### "not honor my silver status"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight through Qantas' site, which apparently involved a codeshare with Jetstar. I have silver status on Qantas, which comes with a higher baggage allowance. I called Qantas to make sure that my status would also carry over to the Jetstar flight, and was informed in no uncertain words that it would. Show up at the Okinawa airport and the Jetstar people will not honor my silver status. They tell me I have to pay $200 to get my bags to Singapore, after which they will be free on the Qantas legs, and that Qantas would reimburse me afterwards. I wasn't very happy about that, but I paid anyway. Once I got home, I contacted Qantas about this and they basically told me to shove off. I incurred a $200 fee because their agent misinformed me, and apparently they could care less. I even asked them to go back and listen to the recording of the call if they had one, and they couldn't be bothered. I live in Australia so I have to fly Qantas a lot, and this level of service just does not sit well with me.

### "never fly with Qantas again"
Not Verified |  I travelled from Brisbane to Singapore on 17 April, and my flight was delayed by 3 hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight. Although another flight was arranged, I am on a very short visit, and now my return to Brisbane is also delayed by 4 hours. This is the second time within 9 days. I can understand one delay, but it has happened again. I will not be able to report to work on time on Monday. This experience has been extremely frustrating, and I will never fly with Qantas again.

### "a wonderful flight experience"
Not Verified |  My husband and I were very impressed with QF73's Easter Sunday flight from Sydney to San Francisco! The in-flight meal exceeded expectations, with standout dishes like the flavorful paneer and vegetable curry, and tender Angus beef with mash . But what made the flight shine was the exceptional service from the crew. Special mention to Barnabas, a Singaporean who brought a warm smile and infectious enthusiasm to our journey. His friendliness set the tone for a wonderful flight experience. Kudos to the entire crew for their outstanding service – a testament to Qantas's commitment to excellence.

### "experience exceeded my expectations"
The overall experience exceeded my expectations especially in the case of the excellent cabin crew who were seasoned professionals and seemed very genuine compared to the forced 'niceness' of some of the other airlines. The Qantas Lounge at LHR is excellent, more akin to a First Class lounge and makes the 'flagship' lounge at the airlines main hub Sydney look like a poor priority pass lounge. The seats are very nice, not the latest with privacy doors and such but very comfortable and private, all with direct aisle access. Food was very good, excellent Australian wines, all the food is plated in the galley although visually it looked a little bland. Excellent cheese course, three varieties with crackers, quince and fruit as well as three dessert options (a trifle, ice cream or fruit platter). One of the best flat white's I have ever had on a plane finished the main meal off. The one slight negative about the service is that the delivery is very convoluted and overall it takes quite a long time but with a 17hr flight time that is not too much of an issue. Bed was comfortable, crew constantly making patrols of the cabin offering drinks and snacks. Some very substantial on demand meal items any time including toasted sandwiches, pies and such. Highly recommended. But please Qantas - it is 2025 where is the wifi?

### "Very disappointing inflight service"
Not Verified | 
Very disappointing inflight service in business class. We were not offered a pre-departure drink, which is standard on Virgin Australia. The meal arrived 35 minutes after take off, do quite a long delay, given the short flying time and only 10 passengers in the cabin. I asked for some cheese and biscuits which is also offered as standard on Virgin Australia, but was bluntly told it’s only offered on some meal services!! There was also a fruit salad on offer, but when I asked if I could have one, the senior flight steward said no!!! Overall a very disappointing experience, given my flight ticket was expensive and one expects a more premium customer service experience on QF. Maybe cabin crew should be trained by Emirates or Singapore Airlines, where cabin crew often refer to you by your name first a more personalised experience.

### "product is currently an insult"
The decline in Qantas quality of the last 10 years has been staggering. My review is based on a return business class trip from Auckland to Paris on a 787 aircraft. The comments on catering apply to every  leg. No one is fooled by a green salad consisiting of a few leaves of lettuce with some olive oil dumped on top. Accompanying bread was stale. Prawns had the texture of old rope. Main courses consisted of rice or quinoa with meat on top. Dessert is basically non existent, unless you count a tub of ice cream or convenience store quality cheese. Presentation is sloppy also, on battered grey trays. And I didn't know undrinkable Australian red wines even existed - but Qantas seems to have sourced them. Seat quality, particularly for a relatively new product, is also poor. The seat isn't comfortable in any configuration but is particularly bad in bed mode - the padding is rock hard to the point where it causes pain quickly if you stay in one position for any period of time. The provided added thin "mattress" (which is just a blanket) provides no extra comfort. The pods are pitched so tightly togther it can be very difficult to exit and enter the seat, particularly in bed mode. The eco-themed amenity kit seemed to be nothing but a zippered bag full of brown paper. The business class product is currently an insult.

### "totally unfair and unacceptable"
We bought the air fare in June 2024 for our New Zealand trip in April 2025. Since we bought the tickets 10 months before our trip, the fare was low and with the lowest booking class of Qantas. This morning, we received an email saying our flight is changed. We called Qantas customer service to check what has happened to our flight. The representative kept deceiving that the flight is cancelled. Actually, Qantas is overselling their tickets and abandon the customer with the lowest fare. The Qantas customer service representative kept misleading us to make the wrong decision to accept the change. After arguing with them, the customer service admitted that our flight has not been cancelled. They are not willing to put us back to the original flight because they are overselling the tickets. They are not only not willing to keep us in the original flight but also not willing to put us to an alternative flight with the similar time. Qantas is discriminating the customers with lower fare in this case. They only keep the customers with higher fare on that flight and abandon the customers with the lower fare. The way they treated customers is totally unfair and unacceptable.

### “Really regret booking with Qantas”
Not Verified | I booked a business class ticket from DC to Cairns for my once in a lifetime Great Barrier Reef Adventure. After paying nearly 10K for my tickets, Qantas informs me my return flight from LAX to DC has been cancelled (it was an Alaska Air partner flight) and I am now expected to spend 15 hours overnight at the LA airport. No hotel was offered. After spending an hour and eight minutes on hold, a customer service rep informed me no other flights were available. I offered to go in economy but still no other flights available (this is March for a mid-July flight by the way). I asked if I could be rerouted through somewhere other than LAX. Again the answer was no. I said ok, well how about if I stay in LA for two days and make a mini vacation out of it- again no. There was no effort at all to be find any creative solution. The Qantas rep cutting me off. Really regret booking with Qantas - may have to cancel the whole trip.

### "more like a budget carrier"
Sydney to Bangkok Economy on a Finnair wet leased by Qantas. A very disappointing experience from the start. Worst part of my holiday. In Sydney I had to use 2 different check-in kiosks to obtain my boarding pass due as the first had a software glitch and shut down together with an embarrassing red light on top. All of the check in kiosks were filthy despite 3 staffers nearby who could have been more helpful and wipe down the screens. The touchscreen function wasn't light touch, rather it required a pretty hard tap which was awful. In Bangkok it was also silly because despite the ticket saying to use the self-check in kiosk, there weren't any. Also Qantas did not give any info to let me know which departure gate to enter the airport (which happened to be near the very end of the terminal) Onboard both flights the carpet was visibly worn and frayed and the seats were stained. The cabin smelt stale the whole time. The toilets were dirty and there was no soap available. Food was more like a budget carrier than a full service. On the flight to Bangkok they even served chicken for 2 meal servings (lunch and dinner) rather than providing options like lamb or fish which was a poor oversight. Seats were terrible. I had no use of the armrest because the over-sized person nextdoor hogged it. Making things worse their leg spilled over more than halfway into my seat. The cabin crew did not intervene to help me. The IFE unit takes up legroom and underseat storage by about 2 inches across. The headphone socket is on the upper right of the seat in front and is easy to tangle up and trip over. It was also worn out and I had to put up with cackly reception or no sound most of the time. Entertainment content was awful. It was overtly repetitive with very limited genre on offer and much of it was repeats of certain actors or 'box set' series so it was like having the same movie multiple times or watching the same person multiple times. This made the length of the already long trip more of an ordeal. Just like their check in kiosks, the IFE swipe function required a pretty hard tap and even then some luck to get it to obey. Despite booking my seats well in advance on the return leg they switched my seat at the last minute and made no apology nor give any good reason or compensation despite being a long-standing customer. The staff onboard were not pleasant. They may have said 'please' and 'thank you' but it was not genuine nor welcoming. Eye contact wasn't natural or soft, it was intimidating. On one leg of the journey they let the passenger next to me handle items rather than handing them to me directly.

### "a great experience"
We flew Qantas on a flight operated by Finnair on their behalf from Sydney to Bangkok. It was a great experience from start to finish, staff smiley and helpful (Finnair), my special GF food great, good entertainment offer and we left on time from Sydney and touched down a few minutes early in Bangkok. It was the distinct mixture of experiences on this flight which have made me post! A collaboration of Scandinavian, Australasian and Asian continents. More like this please. Just great! My husband would have liked just a bit more legroom in economy for a long flight.

### "Do not waste your money"
The food was disgusting. no menu choice (it was Chicken) everything came on the same tray, a slice of bread, Cheese board and the chicken dish it looked horrible. I could not cut the chicken as it was dried up I eventually managed to get a bit to taste, (it was stone cold). I called the cabin crew, she said I will warm it for you, I said you can try but its already dried up, it came back no different. My wife and both sent the trays back and we were offered a granola bar for dinner. We complained to customer services they offered me some Qantas miles or a Qantas voucher neither of these are of any use to me. Do not waste your money on Qantas Business Class flights. PS the seat was broken

### “Qantas has really deteriorated”
Flight on an old 737 (as quoted by flight attendant), Qantas has really deteriorated over the last few years. There is nothing special or premium about the experience anymore, with the cost cutting apparent. Food is vile, plane and seat is old, entertainment is ok (providing you have a device). Only redeeming factor is the inflight service, and even they said they are embarrassed with the airline. I flew American Airlines business class cross country and I have to say, they are much better. They are solidly average across all dimensions.

### "got charged $600 excess baggage"
Qantas gouging. My wife and I just got charged $600 excess baggage for 2 ski bags flying Brisbane to LA. Allowance is 32 kgs. and my combined luggage weight was 24kgs. Qantas website reads. ‘Snow skis and snowboards must be protected in a ski bag. If the snow skiing equipment and your checked bags exceed your checked baggage allowance, airport excess baggage rates apply.’  I assumed this is combined total weight. Talk about gouging, no wonder the Qantas brand is on the nose. Will never fly Qantas again.

### "Cabin crew really good"
Out on QF 064 on Premium Economy back on QF063 Business Class. Premium economy very good and business class great. Cabin crew really good and service superb

### “crews seemed disinterested, disorganised”
I recently flew Perth-Singapore (QF71) and return (QF72) both sectors in Business class and was very disappointed in the flights from start to finish. The crews seemed to be disinterested, disorganised and in the main, unfriendly. Apparently, there is a new drinks/meals system on board where the they take drink orders prior to take-off for your post departure drinks. The drinks are brought to your seat after take-off rather than crew wheeling the trolley down the aisle for you to make your choice. The whole procedure seemed chaotic as orders were mixed up and passengers brought the wrong drinks. The ordering of the meal was equally as disorganised with crew darting around the cabin taking random orders and then frequently having to check which meals had run out. On the return journey, I ordered a glass of champagne for my post departure drink but was advised no Champagne had been ordered and there was none on board. I guess there's a first for everything and I honestly thought they were joking. They offered me a cheap sparkling which I declined and chose a wine instead. The meals have reverted back to being served on a small tray plonked on to the tablecloth provided. Why? Something to do with less movement around the cabin apparently. Honestly, I have praised Qantas business class over the years, but if this latest "streamlined" service is anything to go by, I'll be travelling on another airline.

### "Easy going and happy flying"
Flew Qantas from Cairns to Sydney and then four days later Sydney to Queenstown. They were excellent on both occasions. On time, friendly crew, good food. Easy going and happy flying. Whatever rough patch Qantas went through a couple of years ago wasn’t evident now. I was impressed and will fly with them again. Better than Emirates in my opinion.

### "enjoyed my flight"
Unfortunately the flight was delayed for over an hour. Aside from that I enjoyed my flight. The staff were very friendly and helpful and a tasty meal was served (chicken pie). There was a good selection of soft drinks , wine and beer .

### "staff were friendly and helpful"
Unfortunately the flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours due to weather issues in Melbourne.Luckily I was able to use The QANTAS Club Lounge in Adelaide.I was mildly irritated that the staff at the lounge had some doubts as to my eligibility to use the lounge, even though the document I showed them clearly stated that the lounge invitation was linked to my flight. I had no issue with a similar invitation at the Melbourne Lounge. Apart from that the staff were friendly and helpful.The food was small, but fine for such a short flight. I appreciated that the beveraged included beer and wine.

### "satisfied with the journey"
One way BNE-MEL on QF, outstanding service on the only Legacy carrier in Australia, free checked in baggage and meal onboard, aircraft is showing is age though and no seat back IFE on this flight, Overall satisfied with the journey and looking forward to their upcoming A321's doing the domestic backbone.

### “Virgin do it better”
Bid to upgrade. Mistake. No priority lane in the new temporary security at Melb. The lounge however was really nice with good food options and great view. Would have liked a machine to make my own coffee as the barista was inundated. The flight was on time. No pre departure drink of any kind offered. The food was woeful. No choices at all. Yogurt. Bacon, eggs,tomato mix and mushrooms. The eggs were dried out and sad. It was dreadful. Crew did minimum. Virgin do it better and Qantas used to.

### "Qantas were so much better"
The flights were on time which was the best thing about this trip. The Alliance plane Qantas uses out of Prosperine was ancient and the toilets extremely smelly (due to age and poor cleaning). No entertainment at all. Snack was salsa with a few rice crackers however it was ok. From Brisbane we had entertainment but the meal - dinner can you believe it - was a sausage roll and one Lindt ball. Ugh. No option there. The crew just did the minimum - I miss the old days where Qantas were so much better.

### "my seat didnt recline"
Not Verified |  We booked premium economy on Qantas my seat didnt recline at all the button for the seat was stuck. The charger port didnt work either. Worked off and on. I asked a cabin crew for an orange and she brings me a glass of orange juice. Then she brings me the orange after two hours and says so sorry. Not good enough. I was then given my meal in a plastic dish and she said sorry about this as we have catering issues. So why did we pay for this premium economy. the leg rests was in tatters. Then on the domestic from Sydney to Melbourne someone had spilled coffee on the side of the aircraft and it wasnt cleaned. We were in south america for five weeks and everyone is quick to say Oh third world country, let me tell you they could teach this country a few things. Airports and toilets spotlessly clean. All automated and easy to operate and very helpful Latam staff.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience overall. Food was very low quality, no variety, poorly balanced. People did not receive some of the items. Staff uninterested in their job. Mediocre service. Toilets terrible.

### "Onboard the welcome was warm"
Check in at the counter for this flight to connect with an international flight on a different airline was smooth, with baggage sent to the final destination. The QF business class lounge was comfortable but the food and drink offerings mid-afternoon were very basic. Onboard the welcome was warm and the seat was comfortable although there was no in-seat entertainment. A small but tasty dinner was served, and the flight arrived 30 minutes early. All in all an acceptable experience.

### “No compensation was offered”
On October 11th, I arrived at the airport in Jakarta to catch my Qantas flight to Melbourne that waa scheduled at 9.15pm. The moment when I was in the checked-in counter, the staff told me that my flight was delayed for 6 hours without any prior notification whatsoever. The compensation from Qantas was IDR200,000 (around USD13/14) and I had to wait for my flight from 6pm to 3am, yes 3 A.M. Its not stop there. On October 18th (today, the day I wrote this review), my Qantas flight from Melbourne to Jakarta was previously scheduled at 3.55pm. But they rescheduled it many times (through a various speaker announcement) and now (6.16pm) I’m still in the gate 10 of Terminal 2 waiting for my Qantas flight. No compensation was offered. I respected Qantas regulation that we have to arrived in the airport 3 hours prior. But I wish Qantas can also respect its passengers. For me, I dealt with the same issues 2 times (Jakarta-Melbourne, return).

### "Shameful Attitude"
Shameful Attitude, Shameful purser, 2 hours delay w/o any care for passengers. Traveling from Sydney to Jakarta (arriving at 7 pm), I would have a following flight at 10:45 pm (with Air China) to Beijing, then to Madrid than to Sao Paulo (all connected). I chose Qantas (over Garuda) as Qantas has a good on-time reputation, taking flight QF41 (October 2nd). While taxiing  the pilot discovered a minor engine issue, which caused a 2-hour delay for takeoff, which means I had only 1:45 hour connection time - extremely short. Extremely worried, I discussed my worries with a flight attendant, she assured me that the plane would fly faster, arriving in Jakarta at 8 pm, “…no need to worry, as I would have plenty of time.” Unfounded promise – the flight arrived at Jakarta at 9 pm (2 hours late). 40 minutes before landing I approached the purser told him about my critical situation (3 flights in a row, depending in 10:45 pm Air China) and asked him to help me assigning a Qantas ground staff to help me with migration/customs or to get in touch with Air China for them to help me. The Purser was not impressed from my desperate situation and said they have few people, and he will try to help. When the plane arrived, the purser totally ignored me, nothing was done to help me out or give any solution. Miraculously, due to some very kind immigration officers and especially from excellent service for Air China, I was able to board (in the last moment) the next flight.

### "staff seemed indifferent and inattentive"
Qantas QF93, September 23 (MEL to LAX) Class: Business (upgraded using 110k QF Points x 2 = 220k Points) Seats: 26E and 26F (upgraded from classic economy rewards seat) My recent experience on Qantas flight QF93 from Melbourne to Los Angeles left much to be desired, especially considering it was in Business Class. Unfortunately, the service did not meet the standards I have come to expect from Qantas. Both meal services during the flight were extremely late. The final meal wasn’t served until around 50 minutes before landing in Los Angeles, which was quite frustrating, particularly since passengers in Economy and Premium Economy had already finished their meals almost two hours earlier. For Business Class passengers, this was unacceptable. Despite having my breakfast order taken at the beginning of the flight, the meal I selected wasn’t available when it was time to serve. Worse still, I wasn’t informed about the change, and no apology was offered. I only realized the mistake when I saw my wife, seated next to me, received the meal we had both ordered, while I was given something else. This lack of communication and attention to detail was quite disappointing. The service from the crew on my side of the aisle (seat 26E) was noticeably poor. The staff seemed indifferent and inattentive, making me feel uncomfortable when requesting basic service. Their attitude fell far below what one would expect in Business Class, and it affected the overall enjoyment of the flight. Upon trying to file a formal complaint with Qantas, I was surprised to find that their system does not allow complaints about the cabin crew. I had to categorize my complaint under “aircraft condition,” which felt inappropriate, as the issue was clearly with the staff's professionalism. Final Thoughts: Despite being a loyal Qantas passenger, this flight was a disappointment. The hard product (seating and amenities) was solid, but the inefficiency and unprofessional behavior of the cabin crew, combined with the frustrating experience of dealing with meal service, were hard to overlook. It’s unfortunate that Qantas’ complaint system doesn’t allow for feedback about staff performance directly, which further adds to my frustration. I still rate the experience a 2/5 primarily because the overall product is good, but service like this makes me question if the premium Business Class fare is worth it.

### Qantas Airways customer review
The Qantas experience has fallen off a cliff. The gall of this airline to charge traditional fares of up to $1000 one way for an ancient, repainted ex Jetstar fleet is astounding. Seat pitch and cabin cleanliness is sub what you would experience on a south East Asian low cost carrier. Scratched windows, undressed seatbelts, stained and crumb filled seats. Both legs of our trip were delayed significantly. The group is now nothing but a price gouging national embarrassment. I hope they get everything that’s coming to them.

### "a very good flight"
I enjoyed the flight. It was great to travel on the A220 for the first time. It was very comfortable . Check in was easy and the flight left on time. Service was very friendly. A small snack was served, which was fine for such a short flight. I appreciated being offered wine and beer. Overall a very good flight

### "service has gone substantially downhill"
Not Verified |  Flew Adelaide to Cairns via Sydney in Business Class. Qantas lounge in Adelaide is under renovation and whatever those renovations end up as can only be an improvement. Food was limited to 2 choices of bland rubbish and the coffee was poor. Adelaide to Sydney (737) the service commenced over halfway through the flight and the food was very average. Economy class had all been served before drinks were offered in Business Class. Qantas Lounge in Sydney was ok. Food again was very limited and poor but at least the bar was open. Sydney to Cairns (737) was good with decent food and consistent topping up of drinks from attentive attendants. The flight being half full, if that, no doubt had an impact. Cairns to Adelaide via Brisbane. The morning flight was delayed by an hour which ended up being 2. The lounge in Cairns was marginally better than Adelaide with actual breakfast offerings but overall the Qantas lounge experience is poor to average. Mainly just poor. Cairns to Brisbane was on an Alliance E190 and the plane was filthy. There was rubbish from previous flight(s) in the seat pocket, under the seat and jammed between the seat and the wall. Additionally the floors did not look like they had been vacuumed for a long time and no other surface wiped down. The service was bad, late and poor quality. On descent into Brisbane passengers were advised of any connecting flight due to the significant delay. Our connecting flight was to be on the same aircraft and gate with a 'quick turnaround'. As such we (thought we) had no time to wait in the Qantas lounge and remained at the gate. The boarding time kept being pushed back every 15 minutes with the excuse of 'catering and cleaning' offered. On reboarding to the same seat the plane was in the same condition with the rubbish still in place. The catering was no different with the same garbage being served up and I had to use the call button for the first time in my life to get any response from the FA. Arrived home late I used to rate Qantas but their in flight service has gone substantially downhill, which appears to be a consistent theme in the reviews. Had I flown economy I wouldn't bother leaving a review because you get what you pay for. But these were 4 Business Class flights and overall they were a colossal waste of money. So there is no point flying domestic business. The extra few 1000 $ would go a long way in the airport proper Of note Qantas only requested a review of the Sydney - Cairns flight (the only one likely to elicit positivity). They clearly knew the other 3 would be slated so don't bother requesting a review which would balance out any internal ratings to 'lift your game or I'm going with the competition'. Not there really is any which means Qantas can keep charging premium fares for less than what low cost carriers used to provide Don't recommend them anymore but since you don't have any choice keep your money and/or points and sit at the back

### "disappointed with my recent experience"
I was disappointed with my recent experience. Even though we boarded early, we had to divert to Christchurch for a technical stop due to excess weight. Surprisingly, despite being over the weight limit, we took off and refueled in Christchurch. The explanations we received were often contradictory and unclear. Ultimately, we arrived at our destination four hours late, which significantly impacted my work and health in the following days. When I tried to seek assistance through Qantas's FAQ page, I ended up spending 30 minutes on the phone, only to be directed to fill out an online form. To top it off, I received a compensation of about $50 AUD in Qantas points, which felt inadequate given the situation.

### "cabin crew yelled at me"
Not Verified |  I will not fly with Qantas again, nor will I allow my employes to fly with them for business. An entitled cabin crew yelled at me for putting my rubbish in the rubbish bag on the service cart as she wanted to do it. As a gold FF with Singapore and Emirates, Qantas are an embarrassment to Australia.

### "delays delays delays"
Pathetic, delays delays delays. Could not use lounge passes as Adelaide Qantas lounge was being upgraged so sat around in airport for 5 hours waiting for Qantas to get it together! Not happy. Rang customer service but both could not help but never offered as Qantas say to rate them ... oh by the way there call centre is overseas.

### "no regards to timeliness"
Delayed again. Incompetent airlines with no regards to timeliness or quality. Badged as a full service yet unable to deliver. How often is any flight on time?

### “Qantas doesn't care”
Not Verified | I am the husband, and my wife has flown to Manilla from Rockhampton via Brisbane and Sydney and she is stranded with no baggage what so ever. It has been 5 days now. She booked the flight through flight center with Qantas. We checked with flight centre to see if she needed to collect and process the bag at each transfer and was told no, she only needs to board each flight herself and the bag will arrive at Manilla for collection. Her bag did not arrive and she was told it was left in Brisbane and that it will be on the next flight and it will be delivered to her given address. She has told me that the airlines or whoever handles the baggage put it on Philippine Airlines and it went to Singapore and now it is lost, She has travel insurance with Qantas as well, They are of no help at all and can only say sorry at this point of time. My wife is distressed and I am angry as well for she has gone for a holiday to be with her daughter who has recently undergone a life threatening operation. She has no change of clothes and she had present in her bag which was a brand new high quality bag bought just for this trip. Apparantly now the bag is lost, how I have no idea as it is tagged with my wifes name and home address and her then phone number and her daughters phone number. My wife has a new number while overseas but her daughters number is still active but no one has called. Qantas doesn't care, nor does Qantas insurance. Will never ever use them again.

### “disappointed with the flight attendants”
Not Verified | First time to fly this airline but got really disappointed with the flight attendants and overall service of this airline. When they were serving the meals and drinks I asked the flight attendant to put ice on my orange juice but she said it’s already cold. Well, if it was cold then I wouldn't even bother asking for ice right? Then when they were serving the snacks, they gave me one but didn't give my mother a snack even though we asked for it. My sister's IFE was programmed to Kids mode. She asked for them to help her change the settings but nobody came to assist her. Who would want to fly with an airline with a service like this?

### "huge thumbs up Qantas"
It was my first time flying out of the Gold Coast Airport normally when I visit I use Brisbane but this airport is small but gorgeous the Qantas ground staff were fantastic very friendly and helpful a big shout out to Sebastian super friendly. Boarding was efficient and quick though the plane was a little older but very well kept and didn’t show any age. Cabin staff were second to none and Sydney disembarking went like a breeze huge thumbs up Qantas.

### "aircraft was extremely old"
The aircraft was extremely old, with no entertainment system - seat was ripped and dirty. Hostess seemed like she should have been retired. Flight was 6 hours late. Food was like a terrible microwave dinner

### "regret choosing to fly with this airline"
Not Verified | Disgraceful. Worst of the worse airline among the Oneworld alliance airlines. I truly regret ever choosing to fly with this ridiculous airline, thinking that it is a member of the Oneworld alliance and I am a platinum Emerald member that I will be accorded the same standard as other Oneworld members eg MH, QR, CX, BA, JL. Wrong! Never again. I was refused priority boarding with my family, contrary to my entitlement which I was given by practically all the other Oneworld alliance airlines mentioned. Sickening to the core. You did well QF, we are just one set of customers and one set of customers will do no damage, but let me emphasise, the embarassment is all on you as this incident was noticed by every passengers at gate 23 on 10th August 2024 QF937

### "a great experience"
Not Verified |   Really had a great experience. excellent service from the crew. Update from the captain makes more comfortable and ease on journey. Flight arrived at the destination well in time. Smooth take off and landing.

### "the spirit of ultimate disappointment"
Qantas is hopeless. The spirit of ultimate disappointment. Once again delayed departure - highly incompetent - what other issues might be encountered?

### “Thank you everyone involved”
I would just like to say a very big thank you to the staff who took care of me, arranged a wheelchair so I could disembark the flight, as I felt quite unwell & they sorted me out and took me to baggage claim and got me organised with a cup of coffee. They then made sure that notes were put in the system for my connecting flight, and a wheelchair was made available for me to get down to the departure gate. Unfortunately, I didn't get the staffs names, but they were all amazing. Thank you everyone involved.

### “Flight was enjoyable”
After Covid hit I stopped flying and this is my first flight after 5 years. I thoroughly enjoyed myself flying with Qantas. Flight was enjoyable, not much turbulence, staff was friendly and helpful and loved meals and beverages. Chicken salad was amazing. Beautiful touch with mango ice creams. Flight entertainment also great. Thank you.

### "my seat booked 2 weeks ago"
Horrible QANTAS. I checked in early with my seat booked 2 weeks ago as 43L. The boarding pass received was 43L. At gate, i was moved to 42G, an aisle away from my window seat. The 43L was left empty. The flight QF291 was scheduled to depart at 10.25am. It is now 11.00am.

### "Significant delays"
Significant delays with first announcement made after boarding was meant to commence. Departure time pushed back in 30 min intervals over and over again. Staff not giving clear reason for delays at the time. Had to approach staff to get meal voucher compensation as they didn’t want to apply policy automatically.

### "food quality was abysmal"
Not Verified |   I recently flew with Qantas and was thoroughly disappointed with the in-flight dining experience. The food quality was abysmal, to say the least. The main course, which was supposed to be a chicken dish, was dry, flavorless, and overcooked. It felt like chewing on rubber. The side vegetables were equally uninspiring, with a mushy texture and no seasoning to speak of. The dessert, a bland and uninspired piece of cake, was equally disappointing. It tasted stale and lacked any semblance of freshness. Even the bread roll was hard and dry, making it nearly inedible. To make matters worse, the meal options were extremely limited, and there were no decent alternatives for passengers with dietary restrictions. The overall presentation of the food was unappetizing, and the portions were inadequate for a long-haul flight. I've had better meals on budget airlines, and for the price of a Qantas ticket, I expected much more. This experience has definitely made me reconsider flying with Qantas in the future. They need to seriously improve their in-flight dining if they want to retain their customers.

### "wasted money on a business ticket"
My husband and I went to Auckland with Air New Zealand and business class was as I expected to be. For various reasons we decided to return with Qantas and this was a very big mistake. Business class was no different to that on a short internal flight within Australia. The seats were old, there was no footrest, the headphones had to be pressed against my ears for any sound. To watch any of the movies, you had to have the Qantas App on the mobile phone. I regret having wasted money on a business ticket and I will never again book with Qantas on a long flight. The only positive comment I have is to say that the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful.

### "think about the food needs"
I travelled with my husband and daughter on 10 June from Sydney to Dili, Timor-Leste via Darwin. We have been travelling on Qantas for decades and yet, the only lunch available on this trip (few others as well) has been a ham sandwich! Thousands of people who call Australia home don't eat ham or pork, including a few people in your safety video I'd say. Please, Qantas, think about the food needs of all your travellers and offer some variety. For cultural awareness one can get all answers from google!

### "Another horrific flight"
Another horrific flight endured with Qantas. 6 hour delay on departure from Sydney - 3 different explanations as to why water had apparently saturated seats while parked at the gate. The Captain stated a problem with a door caused water to enter the aircraft and engineers needed to do a very careful test - decompression risks? VH-OQI was the operating ac. Ground staff and engineering estimates initially 30 minute delay, then 60 minute, then 120 minute, then 180 minute, then 'we don"t know'. $15 vouchers handed around at 2, 4 and 5 hour mark - passengers eating junk /snack food for 6 hours instead of a proper dinner. Arrogant ground staff defensive and argumentative to reasonable questions, inviting argument and disrespectful. Once on board - polite, apologetic captain. Food shocking in economy - inedible beef 'burger' a glutinous mess of reconstituted potato mash, frozen carrots and peas and undercooked beef mince drowned in gravy. Literally disgusting and warm at best. Served 3 hours into the 7 hour flight - 11.30pm to midnight Sydney time. Female First Officer buttered the landing in Singapore, smoothest aspect of the whole experience. Singapore to London sector - used a gate with a single security lane to board from 3am for a 4.05am departure. Actual departure 4.57am. Quoting Captain "Obviously we wont be on time, 30 minutes late because of manpower issues here at Singapore and five and a half hours because the plane needed to be fixed". No apology. Sounded completely disinterested in even making an announcement - shouldn't have bothered. His arrogance was the only thing he informed us of. One small bottle of water given for the whole flight to passengers, the refills only in little plastic cups. Snack given an hour out of Singapore, no main meal (breakfast) served until 1 hr and 7 mins out from landing, so a 12 hour stretch with nothing. Luke warm "hot" breakfast was a petri dish of food poisoning risk - scrambled eggs and pork sausage, grey bacon, green potato hash browns. Sent mine back untouched. I paid $3400 for a return economy ticket to be offered inedible food. Captain at least hit the touchdown zone demonstrating one important basic skill - and in fairness, it was firm but not buried. Qantas is a shadow of its former self. Its new CEO is the financial architect of its current service model. After the return trip to Australia, I won't be bothering to assess her performance. This airline has lost my trust completely - four of my last six trips have been unacceptably dismal and its lead by the attitudes on their staff.

### "still waiting for the refund"
Not Verified |   After booking and paid the fare, Qantas cancelled all flights from Sydney to Shanghai which gave us a big headache and had to pay extra $2000 for 4 of our family members! This is so disappointing! Whats worse is we are facing financial stress after paying extra $2000 on top of air fare, Qantas yet not refund us money till now - it has been over 2 weeks we are still waiting for the refund. As loyal customers of Qantas, we will never take Qantas again

### "Simply not acceptable"
Not Verified |   It’s concerning to know that Qantas, when they advise you that the flight is cancelled when you arrive to check in at the counter due to operational issue 9/10 it really means no flight crew. So as a result my family were disadvantaged and I need to be home for work meetings. As a result of organising other flights to get back home due to their inconvenience caused do you think QANTAS offered any reimbursement for costs incurred. Simple answer no. Does Qantas and its brand believe it’s above the law and the greatest brand in the world. Arrogance plays no part in business anymore and consumers have the right to know that it is unacceptable to cancel flights and yet not offer compensation for any inconvenience caused. Arrogant Qantas and your new ceo ought to be ashamed. Simply not acceptable.

### "I will never travel Qantas again"
Not Verified |   I booked leg room sets at the bulk head. When boarding tickets were issued Qantas changes these and we only worked this out on the plane. At this point Qantas ignored me even when I showed them my ticket receipt. This happened on the return flight too, but this time they said we paid normal price an all the seats are full. Upon transfer the baggage scanners in Sydney decided that my wife's bag was over weight at 15kg. We then stood in line at a Qantas counter for 30minutes while one person attended to the massive line of people. I complained to the Qantas lady standing around, she said, That's just how it is'. I will never travel Qantas again.

### “service on the plane was excellent”
Check in was smooth, friendly and easy. Departure was on time. The service on the plane was excellent.They also offered a very tasty meal. The wine offered was excellent.A very pleasant way to finish my first visit to Western Australia.

### "disappointed that they changed planes"
A very enjoyable flight. I had originally booked a flight with the wide bodied A330-200 with lie flat seats and I was disappointed that they changed planes. Nevertheless, the service was excellent, with very tasty food and excellent wine. I also appreciated access to wifi.The plane arrived on time.

### "it was a nightmare"
The Qantas flight from Auckland to Melbourne was delayed by an hour and half. As a result of that, I missed my connecting flights and all of them. I was given no accommodation nor lounge access and was stranded in the airport for 8 hours. I was booked on to a 22 hour total flight journey via Dubai. I requested the staff to at least give me lounge access so that I could shower as I would be on a long flight journey where I would not have enough time to freshen up for 30 hours. Put in all together, it was a nightmare. I hope this changes.

### "a glorified budget airline"
Have travelled with Qantas from Wagga Wagga, Sydney, Manila in both economy and business class 3 times in the past 2 yrs. With each and every flight l have encountered problems ranging from extra leg room seat booked and paid for in advance not provided, inflight entertainment not working, lost baggage. Informed Qantas each time of my disappointment. No reply refund/compensation. Qantas has over the last decade gone from a respected airline, to in my view, a glorified budget airline only interested in the bottom line profit. Pros. Most plane crews Cons. Cramped seating, average food, complaint Response nil.

### "I wouldn't recommended to anyone"
I took Qantas all the way from Jakarta to Melbourne and then to Brisbane to Sydney and back to Jakarta. The reason I took Qantas is because it had direct flights. On one of the routes the handling staff damaged 2 of my Delsey luggage bags therefore I had to file a complaint which I had to do online. Seeing the airline I knew they were not going to do anything but they did reply after a week and asked me to take my luggage for survey. According to the Bag store my damaged bags couldn't get repaired so after of sending emails in and out Qantas agreed to pay a mere compensation of 27 aud for 2 damaged bags. When I mailed them saying it was not fair they said they had closed my case and 0 compensation received. What sort of airline is this? Not to mention their ground staff are very unhelpful plus their self check in machines do not work properly. Furthermore in my flight they didn't have enough snacks so my kids didn't get. It was my first and last time travelling with thus airline. I wouldn't recommended to anyone.

### "A big thanks to Qantas"
Not Verified |   A big thanks to Qantas, after Bonza collapsed. I was stranded, and Qantas gave me a free flight home. Customer service was exceptional at the airport, and on the flight. Can't thank them enough

### “return trip was a disaster”
My first flight with QF41 was great. But my return trip on QF42 was a disaster. The seats was ok. The staff and the food were both terrible. I don’t explore the Inflight entertainment, but I can see Qantas entertainment on the A332 was very limited compared to other aircraft. The staff wasn’t very professional and lack of communication during flight unlike QF41. The food is the biggest problem of this flight - The Beef was not very cooked and it was tough to eat while the plate is very small compared to any other airlines I’ve flew. The lounge is great, but the food is still somewhat limited too. Next time when I travel back to Australia, I would consider Malaysia Airlines or Singapore Airlines instead of Qantas because they are both better than this airline. This is of course my first and last time with Qantas Business Class.

### “Great service”
Great service and very kind crew on our flight. Very decent food with a lot of nice drink options. The crew was just amazing, really caring and trying to help whatever way possible.

### "avoid using Qantas again"
Decidedly average flight. The plane is old and so is the inside of the cabin. Seats are very close together so the leg room is poor. Food was probably the worst that I have had on any flight. Would avoid using Qantas again likely.

### "Never flying you ever again"
Horrible experience flying with Qantas, will never recommend anyone flying with them. We had a long multi port trip booked with Qantas from Queenstown to Jakarta many last minute adjustments including moving us to a low cost carrier Jetstar which ultimately was delayed made us miss a flight and had to be booked a hotel due to their terrible, terrible flight planning. Their digital check in system at Sydney airport doesnt even work from the check in all the way to bag drop, ultimately forcing ppl to raise their hands for assistance which leads to a chaotic queuing system being so disorganized and causing a huge pile of people frustrated just waiting to get their machines running. Their customer service are not capable to handle issues effectively as they were not solution-oriented - only looking to solve whats easiest for her, not for the collective of the passengers, We are never flying Qantas or Jet Star ever again! We initially booked our return flight from Jakarta to Queenstown in Qantas flight and we paid a full price (not a promo fare). The return flight consisted of 3 connecting flights, from Queenstown to Sydney, Sydney to Singapore then Singapore to Jakarta. They rescheduled our connecting flight from Singapore to Jakarta and it became a 16 hour layover in Singapore (and we were supposed to land at 10 PM SGT). So we booked a hotel room by the Singapore airport hoping to get a good night sleep before catching the flight back home. However, on the day of our departure from Queenstown, just as we got to the airport we were told by the staff that the Qantas flight from Queenstown to Sydney has been changed to a Jet Star flight and it got delayed for an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flights. When we landed in Sydney, we ran to our gate but the plane has left. We asked the Qantas staff there asking for clarity and she said “this is a Jetstar problem, not our problem”? In the end we got to the transit desk and sorted out our next flight (next day). Here we are today 26th of April 2024. We checked in for our flight, the kiosk machine had so many issues on it and there were a lot of lines piling up, we ended up have to get one of the Qantas staff to help. Afterwards we had to drop our bag thru the machine (again automated but not working as it was supposed to). Mind you, this was not only our machine, it was all the Qantas bag drop machines at the airport that were not working, so again, the line was piling up. We asked a Qantas staff what had happened and what should we do, as we’ve been waiting in front of a non working machine for a good 30 minutes. She explained a bit of what happened, and ask us to wait again for god knows how long without giving any other solutions. I told her nicely that it was not nice to wait, then she talked back to me “oh its not nice to wait? Then find somewhere else to drop it!” What a service Qantas! Never flying you ever again. Thats how disappointed we are with your company!

### "they treat customers terribly"
Qantas flight QF76 (codeshare Westjet) which left Vancouver for Sydney on 13 April diverted to Honolulu. Allegedly 1 of 3 major electrical systems failed and the plane had to land. We were closer to Fiji at the time but Qantas decided to turn back to Honolulu. We went to Qantas's hotel and the flight was rescheduled for 27 hours later. No problem. We were told by Qantas staff that buses would pick us up at the hotel the next day to take us to the airport at 7:30am. However, no buses showed up. We received no contact from Qantas but a rumour went around that the flight was delayed. We received no texts, or emails about the delay and the Manage Booking page which not work for anyone on our flight. A rumour went around that our flight was leaving later that day. Everyone went to the airport at their own expense. Bags were checked and people went through security. After multiple hours of waiting, the flight was delayed again as Qantas had sent the wrong plane from Sydney to bring passengers back to Sydney. The rested crew were unable to fly that type of plane. Finally, a message was received by email saying that flight was delayed until 9am the following morning. People left the airport at their own cost. We went to the airport the following morning at our cost again. This time the plane did take off. But not all passengers were told by text/email about the new flight. They were asking passengers to agree to stay in Honolulu for extra days at check-in as the plane was smaller than the one that had flown us in from Vancouver. Due to the failure to communicate, there were empty seats. On the flight back, we ran out of catered food. I fly frequently and have never seen this happen. The stewarts had not even reached half way down the plane when they ran out of one choice... People who ordered special meals did not get same as this information was not transferred from our original Vancouver - Sydney flight to this new flight. At the time, Qantas was saying that it would reimburse us for taxi's to the airport, food, nights accomodation missed in Sydney. Qantas is now refusing to pay. It will not even reimburse me for my seats which I paid for but did not get. I, like most, have travel insurance. However, there is an excess. I have been diddled too many times by Qantas. At the beginning of the pandemic, I agreed to leave my credit with Qantas as I thought it would help with cashflow and help maintain the Qantas. In response I was offered an extra 25% credit on top of the credit I would get for my cancelled flight. I went to rebook afterwards when Qantas resumed international flights. I found that the price of flights for people using credit was higher than for people booking and paying with a credit card. I booked several domestic flights in early 2022 which were cancelled and got to no refund/credit. I used to love flying Qantas. The food is good, when there is sufficient available, and the frontline staff are nice. However, the inflight entertainment is not great compared to other airlines these days and they treat customers terribly. Qantas is a mess and I will not fly them again.

### "flight was delayed by 4 hours"
Worst flight I have ever experienced. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and they didn’t even give us an explanation for the reason for the delay. We had a connecting flight from our destination and of course we missed it and to pay a hefty amount for a new booking. We would advise to avoid Qantas or be prepared for delays and losing time & ‘money.

### "very disappointing experience"
Yet another very disappointing experience with Qantas. The ageing aircraft, the ageing cabin crew, the disgusting offering for inflight refreshments. This airline represents the worst value for money in the Australian skies. The pizza had so much grease just opening the box, I honestly would not have fed it to a dog. The flight attendants, all deplaned and vanished before the passengers had left the aircraft, despite being 30 minutues early (southerly tailwind and landing at 2200 so that's not to Qantas credit). My flight in the morning on Jetstar was a better experience. What a shambles Qantas has become. They won't see their A350s in service for long, they'll be out of business.

### “a very good flight”
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy, as was boarding the aircraft. Departure was on time. Staff were friendly and helpful. It was nice that soft drinks, wine and beer were available. The food was quite tasty, but could have been more substantial. Overall a very good flight.

### "I had been downgraded to economy"
My wife and I booked business class on a Qantas flight from Sydney with allocated seats of 3D & 3 F. Thirty minutes before departure I was informed by a rude ground staff member that I had been downgraded to economy and separated from my wife. No apology or offer of refund/compensation was made. My wife subsequently found out that my seat had been given to a junior staff member. I find this an extraordinary way of treating loyal customers (I have been a Qantas Frequent Flyer for more than 30 years ) and clearly is the reason that the Qantas Brand has gone from first in Australia to 41st in the last 5 years.

### "disappointment, annoyance, furiously angry"
Not Verified |   I will attempt to express my dissatisfaction, disappointment, annoyance, furiously angry, especially being p…d off at Qantas policy on a medical emergency response. My husband had an altercation with a Mercedes SUV on his bicycle and lost. He now has a severe spinal cord injury and we can’t take our original return flight of April 13th. We want/are deferring our return by a month (mid-May). I contacted FlightHub, on-line, who we booked through. They were very helpful, but came back with a message from Qantas. We do not make fare changes for medical emergencies”. I have medical certificates/documents to back up our claim. The return portion of our air fare is approximately $2250 for both of us. Qantas’ “offer” for compensation is $15 each. Apart from being ridiculous, it’s an insult. We have to start from scratch and book a one way fare each to our long distance destination to the tune of approximately $1700 each. We spend 6 months in Adelaide (October to April) and 6 months in Toronto, Canada (April to October). We have been doing this routine for the past three years, and plan to keep this up for a few more years. We will never fly Qantas again. I am so angry that we are not cancelling our April 13th flight, we are going to be “no shows”. I am not going to give them the opportunity to re-sell my seats. Is this the ‘sprit of Australia’s customer service? There’s no comfort in “We sincerely apologise”!

### "Happy to fly with Qantas again"
Not Verified |   I'm giving a good review about one of their cabin crew on flight QF517 from Brisbane to Sydney. We were greeted by our purser Kimberly. While we waited for passengers to make their way through the cabin we found out that it was Kimberly's day off and she was working to help out with the back log of flights caused by flooding and flight cancellation from the day before. she was bubbly and happy. After we were seated we continued to observe that she was very helpful and knowledgeable to passengers and staff alike. Happy to fly with Qantas again and again after this experience.

### "gentlemen who were extremely helpful"
My children had missed their flight with another airline, that was very dismissive and zero help. So I was a very stressed out mum trying to navigate buying another ticket with any airline that could take them. Qantas was the only helpful airline that answered my stupid questions, calmed me down and walked me through what to do. There were two gentlemen who were extremely helpful, I unfortunately can only remember one of their names, Chris, but thank you so very much. You don't understand how much you helped.

### "Poor service and insensitive staff"
On 2 April 2024, I (together with my spouse and parents) flew Adelaide to Melbourne and thereafter Melbourne to Singapore. All legs were Qantas Airlines. In Adelaide, I was issued the boarding pass for both legs and the seats were assigned. The staff that attended to us in Adelaide was very friendly and accommodating. In Melbourne, it was a real chaos. At the boarding gate, the staff arrived late and was not able to provide clear instructions to passengers on how they were boarding. The passengers were expected to go down an escalator before going through the boarding gate and due to poor instruction and management, there was safety risks (especially for old people) of being pushed over by anxious passengers. When I arrived at the Business Class queue, the lady at the counter (without looking at my tickets), pointed us to the economy class queue. Well, it did not end there. When asked for clarification, she said that she assumed we were economy class. Thereafter, I was not able to scan my boarding pass which was issued in Adelaide because I was assigned another seat without my permission. The excuse being, the electronic device was not working. I was separated from my spouse. Qantas entertainment can be access through tablet (if the flight device was not working) which I had. Regardless, my seat was taken away (without permission) and given to another passenger which I later found out was the partner of the said flight pilot. To make matters worst, when I left my seat to use the lavatory, the flight attendant poured water into my glass of unfinished wine and there was not an ounce of apology. He made funny and insensitive comments about it. I paid for 4 business class tickets and yet was treated very poorly. Poor service and insensitive staff. Qantas has no class.

### "genuine improvement in service"
Over the last 18 months I have flown Qantas several time, largely from Sydney to Melbourne and return or Sydney to Brisbane and return. During that time I have experienced a genuine improvement in service, punctuality and professionalism of the crew. My most recent flight Sydney - Melbourne - Sydney was as good as it could ever be. The flights were punctual, the crew were very welcoming and the aircraft was impeccably clean and operational. Crew actively helped passengers to be comfortable by hanging up jackets, helping to arrange luggage and checking to see if more help was required. From Melbourne to Sydney on 18th March I sat in an aisle seat and stood up to let the window passenger access to the aisle for the bathroom. Instantly the steward appeared and offered to hold my glass of water so it did not spill during this process. To do this shows he was proactively looking for ways to assist passengers. That is outstanding service. Food in Business class was excellent and presented with pride and good grace. Food in Economy was also quite good and again served very professionally. The point I really want to make is that over the last two years service has improved to the point of being quite exceptional and the journeys have been pleasant as a result. Just in case you think that might apply only to Business, I can assure you that I have experienced the same warm welcomes and professional approach in Economy. The crew appear genuinely pleased to welcome passengers on board. Well done Qantas - you are back in business!

### “Food was below average”
The worst cabin crew I have ever had the experience to travel with. Rude, sullen, mean to a fellow passenger behind her back. The seats are tight and lack legroom. Inflight entertainment is sub standard. Maybe they should get some basic ideas from Emirates. Food was below average, served with indifference. All in all a very cattle class airline. I will never travel with them again.

### "let down by its representatives"
As the only airline flying direct DFW to SYD, I paid a premium fare well in excess of $8000 for Business Class. Lounge arrangements in DFW prior to flight good and embarkation and initial welcome with a glass of champagne worked efficiently. That was the last process that did. Fair to say the business class configuration in this aircraft is the best I have experienced - excellent storage, easy controls and good touch screen entertainment options. Shortly after takeoff I was asked for my dinner and breakfast orders, duly provided. Not sure why I was asked to select from the three dinner choices on the menu - only one of the choices was available and it was the one that I would least desire. I was not asked whether I wanted a refreshment of any sort at that time and, by observation, nor were any of my neighbours. Almost two hours elapsed before any member of the flight crew came near me. Then it was to deliver my dinner. I asked to see the wine-list because the wines had not been included on the dinner menu, as is the practice with all other major airlines recently flown. The response was that they don't have a wine list - they just serve what is loaded on board. I was advised that I could have red or white - no attempt to explain the characteristics of different available wines - clearly didn't have a clue. I chose to have a Shiraz - the bottle was produced but was from a producer I have never heard of. Hardly a good advertisement for Australian wines on the national carrier. The only available meal was a fillet cooked to order. Medium rare it was not - well done a better description. During the meal there was no crew attention to top up wine or water. Next flight crew contact was when tray was removed. No question of offering an aperitif or coffee. From takeoff to dinner clearance the flight crew appeared more interested in chatting to each other near the galley than serving their customers. After dinner, no attempt by flight crew in my section of business class to assist passengers with getting their bedding set up for the overnight flight. Definitely a self help situation. About an hour before landing I realised that I had not been provided with a landing card. I approached one of the flight crew who stated, somewhat arrogantly as though it ws my fault, "you should have been given one". All in all, this flight was another affirmation that airline customer experiences are largely in the hands of the flight crew. Once again, Qantas was let down by its representatives and, to some degree by the quality of the food and wine presented. My rating is based on the facts as laid out in this review and the fact that, if you pay over $500 per hour for an experience, it should be worth it.

### "flight took off on time"
Brisbane to Townsville. Was given boarding passes for this flight in Venice first flight of journey. Checked in luggage at Qantas. Brisbane connections given new boarding passes very polite check in staff member. This was midday flight took off on time snack a sandwich and drinks. My booking was Gluten free so I had to say and cabin crew went to back and brought me a packet of crisps and apple and small coconut chocolate bar. This is only short flight but this is were Qantas and Emirates gluten free meals / snacks differ. Use to be offered gluten free toasted sandwich not any more . Arrived on time. Had aisle seat near back with empty seat next to me. Feel compared with Emirates meals no comparison. Luggage arrived all the way from Venice.

### "tasty food and snacks"
Qantas has changed since my last flight last year. Great service by sensational cabin crew, tasty food and snacks and a great selection of entertainment. Seat was lacking cushioning and a little bit hard and stiff.

### "Disgusting horrible airline"
No Entertainment system at all on for 13 hour flight home. Was issued dismal $100 flight pass for passenger for inconvenience (there was 6 of us 2 adults 4 kids) but you can only use 1 flight pass per future booking, meaning we need 6 flights to use up each credit. Disgusting horrible airline, horrible management, shame on them.

### "Will never use them again"
Not Verified |  Would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. In the past I’ve dealt with multiple cancellations with Qantas, the final straw was Qantas cancelling my international flight less than a few hours before I was meant to fly. Their fix, a flight leaving earlier time with a stop. Had to rush to airport. Paid extra to have a direct flight. Will never use them again. Useless customer service. Offered no help or compensation.

### "experience was let down by the food"
First time with Qantas. Very cheerful and friendly cabin crew. Seat was comfortable. The entertainment and wi-fi worked very well. The whole experience was let down by the food which I think inadequate in term of quantity and quality. The boarding process was efficient.

### "deserves a budget and low rating"
The management of Airline and reputation is horrendous. Qantas has the reputation of constant delays and cancellations to the point that it is of no surprise anymore. Airline cleanliness is not up to standards and aircrew are not as friendly as other airlines. For this current flight, it was plagued with delays, firstly with boarding, even though the aircrew boarded the aircraft before the first boarding call. Subsequently, we only managed to board past the flight time and were then told to wait another 20 minutes due to paperworks issue. This is a full paying flight and not a budget flight, but we were told after they sorted out the paperworks that unfortunately the flight could not have in-flight entertainment. The flight is double the budget airline in price but ended up with no in-flight entertainment. This deserves a budget and low rating.

### "a really disappointing airline"
I was flying to Australia for the first time and I had a choice between China Eastern and Qantas. The experience was so bad. It felt so budget and grimey. 1. They emailed early on the day of the flight to say the entertainment system was broken and to prepare. This is crazy for a long haul flight and the plane came from Sydney so how could they not have addressed this issue before flying to China. So nothing worked. No movies, no map, no safety video. Also, on board they said people should download on Netflix knowing full well that Chinese people have no access to Netflix. So basically they ignored the problems Chinese people might face. The seats were one of the smallest I’ve ever sat on. It was so tight and the whole cabin felt cluttered and poorly laid out. In addition, the material of the pillow meant everything was sticking to it so it looked really gross and dirty. The toilets were also super gross and the whole experience felt unhygienic. The meal was appealing I can barely put it into words. Usually I take a photo of my plane food as generally I like it. There was just one container of meat or veg or whatever you ordered and a piece of bread. No nice tray or cups or no presentation at all. The breakfast was the same. Really below expectations for a long haul flight. The plane left shanghai over 2 hours late. Nothing was offered for these 2 hours. The cabin crew were nice but quite inattentive. While waiting to go to the restroom, a Chinese lady asked for hot water. There were a lot of cabin crew and not one person helped her even though it was obvious was she needed and she asked. After about five minutes someone helped her. They seem to prioritize white people so if you fall into this category you’re lucky. I complained about my experience as it was so terrible and the flight wasn’t cheap. They offered my $100 travel credit which can be used on a future flight. I’m not from Australia and I have no plans to return in the near future so this isn’t really helpful. To conclude, Qantas is a really disappointing airline with a terrible service, dirty and compact cabins, poor food quality  I would never fly with them again. Fortunately after landing I had a good experience in Australia. It’s a shame that this airline is the first thing a lot of people will encounter when coming to Australia. If possible fly with any other available airline.

### “Fantastic service”
Fantastic service on this domestic service continuing on from the AKL-SYD sector that was also excellent. This was my first time flying QF on a domestic sector due to us flying our PUG from Auckland as we have immigrated to Perth. The crew were second to none, very relaxed, genuine and fun, super helpful. The interior of the A330 was very crisp and the seats were comfortable. I was surprised what a substantial meal we were served, I went for a plant based ravioli which was really really delicious. After the great service we received, both me and my PUG, I'm proud to call Qantas my new national airline.

### "disappointing to say the least"
As a member of the One World Alliance elites, I expected a certain level of service and professionalism from Qantas, but sadly, it fell short of my expectations. The overall effort put forth by the airline appeared to be lackluster, as if they were just doing enough to avoid being classified as subpar. The lack of enthusiasm and genuine care was evident from the moment I stepped into the airport at SYD. From the airport crew to the in-flight staff, it seemed that the airline was putting in the least minimal effort, giving off an impression that they simply did not care about providing a quality service. One major disappointment was the absence of smiles from anyone within the Qantas staff. Instead of focusing on their duties, flight attendant were often found chit-chatting and gossiping among themselves while serving food and drinks. This not only reflected a lack of commitment to their responsibilities but also created a negative atmosphere for passengers. What struck me as particularly concerning was a flight attendant making low-class comments and mocking a sleeping passenger. In conclusion, my experience with Qantas was disappointing, to say the least. The lack of genuine effort, professionalism, and respect for passengers left me questioning the commitment of the airline to deliver a quality travel experience. I expected more from Qantas, and it is disheartening to see them fall short of delivering a service that matches the standards of the alliance.

### “What poor service”
It has been my worst flight experience. Firstly Qantas has a poor website and web checkin process. I tried selecting my seats and was unable to do so. Me and my wife had to sit separately on the same flight. Secondly the flight got delayed by over 5 hours. The first delay was of 1 hour that they conveyed by email. The second delay was of another 1 hour that again was sent by an email. Later on the plane arrived late by another 1 hour at the airport and then due to some error they delayed the flight for another 2 and a half hours. What poor service by QANTAS. This is shameful.

### “Onboard catering was very nice”
I had an important family event in Brisbane to attend. Qantas had the best price for the day and time I needed to fly. It has been quite sometime since I have flown QF. Kiosk check was easy and the security formalities were completed in no time. Flight departed slightly late due to a technical issue. The flight time was fairly quick so we landed in Brisbane early. Onboard catering was very nice and a lovely crew who looked after us in the air. Bags were late arriving due to a thunderstorm and lightning meant the ground crew had to leave the tarmac. I still made my family event with plenty of time to spare. Qantas prices can sometimes be extremely high. So I guess I was lucky to find a bargain at relatively short notice. I hope that with a new CEO Qantas can get back to being the reliable and wonderful airline that it once was.

### "incredibly rude and dismissive"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Paid 200 for a ticket which gave me 2 checked bags which the website said gave me 30 kilos each. Come to check in and they say it’s 30 kilos total and wouldn’t let anybody have a carry on unless it is tiny. Got charged 350 dollars just to get my stuff through and doubled the price of my ticket. And the staff were incredibly rude and dismissive.

### "Their service has been the worst"
I booked and paid for a flight not to receive it. After arguing for over 2 hours that they have my money they finally located the payment. However, they would not use my money which they had in their account to rebook the flights they wanted me to pay again. On having the agent confirm twice that my funds which they had in their account would be refunded in 7 days, I paid again. That was 2 months ago and I still have not received my money. If they had been honest and told me it would take longer to refund then I would not have rebooked the flights as I needed the the money over Christmas. Their service has been the worst I have encountered in my lifetime. They won't take any accountability for their system failure or lack of adequate service to their customers to rectify their errors. I'll walk before I ever step foot on another Qantas flight. Their practices are deplorable.

### "reluctant to travel with them again"
Due to our recent experience flying with Qantas, we would be very reluctant to travel with them again! As we booked through an agent our seat numbers on all flights to and from Perth were allocated and out of 4 flights were only sitting together on 2. Nearly all of our flights were delayed usually only a short time but we arrived in Melbourne with no sleep at 5am, due to fly to Wellington at 8am. Unfortunately this flight was delayed twice and we didn't leave until well after 11am, arriving in Wellington about 4.30pm. Admittedly we were advised of these lengthy delays by email but no explanation was given at all. When we finally boarded in Melbourne, there were no pillows or blankets provided at all and it was absolutely freezing. Our flights to Perth were also rather stressful as being elderly, we looked for assistance in Sydney but after being refused 3 times by busy staff, we gave up and joined a very disgruntled queue hoping like hell that we would have time to catch our connecting flight which we basically had to run to catch! Not a pleasant start to our holiday visiting the grandchildren. Definitely a direct flight with Air NZ next time for sure!

### "Absolutely disgusting service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely disgusting service. Paid all that money to have the worse experience. No food options for those who have dietary requirements, I was not offered any drinks or water through out the flight. Asked for assistance in regards to the iPads and was told that the crew was busy and couldn’t do anything about it. Crew was very rude and didn’t provide any assistance throughout the flight. Honestly so disgusting to see the way people were treated.

### "staff at Hobart was rude and unfriendly"
My JetStar flight got cancelled and we got rescheduled to take Qantas. The staff serving us on 10 Dec at Hobart was rude and unfriendly to cut off my question when I wanted to ask something. Minimal eye contact was given to us when she served us. I asked my question early as I did not want her to relook into the seats if she was already on the screen. Thus I asked early only to be cut off by her saying not now. As she was dealing with my seats, I requested for front rows if it’s possible. She gave us the worst seats (behind the toilet door) and we were the first in queue of the economy class to checked in. On the system, we did see other available seats. Not only did she just gave us a lousy seats, she did not even inform us and was just rushing to serve us and end the service. Especially when the staff knew we were from a rescheduled flight from Jetstar, their faces expression changed to a smiley polite face to an annoyed and look down face as though we were not worthy to be served. I’m disappointed as I saw her handling other customers with a much more warm look than us. This lady was in a hurry to serve us and because I requested to sit tgt, I think she got annoyed and gave us bad seats for a long haul 8h20min flight. In addition, My friend’s luggage was 26kg and she requested for the staff to paste a fragile sticker on her luggage. However, she did not do so and commented that “your luggage is so heavy that they won’t be able to throw it around”. Thus she went on to place the heavy tag and no fragile sticker. My ratings is for the treatment the front counter Qantas towards us, As well as the feedback team. I wrote 2 official feedback but no reply from them. To note, In flight service was great.

### "Totally not worth it now"
Not Verified | Flying from Melbourne to Jakarta scheduled time was 15:35. A day before the flight they told us via sms and app that it was going to be delayed to 17:00. OK. Arrived in airport gate and they delayed the flight again to 1830 because or "engineering requirement". Gave us $15 voucher. Not ideal but still OK. Not long after got a text from the Qantas app that flight is further delayed to 20:20. This time no comms from the ground staff whatsoever. I'm sitting in the gate right now and regretting my decision of choosing Qantas over another airline that also flies direct to Jakarta because it was $100 cheaper. Totally not worth it now. It used to be such a great airline. Now I'm just wasting my time writing this review while waiting for the delayed flight. If the flight had "engineering requirement" issues should've sorted them out before the busy Christmas seasons, which I'm sure Qantas had expected.

### “The crew did a great job”
Not Verified | Check in was a bit of a joke as the system would not allow me to fully web check in. We spent nearly 1 hour in the queue as there were only 3 staff on the desks and 1 was tied up for most of the hour dealing with some passengers who had not done something correctly and were expecting the check-in agent to sort it out for them. Boarding was a bit of a shambles with additional checks of the passport and boarding passes being done by private security people for god knows why and the Qantas staff member in charge of this not giving clear directions to us leaving us almost as confused as she was. This led to a 90 minute delay which we expected. The pilots managed to make up 1/2 hour on the way, but it was nice approaching Los Angeles in daylight. On Board: The crew did a great job looking after us and regularly patrolled the aircraft offering snacks and water. They were friendly down to earth people form a variety of national backgrounds. Food wasn't in huge portions but adequate and I enjoyed it. We booked seats 82 and 83 A and B so we had window seats. I can't confirm it, but I believe that Qantas blocked off the C seats for us, which was great of them to do if they did that as it made our trip even more comfortable. There was no wifi on the aircraft due to it flying over the Pacific Ocean and being out of any sort of coverage, but there was plenty on offer on the entertainment system. For economy, the seats were comfortable enough for the 14 hour trip with plenty of legroom, however, the arm rests don't go up fully. The seats can also be reclined with out intruding in the passenger behind you's space. I felt a bit sorry for the people who would be cleaning the aircraft after we left, as there was a family of grubs in front of us who allowed their child to spill food and rubbish all over the carpet in their seats as well as the aisle. Some of it even managed to float down our way. My advice to passengers is that they treat crew with respect and they will get it back, take your rubbish to the bins yourself - the crew aren't your personal servants and if you have children who can't entertain themselves, then teach them how to use headphones so the rest of the passengers don't have to hear their entertainment.

### "Qantas has gone bad to worst"
Not Verified |  Qantas has gone bad to worst. I booked business class tickets from Brisbane to Cambodia. Qantas has a flight sharing with Jetstar (their own subsidiary). Jetstar has put me and my wife in different rows. When I called Qantas the staff said call Jetstar Asia when I called Jetstar Asia they say you booked through Qantas so call Qantas . Never again I will fly Qantas. The management does not have a clue of ground realities their customers face. This is how Qantas treats Business Class customers.

### "I’ve done my last Qantas flight"
I am a gold lifetime member of Qantas. Member since 1997. Been a platinum member. Went to Business Class Lounge, as usual, only to be told by a rude Qantas staff member wearing a silly Santa’s hat that my 2 daughters could not accompany us into the lounge. For decades gold class members came bring their families in. Suddenly now a change. Said it was policy. Unless it has changed recently & communicated deep in small print, this has never been their policy & not a wise way to reward loyalty. Said it was because girls were over 17. We have flown countless times with them being over 17 & the family has been into the lounge. It was 5:30am. Lounge was deserted. No empathy. Just blockages. I’ve done my last Qantas flight.

### "prefer to go with another airline"
Not Verified |  Slipping standard is unmissable for Qantas flights. To pay such premiums for traveling on outdated and shabby aircrafts are not good. Ground service is not existent nowadays. Cabin crew service and food were fantastic though. However, I'd prefer to go with another airline if I had to pay such premium.

### “Air NZ Premium Economy significantly better”
Not Verified |  At best the flight leaving MEL at 23.45 is a dreadful time for a three and a half hour flight getting into AKL at 5.25am (2 hour time difference) Check-in was easy, with no delays through security. The QF Business lounge however was dull, had no windows and a very poor food offering, especially given at that time there was little desire to eat on board. A renovation is however due in 2024. Boarding was delayed and we got away somewhat late due to delays in baggage loading, even though the 23.55 Jetstar flight to AKL at the gate next door pulled back early. The seat 1A would have been great for a day time flight, but despite a good pillow and duvet/blanket (not quite sure what it was) sleep did not come easily. Meal options were either a choice of soup or a ham and cheese roll (at least that's what I think they announced). There were no menus, but passed on both options. Nothing like as extensive as the very good economy meal on way over. Crew were pleasant enough, but no offer of a coffee or juice prior to landing nor any hot or cold towels. No recognition either of lifetime gold status. Sad to say the offering in Air NZ Premium Economy significantly better.

### "Seats old with padding falling apart"
Qantas flying 18 year old aircraft, no surprise that flight delayed 4 hours due to mechanical issues. Aircraft on Qantas now below Jetstar and Bonza. Seats old with padding falling apart, recline springs gone so frequently fall back. Naturally no WiFi or screens. This route is always very full?! Seats in business lounge equally old and filthy.

### “Absolute disgrace of an airline”
Absolute disgrace of an airline. Never on time. My third flight on the same route SYD-BKK return in November/December period. Once I was smarter to take a return flight with Thai Airways. Out of 4 flights, only Thai was on time. The cabin crew is generally a bunch of people constantly irritated the with every request you make as this distracts them from their social chat in the galley. Current QANTAS delay was caused in the very last minute, they issued "lunch vouchers" for the value of THB350. This is only good for a burger at burger king. Many restaurants are smirking at these vouchers, so effectively you're stuck with the burger king or maccas. Alan, get us back our NATIONAL formerly glorious airline!

### "a source of shame for us Aussies"
A fallen giant. Qantas has become a source of shame for us Aussies. The once mighty flying Kangaroo is now associated with delays and exceptionally poor service once reserved for budget airlines and my experience has sadly been the same. I have flown Qantas many times recently for business and it’s a real shame how bad things have become. Almost guaranteed flight delays (usually lengthy and with limited explanation), poorly trained staff that are a shadow of what we were used to, very dirty planes (bring your wet wipes) and in-flight meals that one would expect at a backpackers lodge are all part of virtually every flight I’ve recently taken with them and it seems like it’s only getting worse. Oh and the prices have become extortionately high and continue to go up. It’s almost criminal it’s so bad. Flying Qantas has become a punishment. Be warned.

### "Has Qantas become a budget airline?"
Has Qantas become a budget airline? Our evening meals were a choice between spicy beef noodles, chicken salad and a vegetarian lentil shepherd pie. The spicy beef noodles looked like sludge and was not the best. All meals were served in a box, with a small piece of warm focaccia on a napkin. And that was it. Much later on, a Splice ice cream was handed out as dessert. Much more later on, the tea and coffee was served. You could help yourself to water at the water dispenser with very tiny cups. Best to bring your own water bottle to fill up. It was soon lights out. Whilst the lights were out, water and a small packet of soy crisps came by. Most people were asleep and literally in the dark so this service went unnoticed. Instead of back seat screens, tablets were supplied but there was insufficient quantity for all passengers. If you were not using it for any period of time, the flight attendant asked for it back. When we were preparing to land, request for the tablets to be removed from the back of the seats. One flight attendant roughly pulled mine out of its position and thrust it into the back pocket. Surprisingly she did not do it to 2 other persons sitting close by. If I had chosen a budget airline, my expectations would have been budget meals and service. Qantas prides itself as the Spirit of Australia. The service and meals certainly did not reflect it.

### "laptop charging is disabled permanently"
Flew Sydney to Seoul (QF87) and return (QF88). Service is decent but the in seat power for laptop charging is disabled permanently for both flights despite what the Qantas website says for the plane. I'm ok with them not providing power but please update your website to say that.

### "The big let down was the food"
The flight left on time. The staff were friendly and helpful. Check in was very easy. The seat was quite comfortable as well. The big let down was the food. A very small snack. Not really good enough for a flight over 3 hours. Oddly enough a QANTASLINK flight offered better food for a shorter flight.

### "no responsibility and no compensation"
Lots of delays plus luggage did not arrive not mine and many other passengers. And of course there is no responsibility and no compensation it is "beyond their control

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Singapore to Auckland with a layover in Melbourne. Thereafter, Auckland back to Singapore with a layover in Sydney. Four flights with none departing on time. Singapore to Melbourne had a four hour delay which caused my flight to Auckland to shift to the next available flight that's a whopping 9 Hours 30 Minutes difference in planned departure. Qantas gave me a mere 30$ card for the inconvenience faced. Bloody insulting. The flight to Auckland also did not depart as planned time. Flight back to Singapore was nothing short of awful. Did not depart on time as well and the Aircraft departing to Singapore (QF 1) had electrical issues which caused the delay. The staff on all the flights were also moody and not what you expect from something as reputable as Qantas. The touch screen entertainment was extremely laggy too. I would recommend against Qantas and for other airlines such as Air NZ or Singapore Airlines. Absolutely terrible experience at this price point (1.8K SGD).

### "staff were cordial and efficient"
Had a very decent experience today on this full trans-Tasman service. Although the flight departed at 9am lunch was served. There were choices but by row 2 my preference was gone. Attendant grabbed something from economy to add to my tray. All the staff were cordial and efficient doing their best to please. Flight was on time, offered spectacular snow capped Mountain View’s upon descent and luggage was delivered quite quickly. Good show Qantas.

### "I've said I wouldn't fly Qantas"
We flew Qantas SYD-BKK the transferred to Finnair BKK-CPH via HEL. the Finnair flight was the worst we've ever experienced after 50 years of flying. Finnair CPH-SIN via HEL was only marginally better with a Singaporean crew. So we were horrified to discover that QF82, SIN-SYD, has been changed to QF292 on a Finnair plane manned by a Finnair crew. For those people who complain about Qantas I can only say try Finnair to see how good Qantas is. I've said I wouldn't fly Qantas. I would but never on this leg.

### “least leg room on any plane”
Not Verified | If you are over 6'2 do not book economy. The least leg room on any plane I have ever encountered. I would have asked to get off but the plane was full and it would have inconvenienced too many people.

### "nice food and great service"
Not Verified |  Qantas may not be everyone's favourite at present and certainly still have a ways to go to lift their overall product and service to their main Australian public customers. But fortunately for us, the flying Kangaroo delivered a 7.5 to 8 experience on our short hop over to NZ from Sydney. QF3 is a one stop at Auckland on route to NYC and luckily we only had the short 3 hour first leg and not the extended 16 hour marathon. The flight was slightly delayed out of Sydney about 30-40 mins from memory - incoming flight delayed and this aircraft had to be towed over from hanger. Newer Boeing 787. Baggage drop off at Kingsford Smith was a do it yourself affair as is pretty common now and quite flawless and with printed boarding pass in hand it was a smooth passage though boarder control and security for a quick bite and beverage before heading up to the gate. Qantas gate attendants were great and we did get some announcements to keep us informed of progress on the delay. Staff were observant and without any prompting at boarding allowed our group to board early as one of us has some mobility difficulties. This worked out fantastic as we were seated towards the rear of the plane and greatly assisted minimise extended standing to get aboard. A very big thank you to the attentive staff and their passenger care. The plane was a newer aircraft and seating etc good, pleasantly surprised to find no entertainment box on the floor under the seats to obstruct leg/foot room as is the case with some 787's. Not the biggest screen, nor the best legroom or width but on par with this product and seating class. There was an issue with the head phone jack connection to the armrest that was faulty and interfered with watching movies etc. Was reported to cabin staff. Was tolerable for 3 hours but would be a real pain if having to jingle the connector for 16hrs. Plane was pretty full. The entertainment is usual Qantas fair and would rate it as pretty good and better than most (excepting Emirates and Qatar). Very happy with product. On board service and cabin crew were great - no complaint or issue - pleasant, friendly and did their jobs well. Food - was surprisingly good and tasty - excellent for the short 3 hr hop and 8 out of 10. Have had some very poor offerings from Qantas on other trips but great on this one. We got to NZ a little behind time but luckily for us no biggy. Qantas delivered with meeting their primary obligations in my view; Got us up safely, flew us over safely and got us down safely without issue or incident - just what i'd expect and paid for. The delay is fine and happy to sit in an airport or fly next day if there are any safety issues rather than have a drama in the air. The nice food and great service were nice bonuses to have and appreciated. To my experience - generally Qantas have delivered a 7.5 to 8 level of service. Very happy on this occasion and would use and recommend Qantas in future. Qantas needs to significantly improve its web/phone customer service experience as on previous occasions it has been atrocious.

### "Qantas are an absolute joke"
Not Verified |  Just hope you don't have to call Qantas for customer service. They damaged my property, and no one will take responsibility. I have been on 12 phone calls and sent 9 emails which all come back with the same response, which is to be passed to another department. Qantas are an absolute joke.

### "embarrassed at the quality of food"
The boarding time was delayed because of cabin being too hot. Why this happened no one was told why. Eventually on board business class. The seats were very uncomfortable compared to other airlines I have travelled on. Fortunately was not that long a flight. Qantas should be embarrassed at the quality of food served on this flight. It was totally uneatable other than a couple of spoonfuls of rice. Rice was dry. Chicken was over cooked and like rubber. The salmon was also like rubber and tasted dreadful. Also offered a thin stale slice of sour dough bread. The only thing to eat was a piece of cheese and crackers. This was Business class food!

### "Cabin cleanliness was poor"
Booked a return flight from Wellington to Denpasar via Melbourne. PROS - Three of the flour flights departed and arrived on time. Luggage arrived safely. Cabin crew on all four legs of the trip were friendly, helpful and professional. Meals on offer were with one exception, tasty, well presented and plentiful. CONS - At best I would classify BC on the 737-800 as PE with a hefty price attached. The seats were wide enough and leg room satisfactory but the recline was minimal (certainly not lie flat) and the supposed leg rest would be fine if the customer was 5 foot in height or less. The seat buttons for recline and the leg rest were unresponsive requiring a lot of prodding to elicit any movement in either direction The touch TV screen is tiny, slow to respond and with a very limited choice. Only one amenity kit was offered on the Denpasar - Melbourne leg. Contents basic and little point offering a dental kit if the toilet (tiny with no amenities except soap) does not supply disposable cups to rinse one’s mouth. No pillow provided on the Wellington Melbourne and return leg; no hot towels offered and even worse not even a disinfectant wipe provided with the meal trays to clean one’s hands before/ after eating. With the 12 BC seats situated right behind the galley the noise from cupboards/doors being opened and shut by crew in the galley and able to overhear conversations between crew members was pretty annoying and the ear plugs provided were much too large. Cabin cleanliness was poor - grubby dog eared safety instructions and magazine, crumbs, dust, smeared TV screen and seat leather in need of a good cleaning Despite the crew being professional the same could not be said of the standard of uniform. One cabin crew had the hem of their jacket hanging down and another a suit jacket with stains around the pocket area. Overall a disappointing experience and definitely not value for money.

### "More disgusting service"
More disgusting service from everyone's favourite airline. 50% more expensive than JetStar and still the same abysmal service. They sent me an invitation to buy a one time use of their Qantas Lounge in Melbourne. since I had a 3 hour stop there I thought it would be a nice idea to try it out. Now keep in mind, that some genius in their marketing department thought it would be a good idea to razzle dazzle a new potential regular customer by sending me this special "VIP Offer". You know, let me experience how wonderful the lounge is and then I might buy permanent access to it and further improve their fat profits. I thought it was odd that they only sent the invite to me and not my wife who was travelling with me. But the invite said I could forward it to the others I was travelling with and they can enjoy it to. Sadly or should I say expectedly, no matter how we tried to use the pass, access the site or complete a 2nd purchase their system would not allow me to do so. I figured if I bought one and they were trying to convince me to become a full fee paying client I would simply be able to explain the website issues and buy the 2nd pass at the counter when I walked in. Alas, it was not to be. all I got was excuses, rules about this and that and then a bunch of terse mouthy rudeness from the catty ladies when I displayed the slightest bit of frustration at their lack of ability to fix a simple situation. Your welcome to use your pass Sir" yea.. i'll just wave at my wife through the window while I enjoy my free coffee. Once again, Qantas could have made money, pleased a customer and made flying with them a pleasure, but instead they ensured I will do everything I can to avoid flying with them again. After flying Air NZ on the way over and enjoying their nearly newplane, with complimentary Wifi, and lovely staff with great service, the stark difference in how not to do things by Qantas was pulpable. every metric was comparably, utter garbage compared to Air NZ. They were great once, but sadly they've been managed into the dirt by corporate greed.

### "$100 refund for a $510 ticket"
Not Verified |  On the 18th of October, I needed to cancel my return flight Melbourne to Canberra. I went online and it gave me two options – cancel for credit, or cancel for money. It told me to ‘check my ticket for the rules’. I did this – there was nothing on my ticket about the rules that I could discernibly locate. I clicked ‘cancel for money’, but I was on a call with Qantas as I was doing this (on hold for half an hour, as per usual). Five minutes after clicking – ‘cancel for refund/money’ – I spoke to someone (9.35am approx.). She asked me, ‘have you just requested a refund, online?” I said, “Yes, I have – should I have done this?” “Yes, that is okay,” she said. Will I get a refund?” I asked. Yes,” she said. At no point did she tell me it was only the taxes being refunded. I confirmed again, “would I receive a refund” – she said yes. At no point did she divulge it was only a tiny proportion of the ticket - $100 refund for a $510 ticket. After ending the call I then received an email, saying that I would only receive a refund, depending on the rules of the ticket (what are the rules? Did this email tell me? No of course not). So, again – even after calling – I’m looking at the app, I’m chasing down the paper ticket and looking at it again. I’m a fairly smart person, but I can’t find anything – incredibly obtuse rules. So, I have to call again and I’m on hold for half an hour. This time, I speak to a man. I tell him the situation. He said, “did the previous person you speak to check your ticket rules?” “No,” I said. She should have checked, and cancelled the refund request. She should have requested a ‘cancel for credit’ for you. You would have received a full credit. Did she tell you this?” “No she did not.” “Did she tell you that you would only receive a partial refund?” “No she did not. She did not tell me anything of the sort.” He says, “there’s nothing I can do.” This is Qantas – the spirit of Australia.

### "Awful customer service"
Not Verified |  Awful customer service. We've been trying to find out where our luggage went - it was misplaced by Qantas on a domestic flight in April 2023 from Broome to Brisbane via Perth - but Qantas are just not willing to help. No reaction whatsoever (lost luggage desk was closed upon arrival in Brisbane!) and the luggage is still MIA. (October 2023) After months of fighting to at least get some kind of answer and a compensation, they finally paid the maximum fee for lost luggage. We had to be a pain in their asses to get this compensation, though. We felt they are just not interested in their customers which is ridiculous. I used to love to fly with Qantas. I will never do it again.

### “a disappointing experience”
Not Verified | One of the worst flight experiences of my entire life. The entertainment on the flight did not work, flight attendants refused to help with basic inquiries and were rude to my Dad and myself when serving us meals and providing us with necessary equipment to ensure the flight’s convenience. The flight experience was highly turbulent and shaky even though the weather forecast noted that there was no rain, thunderstorm or heavy winds to create such an effect. Most especially we missed our first flight to Brisbane because of the disorganisation of the service desk. We got there on time but because of how long the line was and the slow, insufficient operations of the people at the counter by the time we reached to check in our luggage the lady at the counter said we won’t make it for our flight, and the next flight would cause us to miss our connecting flight as well. This lady was extremely arrogant, rude, obstinate and unhelpful which is everything a person at the desk is supposed to be. We had to then pay for new flights and another connecting flight because of the ineptitude, chaos and disorganisation of the people at the ground service. This was also extremely risky as the flight we booked to Brisbane to connect to Port Moresby was in thirty minutes and we had to rush in checking our bass. Also they had only one person operating near the kiosk area as they all shut down, and the lines grew to be extremely long when we booked the new tickets. We asked a ground service person and they said it would take approximately 5hrs 30mins till the people from the back could reach the front. This was extremely rushed and a disappointing experience with Qantas who caused us to miss our flight. Also our returned flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane was delayed by 7 hours causing us to again miss our connecting flight to Sydney. Although they did compensate us for this incompetent mistake, we had to travel to Sydney the next day and stay over night in Brisbane which was inconvenient as I had morning plans to fulfil the next day we were supposed to arrive. For the previous mistake caused directly and consequently by the confusion, cluster and disorder of the Qantas ground service we were not compensated for. This is a clear example poor quality service and the way aircraft companies manipulate and scam people in terms of flight so they can cheat and inconvenience people so they can gain more money handed into their pockets. Qantas is a pathetic airline service and all positive connotations associated with the brand in terms of them being the safest and most efficient airline should be thrown in the trash. Qantas is outright insufficient, poorly managed and are pure scammers. Never to be trusted again.

### "Quite disappointing to be exact"
Not Verified |  Quite disappointing to be exact, I always wanted to fly with QF and a chance appeared (at the expense of an expensive fare). Despite prefering to fly through the Middle East, I took this option which was available only to find that they do not update our mobiles on the flight delay. Originating flight from SYD was delayed by 2 hours hence the delay from SIN to LHR. Flight from KUL on MH was a breeze. Sadly, the boarding was a mess at SIN, flight delayed by 2 hours (left only at 1:30am from the original 11:30pm) which resulted in our arrival into LHR (Terminal 3) at close to 8am from the original 6am. Service was alright, nothing to shout about, seats on the A380 were huge and comfortable although the full flight did not help (one can feel the weight and the density) Meals were ok ex-SIN but not ex-LHR. Baggage did not arrive at KUL, one bag never left LHR and one more did not make it on the short connection to KUL. Bag arrived five days & one day later respectively. Check-in staff at LHR did not follow the procedure on the baggage tag when asked for help, she just pushed the bag onto the conveyor belt and that particular bag took 5 days after some probing; the staff responding to email was really helpful - thank you to the LHR team and MH for being so attentive in the delayed baggage. Overall, I would avoid flying with them on this route, honestly not the best flight i have had and I hope never to be on a stuffy and packed flight as I did on these flights.

### "very pleasant flight"
Excellent experience, very pleasant flight. Some minor service inconsistencies, eg cabin crew much friendlier than check in, service in one aisle better than in the other. Business class cabin in the A380 is huge which affects service. Overall, great though. Qantas has amazing lounges, the cabin crew creates a very relaxed atmosphere on board and food and entertainment are above average. Their business class seat on the A380 is among the best in the market.

### "Pretty poor if you ask me"
Not Verified |  When booking the flight to Bangkok the only Qantas options were to connect with JetStar out of Singapore. Upon arrival at Perth checkin counter we were advised they could not ticket us all the way through and we would need to attend the Jetstar transfer desk in terminal 4, the check-in counter also advised we would need to clear customs in Singapore, get our bags and take them to the transfer desk. Upon arrival in Singapore we did not need to clear customs and our bags were checked through, at the JetStar check transfer desk the lady was getting all confused about why Qantas had not issued our boarding pass back in Perth. Bottom line is the check in staff at Perth airport are not well informed and do not know how to obtain connecting code share ticket, others PAX did not need were issued with boarding passes in Australia. Pretty poor if you ask me.

### "staff were rude and dismissive"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed three hours, passengers weren’t notified of this or the gate change. Staff working on gates were not helpful, appeared to not be informed of update, and made no effort to investigate for you. On the flight, staff were rude and dismissive, one of them in particular, seemed to not really enjoy her job. It was a nine hour flight with additional landing delays. A lunch was served. No alcoholic beverages provided at all. When requesting this, staff hesitated and said they would bring the beverage to which they didn’t bother. dinner was served to some people, but Many were not offered dinner or beverages. I had one bottle of water provided for the entire flight, as a meal /beverage was not offered at dinner time.

### "impersonal and unpleasant"
Not Verified | Travelling from Brisbane to Christchurch via Sydney and the check-in experience was awful. Please bring back more people to assist with service. Bag drop was confusing. Only one person running between bag drops to assist customers. Long queues for 2 other ground staff for customers who had questions. The app does not replace the human touch. The new service is impersonal and unpleasant. It's so much better starting a trip with a friendly airline representative assisting and giving assurances. We were directed to one and felt relieved to be given time and necessary information that a scanner can not. Bring back more staff!

### "I simply couldn’t fault them"
Haven’t been a fan of Qantas for a number of years now after repeatedly being let down in the areas of service, communication and reliability. However, I recently flew SYD-DFW which is a 15hr odd flight, and couldn’t be happier. The crew were attentive and friendly; the space was as comfortable as you can get for economy, and the aircraft was on time and arrived early. On board and pre departure communication was great, and I simply couldn’t fault them. The food was very good by any standards - that’s from myself being an acclaimed chef and very picky punter in that department. It was an overall fantastic experience, especially given the length of the flight. I’m flying back today from DFW-MEL, which is a 17.5hr flight, and looking forward to the repeated service I was met with on the way over. Well done to all. The airline is certainly back on its way up.

### "Qantas is a national disgrace"
Qantas is a national disgrace and makes me feel ashamed to be an Australian where we use to pride ourselves in the space of aviation. The flight I caught, I had a leaking air vent from above which was covered up by the flight crew with napkins and a extremely loud rattle beside me the whole flight. I was flying on a 22 yr old Boeing 737-800. The food service was disgraceful and the crew were very unfriendly. We flew the day before Alan Joyce resigned. This airline needs a dramatic turnaround and I would never fly Qantas internationally when you can get a true 5 star experience on Singapore Airlines.

### "worse than majority of the budget airlines"
Not Verified |  Had a Qantas flight shared with emirates and what a total disappointment! In comparison to the various airlines used in the past, Qantas is by far the most outdated and basic airline I have ever been to. Seating is uncomfortable and cramped with very little leg room and recline, entertainment is a basic iPad unlike many other airlines who offer a proper screen and display flight information as well as other type of entertainment, food is low quality and overall drink service is non existent outside meal times. My suitcase arrived cracked and unable to be used and upon contacting baggage care team, I keep getting the same email response stating it to be considered minor damage. I have requested to arrange for the suitcase to be personally inspected but the response is the same verbatim reply and it seems nobody is actually reading my email requesting for a reassessment to be done via a physical inspection of the suitcase. I will never fly Qantas and will avoid any code sharing flights from other companies who use Qantas. This airline is worse than majority of the budget airlines I have travelled, and definitely not suitable for long haul international flights. The only positives were: In flight wifi and good quality pillow

### "overall pretty good flight"
Not Verified |  Christchurch to Sydney then Sydney to Brisbane. Christchurch to Sydney was on time and Sydney to Brisbane was delayed by 1 hours because of a sudden change of wind. There was no screen on the second flight but had wifi so you can use the inflight entertainment app. The screen on the 1st flight was pretty basic. The reaction time was horrible and had to basically punch the screen to get anywhere. The movies were very selective. But overall pretty good flight.

### "Business class has been dumbed down"
Not Verified |  Booked to fly QF10 September 15 weeks in advance. Notice September 15. Flight canceled and date departure changed to September 16. Directed to web site to change flight and the site wanted a $99 change fee plus change of fare up to $398. Spent 50 minutes on call centre to get alternate flight at no extra cost. Business class has been dumbed down. No blanket or pillow. No choice of red wine. Meal presentation and quality is canteen quality. If Neil Perry is putting his name to this. The CWA golden wattle cookbook could do better

### “promotion code would not take”
Qantas has a “Red Email” promotion where you sign up to allow tracking and sharing your information in exchange for a $30 off per flights book through Dec 11th 2023, upon booking my flight the promotion code would not take, went through with booking and called to get that promotion credit added to the purchase, long story short, after 4 hours and 7 people later it’s has still not been resolved. I’m told to call back in 2 hours when the frequent flyer division opens. I’ll keep an eye am only able to do all this and spend that much time on. This is because I am retired with nothing else to do. It’s still frustrates me that I’m put through the wringer or that anyone should be put through this much work to get the promotion promised.

### “Seats are so close together”
Not Verified | Seats are so close together and when you're supporting someone with vision impairment, it's nearly impossible to get them in safely. Another inch between the seats (back and front) would've made a difference. Melbourne Airport was the worst for 'customer service', just getting 'pointing' and "go over there". Brisbane however, was a lot more friendly and helpful. Trying to find someone to actually physically HELP with baggage labels was impossible. I can't find too much negative to say about Brisbane at all. Food? What food? This current trip was morning tea time, so my expectations were low anyway. Melbourne didn't have a 'buggy' available to transport my sight-impaired person? Is that normal or couldn't they be bothered to find one?

### "airline doesn’t care"
Not Verified |  Planes seats out dated Food & beverage was good. Staff were average mostly old and grumpy but a couple of them were happy to be there. Luggage had some tears and lost a zipper. Flight delayed 4 hours. Overall, airline doesn’t care. Try to make a complaint and it goes straight to their junk box. It feels like we are a complete nuisance for the staff and the airline and if you have a complaint you best not say anything or we get in trouble.

### "Food is atrocious"
Qantas Business Class really feels like it just Economy on steroids! There is nothing Flashy, nothing that says style, just "Ho Hum". We only fly business and Qantas is about the worst that we experience. Food is atrocious.... They provide me Jamesons Whisky but it is not Jamesons! Staff are aging like their planes. At least we took off on time and arrived on time. Not too many choices where we love - so probably must have to be Qantas again in the future!

### "Terrible experience"
I booked both my International flights and connecting flights from Johannesburg to Gold Coast via Sydney. My checked in bag was lost when i arrived at OOL, i ended up having to buy clothes and toiletries as i was unsure when my bag would turn up. We went to check at the OOL airport the following day as nobody called us that it arrived. My bag turned up damaged, one wheel was broken/melted making it impossible to pull for the rest of my trip. My return flight was delayed but luckily i didn’t miss my connecting International flight back to Johannesburg. Terrible experience. I’ll rather schedule my next trip with Singapore Airlines when i travel again later this year.

### "I will never fly Qantas again"
Not Verified |  I have been a Gold FF for many years so this is a very disappointing review to write. After a 6 hour delay (which caused me to miss my first event in LA) I arrived to find they had lost my bag (which was clearly labelled). Received bag 3 days later, and as a result had to purchase clothes each day as well as all the bathroom essentials totaling $380, which they won't reimburse, and its not worth going through travel insurance. The inflight service was the worst I had experienced. Cabin Crew were rude, unhelpful, and downright inept. The plane was filthy before it even took off, and made no effort whatsoever to assist passengers. I will never fly Qantas again, and if you value your traveling experience, you will choose another airline!

### "become a sub par airline"
Qantas have become a sub par airline compared to many others. They have terrible meals and drink service. Seats are also outdated and not comfortable. Even dirty from the flight before. My recent flight from Tokyo to Sydney was more than awful. On a night flight they should provide efficient service so people can maximize sleep. The crew were nice though understaffed. I had a Qatar flight a few days earlier and there were double the staff. The drink service after takeoff was non existent. When asked for a drink, on business class, I was told no. Have to wait for the cart. More like economy class. Then due to turbulence, that was non existent, the meal service didn’t start for over an hour after take off. Most airlines bring drinks and a snack. Then deliver the meal service around 30-40 minutes after take off. Not on this flight. And then the meal had to be chosen off a snack menu and you can’t even ask for more than one item. Again, not at all like any other airline that will let you pick what you want when you want. Then when asked to be allowed to sleep until an hour before arrival I was woken up 2 hours before. Sadly I won’t travel unless I have to with Qantas again.

### "abysmal Business Class flights"
Just abysmal Business Class flights. Even worse than obscure ordinary Chinese domestic airline service. A dreadful trip commenced with chaos and confusion because four Qantas flights, scheduled to leave at the same time, were allocated two adjoining departure gates. A thousand or so passengers were herded like sheep into a waiting area then down into ground level containment area where we were funnelled into lines and pushed onto hot crowded buses and then marched over the tarmac and then had to climb the stairs to board. The Sydney - J'Burg flight is 14 hours. We were given one meal immediately after take-off and a second meal one-hour before landing - this left a 12-hour gap between meals or snacks. This would have been easier to deal with if we were told meal times or had snacks available. The staff at the front galley disappeared for most of the flight. The staff, when we did see them were brusque, downright patronising and rude. The entertainment choices were very limited and appeared to the standard domestic route choices. The return flight left J'Burg 2 hours late which led to missed connections and an unnecessary overnight stay in Sydney. Sadly, a different crew on the return flight were just as abrupt and rude. Indeed, they just "forgot" to deliver meals and then almost tossed them at us when we enquired. It felt like both cabin crews resented being on this route and their general antipathy to the airline and/or their roster was reflected in their angry demeanour and consistently rude attitude to paying passengers. Irrespective of the reason, the poor attitude and terrible service is unacceptable in any circumstance. The level of service in business class on this route was unquestionably the worst I've ever experienced. Cathay, Singapore, Emirates, Air New Zealand are all light years ahead of Qantas. I've spent years flying around the world with work and can testify that even the most ordinary Chinese domestic flights offer snacks and have friendlier staff. After these two horrendous flights we've sworn never to fly with Qantas again.

### "The plane was also filthy"
Qantas has truly gone downhill. This is a short flight but the crew basically served the lunch and drinks because they would soon have to start their descent for landing. I did the exact same flight with Virgin the week earlier and they took their time and actually spoke to us. The plane was also filthy, my tray was disgusting and there was hair and crumbs on it so I put everything on my lap.

### "shying away from taking responsibility"
My wife and kid had a Qantas (QF68) flight from Bengaluru to Melbourne for Aug 25, 2022 via Sydney. As per original schedule, they should have reached Melbourne on 26th Aug at 12:30pm, however due to flight cancellations/reschedule they reached only on 27th Aug at 6pm. A delay of almost 30hrs from the original plan. My kid is a special needs kid and we had mentioned the same in our booking as well (wheelchair assistance, torso booked in advance). While there was some empathy towards my wife & kid in terms of deplaning, hotel reservation in Bengaluru however, all that came only after my wife had to firmly ask for it. Additionally, the original connecting flight from Sydney to Melbourne had a layover of only 2hrs, the new rescheduled flight had a layover of 7hrs. When my wife asked for free lounge access to the staff in Sydney she was denied the same. This experience has really made me regret my decision of choosing Qantas. It's been 4 days I raised a complaint to Qantas and there has been no response at all - they are simply shying away from taking responsibility.

### "Rude and terrible service"
Flight cancelled for maintenance problem which is now extremely common for Qantas. Was given a $15 voucher and said I would be booked on a flight in 12 hours. I said that's not really good enough and the staff said it's not there problem. Rude and terrible service for a cancelled flight. No thought to passengers at all. Qantas used to be a great airline now they are plagued with delays and terrible service and also expensive. Avoid flying at all costs

### "terrible experience with Qantas today"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience with Qantas today. After my original flight gat cancelled I got bumped to the next flight an hour something later. I had an extra leg room seat on my original flight but been moved to row 24 and nobody could do anything about it. When arrived to Syd airport I got 3 different instructions from 3 different Qantas staff members on how to get my board pass printed as my digital one was removed from the Qantas app when my original flight got cancelled. Now I'm onboard the aircraft and waiting for over 40 minutes to depart. They had a problem with one of the seats which no one has seen till this moment and I will get to my destination hours after my intended arriving time of when I bought the ticket. The flight is packed and people have been moved to vacant extra leg room seats. My situation has been completely disregarded. As the flight is yet to happen I wont be surprised if more issues appear. Terrible experience.

### "say a huge thank you to the crew"
I would like to say a huge thank you to the crew of the flight QF-51 from Brisbane to Singapore on 18 August 2023. I suffer from a bad aerophobia, so when the flight got a bit bumpy (or so I thought) and I got really anxious, one of the flight attendants sat in the aisle right next to me and was holding my hand to help me calm down and showing me some EFT techniques to reduce the level of my fear of flying next time. The bumpy part only lasted a few minutes and the rest of the flight was very smooth and stress-free for me, but that gentleman and the other flight attendants kept checking on me to make sure I was alright. I was really moved by that. The landing was amazing, and upon leaving the aircraft I even got to see the pilots and talk to them a bit, which was like a dream come true. The other things that I liked about flying with Qantas included take-off and landing on time, good meals (apart from the main meal we were served all kinds of snacks several times during the flight) and the flight attendants' great sense of humor (the joke about the next generation iPad (the toys they gave to the kids onboard) was priceless. My experience of flying with Qantas was 100% positive, and I have already recommended this airline to my friends

### "Avoid them whenever you can"
The flight was half an hour late. We've been provided with Qantas iPAD with outdated movies on it. It was the only entertainment, no flight information, time to destination, cameras, any time at all. Dinner was very poor, it was not enough for little child. Basic little meal with no salad but after dinner we were served with paddle pop 9 good for kid's summer birthday. In the back pocket of seat in front of you there was water - 300ml bottle. I had some water after poor dinner and was about to have some rest. A crew member was walking between seats and asked me" "Do you have water? I shown her my half empty bottle, she took it and was topping up my water from her plastic jar. I was shocked. Her jar was touching everyone's used bottles and filling bottles. After this the crew ensconced themselves in the rear of the plane with curtains. I had some sleep, woke up and had no idea what time it was. My mobile shown time from some country that I was in transit that day, Qantas iPad did not have any information. A crew member was coming and gave me a mini muffin. And announcement was coming - we will land in about 20 minutes. I was dying for coffee, juice or some water but there was nothing. This was our breakfast and refreshment after eight hours long flight. Avoid them whenever you can, I will for sure.

### "Will never fly Qantas again"
Not Verified |  What a embarrassment Qantas has become. Flights booked to travel from Sydney to Des Moines and less then 24 hours before the flight we receive a text message (not a phone call) to advise us that our flight was cancelled and Qantas would be in touch shortly with alterative flights. Well that was just a bald faced lie as we then received another text at 11:40pm tell us to that they had been trying to contact us (must of been by mental telepathy) and please ring this number to organise a refund or flight credits. Wanting neither of these things I rang the number and went through the process of entering Frequent flyer number etc' to verify myself to be finally connected to customer support. The agent had a very heavy accent and due to the noise was extremely difficult to understand, but that didn't seem to matter as 30 minutes into the call the call was terminated and I was returned to the automated system needing to re-enter my details. So I rang again only to get a different agent, again unable to hear and understand due to the noise and accent. So did I get my issue solved this time? No. Again 30 minutes into the call I was cut off. When I made a third call I requested at the start of the call to have the automated cut off turned off only to be told there was no such system, so I explained my last two calls and again insisted that the system be turned off to be told that this call would not be terminated at 30 minutes. When I first started talking to this service agent he told me the flight wasn't cancelled, so I had him recheck only to find out he was looking at the wrong day. So at 2am, the day I was due to fly I finally get flights rearranged. At the end of the conversation I enquired if any compensation was available for the stuffing around I had received only to be told that there was a form on the website I could fill out if I wanted to. Having had flights cancelled previously with other airline I had always been rung with apologies, alternative flights and offers of compensation, QANTAS offered none of this, had to ask for it all and yet to receive and apology. Flights organised I head off to the airport, no sleep, but the prospect of things to improve, wrong. Check-in was a joke, self serve, hundreds of people wanting to use a few machines that were working, poor staff, limited as they were, could not keep up with the issues. Finally got boarding passes and bag tags and headed to the self serve baggage drop only to find the machine would not read the boarding pass, so had to get the boarding pass re-printed and then guess what, the machine would not read the bag tag, so re-print required for this as well. Truly you can't make this up. While waiting for all this to happen, took over 90 minutes to get checked in and bag dropped we were watching people lining up at a service desk for so called budget airlines and being served by an attendant having their bags weighed and loaded and leaving with a smile and a boarding pass. So off to the plane and the chance for some sleep, nope. For some reason every other seat had a type of block under the frame of the seat in front blocking 1/3 of the available leg room so having both legs stretched out was impossible so had to have one leg tucked under the other for nearly 14 hours, So the food had to be good right? No. The plate of fresh seasonal fruit was a bag of dried rubber. Need I say more. Will never fly Qantas again. Budget airline trying to be a premium airline and failing.

### "So get your act sorted out"
To be honest, flying Qantas at almost double the cost of a budget airline, we thought we'd get a good deal onboard, but it was a "five course meal" consisting of 5 tiny sweetish biscuits in a packet and orange juice literally "to die for" if you didn't survive the horror of it being warm and yukky! You'll never trust OJ again. Trust Qantas to grab itself a bad name. It may own the bad name, but it doesn't own the national brand. So get your act sorted out, Qantas!

### "service terrible for a premium cabin"
Where do I even begin. The flight was delayed 6 hours but Qantas did not inform us of any delay beforehand. The check-in agent did not mention anything, but there was a one-page printed letter at the check-in desk saying the flight has been delayed and that food vouchers would be provided. No vouchers were provided and when I presented the letter to the food outlets at JNB, none of them accepted it saying they had not been informed. Nice going Qantas. Luckily I have gold FF status with QF and we were able to use the Aspire lounge at JNB. The lounge itself is okay but this is not a review of the lounge, so I'll leave it there. When we finally got underway after the 6-hour delay, food was served. I was dozing off but the FAs did not even attempt to wake me up, and having had no dinner, I went to sleep. The service on board is terrible for a premium cabin. Pax were provided with one 500mL water bottle and none of the FAs even bothered to check on pax to see if anyone needed anything. Its as though they just shut shop after the dinner service. No food/snacks or even water was provided for over 8 hours. Breakfast was provided 2 hours before landing, and even that was mediocre. The tray table was left up on one of the middle seats and no one came to clear the table after dinner, the pax next to us had left his food on the tray and changed seats (see attached photo). Terribly disappointed with the service - the delay and the terrible service by FAs on board especially for a premium cabin/product. After years of supporting this airline and being a gold FF member, it saddens me to say I will not be flying QF again.

### "do not deliver what they promise"
Qantas, “the pride of Australia, our National Carrier” they say. I say “shameful and not up to any Australian standard”. In comparison to other flights, Qantas surely lacks standards in terms of ground staff service, onboard meals, taking accountability and ensuring that no hiccups of any sort, is repeated. They should learn from their mistakes and value their patrons for without air passengers, Qantas cannot promote themselves. They surely need to upgrade their understanding of service. If one should go through the reviews of Qantas on several websites, one would read about delayed or cancelled flights, being unethical or uncaring when it comes to refunds or compensations, being unfair with costing when it comes to a change in original booking, declining quality, bad customer service, unreliable and do not deliver what they promise, woeful call centre delays, rude staff that take no liability for their mistakes, unpalatable onboard food, snobbish flight crew, lost baggage etc etc - just to name a few. My experience with Qantas was initially the onboard food, which was pathetic and unpalatable. Then, upon reaching my destination, I had the misfortune of “lost baggage” and thereafter learnt that the staff at Sydney Airport who assisted my 91 year old Mother-in-law and myself, did not produce any evidence for baggage claim once checked-in baggage were scanned and sent through on the conveyor belt. Soon after and the days that followed, I went on to experience staff at Call Centres based in Fiji, who were of no help whatsoever; Qantas Staff at Sydney Airport who refused to give out their names and who were utterly rude to my Sister who was following this case on my behalf whilst I was overseas; to a point of disconnecting her phone calls and refusing to pick up the phone again. All of my emails were automated responded, which became quite frustrating and there was not one phone call from Qantas-Australia (Sydney) that came through to me; to assure me that my baggage would be found instead of passing the buck; and finally after a month, Qantas has offered a meagre $300/- compensation when the contents of my baggage costed way more (although found and delivered after 72 hrs) but had to be discarded due to weather damage. I incurred additional expenses to have International roaming just to be readily available on call, should Qantas reach out to me; but, which never did happen. Travelling is stressful enough and to have your baggage lost is anxiety at its peak, especially when Qantas - Australia were of absolute no use and it was Staff at Bangalore Airport who were polished in their Services and who were empathetic, compassionate and understanding of my plight and did everything to keep me informed of their follow-up, on a daily basis. I boarded a direct 12 hr flight from Sydney to Bangalore, checking in 3 bags, in total. It was from point A to point B and yet, Qantas could not even get this right and had lost 1 baggage somewhere. After several phone calls, Qantas washed their hands and justified themselves stating that there was no record of 1 baggage and that only 2 was on the system. How then, when their ground staff were the ones to check all 3 bags, did one disappear off the records? The incompetence of Qantas Customer Care has been more like going through heavy turbulence and their reputation is nosediving as the worst performing Airline. I am yet to have this resolved with Qantas.

### "cancelled my return flight"
I had a round trip from Melbourne to Perth. Missed 2 meetings in Perth because of the delays in departure flight. And missed my partner's birthday because they cancelled my return flight. Even their rescheduled return flight for the following day had long delays because they had messed up their catering orders.

### "What an absolute nightmare"
What an absolute nightmare it is trying to deal with Qantas, so called "Customer Service" and "Customer Care Specialists". I have been a frequent flyer and Qantas Club member for 26 years and have never witness such a lack of customer service. I recently had to catch a Qantas domestic flight from Melbourne to Sydney to get an international flight with another airline. Our baggage was checked in at the designated Qantas counter for international connections and we were advised that our bags would be checked all the way to our final destination. Well, naturally this didn't happen and we had 5 people with no luggage for 3 days. One of the bags contained critical medications. I lodged a "missed luggage report" with the airline we were travelling on but they could not track where our baggage was. The following morning I contacted the local Qantas "Customer Service" only to be told that they could not assist in tracking our luggage. I continued to chase both Qantas and our other airline to try to locate our luggage with both denying responsibility. At least the other airline was able to tell me that the bags never made it to the connecting flight. After 3 days of living with out our luggage and me continuing to chase it, our luggage finally arrived with Qantas "rush tags" attached. When I returned home I sent an email to Qantas asking for an explanation for why our luggage didn't make the connecting flight, and why Qantas "Customer Service" didn't contact me to let me know that the bags wouldn't arrive. From that point on Qantas customer care specialist went into full deny mode and blame shifting to the other airline even though all evidence pointed to Qantas systems failing. There was no admission of any failure by Qantas and their "Customer Care Specialist" didn't even want to follow up to learn from the experience, just a hollow apology and a denial of any wrongdoing.

### "no accountability due to their delay"
Not Verified | Our flight scheduled to depart at 11.50 pm was delayed twice by more than 1 day. We called customer service more than 5 times to change our connecting flights and none of them could help us. Some of the customer service people either just cancelled our call mid way thru or just couldn't reschedule our flights. It was so frustrating that we were trying to contact customer service for more than 5 hours and could not get someone to help us. It was just a simple request yet we are puzzled why customer service cant get this right with one call. Such a horrible experience and never want to fly this airline again. Not with this experience. As a result of this delay all my subsequent connecting flights and other plans had to be deferred at extra cost and Qantas refuse to pay them. They take no accountability due to their delay.

### "poor customer service from QANTAS frequent flyer"
Not Verified |  This review relates to very poor customer service from QANTAS frequent flyer. I submitted evidence for a flight with Royal Air Maroc several months ago and QANTAS have not updated my points. QANTAS broke data protection and sent me via email the details of another customer's booking, what is going on with this department? I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and so this is very disappointing. I would rate this department with a zero

### "£rang for service three times with no response"
Not Verified |  Service was okay on the first plane, but on the A380 it was nonexistent. I rang for service three times with no response after an hour l got up and went to the stewards section where two stewards were sitting and ask for a drink. The response was a hand appeared from behind the curtain with a drink in the hand and no sorry. The food trolley had one steward handing out meals and drinks, it took her ages to get to the rear section. Is this the standard for economy, now l am a pensioner and cannot afford premium if I ever fly again l will think twice about Qantas or the A380.

### "cabin crew were very helpful"
Not Verified |  Another great flight from Qantas. The first class lounge in Melbourne was great, with a good choice of food and plenty of seating. Boarding was organised and fashionable, the staff were helpful. The cabin was well presented and clean. The cabin crew were very helpful. The food was pretty good with a great drinks selection. The toilets were clean and the seats were comfortable for the type of flights being flown. The entertainment was very average, with no individual screens but pop-down ones instead. Free WiFi on all flights really helps Qantas' case, with the WiFi being fast.

### "Airline management and equipment poor"
Not Verified |  Excellent crew on all legs. Food satisfactory. Airline management and equipment poor. Network infected with breakdowns, delays and cancellations. Will fly Singapore Airlines next time.

### "I regret choosing Qantas"
Not Verified |  1hr+ delays both to and from, no complimentary kids pack and ipads don't work. This was my sons first plane trip and I picked window seats for him on both flights, these were changed without warning. This is a premium price tag for a worse experience than a budget airline. I usually go Jetstar or Virgin, and I regret choosing Qantas.

### "Too many cancelled flights"
Not Verified |  Too many cancelled flights. Over the past 3 years at least 50% of my flights with Qantas were cancelled and reallocated to different and inconvenient times. This especially happens on the Sydney to Melbourne route. I can tell in advance when this is going to occur, if the flights is not 90% full 4 hours prior to flight time it will definitely get cancelled. Fly with Qantas - you have the choice of being either packed like a sardine or cancelled. The staff honestly couldn’t give a rats. Service is average compared to other airlines, and not at a premium price tag that they charge. Planes are generally old and seats well worn.

### "the plane was so dirty"
Disgusting! They said Qantas is the Australia's best airline, however my experiences said differently from what people rate. My husband and I flew from Perth to Japan by Singapore return in April 2023. Luckily only 5,5 hours to Singapore otherwise I will make a complaint right away but I need to write this review down and wishing the Airplane make improvement on their services and cleanest like other best airlines in the world. I don't have a problem on check in area, but the plane was so dirty!! I don't think they're even clean the plane after the flight, the seat hasn’t been cleaned from the last flight. I found rubbish in the seat pocket, there's dirt on the blanket even though it was wrap inside the plastic, the pillow was slightly yellow and dusty, and the service on board wasn't great either. The worst part was the seat! How can the seat so hard and uncomfortable, really close each other made me couldn't breath because the seat were to close, especially when the passenger in front of me put their seat back, maybe only 15 cm right to my face! Comparing the price, Air Asia have better seat and cleaner than Qantas. We doesn't have choice to pay more after Covid, we understand that but we also wish that the Air Plane have or keep their "standard" not only make profit. We pay the service and you better priorities customers comfort and cleanliness otherwise you will lose your loyal customers.

### "delighted to receive high quality service"
Not Verified |  Qantas has been facing challenges with their service post-pandemic so I was delighted to receive high quality service onboard my latest flight from Melbourne Tullamarine to Sydney Kingsford Smith. The ground crew were always available and exceptional when helping you. This service continued when we boarded and throughout the flight. Fast and free wifi was provided which helped with the lack of entertainment provided. Qantas features some movies, but they are limited. Meal service consisted of juice or water and an apple crumble bar. The flight was great value for money considering it was booked using Classic Rewards (Points + Pay)

### "Qantas needs to honour their promise"
Appalling treatment and only made worse by their Customer Care Dept. I had booked and paid for 2 business class tickets in Dec 22 (using points plus pay). Boarding passes for myself and my sister were issued at luggage check-in. Upon arrival to business class lounge we were called up and told that only one of us could fly business, I requested to speak to a supervisor. The agent me several reasons, all unsatisfactory but apologised and assured me that the points and funds difference would be credited to my account. She further said by way of compensation she would offer me a $500 credit for the inconvenience. I enquired if this was to be cash, she said no it was a credit to be used towards flights only. She also subsequently met me at the gate before boarding and reiterated same. I was so distressed and affected by this bad start to my (special Christmas gift for my sister) holiday, that I ended up having to go to the hospital in Singapore. and I was very ill for the first 2 days of our 10 day trip All of which can be evidenced. I am not seeking compensation for this aspect but it should be known so that you have a complete picture of what occurred and the knock on effect. Since our return Qantas have shunted me from one department to another. First Customer Service (who apparently have no phone number), then Reservations Dept, then Frequent Flyer loyalty program. Each department tells me it is not under their purvue and that I need evidence of what the agent offered. I was told to go to the airport (a 4+ hour round trip for me) and to try to locate Karen at the airport. I explained that I would not be able to get to the business class lounge without a ticket and clearing customs - that Karen may not be working that day and that there may be many agents who work for Qantas. I was told I should have taken a reference number for the offer made by the agent. Well I did not realise I needed to make a recording or get an affidavit from her on the day as I took her at face value, assumed (and still do believe) that she made this offer in good faith and with full authority to do so. I am now told after wasting days /weeks on this that the complaint has been closed. I was not advised of this via email and no explanation given, they just decided to close it. Astonishing! Now when I make an enquiry I keep getting replies stating the reference number does not exist, presumably because they unilaterally decided to close it. Qantas needs to honour their promise and obligation. ie: 1. The correct amount of Frequent flyer loyalty points to be returned to my account (some points have been reinstated and then removed and I am querying the actual amount is correct). 2. For the compensation amount of $500 (for use towards flights) to be added to my account as promised.

### "not where it previously was"
The overall Qantas business product is not where it previously was. Having taken the same flight down with Virgin Business it is interesting comparing the two products, Virgin was overall a better product. Qantas check in, at Canberra (CBR) could not even see dedicated business check in and used the general boarding machines. Qantas lounge is comfortable but no dedicated business lounge in CBR just one shared with Qantas Club. At time of boarding, they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium FF members. On the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight. The plane was comfortable, and the seating was good. The meal was good overall, but we were not offered any re-fills or a second beverage. Basically, the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service. Following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up, even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service. Finally, the bags well again no business priority, the bag came out amongst all the general baggage. Being a premium FF, the premium baggage service has been nonexistent since Qantas moved to contractors.

### "abrupt, coarse, rude, patronizing"
May/June 2023 trip mishaps:- Was booked to fly out on  26th May 2023 on flight QF64. Only when I got to the airport around 14h15, was I told that I will only be departing on Saturday, 27th May 2023, due to technical issues. I incurred UBER costs going to and from the airport. Once flight was boarded, doors locked, we were informed by the pilot that there were technical issues, so we cannot take off. Delayed on the tarmac for 3 hours 20 mins. My seat was right at the back, therefore could not use the overhead locker to store hand luggage as this is blocked off to passengers. The steward did not help me find space, even though I asked. Was told that I can just walk to the front and see if any available. My vegetarian meal was chick peas again. Thank goodness, my layover in Sydney was 4 hours 10 mins, so even though we were delayed in Johannesburg, I still caught my connecting flight to Auckland. The connecting flight QF 147 – was also delayed on the tarmac for 2 hours 30-40 mins, so we only got to Auckland Monday (29th May) morning around 02:30am. I encountered friendly, helpful and polite staff in Auckland Two precious days lost because of Qantas. My return journey, on the 16th June 2023 – arrived at Sydney airport at 08h10 from Auckland. Flight QF63 to Johannesburg departure time first delayed from 10h0 to 13h00, then to 18h00, then 20h00 and finally only flew out around 22h00. I still cannot fathom, how is it possible that there are no “spare” planes available at the airport for such emergencies (we were told the flight had technical issues and parts needed to be flown in from Brisbane – this information was only shared around 17h00. Before that we were just left hanging). We got no updates from any staff unless you made your way to the transit desk to ask. Even there the staff on duty had no idea what was going on. They kept promising we will be flying out by 18h00 that day. Staff, whether at transit desk or departure gates – abrupt, coarse, rude, patronizing, and talking down to people, like we are idiots. The apologies we received were halfhearted and felt more like insults to our intelligence then genuine concern. On return journey, as vegetarian, I was given pasta at supper and pasta again for breakfast – seriously Qantas, there are more meals you can prep for vegetarians. Please find out from Qatar and Emirates how they manage to give us vegetarians variety and tasty dishes on flights.

### "I will never fly with Qantas again"
Not Verified |  I booked tickets online with Qantas in February 2022. It was for myself, my husband and 4 children under the age of 10. For some reason, whilst booking, there was no option to select a child’s airfare. It was basically impossible to contact Qantas. I called and was on hold for over an hour and then got hung up on and another time was told by a recorded message to call back later and was disconnected. We needed to book our tickets so I booked them and continued to try contacting Qantas. Eventually, after being on hold for almost 2 hours I got through to someone. I explained the situation to them and they changed the booking to show that this was for 4 children. There was a difference in price so they said I would be refunded the difference. It could take up to 6 weeks for the money to go into my account so just wait. All seemed well. Our trip took place about 4 weeks later. I wasn’t all that impressed with Qantas when we flew but that’s another complaint. The 6 weeks came and went and I did not receive my refund. Once again I went through the process of calling Qantas and eventually got through to them. They said that because we had already flown we were not entitled to a refund. However, I had already been told we would get the refund before our trip so I didn’t understand how this was a problem. I was told to register a written complaint, which I did. Months later I still did not have an answer, so contacted them through email complaints department again. A few month later I received an email saying they were working on my claim. This went back and forth for a while. 2 weeks ago (well over a year since the original claim) I was told they regret my experience but they will not refund my money. They gave me some frequent flyer points which I don’t want because I will never fly with Qantas again. I truly believe they are in the wrong here. I was told I would get a refund and then the story changed after it was impossible for me to get the refund. This comes to like $400, which is a lot of money to me. Also, just as a general thing. We have flown with a few other airlines since then (we are doing humanitarian aid-type work in Thailand -which is why we were flying when Covid was still an issue) and every other airline has been just as good, if not better, than Qantas -including the cheaper ones. This goes for domestic and international so I would advise anyone to not fly with Qantas, even if they have a good deal. They are not any better than anyone else and if you have an issue it’s near impossible to work out. We don’t get paid for the work we do so any money we have is very needed. I’m pretty disappointed with Qantas and I don’t want anyone else to experience what we have so please be warned.

### "ever increasing delays at Qantas"
Not Verified |  Despite the aircraft arriving from Hong Kong 5 hours before the flight to Singapore, boarding was delayed by 1 hour in Sydney. Gate staff continuously blamed other factors such as cleaning staff taking longer than required or no gate available as reasons for the delay. When questioned on boarding as to why the plane couldn’t be cleaned in the preceding 5 hours, I was simply told to email customer care, which seems to be the go to response for most Qantas ground staff these days when confronted with polite complaints about the ever increasing delays at Qantas. Cabin crew were pleasant and helpful and the economy class supervisor was amazing, as she singled my family out for special attention and care. This had more to do with my frequent flyer status rather than just being a passenger receiving great service. Aircraft was 19 years old and showing its age. Broken fittings on the seats and in the toilets, ripped seat covers and damaged wall panels, the plane had clearly seen better days. Seats are narrow and leg room and recline are minimal compared to the likes of other major airlines. Food was inedible, bland and prison canteen style. Qantas have dispensed with trays containing an assortment of items and metal cutlery is no longer. You now just get a small portioned bowl with foil on top and a piece of bread slapped on the foil and some wooden cutlery in an envelope. Silver lining is that it’s easy to slip the bowl on the floor under your seat when you decide not to eat anything. Qantas is doing just enough so as not to be seen as a budget carrier while charging a premium price. Flight arrived 30 minutes late and bags were out by the time we got to the carousel, but that has more to do with the efficiency of Singapore Changi International Airport than Qantas.

### "packed in like sardines"
Not Verified |  5hrs 20 min, no screens, packed in like sardines. BYO entertainment, This airline is a joke. Paid over $600 Qantas club, have over 1 million ff points. Old stock, old flight attendants, outdated. These aircraft's are best suited to 1.5 hr East Coast jaunts, not 4 and 5 hr journeys.

### "worst part was the cleanliness"
After a delay of over an hour to leave Melbourne, we finally took off. The delay was due to a problem with a seat barrier in business class, but there were already 2 chairs not working in premium economy. We made up the time in the air but it was still frustrating to get to the airport on time only for a delay like this - surely the seats are regularly serviced? The flight crew were pleasant. The meals were average. No strong flavours, good if you like bland food. The worst part was the cleanliness of the seat (see photo of vestibule next to seat). You don’t want to sit down for a 16 hour flight, and find that the seat hasn’t been cleaned from the last flight. I think the cleaning crew might not be plugging in their vacuum cleaners when cleaning. The premium economy seat was comfortable otherwise, but how comfortable can you be in someone else’s food scraps? However, a very expensive fare - don’t quite see the value. Cleanliness is a big thing these days… get with the program qantas.

### "so dissatisfied and disappointed"
The flight was delayed 5 hours 45 minutes, which meant they didn’t need to supply us with accommodation…. BUT the flight didn’t board until 6 hours and 15 minutes after the the initial flight time. We slept on the floor in the airport for about an hour in the middle of the night. The food voucher only worked at subway and we don’t eat bread. Absolutely disgusting service. They did not care about our wellbeing. I will never fly qantas again. I’m so dissatisfied and disappointed.

### "appalling treatment of customers"
I would not recommend Qantas and their Customer Service. We flew to Australia last August, our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Singapore, where we were abandoned, on return we found our homeward flights had been cancelled without us being informed. This was very stressful as my wife requires wheelchair assistance. I lodged a complaint which I thought had been resolved in January when we were offered cash and miles in compensation. Submitted all the paper requested and since then despite emailing and phoning Australia have received no further communication. I feel that this is appalling treatment of customers and and just that they have no respect for us. I am now wondering if I should take legal action to resolve this situation.

### "Would never recommend"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed for the next day without any email or message delay notification. My flight from Singapore to Melbourne was 8.15 pm and it was delayed at 3:40 AM (NEXT DAY). I didn’t get any notification. I got to know after reaching the airport by the ground staff. There is no counter of Qantas at the Singapore airport. Ground staff just raised the hand for shifting to the next flight. Tried to call Qantas for 1.5 hours to ask for the compensation/options. Irresponsible airlines. Would never recommend or take Qantas again.

### "not a refined experience more"
Qantas Business Class is not a refined experience more, Economy with a little lift - customer is left lacking. Business Class Service is not 'Standard Business Class' you get elsewhere. No name recognition, No lovely to have you flying with us today. Food is boring and mostly unpalatable. They scurried around for a Jameson Whiskey and failed to produce it offering something else. You arrive at your destination feeling somewhat cheated of a 'Real Business Calls Service

### "wouldn't pay the reimbursement"
Lost my bag the night before I was meant to go to a friend's wedding - all my good clothes, my shoes, dress, make-up etc. were in the bag. I bought some essentials (underwear, toothpaste, make-up items) in the morning after speaking with customer care who said I could be reimbursed up to $100 for the first 24 hours as they could not guarantee my bag would arrive that day and could not give me a time frame but said maybe in the afternoon. I was stressed and trying to make plans for what to do/wear etc. My bag fortunately did arrive later that afternoon and I was able to get ready in about 10 minutes and rush to the wedding, however Qantas then said they wouldn't pay the reimbursement because I had arrived at my 'home port'. They have reduced their customer service, baggage handling and don't reimburses customers for expenses incurred due to their poor service.

### "Immensely disappointed"
I am an Australian so I bought the ticket to support the airline, but was disappointed. Never again will I fly with Qantas. Immensely disappointed, I upgraded our seats to have extra leg room, but what we got for the extra money was a lounge room in front of us (people hanging around for hours chatting and stretching for hours, they were not asked to move on at all). We paid extra for these seats and for what? and also there in front of us was the staff cabin box which was constantly been locked and unlocked too frequently throughout the flight so we hardly slept. The table was awkwardly small. I asked for a blanket (didn't get one). I was cold, uncomfortable and constantly distracted. It was the worse flight I have ever been on in my whole entire life.

### "nice flight attendants"
Qantas is a very good airline that is very practical service really, nice flight attendants, absolutely great lounge, entertainment, seating and is just overall very good for an airline.

### "We are so disappointed"
Not Verified |  On 11 September 2022, I booked flights to Bali for myself and my partner using my Qantas Frequent Flyer Points – I was given a booking confirmation and reservation number  for Jetstar flight departing 12 May 2023. On 7 February 2023, I received an email from Qantas advising of an updated departure to our flights which I had to accept online which I did. The day prior to our flight we checked our Qantas App, which was showing the flights with no further changes, we were unable to check in on line as it was a Jetstar flight which we were aware of. The morning of our flight, we arrived early at the Jetstar check in, whilst checking in we were advised by the Jetstar staff that we owed $1050 for our flights. Clearly very confused we showed them our booking reference and our Qantas App which the flights were clearly there. We were informed by Jetstar that this was a Qantas issue, that we would need to speak with Qantas but at 4am no one from Qantas was around and that if we wanted to get on that flight, we would need to pay the $1050! As I was flying to Bali to meet my entire family for my 50th Birthday, we had no choice but to use the money we had saved for the holiday and pay the fare. When the Qantas lounge opened, I went to speak with a staff member on the service desk, they could clearly see the booking and let me take a screen shot they were unable to explain what had happened and told me to phone the customer service line when I got back to Australia. Upon returning from Bali, I attempted to phone the Qantas Customer Service line, after 2 hours on hold my call was answered and I was advised that I needed to lodge the claim online. I did this and a week later received a two line email saying that no ticket was issued and apologised for the inconvenience but no refund would be provided. I do not know how you can get a booking reference, emails advising of updates to flights and to accept them to then be told you owe $1050. We are so disappointed but grateful I guess that we had saved some money for the holiday that we could use to at least get there to spend time with my family.

### "has become a national embarrassment"
QANTAS has become a national embarrassment and no longer deserves to be known as Australia’s flagship carrier. While posting billions in post pandemic profits I wanted to share what my recent experience of a Qantas flight looks like from a customer perspective. But firstly on a positive note thank you Qantas my luggage and I arrived on time and safely in Brisbane always a plus but that’s where any positive news ends. The seats are amongst the narrowest I’ve seen and unfortunately the seat in front of me appears to have been broken resulting in the passenger in front spending the entirety of the trip virtually sleeping in my lap to the extent that I had to tilt the screen to continue watching the inflight entertainment which is outdated and limited in choice compared to carriers such as Emirates and Qatar. The food service was a laughing stock, who serves a paddle pop and a Lindor ball and considers that as appropriate anywhere but a 5 year olds birthday party this was on the flight to Singapore. After the food service there was no drink service as the crew ensconced themselves at the rear of the plane with the curtain drawn making it feel intrusive to seek out a water after a limbo dance to extract yourself from the passenger in fronts reclined seat. An hour before landing passengers were served a pastry that resembled something you would find 3 days down the track in the pie Beaumaris at 7/11. This was the final leg on my trip from Europe so my welcome back home flight which was purchased on codeshare on an Airfrance booking after I was unable to use a 1k Qantas flight credit from a cancelled US flight from 2020. The quote from QANTAS for a return flight to Paris economy using the flight credit was 8k solo and I have now waited 3 years for my flight refund it seems ironic that I ended up on this codeshare flight when I was not able to book an equivalent flight with Qantas direct Avoid this airline at all costs

### "a complete shortage of meals"
Qantas was disappointing. It is considered a top airline, but my first experience with them on a Brisbane to Los Angeles trip was underwhelming. The plane was old and lacked adapters for charging devices, with only one USB port. Additionally, the entertainment options were limited. When requesting a drink, the crew would often bring just a can without a cup or ice, which was inconvenient. The dinner consisted of lamb with mashed potatoes, but the meat was chewy and the taste was unpleasant. The meal lacked accompanying items like bread, butter, salad, or dessert. For breakfast, served an hour before landing, the crew informed the last three rows that hot meals had run out, offering only granola and yogurt instead. This was surprising and not ideal, as I have never encountered a complete shortage of meals on a flight before. Considering the extra cost I paid for Qantas and my expectation of excellent customer service, I found their performance to be subpar compared to other airlines I have flown with.

### "delayed on each way of our trip"
Not Verified | Flights were delayed on each way of our trip, lost about 6 hours total. On the way back Qantas delayed our flight and gave us vouchers for food/drink. When we went to use these the restaurant did not accept these and said it was an ongoing issue with Qantas. We were right next to the Qantas concierge and we complained and they advised could not resolve and we had to contact Qantas customer care to complain. We are now down $45 USD for food/drinks that we would not have purchased. None of this would have been necessary if the flight was on time - never again! !

### "Never fly with them!"
Not Verified |  The worst experience withMy friends and I were booking flights to Perth. We had booked a one-way flight for $350 and the next day we saw a Qantas deal for $175 each way if you were paying return. My friend called Qantas if we could cancel that flight and book under the deal. They said we will give you a credit for your flight and you can book the deal with the credit but we had to do it online. We attempted to do so and it said we would have to call to apply for the credit. The next person we spoke to said no you can't use the credit for this. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls of multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. My return flight became a separate booking as I was returning to Adelaide a day sooner so I had to call separately. At one point I had agreed to pay a gap of $40 to change the flights and asked to confirm that I would not be charged a full new fair they said yes only $40 and then hung up on me and proceeded to take $350 out of my bank account with no permission. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls from multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. We all had the flights confirmed in the Qantas app and it said the credit was in our accounts. I never received any information to say I owed additional money, no emails, no calls and nothing in my online account or app. We were able to check in to the airport using the app for our flight into Perth and had no issues. When I was in Perth, I attempted to check in for my return flight to which it said I was checked in but would have to collect a boarding pass from the service desk at the airport. I called to see if there were any issues. It was at this point while I was in another state that they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay another $309 to get home. I said that is not accurate but they refused to help so I went to the airport the following day to hopefully speak to someone in person. The lady at the desk provided me with another terrible experience saying she could do nothing and I would have to call the reservations line again to sort it out. I said the flight leaves in an hour and it takes 40 minutes of being on hold before I can get through so she after making a big fuss called them herself. The whole time she mocked me to who she was on the phone with directly in front of me. When I showed them the deal I booked and gave them the booking code that I had been provided they refused and said it wasn't valid. They said just because it said 'confirmed' in my app meant that I had a booking but I had to now pay for a ticket. I said if you listen to the recordings of the conversation you can hear them say they would honour the deal and it was all sorted, they then said no this will have been deleted now and the notes say something different. I said I had no additional funds to pay for a ticket to get home because their company told me the deal would be honoured. They refused and boarding was closing in 5 minutes so I was forced to borrow money from a family member to pay for the ticket. I asked for her full name which she refused. I asked for the name of the person on the phone and she said 'no I can't remember' despite using it multiple times in the call and seemed to know them very well. I asked for her employee number, she refused. Never fly with them!

### "experience was absolutely awful"
The experience was absolutely awful. We had multiple delays, no explanation, and ended up adding 12+ hours of delay to our trip. We had to spend lots of extra money trying to find accommodation and change rental car plans. We asked customer service for any kind of meal voucher or taxi refund (we had to pay $50 for a taxi to get to our new hotel due to the delay) but they plainly said no. If the delay was caused by weather, understandable. But it had something to do with their crews, schedule, etc. I am never flying with them again! I am using my extra $ for a better airline because Qantas will make me pay extra anyways caused by numerous unexplained delays!

### "the service was shocking"
This is the worst experience I have had with Qantas and in Sydney Airport. The food was terrible and the service was shocking, particularly being 7 months pregnant with no assistance from staff. Not only that, we had to wait at the gate for an hour before we could get off the aircraft despite landing. Then luggage took over an hour to arrive which made the transport I organised useless. All this due to the lack of preparation from the airline and airport. Ruined what should have been a joy to come home.

### "Didn't find the crew very friendly"
Not Verified | Very disappointed. Didn't find the crew very friendly. We flew from London to Singapore and Singapore to Brisbane. Two weeks later did the return trip. On all flights I found unfriendly crew. Not enough leg room on a 14 hour flight. Charger port for mobile phones didn't work in our 3 seats. Found the plane was in need of good maintenance. Flew same route in 2019 and was definitely a better experience.

### "Never again Qantas"
Not Verified |  I returned home from Norfolk Island to Sydney on Feb.10,2023 travelling business class. On arrival at Sydney when I went to collect my mobility walker I found it damaged and completely unusable as well as unsafe. I do not know what the baggage handlers did to it but it collapsed on me as soon as I started walking.Went5 to baggage claims, waited 10 minutes while struggling to stand, for a lady to give me forms to complete. It is now May 15 2023 and i still have had no response from Qantas despite 2 emails and 2 phone calls to them. I am definitely not happy with "Australia's best airline" and will never fly with them again and I have advised family & friends to boycott as well. The service on our outward flight from Sydney 7 days earlier was also terrible. I can only assume from reading other reviews that Qantas does not seem to care anymore about its customers. Never again Qantas.

### Qantas Airways customer review
When booking my ticket I applied the wrong date (autofilled by my laptop). I immediately noticed and changed the booking (incurring a $198 change fee). The Qantas website advises that if you 'make a mistake' you can change to the correct date 'before midnight' and have no change fee. I called Qantas immediately, the representative agreed with my assessment and advised me to lodge a claim. Nine months later an investigation has decided to decline my refund of change fee! (going against Qantas's own policy) no explanation given.

### "No customer service whatsoever"
Qantas has gone from best to worst airline in the world. To be avoided at all costs. No customer service whatsoever. Promised to reply to our generous bid for upgrades. No reply. Upon complaining they said we applied for wrong leg of flight. When confronted with evidence, they said flight was full.

### "not be flying with Qantas again"
The Qantas aircraft on the shorter legs (only approximately 8 hours) between Brisbane and Singapore was an A330. We had no complaints about the seats or the service provided on this flight. It was a entirely different story on the longer (14 hours) legs between London and Singapore on their supposedly prestigious QF1 and QF2 route. The A380 seating was of the standard you might experience on short haul budget airlines. Uncomfortable, no legroom, flimsy construction with the reclining position difficult to control. With the seats in the fully reclined position, which was most of the time on these overnight flights, it was very difficult to get in and out of your seat. It would appear that Qantas have packed the maximum number of rows of seats into the A380 to generate maximum revenue with no thought to the comfort and well being of the passengers. I certainly will not be flying with Qantas again.

### "disgraceful and filthy travel experience"
Sydney to Christchurch on 20th April 2023 and never have I experienced such a disgraceful and filthy travel experience as that which I along with other passengers were forced to endure during this flight. Flight QF137 delayed for over 1 hour. Flight entertainment not working throughout the journey. Blood or food on seat-belt clip. Chewing gum on back of seat. Second rate substandard food, simply disgusting. Recline button on seat not working. Dirty floor, worn and stained seat. Temperature control not working stuck on cold, which made it uncomfortable for the entire flight. Dirty tray table. Grubby and dirty magazine. Luggage left in the rain on the tarmac in Sydney during the delayed flight, resulting most of my cloth's being wet once they were retrieved in Christchurch. This is an international flight albeit only from Sydney to Christchurch. This is not only reflected in the fare but the additional time required to transit through customs and security etc as a passenger. I will think carefully before I choose to fly Qantas again as I know that you can do better. Finally it saddens me to see how the high standard of service and quality that Qantas was known for has been eroded to below that of Ryan Air. Clearly the plane had not been cleaned properly in a quite sometime and should never have been used for an International flight or for any flight for that matter under the Qantas brand.

### "please look after your passengers"
Requested three halal meals but when it came to flight attendant service, they say there is no halal meal on the list. Next time please look after your passengers. Don’t want deal with Qantas anymore.

### "Will not deal with Qantas again"
They are terrible. The worst. Flights cancelled night before. On phone all day. And at the airport. Paid for upgrade didn't get that. Airlines is no help. I wasn't even offered a refund but a 'credit' yes that's what I would like to do pay to be inconvenienced. Ridiculous. Will not deal with Qantas again

### "saw that my bag had been smashed"
The trip, staff and checking in were fine. However, when I claimed my checked in bag and headed towards the taxi rank, I found that my 4 wheeled, hard case bag was not performing properly. Upon arrival at my hotel for the night, I saw that my bag had been smashed and one wheel had been broken off. It seems that the bag may have been opened, since the attached combination lock has disappeared but there was no sticker indicating that it had been opened. The bag was as new before putting it through baggage check-in. This is very disappointing, not to mention being costly to me. I watched the baggage being unloaded from my seat. The handlers were certainly not being gentle with anyone’s luggage.

### "Service was equally dismal"
Not Verified |  Qantas are currently flying their first class configured A380’s to and from Hong Kong, although they are not selling first class. Instead premium frequent flyers who have booked business class are given the option to select available seats in first class. Good thing they are not selling first class. Seats were worn and some functionality was inoperable. Service was equally dismal with cabin crew reminding passengers that despite sitting in the first class section, we should only expect business class service. Fair enough but this excuse was rolled out whenever someone asked for something basic. This aircraft should have been refurbished before being brought back in to service.

### "Check in was easy and quick"
I enjoyed the trip. Check in was easy and quick. Departure was on time and the staff were friendly and helpful. The snacks offered could have been more substantial, but I guess it wasn't too bad for a short flight.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I enjoyed the flight. There was a slight delay, but arrival time was only slightly delayed. Despite the Easter Rush on Good Friday, check in was easy. The snacks offered for the flight was minimal, but not too bad for a 2 hour flight. Free beer was much appreciated. Staff were friendly.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Plane left on time and arrived early. Service was cheerful and included an apple in lieu of biscuit. The plane was a bit tired and obviously no AV but a very pleasant experience.

### "Flight date moved"
Not Verified | Flight date moved. Notice given to a different date. Flight time change Flight time then delayed over 6 hours - we had children with disabilities. Flying the direct route Perth to London to Newcastle flight had to be changed. Made a complaint to Qantas and asked for refund as flights were so delayed. We were told varying stories in emails but none were accurate. Continue to chase Qantas about their policy over changed and delayed flights without success.

### "I will continue flying with them"
I travel with Qantas extensively. The crew are pretty awesome and we get good service. This flight was no exception. Champagne offered, good selection of wines and spirits, tasty food served with a friendly smile and good humour. I also had a huge choice of what to watch. I will continue flying with them.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience ever. I am diabetic and the airline refused to offer me any drinks or food. During the purchase of my ticket I asked my travel agent to make sure meal was included and I was informed halal was not an option anymore. I requested to have vegetarian instead. During my flight they offered meals to other passengers while I sat there with nothing to eat. They did not offer me any hot drinks. If the airline can't offer halal at least have vegetarian options available on the flight. I hope this is taken seriously.

### "Very disappointed in Qantas"
This was my worst travel experience with Qantas, I flew with them before but their quality seems to be going downhill, I flew to Singapore via Brisbane, I was only informed at the airport that my flight from Brisbane to Singapore was delayed 8hours! No prior notification received through email or even their own app whatsoever. When I landed in Brisbane, at least they could have given me vouchers or something or access to their airport lounge for such a long delay. Very disappointed in Qantas.

### "worst customer service communication"
The worst airline to exist. We were supposed to fly Tokyo to Auckland via Sydney on a Friday night at 10pm. There were a lot of things wrong about our flight. When the online check-in opened, their system only checked in one of the two passengers for the Sydney to Auckland flight. Their system said “Check in at Airport” - which was fine. Five hours before the flight, they sent a message that our flight has been cancelled. One hour later, they retracted and said your flight is not cancelled. When I reached the airport, the staff tried to check me in for the Sydney to Auckland flight but their system won’t let her. They advised that I should just check in with the staff upon reaching Sydney. After the staff gave us our boarding ticket, they advised that the aircraft need to refuel in Brisbane, so the aircraft will make a stop, refuel, we don’t need to get out of the aircraft, before flying to Sydney. Mid-flight, the pilot announced we are terminating in Brisbane and that we need to pick up our luggage even if we have onward flight. Now the problem here is that we don’t have a landing permit to enter Australia. When we got to Brisbane, we told the ground crew our situation and she assured us that she will “personally” pick up our luggage and retag it herself (her exact words). She told us that they are working on rebooking us and that we should just wait at the gate. When we got to the gate, since there were no Qantas flights yet, there weren’t any staff around. I tried to check with the staff in Business Lounge about our boarding pass. She found out that I am still not checked in and also they cannot find our luggage. A few minutes before our boarding time, the staff for the boarding gate finally arrived. She was able to check me in but they still cannot locate our luggage. She raised a ticket for us and said, just see if your luggage might reach Auckland once you get there. When we reached Auckland, to no surprise at all, our luggage wasn’t there. We were travelling domestically across other parts of New Zealand so we asked to send to our hotel where we were staying the longest. We had to buy clothes for a few days to prepare for the worst. I called up the airline baggage services in Australia, Japan and Auckland - either no one picks up or they ask me to call another office or just apologize. We stayed for a week in New Zealand and no news from Qantas. On the day before we fly back to Tokyo, Auckland’s lost luggage staff called us and told us that they have our luggage. When we picked up the luggage from the office, it’s been sitting in Auckland the whole time since the day after we arrived in the city. Bag was retagged but Qantas didn’t bother to update their system for easy tracking?! Now in the present day, they earlier told us they will compensate but later on another customer service staff is saying they will not. Clearly something wrong with their communication even internally. Anyway, long story short - worst airline, worst customer service communication, and thanks to them Qantas they ruined our first visit to Oceania. Don’t believe in their positive advertising, I really think they should come with a warning. Side Note: While we were on our trip, they keep emailing us to upgrade to Business class and pay them more money. The audacity is beyond!

### "dealt us 5 significant delays"
OOL-SYD-MEL dealt us 5 significant delays over two unrelated flights. It was a series of delays that had my phone buzzing relentlessly with flight changes. I have never experienced disorganisation to this extent in 40 years of domestic and international air travel. Cabin crew on the 4 flights (the reverse of the sequence on the way up), were lovely to deal with, but showed annoying inconsistencies in training. They were minor issues, but there were different and unrelated rules on two of the four flights, which is something I’ve not come across before. They need to present with consistency or people like me wonder what other faults are lurking regarding safety training. I hated this trip because of the airline experience and would have much preferred to have stayed home.

### "worst of the worst airline"
The worst of the worst airline. More than 7 out of 10 flights are delayed or cancelled on this route. They dont tell you until you are at the airport so your left sitting around. My wife was delayed over 7 hours 2 days ago. I got to airport only to be told i am delayed.

### "experience couldn't have been better"
My experience couldn't have been better. Before boarding we used the Qatar Airways Lounge in Bangkok which is simply the best. Boarding was well organised. The crew were welcoming and the seat ready with pj's, blanket and seat cover. The Champagne was cold and the food was really good. I slept for 5 hours and had a light breakfast before arrival. What more could I have asked for?

### "never fly Qantas again"
Business class booking, my seat was covered in hairs, pillows and blankets too, food was disgusting, champagne low quality. Cabin crew couldn't care less about customers experience. Arrived at Melbourne Airport my Rimowa bag was totally smashed, unable to use the wheels, couldn't take public transport to my families home 150km from the airport due to luggage damage. I was stuck abandomed at the airport alone a single female traveller No choice but to rent a car at the airport which put me out of pocket $500. Customer responsibility is below 0. Compensation offered 5000 Qantas frequent flyer points to the equivalent of AUD$45.00. This airline needs to take accountability for high paying flyers, I will never fly Qantas again as a tourist visiting Australia.

### "not travel next time with Qantas"
Delhi airport Qantas ground staff unprofessional and rude. Flight delay 1 hour from Delhi and then 7 hours delay from Melbourne, really struggling with kids and they just gave only 15$ voucher to spend 7 hours on Melbourne Airport. I will not travel next time with Qantas. They need to improve there customer service.

### "incompetence and indifference"
Not Verified |  This review relates to frustrations relating to QANTAS not adding frequent flyer points to my account. In early February, I flew with Royal Air Maroc from Madrid to Casablanca in Y class. Royal Air Maroc and Qantas are partners in the One World Alliance. My qantas FF number was entered when I booked my RAM flight and was on the boarding pass too. Qantas have now rejected my evidence yeice even though they have had a copy of the reservation and a copy of the boarding pass too. I had similar issues when trying to have flights with IBERIA added to my account and one BA flight too. RAM staff have been helpful and inform me that I am correct and that QANTAS should add the missing points! Qantas seem to have outsourced their customer services to the Philippines from what I gather. It is very frustrating dealing with incompetence and indifference and clearly with those who do not want to apply rules fairly and by the book.

### "this flight was faultless"
Qantas has not been popular with it's home country recently, with some good reasons. Service has been lacking even before Covid. This experience though, has shown what this airline is capable of when it's got it's act together. Once it was underway this flight was faultless, professional and of the highest standard any air traveler in the world could want - and I've traveled on many Business class flights across the world with many airlines. Aircraft was clean, amenities were all there (including pyjamas in Business Class), service was genuine, friendly, helpful, highly professional, menu was perfect and the food was truly excellent. Lounge was very good before departure. Negatives: a long wait (45 mins) for Business class check-in, departure delayed an hour late which meant missed connections and extra long transits. Qantas is relatively expensive. Tip: keep your boarding pass and baggage check long after your flight, just in case. I had to put in claims for missing points.

### "genuinely gone downhill"
My wife was 27wks pregnant when we boarded our transit flight from Bali to Sydney, we were able to board early and my wife went to the rear of the cabin and asked the crew if she could potentially get a row to herself. She asked only IF after boarding and there was a row available. A no would have been fine but the female crew member at the rear of the flight rudely said no and then as my wife turned to come back to our seats she heard the crew mumble under her breath "as if we'd give it to you anyway". Absolutely disgusting behavior and pathetic treatment. Qantas has genuinely gone downhill, I am ashamed to call it my national airline. Shame on you Qantas, charging ridiculous prices and making record profits while providing pathetic service.

### "business class seat was comfy"
Good flight with a good crew and good food. I wish there was better information at the gate about the delays, but overall it was a pleasant experience. The business class seat was comfy, there were pyjamas provided (unfortunately way too large) and food and wine were very good for a flight.

### "Qantas canceled the flights"
Qantas canceled the flights. They provided only one alternative option requiring a visa. When I pointed it out, they charged an extra 820AUD to have a rescheduled flight without a visa requirement. But they lost my other tickets. I was trying to persuade them for two hours until I got my tickets back. But these flights were canceled again. You can't speak with someone in Melbourne airport. They say to call the hotline and wait for an hour until a rude operator will refuse to solve your issue

### "Every flight has been changed"
Not Verified | I have not taken my flight yet. It was scheduled form the summer of 2023. I had four flights with Qantas because we are touring Australia this summer. I booked a year in advance and planned every detail. Every flight with them has been changed by the airlines. One flight dropped the second leg of our trip. To make a long story short, I had to cancel every flight and book with someone else. I had to change transfers, accommodations and excursions due to limited new options. To make it worse, I am now fighting for my refunds, $1000's is now on my credit card due to the delay in refunds. This company is horrible and can not be trusted. I have spend countless hours trying to get their mess fixed.

### "still waiting for an answer"
I took a flight to Italy and the way back to Brisbane in December. My suitcase was new and when I reached Brisbane I discovered was damaged in the way that is not possible use anymore. I straight contact Qantas and I have been asked some pictures and receipts. I send everything and I didn’t receive any answer. So, I again contacted the customer service, they apologies and they asked other documents. I send back the documents and I didn’t receive any answer again. I contacted for the third time the customer service and I am still waiting for an answer. It’s been more than 3 weeks. I am really surprised, I never expected to have this kind of service on a 3000$ flight.

### "service was poor"
This must be the prime business route for Qantas and very important for them, given all the options now available with other airlines. The service was poor, well meaning staff but chaotically managed, the food on this (and other stages) was nondescript and unattractively served. Long delays between courses and collecting up. No help offered with preparing bedding etc.. The whole experience emphasised how, by comparison, BA has managed to spruce up and recover its business service standards and is for the moment an incomparably better way of getting to and from Australia.

### "Qantas managing to lose baggage"
A simple non-stop flight from AKL to SYD result in Qantas managing to lose baggage. After multiple calls and baggage not being located for 3 days they said that we may purchase some clothes and submit receipt through their website to claim back the expense. This was done, and then nothing is heard from Qanats for 3+ weeks. A follow up phone call to Qantas so called customer service line (wait time 20 mins to get through) would not allow me to speak to the baggage department to get me an update, instead they put me on hold for several minutes and then the same lady told me they had "expedited" my query. When I asked what this meant and when I could expect a response, I was told, as soon as possible. When I probed this for her to actually give me a time line she would not do it, I asked if I could expect the query to be resolved this year, she couldn't even give me that assurance.

### "failed at every step of the way"
Qantas failed at every step of the way. Flight was cancelled - leaving us stranded without airport transport. Replacement flight added a stop over - extra 90min of travel. Replacement flight was delayed. Connecting flight (from added stop over) was missed - extra hour of travel. Lost half of our luggage

### "extremely rude and unhelpful"
I flew from Sydney to Manila with Qantas on 24/02/2023. When my partner and I arrived in Manila, there was no sign of one of cases. It seems that the lady at checkin never checked one of our bags on properly as there are only 3/4 bags listed on our receipt, although we handed over 4. We have been trying to get an answer since Friday, we called, we sent several emails, we sent reports, we spoke to live bots, to no avail. We are moving country and all of our belongings are in this case. We are just trying to get an answer and no one is giving it to us. The service has been appalling since we landed at checkin at the Qantas gate of Sydney airport. Staff are just extremely rude and unhelpful! This is supposed to be Australia’s #1 airline?? I have received much better service from budget airlines. Absolute joke. I would strongly advise against choosing this airline.

### "lacking in customer service skills"
Ground staff and flight staff were rude and more interested in their own interactions than looking after customers. Ground staff were disorganised and flustered. They took their frustrations out on customers. Both the ground staff and flight staff were lacking in customer service skills and behaved like customers were an inconvenience rather than the Airlines core business. This is so unfortunate and I find it an embarrassment for how foreign visitors are treated. Qantas has for many years been too casual and aloof in their customer interactions. They can learn a lot from the Asian carriers. Additionally Qantas smashed our checked luggage so the case is no longer usable. Baggage Services at the airport said yes it was an obvious issue and Qantas would look after it. After submitting the damage and Baggage Services reference number to Qantas they replied saying they do not cover dents, scratches or normal wear and tear. Photo shows what they consider a scratch.

### "Absolute shambles"
Absolute shambles. My flights from Wellington to Los Angeles were voided without my consent. I received a text message on 19th February asking me to check in via the Qantas website. When I tried to do so on the webpage using my booking reference. However, it said that I needed to go to the airport to check in. On Feburary 19th, I went to the Wellington airport. Two employees working for the contractor company that works for Qantas at the airport tried to provide me with my tickets. However, they were told by the ticketing department that my flights had been voided. The person in the ticketing department claimed the flight had been voided by American Airlines, their partner airline. On 1 December I was surprised to receive a partial refund of around 177NZD, a fraction of the approx. 1705 NZD I had paid for the flights. This made no sense as I had asked Qantas several times via email and over the phone to specify what the refund was for in November 2022 without receiving an answer from them. In November I had asked them to change my flight date and paid them to process this request. On February 19th, I was asked to call the Qantas hotline as the employees at the airport were unable to help me. To my disbelief the hotline staff told me that they would not reissue the tickets nor provide a full refund. I absolutely do not recommend this airline. If you want to make any changes to your flight dates be prepared to spend hours on their hotline if you are flying internationally. I don't wish anyone to go through the saga I am going through with them. I am almost 2000NZD out of pocket because of the mistakes that have been made. I still have not received an answer from them nor a full refund and compensation.

### "Please wake up Qantas"
Perfunctory. Interesting word. One applicable to this flight service from CGK to SYD. I don’t know what’s happened with QANTAS since the pandemic, but for sure there has been a major decline in onboard service. My issues don’t stem from no welcome and totally ignored - even as Oneworld Emerald (dwelling on that would seem petty and entitled) rather on the following - no amenity kits for economy. Look on an overnight flight you would expect eye shades and a tooth brush. Nine given out and none in the pockets of my row - no coffee or tea served before landing. On a “red eye” flight the cabin lights come on usually an hour before landing- coffee is normally served. Nothing this flight I wouldn’t mind if this was AirAsia but I am paying almost $1500 for a Cgk-syd-wgn trip. Small things indeed count. Please wake up Qantas - having flown recently on your One World partners Cathay, Qatar and JAL I can assure you you’re being left way, way behind

### "they just don't care"
Not Verified |  Absolutely useless. Late flight, luggage left behind, zero customer service. They just don't care, no refund or credit for taking exit door seats away. What once a great airline is now the world's worst. Do not fly Qantas they just don't care.

### "I have made the move to Virgin"
Not Verified |  Have been a Qantas Frequent Flyer since 1997 but also flown with them well before then both domestically and internationally. Due to their high prices my employer has been booking my flights with Virgin and I found them second to none in both hospitality and service. After all these years with Qantas I have made the move to Virgin as the Qantas service, hospitality, and condition of terminals and lounges is nothing less than the dark ages.

### "The worst customer service I've ever encountered"
Qantas cancelled our flight two years ago and still has not refunded us the hundreds of dollars in excess baggage we paid for. I've spoken to them about this many times, and they don't deny they owe us the money, they just say someone will get back to us about it, and no one ever does. Any time I phone they say they have no record of any of the hours and hours I've spent on the phone with them before, and say they need all the information again. If I have a reference number from the last call, when I call again they say the number doesn't refer to anything and they have no record of the case. The worst customer service I've ever encountered, and it's cost us money we couldn't spare - but they really don't care. Avoid at all costs.

### "service was calm, efficient and friendly"
I flew Qantas Sydney to Melbourne return. The flights were punctual. The service was calm, efficient and friendly. The meals in Business were hot and delicious. It looks like Qantas is back to its old self after the COVID disruption. Well done.

### "hate having to fly with them now"
We had one of our bags badly damaged on a flight in June 2022 and contacted Qantas customer care. After a few emails and pictures they sent us an email in July 2022 staying the replacement bag has been ordered and we will receive it shortly. After 7 months and many emails to Qantas I have no replacement bag and not a single reply from them. I called the booking line today and the lady there did a bit of digging and found out my case had been closed and she cannot look into it, she advised me to open a whole new case and reference my old case number. So I started the process all over again, maybe it might get sorted before 2024. Qantas is a joke and I hate having to fly with them now. We need more airlines to make them wake up and sort out their customer service, or lack of it.

### "we had such a great steward"
We went to Canberra for a funeral and on the flight back we had such a great steward Johno such a happy person with a great personality, making everyone feel so welcome. Nothing was a problem, even though it was a short flight he was the best, see you again Qantas

### Qantas Airways customer review
Flew from Launceston to Sydney with Qantas and on to Christchurch with Air NZ. First flight was delayed which meant I almost missed my transfer. Traveling with bike bag which didn't make the transfer. Finally arrived 2 days later in a condition that the bag is no longer usable. Traveling with friends who also had bike and out of the 7 who returned to NZ not one bike made it back on the original flight. If you have options to fly with another airline I would suggest you do even if the cost is greater.

### "Qantas staff are so inconsiderate"
Not Verified |  Qantas vouchers are useless. Qantas had kindly given us a voucher to access the Singapore lounge in April 2022. After spending a few difficult days in Singapore, with their tight restrictions on everything and no internet connection, we were looking forward to chilling out in the Qantas Lounge before our flight home. Unfortunately, the voucher was only for myself and my wife, so Qantas staff refused to allow our two daughters into the lounge. Considering how few people were travelling last year, it was shocking that our kids couldn't come with us to relax in the lounge for a few hours. So how could we use the voucher? leave our kids outside? Qantas staff are so inconsiderate. I will choose any other airline first, even if it costs more, for the rest of my life.

### "one of the worst flights"
Not Verified |  It was one of the worst flights I ever had, 6 hours delay without any explanation. A 15 dollar meal voucher is a joke, what do you get for 15 $ at the airport. Onboard service is just as bad meals are tiny for international flights. Tried to upgrade return flights 8 days before with my frequent flyer points, no success but it was available with cash payment. What a joke what a disappointment. I would newer ever use this airline again

### "Disgraceful, so disappointed"
Disgraceful, so disappointed in Qantas. On a recent flight home my wife (25w pregnant) went to the rear of the cabin during boarding and kindly asked if there were any rows free after boarding is she could please use the row to lie down or at least stretch out. The female cabin crew member sarcastically told her the flight was full and then when my wife turned back to walk to her seat she heard the crew member mutter something to the affect of "you wouldn't get it anyway" or "why would we give it to you". A nearby passenger heard this comment too! Absolutely disgusting behavior, we did try and buy the Business Class but it sold out too fast and my wife was struggling with the seats we were given. The only reason I didn't go back and give this stupid cabin crew a piece of my mind was because my wife is far too nice and didn't want to risk getting kicked off the flight. That rude incident aside, the seats were filthy with food scraps everywhere and also the meal tray was absolutely filthy! Glad we brought our own wet wipes, honestly disgusting bread crumbs and hair still on the trays. Qantas has honestly gone downhill and the CEO has no idea whatsoever. Embarrassed to say Qantas is our national airline. For those who have heard about Qantas, just know it is not the Qantas it once was, please avoid and fly Virgin. Overall rating 1/10 - 1 point for getting me home!

### "dissatisfied with the lack of service"
The cabin service and the meal was poor as well as being inconsiderate to the person sitting beside me. Firstly, the usual glass of wine was not available on departure. They ran out of meal choice when they reached my row. The person beside was an elderly woman of her way home to Scotland. She did not like the noodles that were the only offer as the meal. She asked for an alternative. An economy class meal was offered. It had not arrived after about an hour. At this point my elderly neighbour gave up and told the steward she no longer wanted the meal. The manager then came as the woman complained about the lack of service. The manager talked down to the elderly woman telling her you don't always get the meal you want. The woman was continuing on from Brisbane on an Emirates flight to Scotland. She tells me she flies Business Class every year to New Zealand. She was happy to know that her next trip later this year will not require a flight on Qantas as Emirates will be flying all the way to NZ. I very rarely fly Qantas choosing other airlines. It is only out of necessity will I consider them again. Their treatment of this elderly woman was appalling and I was also dissatisfied with the lack of service and poor quality of the meal.

### "Qantas has become the worst"
Flight was delayed, no reasons given - we just sat there. Finally boarded and the tray tables were filthy with hair and grime from previous flight. Also the entertainment was pathetic. I've been on Wizz Air flights with better choices. Also the food was rubbish, small plastic container for the food and it tasted really bad. Cheaper airlines have more better food. Qantas has become the worst.

### "an under expectation experience"
It was a bit of an under expectation experience, the seats were smaller compared to other airlines for the same class, they served cold chicken and rice. Check-in, cabin crews, cleanliness and entertainment were good enough.

### "can't wait to to travel with Qantas again"
Not Verified |  I traveled through QF69 from Melbourne to Delhi on 26/01/2023. The crew on this flight went above and beyond to make sure it is a pleasant experience for all passengers. They were caring towards elders and children specially. They always greeted us with a lovely smile and did all they can to make it a delightful experience. I have traveled previously as well but this experience was definitely "5 stars". I could not have hoped for such a fantastic experience. It is my first experience with Qantas and definitely I will always consider Qantas as my first choice. Thanks so much for getting us such a fine team. Please do keep up to support them so they can keep their best foot forward. Loved my experience this time and can't wait to to travel with Qantas again on 6th March back to Melbourne through QF70.

### "meals were tiny and pathetic"
Not Verified |  Qantas has shockingly declined. The meals were tiny and pathetic. Staff were ok but flight to Melbourne was over an hour late. Qantas has declined. I used to love them but now I won’t choose them again. The meals were honestly a joke

### "waited a year for our first business class experience"
Plane delayed 5 hours, first notification when 10mins from airport. Spent 5.5 hours in Business Class lounge, packed. Food for the full 5.5 hours was three hot dishes, rice, butter chicken, pumpkin soup. Four salads, one being a tub of lettuce, sweets being two stale frozen cakes possibly Sara Lea. Bread rolls and butter (which ran out after two hrs). The menu did not change from lunch to dinner. One coffee station, one food station, others closed or needing repair. The overall lounge is shabby and uncomfortable chairs. We waited a year for our first business class experience and this was it. Once at board staff were welcoming but being served dinner at midnight was not enjoyable. Madly trying to contact pick up in Singapore, nightmare.

### "warm and hearty service2
I am flying first morning Qantas flight #605 from Brisbane to Melbourne in business. Very solid airport experience with premium entrance, secure check and lounge in the same business class wing. Lounge is not cramped, barista coffee, basic breakfast, but tasty croissants and fresh juice from a wide selection of fruits and vegetables. A 20 y.o. Boeing 737 is a disappointment, but warm and hearty service from Julianne  is amazing with a lot of food, wine, sparkling wine and fresh orange juice.

### "not service orientated"
The Indian Vegan meals were delicious but the drinks were wanting, bottled water ran out around two hours after take off and the water dispenser in the galley is purified water. The crew was not service orientated which to me was surprising because I know Qantas cabin crew make more money than 95% of cabin crew worldwide. For example when I was given a small 330 ml. bottle of water a couple of minutes before receiving my meal I asked the air hostess for an extra bottle of water and was refused bluntly - she said that she must see that everyone gets one bottle and only if there are more available she will return to give me an extra one. She of course never returned. I discovered bottles were in the galley and free for anyone to take until they ran out two and half hours into the flight. The cabin was very cold and the crew never picked up anything from the floor during the flight. With the meals served without a tray rubbish tends to fall off the table and on the floor but the crew wasn't bothered. I give 7 out of 10 because the flight was cheap (for a one way), the connection at Changi Airport was fast and the food was great but in future unless the price is competitive I will probably prefer an Asian or Middle Eastern Airline.

### "service was painfully slow"
We have just completed a flight in business class with Qantas from Sydney to Queenstown New Zealand. If you value business class experience including enjoying a glass of wine and lunch at a leisurely pace read on. If you don't and you are just one of those who like a bigger seat and you read your book that's fine but this review will not help you. If Qantas was an Uber this would be 3 star trip with no tip. We had a very delightful crew who were completely unfocused on the business class ideal. We were given a champagne on arrival but was offered nothing till 1 hour 20 minutes after take off which was over halfway into the flight. In fact nothing was offered until the lunch service. There were only 12 people in business class but for whatever reason service was painfully slow and ruined the experience for us. We won't be submitting this review to help Qantas we will be changing airlines.

### "impossible to deal with"
We paid a premium price to fly Business Class from London Heathrow to Melbourne with a short stop over in Perth for refuelling . We were bumped off the plane and waited for six hours in Perth for a plane to arrive from Melbourne to allow us to continue our journey. Our plane was high jacked for a return flight to London . We arrived in Melbourne over Seven Hours late with no apology. In accordance with EU/GB departing plane legislation we submitted our legally entitled claim of £524 per person . Qantas Customer Service have been impossible to deal with and clearly obstructive . We have now submitted a complaint to the CAA

### "Did Qantas forget how to run an airline?"
Not Verified | Safety is great but timeliness is a close second on my book. On arrival at Honolulu it took over an hour for our bags to come out, causing us to miss a connecting flight. Departure is currently more than 3 hours late and counting. The latest excuse is the food is late being delivered. I don't know but there seems to be a real problem with the ground services in Honolulu. Did Qantas forget how to run an airline?

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
Honestly the worst airline I have ever flown with. Starting when they booked me on a Comair flight in August 2022 when the company was liquidated in May 2022. Then I missed all of my connecting flights because there were no flights out of Cape town to Johannesburg. After waiting 2 hours to get the issue sorted out I was eventually booked onto another flight the following day. While changing my flights they just decided to change my return flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. I initially had a 2 hour layover now I have a 6hour layover. Didn’t ask me if the could nor did they inform me they had changed it. Seats are so small and uncomfortable, the one staff member on the flight from Sydney was so rude. The entertainment is very average. Overall I would just never recommend them to anyone. Nor will I fly with them again.

### "never been treated with such disrespect"
Not Verified | I want to talk about service in business class aboard Flight QF 24 that left Bangkok to Sydney, Australia on Dec 26th 2022. My boyfriend and I travel very often, and ALWAYS get business class seats for not just the comfortable seating but most importantly the service and respect. This has been present in every flight we have ever taken, besides this one. We boarded the plane and everything was lovely; seats were nicely prepared and comfortable. We sat and got settled in when one of the staff came around with the normal complimentary champagne which was greatly appreciated. We even asked for a second glass before take off, and were given it no problem at all. Once the flight took off, we were waiting for the normal first class flight attendants to come around and refresh our beverages. We got nothing, only eyes gearing the other way from our seats while we were trying to get the attention from one of the three attendants servicing our area. So, we decided to wait patiently for an hour and a half from take-off when they came around asking what we would like for dinner. My boyfriend and I both asked our separate flight attendants for a refresher, which we were then told we had to wait till after dinner was served (Never have we ever been told no, or "wait" in first class) again, one of the reasons we chose to spend thousands on these special seats. Finally we got our second drink after 2 hours had passed at this point. I asked for a glass or champagne and wine, and was told by a male flight attendant, "you can only have one" while my boyfriend sat with two glasses next to me, and also before take-off we were given two glasses of champagne? That made no sense and felt extremely weird energy from the staff after this. He then came back and asked if I'd like that second drink now, and I responded “yes please” remaining respectful and grateful. As he comes back for the third time about 20-30 minutes after the second glass was poured, he offers me another drink, but throws in “would you like to start with a glass of water first?” I felt very uncomfortable that he offered me water, without me asking for it, and awkwardly accepted the water. I have never in my 8 years of flying business/first class been asked a question like he did, especially when I was completely reserved and respectful, not one bit out of character. And after he had said/acted this way towards me, the flight attendant that was servicing my boyfriend was approaching him to ask him if he'd like another drink as well. The staff quickly walked to the other side and whispered something in that employee's ear while he was in the middle of pouring my boyfriend a drink, and again, that flight attendant asked him “would you like a glass of water to start with?”. My boyfriend firmly said “No, I would not” as he was officially picking up on the disrespect and completely uncalled for attitude towards both of us. We both became extremely irritated and felt very welcomed and disrespected. We have flown on countless airlines, business/first class seats, and like I said earlier, have NEVER been treated with such disrespect and immatureness from first class flight attendants. We are both successful people and enjoy being treated with respect wherever we go, which is why, like I said, we spend our hard earned money to get that same treatment.

### "Not going to travel with Qantas again"
My flight seat was changed at the last moment right before boarding with no reasons told or with no explanation. I had opted for Indian vegetarian option, but airline has combined three veg options ( indian jain, vegan and indian vegetarian) meal into one category, which means that my version of vegetarian did not include any dairy products. My meal had no real fruits or natural sweets .. My meal had fruit pops, chocolates and very high sugar products. Staff was rude and did not offer anything to drink, one of the air hostess was too arrogant to ask , She asked all the time for everything from my co passengers but I have to ask her always for every thing including simple glass of water. My seat was quite tight to sit and the remote was not detachable so have to use the control on the screen. Not going to travel with Qantas again.

### "not give a damn about it's customers"
This company does not give a damn about it's customers! I was on a direct flight from Melbourne to Dallas and after Qantas delayed the flight by 6 hours they cancelled the flight. They kept everyone at the terminal for another 3 hours and just sent everyone home with a promise to try and re-book flights. They didn't bother getting in touch at all. I had to re-call and book my flights myself. They didn't even have a record to re-book my flights! It took 4 hours on the phone with them and constant call drop outs. Qantas will not offer any local support. You can never talk to an Australian representative. You can only deal with call centre workers in the Philippines that book flights. They can't and will not offer any customer care assistance. This airline is a complete joke. Absolutely the worst experience you can ever ask for.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines - journey started off well with staff on the ground at Johannesburg being so helpful Once on the flight, just a horrid experience. Food was atrocious - we practically got the same meal for supper and breakfast. To make it worse, somehow this airline cannot differentiate between vegetarian and vegan. The seats are very uncomfortable. The staff mediocre. The in-flight entertainment is so limited - under most headers, only 5 titles or less available (e.g. European section, Bollywood, etc.)

### "this airline just ignores you"
Please be very careful around lost baggage with this Airline. My bag was lost by Qantas on the 5th of December and now it's the 16th of December and the treatment I have received by this airline has been deplorable, I have had to fight for any information on my bag and when I receive the information it is all factually incorrect! No one will talk to me or call or email me back. We are given incorrect phone numbers to call, and I have even had a Travel Agent involved on my behalf and they are receiving the exact same treatment and false information! I have laid a compliant to no response I have called the baggage services 100's of times only to get reservations as they are sending calls to this department, then I am told why you are calling Reservations! I have emailed lost baggage again no response this airline just ignores you and simply does not care or will just resort to lies so you will go away! Be very warned with this Airline! Prepare to never see your property again and have insurance as I cannot even get info or help on lodging a claim for compensation. Qantas has torn me down in just under 2 weeks and I cannot fight this anymore.

### "turned into a 3 days nightmare"
Don't book with Qantas. We recently bought a return flight via their website with a connection from Sydney to Europe. This was the most expensive flight for our journey, but had the best connection each way. In the end, Qantas changed both our first flights, resulting in missing the connections on the way in and out. We ended up with a 24 hours connection on the way in and a 12 hour connection on the way out. What would have been a very long flight turned into a 3 days nightmare. Needless to say, Qantas did not offer a proper solution or any compensation at all. They just washed their hands and we've been treated as hostages, not customers.

### "Worst flight with Qantas"
Worst flight with Qantas. We used to fly Qantas quite often to Australia before covid, but my friends and I have had a terrible experience with Qantas on a recent trip to Bali. Our flight went via Sydney, which was delayed for an hour, by the time we made it to Sydney, we had to sprint to get to our connecting flight to Bali, our friends were told that there baggage had to be collected in Sydney to then be checked in for the flight to Bali - which made no sense, as it was an international transit. So half of us made it to the gate just in time, where we were met with rude staff, who blamed us for not telling our friends that they should have come straight to the gate as their bags were already loaded on the aircraft along with ours - but we didn’t want to go against what they had been told. So our friends missed the flight! To top things off, our baggage was not on the flight, even though the staff at the gate told us everyone’s baggage was on the flight. So we spent the first 3 days of our trip in Bali with no clothes to do the activities we wanted to do, our friends arrived a day late (they were not put up in a hotel by qantas, they had to buy a room themselves) and we were only compensated $60NZD which got us either a cheap shirt and shorts or bikinis for 3 days. We’re all sick of Qantas after that trip, definitely worth paying an extra few $100 for quality service on Air New Zealand.

### "apparently bubble and squeak"
Excellent service and comfy seat, but the catering is apparently bubble and squeak. I have never had anything quite like it. Someone must be laughing their socks off.

### "really downgraded the quality"
Qantas have really downgraded the quality of their international economy class service, particularly the food offering. This flight had 2 meals (dinner and breakfast), both of which were very basic compared to previously. Just a small foil covered tray of hot food and a single additional sweet item. No salads, bread, sauces, fruit, etc. My flight immediately before this one was JAL from Paris to Tokyo. The superiority of the JAL economy service and product compared to Qantas was huge! JAL had more leg room, far greater food offering and far more attentive staff. Qantas and JAL are both premium priced airlines. Unfortunately Qantas no longer is providing a premium offering (at least in economy class).

### "Seat was very comfortable"
Have flown this route many times but a first on the non stop flight of 17.5 hours. So much better than a change of planes on the way. Seat was very comfortable, as it needed to be, in a small cabin. Good wines and food, nice attentive crew, lovely quiet plane to fly in. A very good experience and have recovered very quickly from time change

### "A very good experience"
A very good experience. Easy check-in and boarding. Extremely comfortable seat in a small cabin upstairs. Big seat back screen, plenty of room, avoid recline a d a clever pillow that attaches to the seat headrest, really comfortable. Good food and wines, friendly staff if a little slow in serving. Brief refuelling stop in Singapore was ok. Exceeded my expectations and this is a really good product.

### "could not fault them"
Congratulations Qantas. Was let down by Jetstar again. No notification until arrival at airport flight cancelled. Qantas booked me on a flight 4 hours later. Drink and meal vouchers given. From front counter to staff on board could not fault them. Happy to help. Staff on flight were fantastic. Plenty of laughs. Shout out to steward on board. Even entertained the children on board playing Bob the builder and even singing with a borrowed a hard hat from a customer to the back of the plane. Well done Qantas first time I have flown with you and I will most certainly do it again. And the on board snacks were free. Included in flight.

### "Qantas refused to offer any refund"
I was unable to make my flight because of an ear infection. I was issued a flight credit good for about 6 months. My ear problem of a blocked eustachian has not cleared up, and has become a chronic health issue. My ENT wrote me a doctors note saying I could not fly. The proposed flight was Los Angeles to Sydney, about 15 hours. I called customer service and was on the phone for over an hour. The operator, who spoke poor English, keep checking with others as if he didn't know the procedure. I believe he was a sub-contractor, answering phones for Qantas from another country. Finally he said I would be charged a $250 cancel fee, which I agreed to. He said the remainder of the $7,365.00 ticket would be refunded to my credit card in about 8 weeks. After 9 weeks, I called Qantas to inquire as to the status of my refund. A different operator told me that previous operator had misinformed me. Qantas refused to offer any refund, any partial refund, or allow me to transfer the flight credit to my daughter who lives in Australia.

### "I want them to give me my money back"
Qantas online booking charge me 3 times my air fares. I've try to call Qantas to get my money back without any success. First call they could not find their own booking reference, put me on hold, after 35min waiting in the queue, then communication finished without warning after 20more minute on hold. 2nd call, 30min waiting time, hang up as soon as I've been connected to an operator. 3rd call, 30min waiting time, then get in touch with an operator who still can't find the booking reference, then tell me that I've to process a claim on line. I explain he that I'm not claiming any thing, I want them to give me my money back. She told me again with any more information, webpage, phone number or else where to make the claim. I've repeat that they are the one at fault so they should look into it, I'm not paid to solve their mistake. I've ask her to connect me to her manager or the competent department, she ask me to go the the website, without no further explanation, I've told her no, I want to speak to a manager, she said ok, and put me on hold during 40more minute. She put me on hold 4 or 5 time each time the queue was bringing back. At the end the call was terminated with the usual satisfaction question. Obviously the operator was looking at wasting time because I insisting in talking to a person.

### "I never want to fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Seats are incredibly uncomfortable and not built for anyone over 5’9. My husband and I experienced the most miserable flight cancellation. We had just gotten off a red eye flight from Bali to connect to get to NZ and the plane’s engine starter motor failed. Do they not check these things during regular maintenance? We were stuck on the aircraft for not only engine failure but, to begin with, their flight attendant was late by over half an hour. Sat on the plane for over an hour just to revised and get told we had to take the next red eye flight. Two red eye flights in 24 hours. Sat in the airport for 14 hours when about 75% of the flight was able to get earlier scheduled flights out of Australia. I never want to fly this airline again. An entire day wasted because someone didn’t do their job and we were forced to sleep in the airport. Meal vouchers weren’t enough for this. I’m grateful my husband has airport lounge access otherwise I’m not sure how so would have survived waiting this long to get to our destination.

### "team who went above and beyond"
I upgraded to Business for my trip back from Darwin to Adelaide on QF1959. From the moment I entered the plane to the moment I departed in Adelaide I was treated by your team as if I was the only one on the plane. I would like to say thanks to your team who went above and beyond. The care and service in particular from one of your employees Flight Manager Jennifer was amazing, and after seeing her actions in transit with the team and the customers made it clear that you have a special "diamond" within your team. As the service industry has perhaps dropped the ball in these times, with people like Jennifer and the team it was the opposite. Please pass on my thanks personally for the service provided. Many Thanks.

### "The flight was good"
This flight was a continuation on14 November from International flight Venice Dubai Brisbane. Booked through Emirates and boarding passes issued in Venice all the way to Townsville. Flight a bit delayed received allocated requested aisle seat and fortunate middle seat empty. Snack offered on this short flight. Passengers handed out cheese and Crackers. I asked if any Gluten Free options. The cabin member offered a choice of sweet or savoury gluten free snack as i didn't mind given packet of Rice Crackers and then asked if I'd like an apple as well. The flight was good. Landed safely and Luggage quick of conveyer. Everything went smoothly from Venice to Townsville via Dubai and Brisbane.

### "food choice was great"
Not Verified |  The experience on this flight was flawless (even though there was a 40 minute delay in boarding). The aircraft was in good condition and clean, the flight attendants were excellent and the food choice was great for lunch and supper. The Qantas wine choice was good. However given the increase in the popularity in Rosé, I think it's about time it was included in the mix.

### "Service was excellent"
Qantas has had a lot of negative reporting lately, but here is a headline you will NEVER see. Visiting couple make 7 separate flights over 3 weeks and each flight was on time and all their luggage made it safe and sound. Yes, we flew Sydney-Canberra-Darwin-Cairns-Brisbane-Port Macquarie and couldn't have been more satisfied. (the Darwin-Cairns was vis Brisbane). Each leg - even the first one - we got some sort of refreshment, snack or light hot meal. Service was excellent, ground staff did their job and our visit was awesome. We must have booked before the price hikes as each of us paid just under $1200 Australian so it was quite a bargain I feel. So just keep in mind that things are basically fine, bad things can happen but keep it in context

### "Very grumpy and snarly"
Not Verified |  Flying Business Class with wife. Seats 3A and C. On embarking, not one vacant spot in the entire Business Class compartment for our 2 pieces of carry-on regulation-size luggage. Left both pieces in the aisle. Flight attendant got annoyed when I requested that the allocated luggage compartments for the allocated seats be vacated so that our 2 pieces could be stored. Very grumpy and snarly. One economy class passenger then removed 1 item and ours were stored somewhere back in the middle of economy. I then asked the flight attendant if one could store one’s luggage randomly in any allocated Business Class overhead locker and he said “Yes” but I doubt if that is correct. The attendant had to carry the overheads towards the back of the plane, this would be an issue if someone less strong had to attempt this.

### "nothing good to say about them"
Luggage lost on the way to Japan, pathetic meals, cancelled flight and moved as to another one. Cancelled the extra weight we bought without telling us, major delays on our flight home just pathetic. Do not fly with Qantas, nothing good to say about them.

### "a shadow of its former self"
Not Verified |  An odd flight with a litany of big and small issues. Small inconsistencies: Arrangement of the queues at boarding resulted in Premium Economy passengers boarding before most business class passengers. Window dimmers for the entire business class cabin stopped working twice during the flight resulting in daylight flooding into the dark cabin. Frozen butter and cold bread served with meals. Not sure how people spread the rock solid butter? Flight number displayed on the entertainment system was incorrect. I know this is pedantic but it’s unusual for an airline to get it wrong on their systems. Bigger problems: One crew member was very aggressive. I requested an amenity kit so that I could change my socks and the response I got was a very curt “we will get to that.” Most of the crew no longer even try and call you by your name, instead I was referred to as 8K - my seat number. Aside from Ian and Lisa there was zero proactive engagement with customers. Basically an economy class service level i.e. after the meal service the staff disappear to rest. Ian worked tirelessly all night and he reminded me of the old Qantas business class service where the crew would remembered small details and would actually bring you something that you requested. He and Lisa were genuinely friendly and warm. The rest of the crew I interacted with were passive aggressive and just tolerated having to interact with actual passengers. Qantas international business is becoming a shadow of its former self. The hard product is good but it is lacking in all the soft touches that used to make it enjoyable.

### "could not fault them"
Husband and I flew Bne to Heathrow via Perth to embark on a cruise. We had left 36 hours leeway after arrival in London in case any delays occurred. Bne to Perth was on time, luggage arrived with us and crew were friendly and professional. Transit time in Perth was meant to be 2.5 hours before we boarded QF9. After about 3 hours we were advised by the Captain (Morris I think) that there would be a delay of around 90 mins due to a wing maintenance problem. After about another 2 hours, he came back to all of us in person and apologised that we would not be leaving that night and Qantas were organising hotels for us. It was anticipated our flight would leave at 8pm the next night. The arrangements and service to get us all to hotels with vouchers etc was very quick and professional. Once back at the airport, another delay of 4 hours and we finally left Perth around midnight. As the window of us boarding our ship was closing very rapidly, the crew (Luke and Captain Morris) were really really helpful - there were 2 spare seats in business class and when we were about an hour from landing in London, we were able to move to those seats so that we could leave the plane quickly. This was a godsend as in the end we only made the ship by 3 hours (and our luggage was with us). Yes it was very stressful and frustrating, but the Qantas staff kept us informed at every stage. Things happen but they were very understanding of our situation. Food, cabin crew and entertainment were all excellent and could not fault them.

### "Would not recommend Qantas"
Not Verified |  Delayed flight due to getting the last lot of baggage on board. Get to Auckland to find out Qantas have left behind 20 suitcases, one being mine. If they had brains they would have sent it on the next Qantas flight which was 2 hours after but no, said it will take a couple of days to get our baggage back. Now can’t start my travels, have caused me so much reorganising and have lost money because of it. Would not recommend Qantas to anybody

### "saying I filed the claim too late"
Flew through Sydney back to Auckland in early September. The flight itself was great, but my suitcase is now a write-off. The polycarbonate shell somehow ended up split - I'm assuming the suitcase took a bit of a drop. It's a 78cm checked-in suitcase, so was around NZD 300. The resolution process was a delight - took merely 2 months to reach a claim outcome of $75. I called in at 25 days and was advised to buy a new one and that I'd be reimbursed for the cost - apparently not. I received one outcome saying I filed the claim too late, so I had to call and speak to someone for an hour before they advised me to open a new claim. Their system decided I'd taken a domestic flight - ah yes the country of Australia and NZ... Finally, after following up with a couple more hour-long calls, it seemed to be going somewhere, only to get an outcome literally less than minimum wage for the time I'd spent following this up.

### "Qantas has gone down the drain"
Very rude staff on Sydney to New Delhi flight in March 2022. Seen staff arguing with almost 6 people in my cabin including me. Almost all of staff with mask below nose. No etiquette regarding customer service. Never again. Qantas has gone down the drain that quickly.

### "incorrectly charged for excess luggage"
I was returning to Australia & was incorrectly charged for excess luggage at OR Tambo Airport - $80/kg for 8kgs, $640! I was within the Premium Economy limit of 40kgs. I was ill & emotionally distressed at the time, and didn't argue as I was told in no uncertain terms that I would not get my boarding pass unless I paid the fee, so I did. I lodged a claim with all the supporting documentation with with Qantas Customer care on 15 September & all I have to show for it is a Customer Care Reference Number & nothing else. I've emailed them almost on a weekly basis, but still had no response. I've even asked Visa to reject the charge but they don't seem to be able to do that. No wonder Qantas is making such huge profits - they extort money from vulnerable passengers & ignore you when you complain & try to get a refund.

### "a lot better than we anticipated"
Not Verified |  We are both retired and wanted a last visit to Australia before age would make it too difficult. Booked the flight some months ahead through a travel agent and then fingers crossed spent weeks worrying about train strikes, covid, Putin before finally making the airport on Sunday 16 October. Arrived at check in about 4 hours before ETD and were at the front of the Premium Economy queue. Didn't do on line check in as we had bid for an upgrade and the fine print stated it may prejudice the bid! Anyway didn't get the upgrade but when check in opened we were through in a flash - no problems and despite being allocated seats on separate rows (all that was left) the man on check sorted to seats together albeit in the back row two in a row of three. He did this without being asked - I was impressed and very grateful. Boarding was good and the flight left on time and we had an empty seat next to us another surprise. Seat was as expected, films/tv ok, meals reasonable. The cabin crew were excellent and we managed to get up and walk about as often as we wanted. Economy looked a bit grim but that's the way it is. Didn't get a lot of sleep but leaving at midday meant that it was difficult to doze anyway - breakfast was served about 3 hours prior to arrival. Flight arrived on time and we ere through customs etc in a flash to be met by our driver and whisked off to our apartment. In summary it was good a lot better than we anticipated and enabled us to ditch the usual stopover in HK or Singapore. Surprisingly there a few recent reviews on this flight so hoped for the best and planned for the worst!

### "cancelled without any communication"
Not Verified | We had a return flight from Johannesburg to Sydney due to depart 21 Oct 22. The flight has been cancelled by Qantas without any communication from the airline that the flight has been cancelled and they have changed our itinerary. We booked these flights in May and received itinerary change emails for a 20min change in flight time, e-ticket confirmation in Sept that flight is still going ahead, only to find out when we try to do online check in that our flight has been cancelled and they can only help us in 5days. More than an hour spent on the phone with staff and nothing. This is the worst experience I’ve had with an airline. How do you leave your passengers stranded and just not care?! You don’t cancel a flight and not tell people that have booked and paid.

### "staff are rude, arrogant and ignorant"
Not Verified |  We had a flight from Paraburdoo to Perth due to depart at 6pm. We watched our plane land and taxi in. Surprisingly it landed 15 minutes early. That's where it all went bad. The pilot got off to inspect the plane, and must have found an issue, so they "delayed" boarding. We waited for over an hour after we were due to take off and were finally given an update that we can't board this plane with no reason given. We were told Qantas is flying up a new plane and it would arrive by just after 9pm. No surprises this was a lie. They organised external catering as the one kiosk had already closed, which was frozen sandwiches .. yes still completely frozen. We then waited with no further reasoning as to why we can't board this plane. I had to exit the airport to use any bathroom facilities. Whilst out there I was near the fence and tried to say hello to one of the original pilots. He looked at me like I was a nobody, turned his back and walked away. We finally got the new plane at 10:20pm and departed Paraburdoo 5 hours late. Not even an apology from the captain, cabin crew or any Qantas employee. We departed at 11:pm and arrived in Perth just after 12:30am. Qantas staff are rude, arrogant and ignorant, plus the airline is a shambles.

### "customer service is truly deplorable"
Qantas customer service is truly deplorable these days. I had a flight booked from Singapore to Australia that was 100% cancellable and refundable with no penalty to be applied. I paid extra for this privilege of having the ticket being fully refundable. I cancelled the flight online and received no confirmation email or other acknowledgement, it simply disappeared from my frequent flyer account. After waiting 3 weeks with no update and no refund, I called customer service to be told that there had been a mistake on Qantas' side meaning that the refund hadn't been processed, that they would do this manually now and that I would have to wait 8 weeks for the money to appear. 8 weeks to process a refund that is fully payable as a term of the ticket is insane and to make me wait 3 extra weeks for a total of 11 weeks because of a mistake made by Qantas boggles the mind. As a comparison, on the same day that I cancelled my Qantas flight, I cancelled a hotel booking on a booking site that was actually for a larger total sum than the Qantas flight. That money from the hotel booking site appeared as a credit on my AMEX card 72 hours later. Qantas is fast becoming a third world country airline experience with terrible customer service.

### "charged me twice for a second time"
Not Verified |  Qantas charged me twice for a second time! I am sorry to say that this is not the first time but rather the second time that Qantas has charged me twice without any compensation or appearance of remorse for the difficulty it has caused me. Early this year I booked tickets to LAX return for. my sister and I for business. I was charged in excess of 3500 AUD twice. Qantas of course, after I waited an hour on the phone, said that they were not responsible and couldn't do anything. I just booked another international flight and unbelievably they charged me twice again! The issue is still to be resolved. I will in the future take every means necessary to avoid Qantas, even if it means I cannot travel direct to my destination.

### "money for the flight was taken out twice"
Worst customer experience I have ever received. Booked my flight on Qantas website, unfortunately the money for the flight was taken out twice. Thought I would be able to call Qantas and quickly sort it out but I was very wrong. Have spent over 20 hours on hold and on calls with the contact centre. They keep saying that the refund payment will be processed within so many working days but each time it never arrives and the call centre blames it on the last person I spoke to. It’s been 6 weeks and still have not received the money they took from my account back. Would highly recommend using 3rd party website to avoid this. Really want this issue resolved.

### "permanently put off flying them"
Flew QF1 Sydney to London on 7 October on one of Qantas’ A380s and the flight was an absolute disaster. It all started as I sat in the lounge and slowly the notifications started to drop through. The flight time was at first delayed half an hour but by the time I actually arrived in London the flight had been delayed nearly four hours. It turns out that I got off lucky as other QF1 flights this month have been delayed by five hours and nearly six hours. Already you can see that this flight’s performance is absolutely pathetic and you cannot depend on Qantas to get you to arrive on time. The delay caused me great anxiety and prevented me from being able to sleep on the plane for the whole flight. I belatedly arrived in London an absolute mess. Qantas have really cheapened their food offerings. They no longer provide a traditional meal service. They give you a main dish and a piece of bread but without any other accompanying dishes. The main I chose was roast beef and mash with a tasteless piece of bread. There was no dessert offered at the time but they later came round with an ice cream that is clearly marketed at children. I’m not sure why they think that it counts as a proper dessert. The most frustrating parts of the flights was the constant delays. Delayed take off, delayed clearance to land, delayed clearance to taxi to the gate. Delayed receiving my bag at Heathrow. This happened at almost every part of the flight which only increased the overall delay. The most insulting part was when the captain apologised for the flight “being a bit late” Many people including me missed their connections and others would have had to book new flights due to travelling on separate tickets. I had to book a new flight to Barcelona as I should have had eight hours to travel from Heathrow to Gatwick and catch another flight but due to the significant delay I was unable to make it on time. Qantas in its current state should be avoided at all cost. I have been permanently put off flying them and would recommend to all reading this that you also avoid flying them. Their logistical issues caused by Alan Joyce gutting the airline during the pandemic have killed this airline. The downgrading of the inflight service is just insulting to customers. I’d fly with an airline like Qatar, Singapore or Emirates in future.

### "staff were pleasant and efficient"
The 737-800 had better (and adequate seat space and leg room) than the older 737’s. The staff were pleasant and efficient. All flights were on time and and there were no luggage issues. The food was suitable given the environment. Again, I highly recommend Qantas.

### "would not fly again with Qantas Internationally"
They are cutting services, food, amenities, I am an economy only traveller so this review is based on experience flying international in economy class. I travel Australia to India mostly with Singapore and Thai and this time gave Qantas a try on the return from Delhi to Melbourne. Review is based on my past experience with Thai and Singapore Airlines. I booked via agent. Basics good - flight onboarding, general courtesy of flight attendants was good so 3 stars. This was a 12hr plus direct flight 8pm DEL - 13.55 MEL. Food: Average at best. Very small portions and pretty much tasteless. Can't call it sambhar when it looks and taste like pumpkin. We were 4 passengers and had different meals which were all tasteless. Food service: For a flight starting at 8pm (DEL) and landed at 2pm (Melbourne) they served 2 main meals only. Dinner served at 10.30pm (2.5hrs into flight) and Breakfast served around 1pm (Melbourne). Kids were hungry and had to request breakfast for which we got some soy crackers while actual breakfast was served at lunch time! They kept on serving snack items - soy crackers, chocolate etc in between but skipped on one full meal. Amenities: They did not have Toothpaste and Toothbrush for a flight originating at dinner time and ending at lunch time. Upon asking flight attendants took the feedback and said its not provided on this flight and that generally its provided for long flights. I was surprised if almost a 13 hour direct flight isn't a long flight to have toothpaste etc on board. No warm/hot napkin etc to freshen up. Old style armrests which have press to call attendants button which we all pressed accidentally by resting elbows on armrests. It could be just the DEL-MEL leg and not in general Qantas planes for other international legs but hey that's what I got and experienced. For my mediocre experience with food, food service, basic amenities I'd give it 3 stars and would not fly again with Qantas Internationally. I got much better experience with Thai, Singapore and Emirates for the same legs of journey at same price levels and would avoid Qantas under normal conditions of travel.

### "How low grade has this airline become"
QF119 on September 2, 2022 / Seat 4K. The catering on this flight was disgraceful, for fares costing $1000 plus there is no printed menus (lets not blame Covid), no choice of meal and one piece of bread per passenger, in business class. I was verbally advised there is “one piece of bread loaded per business class passenger sir”. So, with zero choice of meals as I dont eat the Indian meal that what was offered, butter chicken, which smelt awful permeating through the cabin, I ate the small plate of lettuce leaves and once slice of bread. Business class? How very tragic. I then asked for a plate of cheese, once available in Business class on Qantas both domestically and internationally, and is now another bygone luxury. Once again, “sorry, no cheese loaded” says the attendant. The pre packaged dry cake they called 'dessert' in business class on this international flight was also left on my tray uneaten. Eventually the cabin crew presented me with a bag of Santos pretzels, the dregs from the economy snack tray. How low grade has this airline become? There are many far superior options to get to Auckland from Australia. Qantas just do not care about you, your hard earned money or their food, all they care about is their bottom line. Swissport left my bag at Brisbane. The bag ended up in Perth, please do not check in bags on Qantas, its a high chance they will get lost. Care factor by Qantas, Zero.

### "They do not respond to emails"
Not Verified | Qantas customer service is non existent, even as a Gold member. Qantas also breaches its own policies. I have cancelled my booking within 24hours and should have received a full refund. 4 months later, after 7 hours on the phone, 15 emails and 2 customer complaint forms, I have still not received any refund. They do not respond to emails and just hang up on you on the phone.

### "appreciated the free beer"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was OK. The staff were friendly and helpful and I appreciated the free beer. The meal was a bit small, just cheese and crackers but I guess that's OK for a short flight.

### "service was friendly and efficient"
Unfortunately the 1900 flight was cancelled and I was put on a 2100 flight which was a pain. I guess it could have been far worse. The service was friendly and efficient and it's always nice to have free drinks. They served a tasty pie as well.

### "paying 300$ for the extra bag"
All problem previously expected and still happened. Bought international flight Brisbane - Sydney - Santiago - Rio, 3 months before my departure date. I was sure that i would have problem taking 2 bags, specially Brisbane - Sydney. To avoid that i was making sure i buy the tickets from Qantas website, not from other third part websites, and on the process i was making sure that i had 2 luggage included or if i had to buy it, that wouldn't be a problem, cause i definitely was taking 2. No evidence about it was showing anywhere, first think weird. Between buying the ticket and actual flight, i assume that Qantas changed the 2 bags that you are allowed to take to only 1 bag, so I end up at the airport with 2 luggage paying 300$ for the extra bag.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified | Worst customer service ever. Flight was delayed and could not assist me with an insurance letter as the flight was a different airline. I paid my money to Qantas It is a QF flight code They chose partner airline - not me. Not only could not provide letter, didn’t not assist with trying to obtain letter. We Australians are not proud of you and your service. Definitely not flying Qantas going forward.

### "Overall disappointing performance"
Not Verified | Overall disappointing performance. Check in for bags in Manila took two hours because they were randomly checking bags at the bag check and were understaffed. Sat at gate inside the plane for an extra hour because of various reasons. This was after boarding was delayed already. Wouldn’t allow water to be brought on plane, I have never heard of that before. Had some sort of miniature water fountain on plain that a water bottle could not fit under. Flight attendants were nice, it was more so the Manila gate and check in staff

### "Terrible service"
Terrible service. Travelling family of 7. Flight home cancelled on the day. Family split and rebooked on 2 different indirect flights leaving and arriving at different times. When tried to rebook all on same flight and a direct route (as per original booking) told would have to pay more! Unbelievable. No apology. No complimentary access to lounge whilst waiting around at airport for hours for cancelled and then delayed flights. Finally arrived home hours apart. Will not fly Qantas again.

### "crew members are polite and friendly"
Not Verified | I have always had good flights with Qantas but wasn’t sure what to expect after the criticisms the airline received this year. The direct Perth to Rome flight was no exception. It was incredibly smooth and the staff were so welcoming and accomodating. The crew members are polite and friendly, and  go out of their way to ensure you have everything you need. I can’t praise the staff enough.

### "friendly service to children"
Had not so good experience with Qantas many years ago but tried flying with Qantas this year. Excellent customer service by cabin crew especially Elio (pardon me if the name is mispelled); friendly service to children and family as well as showing great Australian spirit. The crew has made my little one's experience great time flying with Qantas. Will definitely fly Qantas again.

### "Staff were so unhelpful and rude"
I was travelling with a baby and let me tell you I do not recommend. When arriving at Sydney Airport the lady at check in was so rude. She refused to take my authorized luggage cause she decided I had enough already. When travelling with a baby I am allowed my luggage, a 10kg baby luggage and 3 baby items. I had only 2 baby items but she still refused me the 10kg one cause she wasn't feeling like it. Lucky I was travelling with my sister and her baby too and the lady that checked her in let her take my luggage. Then on board, well again had to deal with staff abusing me. When I booked my flight I paid an extra $40 to have a bassinet. I was allocated the seat but once i arrived on board the staff asked me to change my seat with a guy. At first I refused and said I paid for my seat I shouldn't be the one moving. Then the staff starting to threaten me saying they spoke to the captain and the flight will return to Perth and they will take further action if I don't move. I let you imagine my state of mind with a newborn baby in my arms and having to deal with that. Staff were so unhelpful and rude and didn't care. I finally moved cause i had no choice but said I want to be refunded for the extra cost I paid, which they say 'yes of course contact the company they will refund you'. I flew in June and I am still waiting to get a refunded. When calling the customer center they either hang up on me or they are saying that seats can be changed on the day there is nothing they can do.

### "promo code no longer worked"
I recently used the "Thank You From Qantas" promo code for $50 that was emailed to me. I had to cancel this flight, and rebook another, but in cancelling the flight, the promo code was not reissued, and the existing promo code no longer worked. I have since spoken with a customer service representative on the phone, who told me that once used, promo codes cannot be used again, even if the booking is cancelled. I then asked if another one could be issued to me and she said "no". Not exactly the "Thank You From Qantas" I was expecting. Another example of Qantas customer service going severely wrong.

### "they do not put passengers first"
Waiting at the gate, there seemed to be no staff around. Even after our allotted boarding time. It seemed that there was a shortage of gate agents, overhearing a grounds person talking on the desk phone when it rang. There were no updates at all, not even a delay update. Eventually after an hour we were finally called to board. Bit of a mess, economy were standing in the business line plus economy line, no one cared. Especially towards the back, there were a number of empty rows. It was a very old plane with engines mounted high near the tail. After another delay to take off, the noisy engines started vibrating and roaring but were off. We had cheese and crackers which was fine. It was nice to see the magazine back. For the most expensive option here 'Qantas' they really do not deserve being anyone’s first choice, as it is blatantly obvious - they do not put passengers first, only themselves. I need to try Rex.

### "Have been a loyal customer, not any more"
Not Verified |  Qantas has become a substandard airline that treats it customers deplorably. We were travelling with small children and a disabled person for a family holiday. Qantas delayed our flight by nearly 4 hours with no support or help. When trying to call their so called help centre was on hold for nearly an hour with no help offered, just oh well tough luck. We missed out on our first day of the holiday with great financial loss and heartache. Qantas are very greedy and arrogant. They want their money but are happy to take their customers money under the false pretence of you are going to get what you pay for, good service and a flight that leaves on time. They are a joke. Have been a loyal customer, not any more. We will be looking for other options.

### "We shan't use Qantas again"
We booked a round trip Premium Economy Per - Lon - Per. Apart from a broken table in seat 23A the outward leg was fine good food, good service good everything that is where the similarity ends. The return leg on Saturday the 17 Sept Flight QF10 could not have been so different. We were called to board and I went to the boarding gate along with my partner and other Premium Econ passenger. At the gate i was told I wasn't wants. I explained we had been called and was told "Yes but not you" we were directed to go stand in a corner with two other passengers, our passports and boarding passes were taken from us by an individual who did nothing with them. Shortly thereafter the Qantas duty manager appeared and spoke with one of the other passengers that were cast aside, The passenger was advised her Premium Economy seat was inoperable and could not be reclined, she was offered the option of a $500 USD credit, or a re book in a weeks time. We were then spoken to and the issue was the same an inoperable seat same offer $500USD or wait a week. The refund was made while arguing with Qantas the manager was only interested in missing the slot. We were advised the Purser would come speak with us, he didn't. For 17 hours my partner endured the privilege of sitting in a seat that did not recline therefore could not sleep. Of the 28 seats in Premium Economy 3 were inoperable. We had a vacant seat beside us. We did not receive the welcome drink that might have cooled tempers then there was the meal issue, 3 options were stated on the menu, the vegetarian option wasn't available at all, by the time that had served the first few rows the 2nd option a Vietnamese Chicken salad was gone, we were advised they only loaded 6 of these for Premium Economy that left us with the only remaining dish a very tied overcooked grayish beef stew. If Neil Perry put his signature to these dishes for Qantas then he hasn't trialled them in a longtime. The food was disgusting so much so I passed on breakfast. Back to the broken seat as there was a vacant seat in the row I opted to move into it so that my partner had the benefit of a reclining seat. Shortly thereafter the cabin staff member advised rudely I had to move as the seat was reserved for "crew rest". I explained the broken seat and the fact I had paid $6000 AUD total for my partner and I to fly "Premium Economy" and that it wasn't for the privilege of sitting in a broken seat for the next 16 hours. She couldn't have cared less Overall the flight was disgraceful a broken seat, disgusting dinner and a dirty aircraft. We shan't use Qantas again.

### "I'm not flying anywhere"
Flight delayed 3 hours due to wheel change, missed my connection. Guy at destination writes 2 flight numbers at the back of the ticket and hurries me along. One day later i come to airport to find that I'm not flying anywhere, go to Qantas stand - its empty. Call them by the number, they say i flew the day before to Ho chi minh. I ask the employee on the phone what do i do now. She says something along the lines of better luck next time.

### "not provide any alternative vegetarian meal options"
I recently flew from Sydney to Melbourne and was hungry. Customers were being served a meal - a trio of pies, however I couldn't eat this because of the meat. Qantas does not provide any alternative vegetarian meal options, which means they are okay to make some of their customers go hungry while others are eating around them. I was offered a small pack of rice crackers but they taste like stale cardboard, so makes the experience even worse. Very unfortunate that this airline chooses to discriminate.

### "punctual and organised"
In August we flew Sydney to London and then the return to Sydney in September. Each flight was punctual and luggage arrived on time in the arrivals section both ways. The Qantas International Lounge in London was an excellent haven - quiet, relaxed and an outstanding level of service from an attendant named Michael. Equally the flight from London to Singapore was exemplary with cabin crew introducing themselves by name and Juan taking care of all procedures in a professional and competent manner. The flight from Singapore to Sydney was perhaps a little less enjoyable as the attendants were not quite as well-versed in procedure or hospitality (ie; don't forget the cutlery when you serve a meal) and hopefully Qantas will address this. The business class pod was comfortable and offered the peace and quiet I like when travelling. In summary, Qantas was punctual and organised with no luggage issues. The A380 is a beautiful craft with space, grace and a lovely smooth flight.

### "In short, the service is diabolical"
Not Verified |  Qantas Airways has drastically diminished in service since COVID. I flew return in business class to Singapore and there many disappointments along the way: 1) My luggage did not arrive in Singapore. I checked in well ahead of time and my bag had ironically been tagged as first as the desk had run out of business tags. Qantas does not have any service on the ground and relies upon Singapore Airlines in case of lost luggage. I registered the missing bag at the airport, but it proved impossible to get through on the phone to follow up. The website simply stated they were attempting to locate my bag. And it was impossible to gain any compensation. As it turned out my luggage never arrived - it appeared several hours after my return to London, so it would seem it never left LHR and there was no attempt to deliver it to me in Singapore. It was impossible to get any information on compensation and I am still waiting for that. I contacted Qantas via web form, and social media (and attempted via phone). I also attempted to get information on compensation and registered a complaint at check in on my return and at the lounge. The service is appalling. I have received an email from Qantas stating they have tried to get in touch, which is not true, and I attempted to respond and included my reference number but received an auto-reply stating there was no reference number. In short, the service is diabolical. 2) The food / inflight service: No pre-dinner drink/snack and no entrée. For a 13 hour flight and business class ticket at a cost of around £7000 the service is lower than many short haul economy. The main was served on a side plate. I had a glass of wine, and chose cheese for dessert which was served on what appeared to be a saucer! 3) The toilets in half of the plane were broken: The staff advised because half of the toilets were not working they would only serve water for the flight. This seemed very perplexing and it was perhaps that they hadn't stocked drinks. There was no offer of compensation for lack of drinks and as mentioned the drink service seemed very limited from the time of boarding, rather than after a few hours in when the staff said the toilets broke. 4) Running low on fuel: As we came closer to LHR on the return leg, the captain announced that they were running low on fuel and we would divert to Birmingham (which is further north). Again this caused a great deal of confusion. The explanation was something to do with weather, however, by this stage confidence in the airline had disappeared. A short time later the "fuel crisis" had somehow been averted and we landed at LHR. Overall a terrible experience and I am still awaiting advice on compensation a number of weeks later and out of pocket having to buy clothes and personal items for a week in Singapore without luggage. I also had to attend my first day in the office in my clothing from the flight. The attitude of Qantas towards business passengers (and no doubt all passengers) is appalling. As a former Platinum FF, I was glad I have other options to choose from.

### "flight was a pleasurable experience"
Sydney to Bangkok. Departed on time and was a quick 8 hours to Bangkok. The service from the staff was faultless, amongst the best I've had. The seats on the A330 were comfortable and not cramped at all, although the IFE box can be a bit annoying when placing your feet in the centre seats, luckily I had the seat next to me free. Nice blankets and quite plush pillows were provided. Cabin temperature was good, not too hot, and the individual vents are great. The meals were very tasty, a chicken parmigiana for the main one, and the drinks/wine were all good. The IFE was pretty good, I always look forward to the Australian content which they have a good selection of. Good quality screens, and useful to have the USB charger in every screen too. The entire flight was a pleasurable experience and amongst the best economy products out there. But once again, the Qantas staff were a big part of this and why it was such a good flight.

### "relatively generous legroom"
A pleasant surprise for Qantas to be operating the Boeing 717 on the short hop from Melbourne to Canberra, a route packed with the usual 737s. Compared to other carriers, the seat comfort of the Qantas 717 is a big step up with relatively generous legroom (around 32 inches), good cushioning, and an adjustable headrest. Due to the shortness of the flight (50 minutes), only a very simple snack (crackers and cheese) and a beverage service were provided which, although simple is still a step up from the offerings of Virgin and Jetstar offering nothing for free. However, its high price (about 50% more expensive than Virgin and Jetstar) negates some of the advantages Qantas has in its offerings and therefore makes it suitable more for time-sensitive business travelers over price-sensitive leisure travelers. There was no Wi-Fi on board however 2 stars was still given for the option to connect your own device for Qantas's inflight entertainment options.

### "way I was treated was very rude"
I traveled from Manila to Melbourne via Sydney and first bags were delayed at Sydney. Due to this I was told I missed my connection but they put me on the next flight and issues a boarding pass as well. At the gate, I had been bumped into another flight later in the day. The customer service tells me I was late at the gate! I asked for an explanation and I was told a supervisor will see me. He just tells me nothing can be done and this happens with Qantas all the time. And he just walked away. The way I was treated was very rude from Qantas. Zero customer focus. This is a 3rd class cheap budget type of airline that is charging 1000s of dollars. I paid $2700 for this low class cheap airline. Trying to avoid them whenever I can.

### "Every staff member was friendly"
Not Verified |  I was concerned about this flight with all Qantas issues. What a pleasant surprise. From the time we arrived at the airport it was just easy. Every staff member was friendly. Flight left on time. Onboard cabin crew were awesome. Friendly, warm, and took great care of us. Food was brilliant. Better than the garbage we got on Emirates after this flight. I have to say this flight was a real pleasant surprise. Not what I expected at all. Went way beyond expectations. Even our or luggage arrived. Can't believe I am writing such a positive review for Qantas after they left us stranded in Japan when covid hit, and had to buy new flights to get home. Took 6 months to get refund. Definitely back in our good books. Great job to the crew on 18.08.2022 Especially blonde hair cabin crew lass in BC. You made it a pleasure. Flew business class Perth to Singapore.

### "will never trust them again"
Not Verified |  I managed to get back to UK ok although had to wait an hour for luggage at the other end & fear set in seeing so many cases sitting between the carousels. My partner was due to arrive from Melbourne via Sydney, Singapore into London on 22 august at 6:35am . His flight was delayed twice, then he was advised whilst still in Sydney after Qantas had to put him up for a night that his case had been misplaced & he’d have to see if it turned up at the London end. It didn’t, he was told to do a report, which he did and they would keep him up to date on where his luggage was, didn’t happen. The luggage company have terrible reviews, so out of concern he contacted Qantas to find out where his case is, they didn’t know. This is 2 days on. My partner has a sleep apnoea condition & his machine is in the case. Apart from that, we have clothing worth far more than a measly A$500 offered in insurance. We now have to get back to Australia with Qantas but will never trust them again.

### "trip was pleasurable experience"
QANTAS QF1 departed Sydney and arrived in London via Singapore with punctuality. The flight was smooth and eventful. The new seats reclined fully with ample room for taller people and are both supportive and fully adjustable so make for a great range of sitting, reclining or sleeping flat. I am glad I took my thick woolly jumper as I do find airplanes a little colder that comfortable - but that is a matter of choice and easily fixed by wearing appropriate clothing. The Steward hung my jacket in the wardrobe upon first settling to the seat and offered a glass of champagne, The various meals that followed were delicious and on-demand service friendly and punctual. The ICE worked smoothly with little lag but I do prefer my own book, a cozy blanket and maybe tea; maybe coffee; maybe a single malt. All was arranged with a smile and promptly. Sleep was easy with the adaptive lighting in the cabin and during the night it was very easy to call for any extra service. Toilets at the rear of the Business Class Cabin were always clean but so tiny that the reason for being their required some dexterity. The entire trip was pleasurable experience and the equal of other Business Class flights taken over the past 20 years.

### "we had economy not business class"
Booked and paid for businesses class ticket for my wedding anniversary through Qantas web site. Upon arrival at the airport headed to the lounge and was then told that we had economy not business class. Obviously economy would have been much cheaper. Call Qantas to assist wanted nothing to do with it as the booking was been fulfilled by JetStar. Called Jetstar they blamed Qantas and stated they we had to complete the flight before anything could be down. Upon returning I have raised the issue twice via email as you their is no contact number you can call. Basically they have completely ignored my complaint.

### "days of Qantas loyalty are now well and truly over"
On my last Qantas flight, my bag was destroyed, not just damaged, but destroyed by the baggage handlers. A claim was completed at the airport and Reference number assigned and photos and proof of ownership etc sent to Qantas, however it has now been over two weeks and Qantas has not contacted me (aside from the automated emails) about my bag. This line from the Automated response from the automated Qantas Customer Care reply email: "As always, our Baggage Services team is available on 1300 306 980, should you wish to call us. Is an absolute lie. After a 45 minute hold time, this number takes you to the booking agents who according to Var (a Qantas booking agent) have no number to transfer you to. If you try to get them to transfer to anyone else, they (at least Var) will just hang up on you. I used to think of Qantas as a good quality Airline, now I put Qantas same class as all the other low cost/budget airlines. My days of Qantas loyalty are now well and truly over.

### "cancelled at the last minute"
Not Verified |  My wife and I have had 3 unexpected last minute return flights with Qantas to visit a seriously ill interstate close friend. Each flight has been cancelled at the last minute. Worse than that I was offered a refund or credit voucher and chose the refund. About 6 weeks later I was offered a credit voucher card for the extortionate amount for 2 Sydney Brisbane economy return tickets of $2,100. I rang requesting a refund as before and was told the payment would take 6-8 weeks to process. I will never fly Qantas again, and on recently cancelling a Virgin flight received a refund in 5 days! Qantas will lose a lot of customers I’m sure and particularly the national carrier status that Alan Joyce likes to trade on.

### "appears to be making small budget cuts"
Not Verified |  I am a current Australian resident, residing in Perth Western Australia. I have travelled on Qantas many times over the last 15 years and usually, it is quite an enjoyable experience. However, in recent years, Qantas appears to be making small budget cuts on things like food and entertainment without the result of lowering the price on tickets. It is still an enjoyable airline in my opinion, although I think its experience has decreased over recent years.

### "stressful experience with mediocre service"
After flying with the competition for the last couple of years, I decided to give Qantas another go. The result is that I’ll avoid making further bookings unless necessary. Since the pandemic, Qantas appears to be an airline in disarray and certainly not what it used to be. I had an unpleasant experience on a recent flight from Brisbane to Melbourne, where my flight was cancelled and as a result I was delayed by almost 4 hours. This wasn’t bad considering some of the other passengers on board were rebooked on a flight that was 7 hours later. However, it still meant that I was very late to my own birthday dinner. A lot of Qantas staff appear to be disgruntled which has an effect on customer service. This doesn’t seem surprising given media reports on how they were treated over the course of the pandemic. When I approached a check in counter at Melbourne airport, the staff member, without saying a word, put a sign in front of my face, with a message to the effect: “counter closed, please be considerate to our staff”. The inflight meal service seems to be the main differentiator from the competition. However, on domestic flights this is minimal and doesn’t come remotely close to justifying the higher ticket prices. Due to the delay, the flight operated well within the timeframe for complimentary beer and wine however, this was not provided as they were basing their service off the original scheduled departure time. Luggage collection in Brisbane was a mess. Hundreds of people crowding around the conveyor that would maybe spit out 1 suitcase per minute. The wait was in excess of 30 minutes. Overall, I found my flight to be a stressful experience with mediocre service and onboard offering.

### "call centre system has completely failed"
Not Verified |  The call centre system has completely failed and ability to complete task or solve problems is gone. I normally don’t even write a review, but after 6 hours of call time and two weeks of attempts no resolution was found. I was hung up on by a manager and staff. It is clear they have outsourced their call centre and the international portion of this company is failing.

### "customer service is in absolute disarray"
I booked flexible return tickets with Qantas on a codeshare flight using emirates. It took 15-20 hrs on phone calls trying to use credit vouchers I had accumulated over covid. I didn’t know at the time, but my ticket was never correctly issued until the day before my flight when Qantas rang me in a panic trying to say I hadn’t paid! After another 4 hr conversation and it was agreed that I had credit vouchers. Anyway, my tickets were expensive and supposedly very flexible. On my returning flight home I wanted to pay for an upgrade as my wife became pregnant whilst we were away for many months. I then spent 5-7 hrs on the phone with Qantas on various different conversations, which were all handled completely differently. All I wanted was to upgrade my flight and pay for it. How hard can this be? My request was never granted and I was told that it would be possible 24th before the flight and that Qantas’s would contact me. I also ring emirates and after only 5-10mins they said to me that because Qantas ‘owns’ the ticket they cannot change it. I then arrive at the airport after never received my upgrade offer. I spend 4-5 hrs at the airport trying to pay for an upgrade to this flight. Emirates senior staff also rang Qantas on my behalf and demanded it to be possible as there were seats available, but Qantas still refused for whatever reason. Anyway, emirates may still upgrade us at a cost but only once we get on the plane first and only if seats remain available. They said if we booked though emirates they would only charge us a small fee to upgrade, but because it is a Qantas ticket they are limited with options. Qantas customer service is in absolute disarray and I can only hope that this resolves. The relationship between emirates and qantas appears to be fractured.

### "online booking system did not work"
Not Verified |  Terrible, the online booking system did not work, so ended up on a 1h+ phone call with an offshore call centre, talking to an operator with no idea. Was told 2 bookings needed as one flight was points and one was a flight credit. Over a week later, still no email confirmation of the 2nd flight. Another 1hr+ call to offshore call centre - being asked the same questions over and over and over again and still can't / won't issue me a ticket. I've now wasted as much time on the phone to these clowns trying to get my flight ticketed as the flight takes!

### "Do not trust this airline"
Not Verified |  I had booked flights with Qantas which were cancelled only a week before we were due to fly out. My flights back into Australia were also cancelled! I spent over 12hrs on hold trying to sort it out and whenever i got through to someone i was placed on hold after explaining my issue and the the line conveniently 'dropped out". Do not trust this airline.

### "our flight was canceled"
Not Verified |  We were due to fly Darwin to Perth, a 4 hour flight. 12 hours prior to departure our flight was canceled and we were put on an alternate flight Darwin via Brisbane to Perth. An 11 hour flight.

### "staff were wonderful and professional"
Not Verified |  On the 21st of July, I was on the aircraft that had to abort it's landing in Wellington due to horrendous weather conditions. Our captain's name was Clive and he was magnificent. We had to divert to Christchurch for the night and flew to Wellington for the night where we were put up in a hotel. All Qantas staff were wonderful and professional during this stressful time. Thank you so much for your empathy and care!

### "the customer is no longer king"
Great service from all flight crew on QF82. Flight attendants very helpful and friendly. Ground service also impeccable. Which cannot be said for QF management: shortly after QF82 touched down in Sydney, QF2 (also from Singapore) also landed in Sydney (as noticed by myself when taxing to the gate). QF82 passengers then waited for their luggage, as did QF2 passengers. After an hour QF82 passengers were advised that their baggage will be delayed because of 'a lack of staff and equipment". However, it then got to be known the QF Chief Executive Alan Joyce was on board of QF2 and got his luggage delivered prior to any other passengers. In other words, QF82 passengers had to wait for their luggage (although arriving earlier than QF2) for another half and hour (a total of 1.5 hours) to enable Mr Joyce's (and QF2's) luggage to be delivered first. Well, it seems that the customer is no longer king. While I am impressed by the professional conduct of the flight and ground crews, I am not impressed by the willful (and in my view unprofessional) delay of luggage delivery. My rating only refers to the flight crew, not to QF management practices.

### "the steady decline in service has finally tipped the scales for me"
Flew to Sydney on QF and back to LAX on AA. The difference was night and day. QF check-in at LAX was pretty good, friendly and gave good directions. No ground service at all on arrival in Sydney. The service and food on the flight was well below average. Cabin crew too busy chatting to each other during meal service, the crew generally dismissive, old selection of inflight movies and the food is just bad. Almost everything has some variety of beans or legumes in it (quite challenging for people with stomach issues or IBS), small portions and quite bland. Breakfast is incredibly boring with the same menu they've had for many years. I've flown QF a lot over the years between the US and Australia and the steady decline in service has finally tipped the scales for me and I won't be using them anymore. They spend a lot of money telling you how good they are, great partnerships with restaurateurs and amazing innovative experiences, but it's just become all talk and doesn't live up to the hype.

### "frightened for the return flights"
Qantas agents at Los Angeles do not understand that transit passengers do not require visas. This is travel knowledge that very nearly derailed our 5-week family vacation to Bali & Singapore. Upon check-in, the agents said they would not allow us on the plane without Australian Visas. We explained that we were not entering Australia, rather, we were transiting on our way to Bali. They insisted that Visas were required if the layover was over 3 hours. They said we needed to get Australian e-Visas and that we had 20 minutes to sign up for and receive approval or they would not take our bags or issue boarding passes. Our three young kids began crying. The agents even tried to shame us by claiming we didn't properly prepare for our trip - like it was our fault. The reason there is no information about visa requirements for transit passengers is that there is no such requirement. Qantas agents put us through absolute hell and pain for no reason. We managed to get the unneeded visas after 30 minutes of misery. To add insult to injury, they didn't honor the window seat selections I had paid for two days prior. They instead put us in the very back of the plane in the middle. The agent said "You weren't charged. An absolute lie. Qantas did charge us! Two out-of-five of our seats had faulty and inoperable AVOD on the a380 from LAX-SYD. Lastly, Qantas lost our checked luggage. We arrived in Bali with nothing. It took us 11 days to finally get it. I am absolutely frightened for the return flights.

### "meal was very small for a three hour flight"
Check was quite smooth, despite the airport being extremely busy. The flight departed on time and staff were friendly and well organized. The meal was very small for a three hour flight,  just some dry biscuits with some dip, but they did offer free drinks and offered a second wine. Apart from the paltry meal, I had a good flight.

### "Staff were excellent"
An enjoyable flight. For a full service airline the meal could have been more substantial, just a small packet of biscuits, but it was nice that they offered free drinks. The flight left on time and I was lucky check in was quite easy and fast. Staff were excellent.

### "staff were very friendly and helpful"
I enjoyed my flight. Check In and security was surprisingly easy. The plane left on time and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The meal served was a bit small (bangers and mash! ), but quite tasty. Free drinks was very much appreciated. IFE was quite good as well. Overall a great start to my holidays.

### "It’s been a disappointing experience"
I have tried everything to contact Qantas since around January 2022 in an effort to achieve communication. Every effort is made extremely difficult, from the phone to emails to going to the airport, which was chaos. My problems were caused by in my opinion total disregard for the client. I have many opinions on the ticket purchase and credit method used by Qantas, with the current business process causing the backlog that has occurred. A simple process would be to reverse the purchase, points and cash returned. Done then on with core business, not attempting to control myriad calls. It’s been a disappointing experience.

### "I will fly with them again, but certainly not by choice"
What can I say that has not already been said by so many others. I'm glad that I didn't have to pay any of my money for this flight, it was a work trip. I know that airlines are supposed to have standards for seat pitch, but I'm pretty sure that QF are screwing us on this. Even though I'm 6'4", in the past I have flown economy and been fine. In this case, my knees were virtually up near the shoulders of the passenger in front of me. There was not even sufficient space for the meal serving. That flight lasted for only 4 hours or so, I'm pretty sure I couldn't have lasted more than another 2 hours on it. Upon arrival in Perth, that plane was to fly on to London. I truly feel pity for anybody who was taking that flight. Cabin crew were nice, food was OK but very difficult to eat given the available space in that part of the cabin. I've heard rumors that QF wants to get rid of us "plebs" (economy class) and only fly business and first class passengers in future. Pilot was the icing on the cake by thumping us down on runway 24 at Perth airport. I feel for all of the staff that has lost their jobs, but hoping that if this year is another year of loss for Qantas, the government doesn't bale them out with our tax money. Also hoping that when BONZA start operations, it makes QF pick up their game. I will fly with them again, but certainly not by choice.

### "impossible to actually use the voucher"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly with Qantas in March 2020 but the flight was cancelled due to COVID. The flight was exchanged for a voucher. However, it is impossible to actually use the voucher and book my ticket. I am not allowed to book online and get a message saying I must call Qantas. But Qantas don't pick up the telephone. I've waited hours and, the one time I got through, was disconnected. I've written to their email address several time but just get a message saying that they will get back to me. My initial contact with them was on April 18th, 2022 but I still haven't heard anything back. I have also posted on their facebook page several times and get the same message that they will get back to me. Three months later it seems clear that they are not going to get back to me. I cannot visit their office since I live in Japan and there is not an office near me. I feel extremely frustrated at an airline that seems happy to take my money but is making it as difficult as possible to actually book the flight that I have already paid for. I would urge anyone considering buying a ticket with this airline to think again. In my experience, once they have their money, they have little regard for their customers.

### "quality of flying with Qantas is now so poor"
I have been flying weekly again since beginning of March 2022, Sunshine Coast (MCY) to Sydney to Dubbo and return since beginning of March 2022. There have been delays and cancellations every week. The quality of flying with Qantas is now so poor. Being a Platinum member does not seem to make any difference at all anymore. They now board families before boarding business class or platinum customers. The food on the aircrafts and in the lounges is terrible. I now pack my own food to eat on the aircraft. Most flights you cant even get a cup of tea, only water and soft drinks or juice. I don't drink soft drinks or manufactured juices. You are just another number now and there is no reward for loyalty it would seem.

### "one of my luggage is missing"
My father is in critical condition in the Philippines, so I decided to book the earliest possible flight home. When I arrived in the Philippines, I found out, one of my luggage is missing. I was told to file a report, which I did. I informed the Qantas baggage staff that I need some of the things in that luggage for my dad. She assured me they'll act on it fast. I have followed up with them many times now. It's been three days, and they can't even tell me when they can deliver my luggage. They just seem not to understand the urgency of this matter. I honestly feel, they don't care at all!

### "a low cost carrier dressed up"
Another absolute disgrace. Just a low cost carrier dressed up. Very poor attitude. How about some common courtesy? Please jut let them go bankrupt, so Australia can get a real airline.

### "making it impossible to use the flight credit"
Qantas issued me a 'flight credit' as a refund for a flight I had to cancel (I paid extra to book a ticket that permitted a refund). In theory, I am meant to be able to use this flight credit (approx $400) to purchase another Qantas flight (12 month expiry). However, they have made it literally impossible for me to actually use the flight credit. On 6 separate occasions, I have called the designated phone line and spent in total over 17 hours on hold. Each and every time I've reached someone they have said one of the following: 1) We can't process this now please call back later 2) I need to liaise with another department please call back later 3) There are no flights available (even though I provide them with an exact flight number for a flight that has seats available to be booked on their website). 4) Twice they have simply hung up after waiting for over 4 hours on hold each time 5) On my final effort, I called and they said I had a $400 flight credit. They then said I couldn't book the flight I wanted and hung up. I called back and got onto another person. They said they checked my account and I had no flight credits and that they went back to the original booking and the terms and conditions did not permit a refund. They refused any further discussion and hung up. Clearly, they are not only making it impossible to use the flight credit, but also resorting to deception and flat-out denying that I have a flight credit. They are effectively holding my money for ransom and are not providing the service.

### "This is the end for us"
Lost luggage containing essential items. Arrived 5 days later. Family holiday not just disrupted but ruined. Our youngest had only 3 days of contact lenses in hand luggage so 2 days of complete vision impairment. Return trip flight cancelled due to aircraft engineering issues and rescheduled to next day. Incurred significant cost for additional last minute hotel booking (lucky to get a booking) Upon our final arrival into Sydney en route to Adelaide no baggage handlers allocated. Bags took 90 min to come out so missed connecting flight. Very unhappy. Have been a loyal Qantas customer since I started flying. This is the end for us. If I could rate lower than one star I would.

### "abysmal customer service outcome"
Our flight was delayed which in current climate is OK On arrival in Sydney we were only able to retrieve one of our two suitcases After about 30 more minutes we and several other passengers realised our luggage was lost We eventually found luggage services and after queuing filled out a form and joined the line to lodge I lodged the form and asked what happens now The woman said I would be contacted next day and our bag would be delivered I asked is that all and she said that is all they will contact you tomorrow Tomorrow comes and I hear nothing I ring the Qantas baggage services help line I first got someone with unsatisfactory English she asked for a reference number which I didn’t receive I gave her all the details including the lost baggage barcode number However after an hour on the phone I was not any further forward and asked to be put directly in touch with baggage services in Sydney The next person who answered was in Fiji and was in sales I rang again later and after another hour and telling the call centre person this time in South Africa that my wife had heart medication in bag our case was elevated from not caring to am I bothered I had gotten no further. Another call later that day another hour wasted our case now in overnight leave it to tomorrow’s person to sort out. Rang again this morning and after another hour managed to get a file number to track my case. Just checked on line and details of lost baggage are there but no feedback on any progress. In summary the call centre is a complete waste of everyone’s time They have no ability to actually impact baggage handling at the airport where baggage is lost. So far we have lost the cost of limousine we had hired. My wife had to ring doctors to get new scripts. Also it is my wife’s birthday today and all her clothing and jewellery were in lost case So it has ruined tonight’s special evening out. I cannot rate Qantas on service as they have supplied none. Outsourcing baggage handling and overseas call centres may make a better bottom line but it has resulted in an abysmal customer service outcome!

### "avoid flying with Qantas"
Not Verified | Auckland to Gold Coast via Sydney. If I could give Qantas 0 stars, I would. Please learn from my mistakes and avoid flying with Qantas - their customer service is non-existent. My original flight was due to fly from Auckland to Gold Coast via Sydney (the original flight was supposed to take a total of 4 hours 55 mins). I subsequently received a notification ~3 weeks before I was due to fly that the flight details had changed. The connecting flight from Sydney to Gold Coast had been changed so that my total travel time would now ballooned to 13+ hours with a long overnight stopover in Sydney. I decided to request a refund for my flight and the request was confirmed as received on Feb 9. As at July 7, I have yet to receive the refund. Each time I call Qantas, I have to wait for at least 30 minutes to an hour to get through to someone. Even then, they are unable to give me any good answers other than telling me they are forwarding my query to the Finance Department. I have tried contacting Qantas via email and social media but the phone calls are thus far the only way to get some semblance of a response.

### "a nightmare from start to finish"
Not Verified |  Dealing with Qantas has been a nightmare from start to finish. This is especially galling as we are paying business class prices for economy seats. We have even tried to use our lounge passes which we have not been able through covid to be told the lounge is closed, yet on the webpage it states it is open.

### "Qantas doesn't care"
London to Sydney. After travelling for 4 days, with 50 hours delay, the luggage lost. No clothes, no important papers, no nothing. No answers, no client service, no information, no clue of where my professional material can be. Terrible service. Never using Qantas again. And Qantas doesn't care.

### "issued us boarding pass only from HBA to SYD"
Not Verified |  From the time I arrived at the Qantas desk the staff took around 40 minutes to issue me with boarding pass (for family). I was all ready for the flight making  sure that I had all the required documentation including Covid vaccine certificate, baggage properly weighed, destination country's covid requirement document (air suvidha). As soon as I arrived at the desk, the lady asked me if I had purchased additional baggage, I said that I had already checked the weights 4 times and I have less weight than what I am allowed. She took around 15 minutes to verify the covid vaccination certificate and the air suvidha form (destination country requirement) I literally had to show her the first and last vaccine dates on the printed certificate. Then she took another 15 minutes to search/look up our itinerary saying that its not showing on her computer so I had to literary show her the booking reference number and the name format on the itinerary. Another 15 minutes to check the baggage allowance, asking me if i knew how much I was allowed to which I answered and even provided my printed copy of the itinerary, she was visiting the Srilankan Airlines website to find out the allowance. The lady serving us had to call her colleague to assist her. Finally after more than 45 minutes I was issued with boarding pass but this didn't end here. She issued us boarding pass only from HBA to SYD but not the other two boarding pass. Upon enquiring she said she could only issue from HBA to SYD and advised me to go to Sydney and collect other boarding pass from there. When I asked about the transfer from domestic airport to international she replied saying that I need to take a bus or train which will cost around $6 per person to get transferred. I told her that we have not chosen self transfer and paid more so that everything was smooth as I had young family with me, she said me that she doesn't know about that and that I would require a future Qantas boarding pass to get on the bus. As the flight was delayed, Qantas failed to provide the information to the other staff on duty at receiving airport nor to the partner airline (SriLankan). The Srilankan airline almost left us because Qantas flight was delayed, luckily we could catch the flight as the staff at Srilankan airline delayed the flight for us. I am very disappointed by the behaviour and the customer service of the staff at HBA. Qantas being a reputed company my expectation were high but it was no where close to it in terms of the desk staff. I would also like to mention about the positives, the lady at the receiving Qantas terminal (gate 15) helped/rushed us to the shuttle bus which

### "Qantas is an absolute disgrace"
What a disgrace, from bag drop check in zero service. Lounge another embarrassment. Boarding was non existent. Prior to boarding wanted to ask a question , walked over to the desk, three staff standing in a circle talking, 2 looked at me and kept chatting, my question or me was never answered or my existence acknowledged. Qantas is an absolute disgrace, just become the low cost carrier you are.

### "Amazing service and staff"
Qantas truly back on track. Amazing service and staff. Wonderful food, amenities, everything was top notch. From the check in process to boarding, on board and baggage.

### "So disappointed, big time"
Not Verified |  Qantas service has failed, the misinformation, lack of assistance cost me money, time and traumatised to the passenger and yet they don’t even know their own policy. Disgusting work ethic, unfriendly operator. So disappointed, big time.

### "stuffed up my entire trip"
Not Verified | Down the toilet. I am a 25-year Qantas Member and recently had Qantas cancel and change my flights that many times, that it stuffed up my entire trip. Hold times are out to 3+ hours and they don't answer email complaints and inquiries. I cancelled my flight, and am now going with another carrier.

### "constant delays and zero service"
QF93 Melbourne to Los Angeles, constant delays and zero service from any staff. After several hours of trying to check-in, I finally made my way to the departure gate. Despite extensive delays in boarding, no announcement was ever made, and staff seemed content on setting up little poles and ropes here and there, with no indication as to why. Seated about an hour late (no communications, queries just greeted with shoulder shrugs), the first announcement I heard for the day was "the plane has a flat tyre, it'll take 45 minutes to fix it". After about 90 minutes, a clearly irritated captain came on and announced "due to Qantas policy of outsourcing its maintenance crew, we have been advised the crew that changed the tyre are not qualified to drive the jeep that pushes the plane onto the runway. We have called a bloke who may know what to do, and he will be here in about another hour". Ultimately we left 4.5 hours late, crummy meal accompanied by sullen to rude inflight service, we arrived at LAX 4 hours late (the captain congratulating himself on making up 30 minutes inflight). Missed connections for 75% of the passengers, and a dubious pre-landing announcement advised there will be Qantas ground staff available to assist with re-bookings. Needless to say, there was no one. Left to our own devices, I was able to get on the last Southwest flight, at additional expense, to my destination (my previously booked AA flight already had departed an hour earlier.) The elderly couple who had been sitting next to me looked mortified at the prospect of sleeping on the airport floor until the next flight to Maryland. They texted me at 4 am on the day of my return flight to advise me they had cancelled my Los Angeles to Melbourne flight (operational reasons!) Nothing else, just "cancelled" No information, no updates, no emails, nothing. After the usual ridiculous wait times to a non-comprehending call centre operator, I was able to organise a return to Melbourne via Sydney. Of course, it was late and only a combination of carry-on luggage, high-speed sprinting and commando rolls into the domestic terminal enabled me to make the flight home. The boarding pass I had been given didn't scan, so the gate attendant sneered at me with "boarding denied, stand aside please" as her only comment. Fortunately, a Qantas employee was on hand and showed her how to scan a barcode. Clearly irritated, she grunted at me and pointed towards the entry door. Back in Melbourne, unable to retrieve my duty-free purchases (I had foolishly believed I may return as scheduled, on the flight I had paid for), I then had to re-book (at extra expense) my connection back home to regional Victoria.

### "a bit of a nightmare"
The whole process of flying with Qantas was a bit of a nightmare. Qantas changed both outgoing and incoming flights, essentially cutting off 2 days off my 7 day trip. I went to the trouble and expense of booking a direct flight, and the changes both involved me having to fly well out of my way to another state, and then to my destination. Their response when I phoned to ask if they could change me to a more convenient flight was to cancel the homecoming flight and give me a credit. And leave me stranded in another state unable to come home. I will never voluntarily book another qantas flight if I can help it.

### "service was sullen or non existent"
Not Verified |  QF9 started late due to the aircraft being left in the hangar. There was no communication of this delay until after our boarding time had passed. No time was made up out of Perth, or at any stage, and all our connections with gates were slowed down by errors by ground crew. Nothing went well, and service was sullen or non existent. If only I could leave a no star review in the service sector.

### "I have to use the points"
This is not a good review. The Qantas lounge in Adelaide did actually have a choice this time, however it was poor as in toast, scrambled egg and baked beans. The cappuccino was decent. It would be good to have some tables that can rise as at 50 plus it’s difficult to navigate from your knees to your mouth as the tables are so low. Oh dear - the plane. Business class was sad. No wifi and the huge clumpy table not designed for a non weight lifter. The breakfast choice was … no choice. I’m sorry we have run out”. So the limp omelette and half cooked potato went uneaten. The coffee was obviously intended to put hairs on the chest or used as a spoon holder. Thank God for McDonalds. When one gets up at 4:30 for the first flight a decent coffee is an expectation, considering the price. Finally the baggage collection. Only had to wait 40 minutes today! I am only continuing to fly Qantas because I have to use the points.

### "the service was efficient"
Check in was easy. There was a large queue at security which luckily moved quickly. The plane left on time and the service was efficient. There was coffee, tea and soft drinks available. The food offered was very small, just a small package of biscuits. This is no big deal , as if was a short flight.

### "Poor service, no communication"
We waited an hour and a half for our bags to be delivered. This is longer than the flight! Poor service, no communication, had to scramble in the end because bags came out on a different carousel to the one we were told. This is the result of cost cutting and sacking their baggage handlers to save money. Really poor service Qantas!

### "Will never fly Qantas again"
Qantas advertises itself as "The Spirit of Australia". As someone who has lived in Australia my whole life, I am worried about the definition of the "Spirit of Australia". While the flight attendants were friendly enough, they were anything but attentive. The A/C was stuck on cold, and it was freezing, good thing I packed a beanie for the summer USA trip! Ground communication in relation to boarding was sub par. While I had "special meals", the amount of people in the premium economy cabin having to take the last dish on offer was atrocious. They ran out of apple juice in breakfast service. You can clearly tell where upper management has cut back budget, a pity given the price premium travelers pay. However, the worst part of the trip was the fact our plane was delayed for "cleaning", but given the state of the aircraft, I'd hazard a guess no cleaning had been done. There was mess everywhere around my seat, an empty bag of chips discarded on the ground that had been left there, a seat and tray table that hadn't been sanitised. Just horrible! The aircraft itself was fine, would have been very pleasant. Pilots were great. Qantas used to be a great airline to fly. As a 20 year Qantas frequent flyer, I've canceled my return trip and flying a different airline who actually cares. Will never fly Qantas again. You don't pay a price premium for the level of service Qantas offers. A once proud airline run into the ground.

### "happy to provide a lousy service"
Not Verified |  Terrible service in the Qantas Lounge and also had to suffer poorly managed flight cancellations. Lodged a complaint about this matter. Eight weeks later, no response to my complaint. Seems to me that Qantas is happy to provide a lousy service whilst totally ignoring the complaints of its customers. Obviously, this airline feels it can get away with this due to lack of competition in the domestic market. If only there were more competition in the domestic market as this airline would deservedly go out of business.

### "the worst service in my life"
My baggage was delay on my flight on may 22. Its been 12 days of the most stressful experience. I completed the form of delayed baggage at the Airport they told me they will Call me and they did not call. I have been losing 4 hours per day trying to contact them and also money because i have no clothes and no medicine. At May 24 they told me my baggage was in Brisbane and they will deliver it on the 25 of may, the bagagge did not arrive. Then i went to the Airport because they told me my baggage was there and they did not find it. I have to call again and yes my baggage arrived to prospine Airport on the 29 of May, its been 4 days and they can not sent the baggage to the hostel because they are a mess. They also told me i can have a Refund for the clothes i have to buy but there is no answer. I experienced the worst service in my life with Qantas

### "worst service I have experienced"
This has to be the worst service I have experienced from any airline. I was sent a first message less than 48 hours before my flight stating that my flight was cancelled. After calling customer service, and being on the call for an hour I was told that my flight is fine and nothing is wrong. 5 hours later I get another message stating that I need to call them to sort out my flight details. So I have to sit through another hour of hold just to talk to them. After this hour, I receive absolutely no help as the assistant can barely explain what happened to my flight or offer me alternatives. As a third attempt, meaning I was on the phone for 3 hours with them, the assistant, which was the best of the 3, tried to offer me alternative flights but to no avail as there weren't any flights available. This left me with accommodation cost losses as well as a holiday that was shortened by 4 days and three hours of my life I would never get back. I absolutely do not recommend Qantas and will never make use of their service again.

### "Very good service"
Not Verified |  Very good service. Attendants / cabin crew were qualified and provided excellent service. They were very responsive, polite, courteous and smiling.

### "extra points for gluten free meal and snacks"
Great service with extra points for their gluten free meal and snacks. The very generous selection of wines and spirits in economy was also stellar. Great crew and excellent IFE.

### "Not value for money"
Not Verified |  Would not fly Qantas again. Terrible check-in process both online and at the airport where they replaced service people with terminals. The plane was old and dirty. Missed my meeting because baggage was not unloaded and had to spend 45 mins waiting for my bags to be unloaded. Not value for money.

### "Paying a premium fee for a substandard service"
Not Verified |  Qantas have to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. Paying a premium fee for a substandard service. Our flights were booked 7 months in advance and cancelled two weeks prior to departure via email. No options given just a notification of the flight we have been moved to 48 hours later. 4 hours on hold to speak with the most useless customer service team to attempt rebook another flight. Qantas could not accommodate with affiliate airlines that they have advertised and sold on their website as we needed to arrive on the same day we had to have an extra 6 hours in transit. We paid an additional fee to have a bassinet seat and was told that they this would not be available on our rebooked flight.

### "legendary steak sandwich was a let down"
Following from a previous review where numerous pre-flight challenges started taking their toll prior to my PER-MEL-SYD-LAX trip, I made it onto QF17 from SYD-LAX. I upgraded to First class using the bid for upgrade option but it never showed up in my booking, however Fiona at the Qantas Melbourne customer service desk managed to get me a seat. Thanks to the lovely ladies at the Perth Business lounge who worked to try and sort it out. Prior to the flight there were no Security Fast Lane passes provided (I asked) and First customers are crammed into over-crowded buses to transfer to the international terminal. On board the reality is that you get acres of space but the catering and service is indistinguishable from Qantas Business. The legendary steak sandwich was a let down (so disappointing), I can honestly make a better sandwich at home. The champagne was excellent, as was the coffee. Toilets were clean but there were no amenities provided (just empty drawers). There is no in flight wifi. Post flight Qantas frequent flyer status credits have been incorrectly applied. I booked the trip during the “Thanks a Million” promotion but only standard points have been applied instead of double points. Needless to say this will require multiple calls, email, in person queries etc. The pre and post fight friction consumes hours of time. For the more pedantic, the inflight entertainment starts with a mandatory 30sec advertisement for a Qantas Health Insurance promotion that ended on 31st March. Watching this every time you change shows becomes tired very quickly. If the promotion ended in March why we watching it in May?

### "there must be total chaos behind the scenes"
My challenges with Qantas started even before I boarded the first aircraft on my PER-MEL-SYD-LAX trip. Qantas has cancelled and changed numerous legs of the flight in the last two days, forced me to leave a day early and rerouted me via SYD. It has also resulted in considerable anxiety with the US covid testing requirements requiring a covid test the day before travel and my flights running very close to the margin. In addition to the stress of all the changes I successfully bid to upgrade from Business to First for the SYD-LAX leg. However due to the numerous changed and cancellations by the airline I am now in the situation that I have paid for the upgrade, I have an email confirming the upgrade and the upgrade is showing on my online booking but staff cannot issue a boarding pass fir the upgrade. The most consistent message from Qantas Staff at the airport and on the phone is that staff at the next airport or next help desk will definitely be able to help. But they cant. I love this airline and I intentionally requested Qantas flights for this trip, but there must be total chaos behind the scenes to result in this kind of customer experience.

### "So much for priority service"
After Booking with fight center my direct flight from Perth to Melbourne departure from 6.05am on the 27th March 2022. And upgrading to Business class I was looking forward to catching up with family in Melbourne. At 3am that morning I received a message from Qantas that my flight was canceled and had to contact my agent. At 3 in the morning? When checking my booking on the Qantas app I found that Qantas had rescheduled My fight with no explanation, to a flight departing a 10.40 am via Adelaide with an hour and a half waiting time in Adelaide. I am 71 of years and it ended up a very long an tiresome day and due to my arrival time in Melbourne my family was not able to collect me at that time. So I needed to take a bus from the airport. After arrival into Melbourne I went to collect my bag which was lost and I ended to have to visit their luggage dept to recover my bag which was promised to be delivered to my place of residence. Now 2 day later no bag. So much for priority service. I felt a little better at the baggage depth to discover a gentleman from the same flight who was going through the same issues as me changing flights and lost luggage. This not a foreign airline and the treatment I received is totally un Australian and that has made me very sad. I am a regular flyer with many miles under my belt, I have flown 2 and a half times around the world. Due to corona I had to restrict my travel and never before have I had an experience like this before.

### "My only criticism was the meal"
Check in was easy. The plane left on time. The staff were friendly and helpful. My only criticism was the "meal". Just water and cheese and biscuits. Very paltry for such a full service airline, even if it's a short flight.

### "flight attendants were very friendly and helpful"
There was a flight delay and the departure date had to be changed. Check in was quite easy and quick, especially for such a busy period. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. The meal was quite paltry, just a small packet of biscuits. Overall a reasonable flight.

### "I will never fly with Qantas again!"
I will never fly with Qantas again! We were travelling from Melbourne to Phoenix return and they canceled our return flight a day before the return. No reason given, probably just being cheapskates and not wanting to fly a plane that might not be be full to overloaded! Moved us to a LAX to Sydney to Melbourne. instead of direct with a long lay over. As the replacement flight wasn't convenient for our other commitments we moved to a Dallas to Sydney to Melbourne flight a day later. Q tech botched our APIS info so we couldn't use the digital passport platform, had to stand in the mile long snake queue and missed our connecting flight, that they chose the timing of! Was supposed to be on the 8am connecting flight and was moved/ rebooked on a 4pm flight, how many flights does Qantas have from Sydney to Melbourne every day? If you want or need to change anything on your trip and need to get someone on the phone, good luck with that, I waited a total of 16 to 17 hours on hold in stints up to 4.5 hours long and didn't get to talk to a single human. These guys have $1.4 Billion in flight credits issued to hapless, taken for granted customers that had no other choice than to fold their cards and give in. Why bother asking you for your breakfast order, if you don't have what's on the list, I have no idea what the poor people behind me got or didn't get. I will give them credit for one thing, they smashed my wife's suitcase on the way from Australia, but they did give her a new one that she could could transfer her smalls etc. into, In the baggage area!

### "Staff was courteous and responsive"
Reasonable well, departed 30 mins late but made up some time up in air. Food and beverages are basic. Staff was courteous and responsive. The ground staff need to communicate better on delays.

### "the flights were quite good"
Not Verified |  My sister and I flew to Melbourne and returned 5 days later. I know this won't please everyone, but the flights were quite good. Previously I have written it was impossible to get hold of Qantas by the phone - same applies. The meals were quite tasty, the staff were friendly, we left Melbourne an hour late - but we did have our luggage! All in all very good flights.

### "I will never fly them again!"
Qantas has turned my first trip to America into a nightmare. QF7 to Dallas  was delayed so I missed my next flight to Jacksonville with American Airlines. Upon arrival in Dallas I was not given the next flight to JAX and had to stay overnight in hotel that was apparently “booked” for us. To make things worse my wallet was stolen on the plane and upon finding out staff were alerted but did nothing to reassure. I was given no transfers for airport to the Sheraton with the apparent “booked room” and no staff to talk to I was then routed on United Arline (which wasn’t what was on the ticket originally) to Houston then to JAX . United airlines is not oneworld carrier even. Just now that flight is delayed and I was rudely told to get on the next plane to Chicago then another to JAX. UA people said QF did this. What a nightmare. My travel agents called the agent help line which no one answers as it is a public holiday and are closed. I will never fly them again!

### "I will never fly Qantas ever again"
I can only say the worst for an airline. I have been traveling for more than 30 years and all the wrong things happened with my flight with Qantas. First off, the flight leaving Manila was late, the food was bad in the flight and the flight attendants were scarce. The in flight entertainment did not even work! Imagine 8 hours without any in flight entertainment? When we landed in Sydney, we were told that the flight was cancelled and we were on the next flight, but it should be ok, but we were booted out to Economy when I paid almost $10,000 for business class! Worse, we were at the back of the plane where 2 babies kept on crying the whole flight. Then we landed in Melbourne, and to the worst of my nightmarish flight, my bag where my medicines and other essentials did not arrive! I went to the Baggage claim staff and she verified that my bad was still in Sydney. She said that she will report and follow up, but to this day, my 3rd day in Melbourne, I still have to get my delayed bag, even with the countless times I had to call the Mishandled baggage number. And I will be leaving Melbourne tomorrow, most likely without my bag. So I now know that I will never fly Qantas ever again, even if I get a lot of discount. There are many other airlines, with better service and staff.

### "shocking customer service tactics"
Utterly shocking customer service tactics. 6 weeks after the 4 tickets were purchased, Qantas sent an email informing us that our original flight was cancelled. The website wouldn't allow us to change the flight date to any other day if the same week even though flights were available, leaving only the option to cancel and take a credit. Once you click cancel, from a consumer Law perspective it was you who cancelled the booking, at which point Qantas have no further obligation to fly you at the original fair. The ticket prices had gone up 30%, and what Qantas we're trying is to get more money. The Australian customer service line (13 13 13) is a joke, and no calls get answered in under two hours. When I was finally front of the phone queue, the operator simply hung up! They avoid providing an Australian customer service email address for the same reason. To ensure that your only reasonable option is to take a credit on the website, and then rebook at a much higher price. We will definitely never fly Qantas again if this is how they treat paying customers.

### "they have totally lost the plot post COVID"
Will never fly this airline again. I think the customer support issues with Qantas this year have already been heavily documented, but suffice to say that you better be prepared to wait at least 2-3 hours anytime you need to call them. Purchased a return ticket to Australia for $2450 - went through all the COVID testing rigmarole and then discovered the first leg of my flight was cancelled without any notice the day before my flight(TPA-DFW), which necessitated me to buy a last minute ticket on another flight at the airport for $$$ because I could not get through to Qantas support. This still has not been resolved. My return flight from MEL-TPA was cancelled, again without any notice - I just noticed it was missing all together. There followed 5 calls to Qantas to fix this issue. I tracked my total time of 22 hours on hold with Qantas 131313 customer support (there was no way to rectify this online) across 5 calls, with one call taking 7 hours (6 hours of which was hold time). Several calls were dropped after 2-3 hours, others resulted in a waste of time as 3 separate reps failed to fix my issue despite their promises. My return flights had to be changed - so my original 24 hour journey with window assignments changed to a 34 hours ordeal with middle seats! I've flown Qantas plenty of times in the past (usually 1 international flight per year) without any issue. But they have totally lost the plot post COVID.

### "No responsibility on Qantas part"
Not Verified |  So we checked our flight schedule for the day we flew out. It stated that our flight was supposed to go the next morning. We rang, on the phone for an hour and we’re assured multiple times that our flight was not altered! So, no surprise when we rocked up for check in, we were informed our flight had changed to 11:30am the next morning. No responsibility on Qantas part.

### "Customer Service simply non-existent"
March 2020 I am informed by email that my original booking reference becomes a Credit Voucher. July 2020 a second email informs me that the same Credit Voucher is now valid until Dec 2022. I now wish to use this Credit Voucher to help pay for flights to Melbourne for myself and my Fiancée, and have spent the last 7 days and over 16 hours 'holding' on the various Qantas 'Customer Service (joke) lines trying to speak to someone, to sort out why I cannot access this booking reference / credit on 'Manage My Booking'. My longest wait so far has been 4 hours 37 minutes and 23 seconds .. unbelievable, and so I eventually gave up and put the phone down! The Qantas organisation, if it can be called that, is an absolute disgrace! My Voucher / Credit is worth $837.86 and I simply cant use it until somebody answers the phone and works out what the problem is! All I receive when I input my Credit Voucher reference and Name is ... 'ERROR, WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND THIS BOOKING CONFIRMATION'. My Frequent Flyer Account says the value of the Credit is exactly half of the above ($419.83) because it only takes into account my original ticket, and not my Fiancées original ticket, but even this 50% Credit will not load properly? Once again I get 'ERROR, WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND THIS BOOKING' Finally, today a Lady in the Philippines picked up the phone after another 2.5 hour wait! She informed me that she only dealt with Frequent Flyer issues and that I needed to speak to Reservations. She then told me she would put me through to Reservations. I waited over an hour on hold again and then gave up! I made another 2.5 hour attempt to speak to someone tonight, again with no joy! Qantas Customer Service is appalling and disgusting, and simply non-existent. They know nothing of the stress they are causing their Customers. If I do ever manage to get my Credit verified with them, this will be the last time I will be using Qantas ever again!

### "Shame on you Qantas. You have no honor in service"
Not Verified |  My wife booked a flight for Hawaii to Perth for April 6, 2022. Qantas rescheduled her connecting flight that resulted in a 15 hour layover in Sydney. Numerous attempts to contact Qantas failed, wait on phone was just too painful. Upon arriving at Honolulu International airport to check-in, she was assured she would be escorted to a hotel, given a meal and returned to the airport on April 8 for her morning flight to Perth. Never happened! Alone, confused, no help, tired and very worried she was able to get a cab to a close hotel..no thanks to Qantas. My wife is 65 and is not a seasoned traveler. She left the islands happy to be able to just see her grandson in Perth. Shame on you Qantas. You have no honor in service.

### "Very poor from a so called premium airline"
Not Verified |  Flight was scheduled to leave at 7.15pm and bumped at 4pm back to 9.10 due to bad weather in Sydney delaying our plane, because I did the right thing and checked in online I didn’t get the option to get a different flight, because I had checked baggage they couldn’t change to me different flight. Flight then got delayed to 10pm Departure, now 10.40pm departure. No meal vouchers or lounge access offered as compensation for waiting around for 4 hour. Very poor from a so called premium airline. Qantas truly are the aging fleet and I don’t mean their planes.

### "the staff were very friendly"
A very enjoyable flight. Check in was easy and fast and the staff were very friendly. It was nice to have free drinks, including alcohol. A light dinner of pies and sausage rolls were served. Quite OK for a short flight. Departure and arrival were on time.

### "4800 AUD to change a ticket"
4 calls of more than 5 hours each one for an unsolved issue. They charged me 4800 AUD to change a ticket due to a positive covid case (at the airport!) This is by far the most inhumane treatment I had received as a customer. Don't ever use Qantas.

### "disgrace for a full service airline"
Our flight between Perth and Melbourne did not have back of seat screens. Yes, you could connect to internet and I believe you could access some sort of in flight entertainment but it requires passengers to have a device. When did a full service airline doing a long domestic flight require its customers to BYOD? And who wants to watch a movie on their iphone screen? My back of seat screen attaching device was broken anyway so no option even to use my own device. This is an absolute disgrace for a full service airline. If Tiger air still flew from Perth I would rather go with them at a cheaper price and not expect in-flight entertainment devices to be provided. I will be checking whether Virgin provides back of seat screens and if so will be flying with them in the future.

### "customer service is a joke"
Not Verified |  Qantas customer service is a joke. Our family has been a long time supporter of the airline but this experience is just unbelievable. We couldn’t get through on the phone after 3 days, 7 attempts of waiting more than 2-3hours. When we did finally get through the guy we spoke with, couldn’t refund our travel bank because Qantas had registered it in Fijian dollars and their system didn’t allow a conversion, then couldn’t rebook our flights unless we paid all over again. Then when we agreed to pay all over again he said the flight tickets were gone because he had reserved them for us and couldn’t unreserved them for 3 days. Then tried to charge us $1k more per person?! So now we are stuck in another country, with no refund, no tickets, and more then $8k in lost travel credit that can’t be used online- only by calling but they don’t answer calls. Unbelievable. We will never fly again with you.

### "customer service was severely declining"
Qantas, what happened to you? You are digging your own grave. Customers like myself who have supported you during this difficult time are being punished. Where's the incentive to continue? I had a connecting flight for which all legs were changed multiple times (sometimes with the first leg leaving after the second leg and from different locations). Could not speak to anyone without having to wait four hours on the phone. Rude business class flight attendants, was served unidentifiable meat and half cooked rice, no drink selection (all of this is worse than on economy, at least certainly no better. We were also served the same awful filter coffee). My seat was dirty, then after all that I had to find myself accommodation at close to midnight in a dark, deserted part of Melbourne (flight was delayed again by 5 hours at the last minute). They won't even reimburse me for it! There is nowhere to upload my receipt and I can't speak to anyone. Even after the pandemic is over, I will never fly with Qantas again. Even before the pandemic started their customer service was severely declining, but this takes it to a new low.

### "whole experience was awful"
The worst customer service I have ever received. I booked a one way flight with Qantas on the 22nd February over the phone using a voucher. Despite being told you can save time and book online, of course the website didn't allow it so I had to call. I waited hours on the phone when I initially booked. Skip forward a month I still hadn't received an email confirmation. This has happened every time I have booked with Qantas so I have wasted so many hours on hold to them just to get an itinerary sent through. After waiting several hours for a call back, an itinerary was sent by email. I noticed there was only 35 minutes between connecting flight so called back to confirm that the two flights would be the same plane. The customer service rep then told me no booking existed! After an hour on the phone there was no resolution, and I had to go into a meeting. She told me she would call back first thing in the morning to confirm it had been resolved. No surprises, she didn't call back. I called Qantas at 430PM, waited 5hrs on hold, then another 3hrs after getting through, mostly on hold, with no clue what was being done. At one stage I was placed back on hold for over an hour, with no one checking in. I spent a total of 8 hours on the phone, finishing the call at 1245AM!!!! The customer service rep and manager I spoke to were in no way apologetic and made no attempt to offer remuneration for a quite clear Qantas error. I ended up getting a flight but had to pay an additional $120, which they refused to waive! I had no choice with booking with them as there were no available flights with any other airline prior to Easter. To top it off when the eticket was emailed through, the customer service rep hung up without apologising or letting me remain on the line to provide feedback. The whole experience was awful. I won't ever be booking with them again. I'd love to say this experience is isolated to the customer service, however Qantas is by far the most expensive airline, yet most flights out of Alice Springs don't have WIFI and you don't get served meals. I have no clue what their excessive flight charges are for because it is no different experience than flying with Jetstar.

### "service is severely lacking now"
Qantas is not what it used to be. I used to like flying Qantas for the service. The service is severely lacking now. I wanted to use a credit but had trouble. The call centre doesn’t answer the phone, the social media team doesn’t respond and the customer service team doesn’t respond to emails. So I ended up having to pay for a whole new booking from scratch. The service at the airport was also poor. No one in the check in area to help with check in kiosks or luggage check. The lounge experience sucked. My wife got turned away because she was wearing flip flops. Fair enough, there’s a dress code. Went in to get takeaway coffees at least, but they were no good. The barista burned the milk. The service onboard wasn’t much better. Got a bottle of water and a packet of biscuits. Wasn’t even offered or asked if I want a coffee or a soft drink. It’s just not the premium full service it used to be.

### "a train wreck at Qantas customer service"
5 days ago i booked a return flight Adelaide to Melbourne on line (for work). I have a booking reference number. Web site said i would get a email confirming everything. But no email, no tax invoice, no charge to my credit card yet. When i go online to manage the booking, you can see it, but if you click on the flights it says "still processing". Various forums from mid March have many many people reporting similar stories - some have been charged, others not - but their flights are not confirmed. When you get to the airport - no seat. I tried to ring, 131313, but hung up after 2.5 hours. Longer than the 2 flights would take. They have a major IT problem with their booking web site. Its a train wreck at Qantas customer service right now. I used to only fly Qantas, pretty frustrating they are forcing their long term loyal customers reluctantly into the arms of their competitors. If you must fly Qantas book each leg separately, that way if one leg gets messed up at least you have 1 good flight. Also do not book motels, hire cars etc - until you get an email from Qantas confirming all good / tax receipt. It shouldn't be this hard to buy a simple return flight on line. But it is.

### "So sad for Qantas that they are burning themselves to the ground"
Not Verified |  So sad for Qantas that they are burning themselves to the ground. I remember when they were a 4-star airline. The prestige and premium quality is long gone and in its place a stressed budget national airline desperately clinging to its reputation and brand from years gone. The problems I have experienced: - 3x Calls now all exceeding 5 hour wait times - Used points to book 5 tickets in September and the flights were cancelled by Qantas and over a month later they have still not credited my points back and so I have since missed out being able to book other flights using classic rewards. Upgraded an upcoming flight for a couple hundred dollars and received an email asking for me to call to sort out payment within 24 hours or they will cancel my ticket which was thousands of dollars. Have been on hold for 6+ hours now and still going.

### "lost all confidence in Qantas"
Not Verified |  My partner bought a return trip from London to Perth last year (flying in June this year) and we thought all would be fine as long as the border opened in time. Over the past few months Qantas has been sending him emails with his flight times changing constantly, giving him long stopovers with nowhere to sleep in between and no option to change the flights to a more suitable one. There is no way to update your flights online and no way to 'accept' the changes. He thought he would call the customer service centre and ask them to change it but couldn't get through, even waiting over 2 hours on the call at one point before giving up. All the while being charged for the call. It was then that I discovered the hundreds of upset customers on various forums who were having the same issues and worse (such as flights being cancelled for no reason). We lost all confidence in Qantas at that point and he rebooked his flight on Qatar Airways. Unfortunately, it looks as though he might not see a refund from Qantas as there is no way to contact them and he has lost thousands because of it. Apparently they charge cancellation fees and give you a 'credit', which is fair enough when the cancellation is due to personal reasons, but not when it is because of airline incompetence. How can such an iconic airline degenerate to this and keep operating? And they are still advertising! So many more unaware customers are going to fall victim to this, which is completely not acceptable.

### "I like so many other people have tried ringing Qantas"
Not Verified |  So Disappointing. I like so many other people have tried ringing Qantas - it's hopeless. I had to pay extra on my flights and did so. The website says I did not pay the money, and trying to get someone from Qantas to listen to me appears a hopeless proposition.

### "one of the worst in terms of customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst in terms of customer service. It makes me worry what else they are cutting corners on if they won't even spend the minimal level of money on employing people to help customers with their issues. I have a credit from a flight that was impacted by the pandemic, and I have just waited on the phone for an hour and ten minutes only to have the line drop out and no-one bother to call back. This has happened before, and they are doing nothing about it. I would expect this of very dodgy businesses, hence my dismay that Qantas is clearly heading this way. Shame on those who feel it is ok to take people's money but not provide the support systems for them if they need any actual service or assistance. Very disappointed.

### "serious customer service issues"
Former Australian Icon now takes the 2022 crown for the most incompetent Australian company. Have 1 connecting international flight and have had to call them 6 times so far. They limit phone contact with 1 number and a skeleton staff. Their message says "Our staff are working very hard to help you". They just don't have enough staff and gaslight everybody into thinking they have this incredible extraordinary level of demand. Started with a surname issue and ended up ringing them 6 times so far: 1. Waited 3.5 hours and the customer service person said she had changed the name (soon discovered she did nothing). 2. Rang back again to get the name changed and waited 4.25 hours before call answered (this time the name was changed). 3. Had to change the departure date but the Manage my Booking would not let me because a name change had been made. Rang and waited 3.5 hours. Customer service person arranged for a flight credit which was emailed straight away and abruptly disconnected the call. 4. More than 30 hours had passed and I could not book another flight as the flight credit did not work (disrupted our whole itinerary). Called customer service again waited just over 4 hours and the call was disconnected on pick up. 5. Rang again and waited about 1.5 hours before speaking to customer service person (voice sounded the same as person in 1. above). She attempted to fix the flight credit but it still did not work (the error message changed from: "The flight voucher is still being prepared" to "This voucher can’t be used online. For assistance, call 13 13 13 (in Australia) or your local Qantas office. This will open a new tab or window in your browser. She started to book a new flight for us but when questioned about seating she said we would have to wait 24-36 hours before we could select. I expressed my concern as we are a family with 2yr old and 9mth old children. After further discussion I requested a refund and was told she would check and then she disconnected the call - never rang back. I am waiting on the phone again now (for just over 1.75 hrs). Qantas has serious customer service issues from quantity/quality of staff through to its thoughtless structured online processes. If good customer service is important for you - do not fly with Qantas.

### "I will never, ever use Qantas again"
Flight not taken yet because it had to be cancelled! Checked online with Qantas to see if I could get back to Perth via Singapore. Explained to them that I was stuck in the Philippines, and that I would have to overnight in Changi. No problems for me doing this, I've been to Changi many times before. My original flight was meant to be Cebu - Singapore - Perth. I was due to depart on March 27th. (Yes, I know that it's in the future). When I went for my pre-departure COVID-19 RT-PCR test, Scoot(no QF!) advised me that there was no code sharing in place with the two airlines, and that I would be unable to transit overnight in Singapore. I had already explained my situation to QF staff who had told me that everything would be fine. I filed a complaint online with QF about 2 weeks ago on their Facebook page. No reply. And there has been a major communications outage in Cebu after typhoon Odette passed through. A week or so ago, I looked at the QF webpage to see what I could do, and they give no refunds, only flight credits. Surely there must be some law against this? I will get the issuer of my credit card to look into this further. All I know is that I will never, ever use Qantas again, even for domestic flights within Australia. Even though Scoot is a budget airline, and despite my recent complaints about their cancellations on me, they at least managed to bring my flight forward and get me home, so kudos to them. Not so keen on the Australian Federal Government for allowing state leaders to chop and change when people are allowed to enter on a whim. Hoping that the industry gets back to what it used to be this year. But as for Qantas, done your dash with me. A new airline is supposed to be starting this year, an airline called "Bonzer". Are they any better than QF or Virgin Australia? Remains to be seen. But they would be hard pushed to do any worse.

### "unfortunately Qantas has lost what it once took pride in"
Not Verified |  As I scroll down below through all the comments over the past week alone (Today's date is 2/03/2022), there is a common theme that is clear as day, unfortunately Qantas has lost what it once took pride in - genuine customer first approach and excellent customer service. That has now completely gone out the window. I booked flights to Europe a week ago, which took 2 hours over the phone as I was using a flight voucher - customer service rep didn't know how to apply a voucher. Three days later, flight was cancelled and was told by the second customer service rep - this was due to operational challenges and/or airport restrictions, then she told me her Team Leader would get on a call with me, waited another 90 mins and the phone died. Called again next day, 2 hour wait, 45 mins with another customer service rep who I told multiple times, to call me back if the phone dies, guess what - phone died and no call back. Called the next day, spoke with a lady who was based in South Africa - seemed like I was getting somewhere here - said she would follow up with Emirates who was the airline I was actually flying with, and then would call me back the following day. I asked her to promise me - she promised - she didn't. Today - called again and spoke with another non interested customer service rep - explained again for the forth/fifth time and asked to speak to her Team Leader - said she would pass on the message and her Team Leader would call me in 90 minutes - still no call 3 hours later. I still have no flights booked and cannot contact Qantas! This is absolutely not ok and unacceptable. As a Gold Status member - I will not be using Qantas again after this week. There is enough evidence on this page alone for a serious investigation into Qantas's Customer Service operations by 60 Minutes. Qantas - is there anybody there who can help me please?

### "never experienced such a bad customer service"
I booked a business class ticket to Adelaide from Brisbane 2 weeks before departure. After booking I've never received an e-ticket or confirmation per email. I was only able to see my booking online and on the Qantas app. I didn't change any of my existing details with Qantas and on the same email address I've received tickets and confirmations before. After that I've tried to request an invoice online multiple times which ended in receiving an error message. I also tried to call customer service, which I gave up after waiting 1 hour in the queue and the offered call back never came. Before the flight I checked in online which worked fine and received my confirmation of check-in and my boarding pass. Then, 2 hours before departure I received a call from Qantas and they told me the flight is oversold and I have to take the next one, which is 10 hours later or downgrade to economy class. Due to I had to be in Adelaide at a certain time I didn't have a choice and agreed to take the economy ticket, mostly I fly economy anyway. When I asked what the price and the refund is going to be it turned out Qantas charges me $800 for a eco-flex ticket which usually only cost $600, and I know because I have booked that ticket multiple times before and even my return flight is eco-flex for $600. The lady on the phone told me she can only give me the currently available price which of course is much higher 2 hours before departure. So, not only am I downgraded shortly before the flight, on top of that I am punished for Qantas mistake of overselling and have to overpay for a ticket just to get to my desired destination in time without being offered a better deal or any kind of compensation. It's really not nice to feel being taken advantage of because I have a schedule. Unfortunately Australia doesn't have many airlines to choose from and they get away with bad customer service. I guess they need more competition to be forced to improve their services. I never experienced such a bad customer service in over 10 years of frequent flying. 90% of my over 200 flights were done with Star Alliance and they offer great service. That really makes me miss the times back in Europe where airlines can't afford bad service and still value their customer especially when flying business class.

### "Customer Service is just horrible"
Not Verified |  The Customer Service for Qantas is just horrible. I have been flying with them for work for 9 year now and have had no issues in the past but there is no longer anyone who will answer your phone call. I tried to book 3 seat for my family to fly from MEL to LAX but as my son is under 2 years of age, they could not give him his own seat. I understand this but Qantas has the ability to book additional seats on flight for comfort reasons. I just wanted to make sure he was not sitting on our laps for 14 hours. They explain it on their website quite well. I was not sure how to properly enter this transaction code online so I thought a phone call would get this done properly. The Customer Service Rep was convinced my son needed to be booked for the bassinet seat but he does not qualify for this as he is over 18 months of age. I spent 90mins going back and forth trying to make the right booking and we ended on putting in a bassinet request with 2 tickets issued. I will not have to call back this week and try and speak to someone who knows what they are doing and get them to issue a third seat. Qantas is quickly regressing to the mean with their awful customer service via the phone. I can see why they are bleeding market share to someone like Rex on local routes with the premium they charge in price.

### "been on hold now for 4 hours"
Not Verified |  I booked three tickets to NZ on Wednesday and the full fee was charged to my credit card on The same day. On Thursday the same credit card had three individual charges for each ticket. I have been on hold now for 4 hours (no other way to contact them known). Absolutely despicable! I have avoided flying with Qantas generally because I hate their inflight service (surly generally) but this is literally unbelievable. I’m just going to call my bank to dispute the charges.

### "mask up and down between bites"
Want to hear stupid? Being given a meal and drink then ordered you must put mask up and down between bites and swigs. I have flown overseas and domestically and never had a problem being allowed to eat a meal and have a drink.

### "Worst possible customer service"
Not Verified |  Never book with Qantas! Worst possible customer service I have ever experienced. I paid for international flight tickets using BPAY through their website because they have ludicrous extra charges for every other form of payment, and they never processed the payment. It is literally impossible to get in contact with them. I have been on the phone for a cumulative 15 hrs, including one 6 hr straight period, and was still unable to talk to anyone. I went directly to the airport and their person there told me that airport staff can do nothing. Qantas were the ones that never processed my tickets, and yet I have had to spend many hours trying to rectify their problem, and even their airport staff are useless and completely unhelpful. The staff member at the airport told me that all I could do was leave a complaint, so I hope this review will mean that less people chose Qantas and have to experience what I have.

### "Qantas changed the flight time"
Not Verified |  I have a booking 23/4 Sydney to Adelaide. Qantas changed the flight time, making it previously 1240, now 1040. Impossible for me to make on time. Only way to contact Qantas is by phone. Trust me, no other way. Rang 131313 at 15.30, still hanging on the phone at 20.00 hearing absolute rubbish adverts. Then hung up, Disgraceful.

### "very poor service and food"
I really didn’t know if I was flying Jetstar or Qantas. I travelled this so called full services carrier Qantas, very poor service and food offering. Changed my check in seat, without even advising me. This airline is extremely poor service. Staff are arrogant and not interested. Food was embarrassing. Never fly them again.

### "pathetic process to book bassinet"
A pathetic process to book bassinet. We have booked online and allotted to someone else without the informing. Will never use this airline again.

### "extremely rude and unfriendly"
Sandwich was frozen. Crew were extremely rude and unfriendly. Very embarrassing. That the catch phrase is spirit of Australia. Just disgraceful.

### "Overall it was an acceptable trip"
Nothing exceptional today. I try to use Qantas as they are the only true full service carrier. Booked seats 26 E and F and nobody sat in D so I was able to stretch out. My partner is a large man and during take off and landing I felt squished. A snack was offered of pretzels nuts corn chips and salsa which was nice with a soft drink and water but no additional drinks offered. Certain travellers were offered alcohol but no one else was. My last flight with Qantaslink for only and hour had two drink services. The cabin crew were quite curt and i was barked at while putting something in my nag before I stowed it. The plane itself is aged but clean, I like the free wifi and was lucky that I found the usb ports under the seat in front of me. Overall it was an acceptable trip but a long way off the friendliness that I know Qantas is capable of.

### "she advised the flight was closed"
Arrived 2 minutes late for check in at a regional airport and there was no staff to check us for our Qantas flight. Virgin Australia frights staff advised us to go past security and the Qantas staff are at the gate which will help you. Another 5 mins getting past security we got to the Qantas staff and viewed our plane arriving from Sydney for pick up passengers at Coffs Harbour. The staff member from Qantas said she would get her supervisor who arrived 5 min later, she advised the flight was closed and we would have to book another flight.

### "staff do not provide any service over the phone"
Not Verified |  Qantas changed my booking and there is no number to call that you don’t have to wait for over 2 hours to be served. I got a call back after 1.5 hours to be told I’d be put on a quick hold while they fixed the issue which was that they changed my domestic flight so that I wouldn’t have time to transit in Sydney to make my international flight. Spoke to someone for 2 minutes to be told I’d be put on a quick hold - I waited another 1 hour and then they disconnected the line. We have had our booking changed by Qantas multiple times the staff do not provide any service over the phone and it is impossible to fix it on line, their website constantly reports errors when your try and fix your booking. Even with all the money the government has bailed them out with they are becoming worse than a Ryanair or a terrible airline. If there was a choice I would never travel with Qantas.

### "Complete disregard for customers"
Previously flown on a repatriation flight which was basic but expected and accepted given the circumstances. Have now booked LHR-DRW-PER but Qantas have changed the DRW layover to minus 27 hours, so the plane departs for Perth whilst I'm still meant to be checking in at Heathrow. It was fine when I booked and had confirmation. 4 hours plus on the phone to see whether this is an error but no-one picks up the phone. No response after 36 hours plus on Twitter and no email support available. Read around and realise it seems to be a company ploy to get you to part with your money. I paid extra for seat selection which now goes to waste and I'll need to take a hit asking the agent for a refund and waste more time sorting out a flight with a more reputable carrier, probably Qatar Airwaus or Emirates. Complete disregard for customers and no care about reputation as the national flag carrier.

### "Shame on you Qantas"
I booked a flight for my mother from Victoria BC Canada to Melbourne and Qantas reduced the layover time to 1 hour from 3 hours. When my mum got to the airport they wouldn’t let her board the plane because the connection was too short. I called Qantas twice each waiting 3.5 hours on hold and my call got dropped both times. When I did get through they put me back on hold when I explained the issue and then my call was dropped again. Clearly they don’t want to book my mother on another flight because if I cancel from exhaustion I will need to pay a last minute full fair ticket. I logged in online and the ticket has been frozen and told me to call. My only option now is to cancel since I can’t get through. Shame on you Qantas. I haven’t seen my mother in 2 years from the pandemic. I am a loyal customer and you are hateful people. She is 70 years old and cried because she hasn’t seen her granddaughter in 2 years.

### "I would have to pay a no-show fee"
On 4th January 2022, I showed up two hours prior to my flight from Nice, France to Sydney, Australia, willing to board my Qantas flight to Dubai (operated by Emirates). At the check-in counter, I was informed that I was not going to be able to board the flight because of issues with a layover in Brisbane. Despite showing them an Australian government website page that stated that layovers of less than 8 hours were accepted without quarantine, they did not want to know and said I was not able to board the flight and that I would have to rebook. When asking if I could rebook a flight with them, they said that I had to call their customer service line (with the unavoidable 2 hours wait as is ordinary for airlines). I did everything I could to get another ticket with the same departing flight from Nice, including asking some relatives to line up on the customer line for me. I finally got a ticket sold to me, knowing my current situation, only to being told that the check in was now closed (I bought the ticket on the phone in front of them at the desk). Following hours on the phone to begin the process of refund, I got told that they cancelled the Dubai-Brisbane flight that I was supposed to get. I also learned that I would have to pay a "no-show" fee if I were to ask for a refund, as the ticket was not cancelled at least 24 hours prior to departure. Emirates and Qantas say they cannot do anything. It is to me unacceptable that major airlines treat you this way and tell you face to face you were not able to board (they must have had a record of my name to tell me this), and later tell you that you did not show up to the flight. I will revoke my Qantas frequent flyer card and seriously consider flying with them again.

### "Qantas are not fixing their problem"
Not Verified | Frequent flyer booking was not ticketed at Qantas end. Making the Iberia flight cancel for my husband to travel in two days. Ive been on hold three times 45mins, 1hr, 2hrs. Finally someone helped me and they have requested seat back from Iberia. It's not good enough that Qantas don't ticket the booking and seats cancel. No one at Qantas contacted me, I just went online to print out his details this morning and noticed one of his flights has cancelled. Qantas taking long time to answer my calls on international phone. This is costing me a fortune due to qf problem. Negative covid test required 24hrs prior. Australia border form in for this booking date. Next flight available not till 12 Feb four days later. Why does this happen, ok Qantas ticket centre error, but why can't it just get fixed we didn't do anything wrong, but Qantas are not fixing their problem. My husband needs to get back to Australia.

### "do not accept liability for minor damage to baggage"
I only traveled with Qantas to use a credit that took a life time to receive, the fare was not comparable but my complaint this time is regarding treatment of my luggage. I travelled with Qantas in January, my suitcase which had been secure and in good condition was on the baggage return open. The zip sliders on both ends of a double zip had been severely damaged to the extent they had been snapped off and the baggage lock was also snapped off rendering the suitcase unusable. This is on both ends of the suitcase? I have tried to resolve this with Qantas however their response was "We do not accept liability for minor damage to baggage such as scratches, scuffs, zips, dents, cuts or any other marks arising through normal wear and tear". Normal wear and tear I accept but the damage has rendered the suitcase unusable.

### "Pick up your game Qantas"
Absolutely vile non existent service, the staff could not have cared less. Too busy standing up front gossiping. When the attendant did walk down the aisle she only came to row 2 and turned around. Except when attending to the pilot next to me. I was seated in row three, next to a pilot who was travelling free, he got much better service than I did. I did eventually get the attention of a crew member from economy, this should not happen. You have 3 rows, 12 passengers max in Business, you need to be attentive. The price you charge for these domestic legs does not match the service, food or drinks offered. Pick up your game Qantas.

### "pathetic customer service"
Didn't fly. Cancelled the booking and changed to another airline due to their pathetic customer service. Incorrect information on the website about how to make a change we needed. Hours spent on the phone trying to change the booking and having my call disconnected several times by the call centre staff (instead of answering they just 'dump' the call to reduce their backlog). Followed by failure to process my refund - so ten weeks later I am calling them again and being 'dumped' by their phone system. And no effort to expedite my refund - another 8 week wait. QF seems to think that I should be grateful for the chance to give my money to them.

### "not honour their commitment"
Fully refundable - their idea of fully is very different from mine! Was told would get 100% refund of the points and the $. Got the points and when the refund of the $ was calculated, it was short of what was actually paid. Also was going to take 8-12 weeks. Only a few dollars - but if they are doing that for every customer. Queried the difference as soon as notified of the amount - so 8-12 weeks before it was paid and was told "difference is the credit card fee and this will be refunded when the rest is". When it was not, I contacted Qantas, using the same customer service reference. 4 follow ups over 4 months plus Facebook message, no response, nothing. Terrible service. Appreciate these can be difficult times, they are for everyone. We spent the extra to ensure the trip was fully refundable, yet Qantas still feel they have the right not only to not honour their commitment, but then not respond at all. For the same trip, booked one of the legs with British Airways - they were able to refund the points and every $ and cent 48 hours after the request, and that was over the weekend. For another Emirates flight, another trip - they refunded all out money, every cent within 4 days - so really there is no excuse Qantas can use - other can do it.

### "Absolutely horrible customer service"
Absolutely horrible customer service. I called and waited 2.5 hours on hold, when I finally got someone on the phone and asked my question, they immediately hung up on me. What a joke. Thanks for wasting my time. I will never fly with this company again, and I will tell everyone I know that it's not worth their time or money to even consider giving Qantas their business.

### "the worst customer service by far"
I will never fly with Qantas again. Qantas has the worst customer service by far. I had a ticket to return to Australia early January, however I wanted to change my flight to return to Australia late January as I wanted to spend more time with my family. As the flights were international I couldn't change these online, I needed to call Qantas. When I was still in Australia I called Qantas 3 times. The first time I requested a call back. I received a call back 3.5hrs later. I picked up the phone and the call immediately ended. I then called Qantas again and was on hold for 3.5hrs. The call then ended on me. When I arrived in Prague I called the number Qantas has on their website for calls to Qantas in the Czech Republic. I reached an aviation centre who told me they could not help and I needed to call Qantas. Why was this number on the website when it wasn't even linked to Qantas? I then went to the UK and bought a cheap SIM for the sole purpose of calling Qantas. Again I was on hold for 4hrs and never made it through. Eventually my only option was to cancel my flights and rebook. I have now rebooked through KLM and will never book with Qantas again. Two weeks later and I am still waiting to receive a flight credit for these cancelled flights. You would expect for Australia's most expensive airline that their customer service would be much better. I am never booking through Qantas again. They have wasted my money and so much of my time.

### "overall a good experience"
I enjoyed the flight. Staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. The flight left on time and it was nice to have some IFE. I appreciated the free drinks. I was offered another beer! I was expecting a bit more food for a late afternoon flight though. All I got was cheese and crackers! But overall a good experience.

### "Very friendly and efficient staff"
I enjoyed the flight. Very friendly and efficient staff from throughout. Check in was easy and the flight left on time. Food was quite small, but that is no problem given it was such a short flight.

### "terrible service"
Not Verified | New York to Sydney. I transferred my points from a credit card to Qantas thinking I'd be so excited traveling from the USA to Australia. However, when the pandemic hit, Qantas only gave an extra 3 months and after that, if the account wasn't used, the points would expire. I called and explained that there was no way to use the points for travel due to the closing of every country. But, I'd gladly use it on other merchandise and pay for the shipping to USA but they wouldn't hear of it. They canceled the points. I called them to see if anything could be done, but they always hung up - terrible service.

### "problems you may have with the refund"
The booking process was fine in each of my 4 bookings. The change process was fine in 2 where the automated system does a credit, then allows me to re-use the credit. What is not fine is any problems you may have with the refund or anything else at all. The system is fully automated with manual queries not being answered in any way whatsoever. Doing a refund outside the auto system. I tried multiple phone calls ... complete waste of time, the call stretches on over an hour and then cuts off. They never reply to any emails. 8 weeks sent three times. Another booking would not work with the auto system either. This was through trip.com and i approached them. Trip.com were great. Answered emails immediately. They fixed the issue, re-issued the booking, then sent to Qantas. And there it has sat for a month. So, even the clout of Trip.com does not move these incompetents at Qantas. The booking in is still 11 months away, so I have time, but they are truly useless.

### "Terrible customer service on the booking system"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service on the booking system. To change fully flexible flights, supposed to only need to press “change booking” button online, but this had an error for 48 hours even though I tried multiple phones and computers. Then I called, was on hold for 3 hours to a call Centre, and then hung up on as soon as it connected. So stressful when you have to add PCR tests by a deadline so ended up going ahead with original flight. I used to be a loyal Qantas customer but no longer. If Alan Joyce begged all his customers to come back then why didn’t he have the technology and if that fails, the human service to back it up?

### "Its all going down"
Good wifi. Flew on a lunchtime flight where a light meal is provided. Got the most incredibly bland and skimpy beef sandwich finger. The beef was sliced so thin it was almost invisible to the naked eye sideways. It barely covered half the finger and some of that was fat. Flavor was dry bread. They just don't get it. Its an insult. And there's nothing you can buy to replace it. They hand out free alcohol on many flights when many people don't drink alcohol or want it on a flight. But food is important to all people. It doesn't need to be gourmet but it does need to be time appropriate, journey length appropriate and of a reasonable standard. Perhaps they are struggling financially and cant afford the extra dollar or two. And what happened to those delicious hot/salad boxed meals from a few years back. Most my friends agreed they were often better than their business class meals. Not surprising since my only 4.5 hour business class flight was offered the choice of fish pie or caesar salad. Down, down. Its all going down.

### "Total experience awful"
Not Verified | 26 Dec 2021 family trip to Cairns from Melbourne 2.20 flight. Paid to get passes to the Qantas lounge about $200 for the four of of us ok free drinks. Food abysmal. Ploughman plate 2 bits of ham, tiny bread roll, piece of cheese, and I think sliced gherkin. Pasta was cold ,some sort of dry salad and fruit, no newspapers or mags because of covid. Flight greeted with the most surly cross angry and rude staff on flight, no greeting from the pilot. Surly and cross staff barked at you about masks, no pleasantry’s, welcome aboard or when we got off. Food for 3.5 hour flight, cheese and crackers - that’s it. Old aircraft with no screens no menu. If I did not have to get the return flight I wouldn’t. Also paid for extra legroom for my daughter who is 6 foot tall, never had a problem any other airline in exit seat, she is 14 and was sat with her father is 6 ft 6 made her move to cramped seat. Total experience awful.

### "experience was simply stressful and unacceptable"
Not Verified | I paid for our tickets on 12 September 2021. About 10 December we had still not received our ticket so I called Qantas to inquire. It took more than two hours waiting to speak to someone, while being tortured by their advertising. After a lengthy time on the phone - more than two hours, the matter was resolved and tickets were emailed to me. Today 24 December I tried to check-in online, but couldn't because the website said I hadn't paid the fare. I spent about an hour waiting for a person in an overseas location to answer. Her said he would fix the problem and do our seat allocation. After a while I was put on hold and listed to their music for about ten minutes before the call ended and I was sent to their "How did we do" entity. With the issue of check-in unresolved I called back again - after waiting about 3/4 of an hour I was told that seat allocation couldn't be done because "the airport had control of the seats", but that it appeared my wife and I were allocated seats on different rows. I was informed I should talk to the staff at the airport if I wanted to change this seating allocation. At this point my sense of frustration and despair deepened. The start of our holiday had been ruined by Qantas' incompetence. About ten minutes later I received a text message saying that online check-in was available and providing details of how to check in. I tried to use this service several times but every time the website responded that there is a problem and try again later. For an airline that prides itself as excellent, this overall experience was simply stressful and unacceptable. Qantas is now my airline of last resort.

### "extremely bad experience"
My flight got cancelled. For refund I had to wait for hours on the phone with no luck as the line drops off every 3-4 hours. This issue is still not resolved. Poor service and extremely bad experience.

### "Greeted by surly attendant"
Precious FA's. Greeted by surly attendant demanding I turn my boarding pass from 45° to straight. Like she cant read on 45° or tilt her precious head. So which one of us needs to try a little bit harder. First impressions. Hostile. Ancient 737. No IFE but good wifi. Refreshment on 9.30am flight was pathetic. A tiny packet of sweet miniature biscuits. For a 3 hour flight. Was starving before we even arrived. Food really does matter on full service airlines where there's no option to purchase. Don't skimp. Precious flight attendants not seen after what must have been an incredibly exhausting 20 minute service handing out tiny biscuits and collecting wrappers. Sorry to say, Ive had better on both their competitors. And as per previous comments, return flight has been changed by 4 odd hours to an inconvenient time. Competitors are better and their FA's aren't generally precious.

### "Very satisfied"
Very satisfied. My trip to the airport was delayed by heavy rain so I didn't arrive at the airport on time and missed the check in deadline by a few minutes. Yet the staff very kindly allowed me to check in my baggage. There was a delay on the flight, but nothing serious. It was nice to have free alcohol and food. Dinner was small (three party pies), but fine for a short trip. No IFE, but again no big deal for such a short trip.

### "delays and cancellations a regular thing"
Not Verified |  Incompetent organisation with delays and cancellations a regular thing, just rubbish. There is no one to really complain to and if there was, all you get is operational reasons. They steal my time with no care at all. In these Last few weeks I have had a flight canceled and had to wait 3 hrs for replacement, also sat on runway fit two hours waiting for them to fix it, the flight I am now waiting for has just been delayed and the plane type changed so I now have a terrible seat,  but who cares? Not Qantas

### "Not good enough Qantas!"
Three flights with Qantas this week and all 3 flights were delayed. One flight can be forgiven as things can go wrong but 3 flights in the same week is really poor. Not good enough Qantas!

### "Woeful Airline"
Not Verified |  Woeful Airline. QF824, 4 May. Knowing the aircraft had problems - the full aircraft departed. Soon it became evident that there was no air conditioning - which remained for the 4 hour journey flying in the tropics. Totally oppressive as were the surly cabin crew.

### "Miserable and abusive behaviour"
Miserable and abusive behaviour! I counted 17 hrs on hold during last 3 days with the customer's service, no answer for redeeming a voucher following a flight cancelled 2 years ago. I used all possible time to call even between 2 and 6 am, the result is the same. I would probably abandon this voucher of 2000$ as I won't see any other approach. That is again what Qantas does to the people that supported them when they clearly abandoned the country while the other continued to serve us.

### "truly and utterly horrible"
I am not usually the type to write negative reviews, but Qantas' customer service has been truly and utterly horrible. I will not be flying with them again, and I would advise you to do the same. Not only do they place you on hold for 3-4 hours at a time, but they also hang up on you when you finally make it through to chat with someone. Even when you call at 2 or 3am, there's always extremely long hold times - I had to call about 9 or 10 times throughout the week until I finally got through to someone, only to have them hang up on me. I called again, was placed on hold for 45 mins, then they hung up on me again. At 4am, after being placed on hold for 2 hours - when I finally spoke to someone about obtaining a refund, they were extremely pushy, rude - they sounded extremely annoyed at me for asking for a refund, when Qantas had completely changed my flights and rendered my trip unfeasible. I think Qantas should be the ones apologising and accomodating to me, instead of making me feel like I'm inconveniencing them for asking for a refund? Firstly, I felt pressured to converting my flights into credit instead of a refund, of which I did not want. Secondly, I felt like I was being rushed to get off the phone (despite having been placed on hold for so long, multiple times). I asked if I could get an email confirmation of the refund, and that was met with hostility. Inexcusable behaviour, really! Don't understand why they don't just open up a live chat (would be so much easier to get in contact with ANYONE that could help), or hire more staff to be able to handle these issues? It's inexcusable that a big airline like this makes you wait 3-4 hours at a time and then hangs up, or when you do get through, you're met with someone who's rude and just wants to get you off the phone.

### "It’s been nothing less than heartless of Qantas"
Not Verified |  What a complete scam! My friend and I had flight to New York booked for July 2020 which were naturally cancelled due to covid. We realised this year it would be impossible for us to fly again soon and use the credits so for over 6 months have been calling Qantas help centre to get a refund and no response. We have been given mixed information by Qantas on when our credit expires and are completely stressed out that we will loose the $3500 because we can’t get in contact with Qantas to confirm anything! Both of us are uni students and this was a large part of our savings. It’s been nothing less than heartless of Qantas to not give full refunds during these COVID times and I’m shocked at the void of customer service on call lines (a clear representation of how understaffed the company is after big layoffs). Disappointed.

### "still no refund 8 weeks later"
Flight cancelled by Qantas and still no refund 8 weeks later. I've complained twice with zero communication. This company needs to reigned in by the government, they are scamming people and breaking the law by stealing money.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Very poor customer service. Needed to change flights, Qantas staff at counter told me to go away and call the helpline. 45 mins waiting on phone still couldn't get through. Gave up. What a bad company, and what poor service.

### "Thoroughly disappointed"
Not Verified |  On May 17th, I travelled with Qantas from Brisbane to Hobart, I was travelling with two surfboards that had been extensively well packed and secured within their board bag. The following day I found that both boards had been destroyed during the flight. One board had been completely snapped, and the other badly creased. The amount of force needed to cause this damage is extensive, and almost humanly impossible. I contacted Qantas upon arrival home, however it was out of the 3day limit (unbeknown to me) and they refused to do anything. Waited over 7 more weeks to discuss the issue with someone further. Upon no contact after two months of lodging a case, I rang on my own terms and was put through to Jackie at the complaints team who was absolutely lovely, helped all she could and transferred me to Linda who was incredibly rude, talked over me throughout the conversation, and would not listen to what I had to say. The way in which I was treated was disgusting and there was no remorse for $3,000 worth of damage of brand new equipment, with receipts, and photos with time and dates on them. Will discontinue any travel with Qantas in the future. And encourage others to do so also. Thoroughly disappointed.

### "Expected infinitely better service"
Not Verified |  Qantas cancelled the Sydney to Hamilton Island flight during the covid lockdown. Fair enough. However, they did not cancel the return flight! That is ridiculous. 2+ hour wait on the phone to request a refund for the first leg. That should be automatic! 0m validity for the credit voucher for the second leg not yet cancelled, completes the ridiculousness of this entire shambles. Expected infinitely better service from you Qantas. Everyone shows their true colours in adversity, and yours are not that bright. Absolutely 1 start rating. Zero is sadly not an option.

### "Seriously disappointed"
Not Verified |  Seriously disappointed. Flew from Brisbane - Cairns with Jetstar, no problem. Same bag going back on Qantas, too heavy. Still within the total ticket limits but bag was over by 2kg. If I paid $35 more, they would take the bag as it was. So they were able to lift it, and it was within the ticketed weight limits, but they just wanted to collect more bonus for Alan Joyce? Qantas is totally un-Australian.

### "recommend avoiding this company"
I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding this company at all costs. No dramas with taking your money and if all goes well, but God forbid you need a refund. I have waited months and months of back and forth to no avail, several weeks between each reply where they don't even read what I've written and just throw a copy and paste that is of zero help and doesn't resolve anything. Then another few weeks before they do the same to my reply. Told me to get advice from the bank, I got it, provided it to them, and they did the exact opposite of what the bank suggested - refunding to an old account, which is no longer retrievable - so they have literally lost me several hundred dollars because they didn't take the advice they asked for. Have made me waste hours on numerous in person visits and phone calls with my bank, hours of wasteful messages, and all the while have zero empathy and zero recognition of their own mistake - and a complete refusal to even read a word I say and acknowledge what has happened. Must not have a copy and paste for that. They can't even, after months of asking, simply call me to discuss. They refuse to escalate and refuse to call me. Waste of time, waste of money, disgusting service. Would literally pay 10x as much for a flight through someone else simply to avoid this company who talk in circles and ignore everything I say. Steer clear especially in times like these where you are likely to have to deal with customer service. That's too generous a name for this team of thieves.

### "I will never travel Qantas again."
I was booked from Adelaide to Auckland via Melbourne with absolute assurance at booking time that my bag could be checked right through as I am elderly and cannot handle my checked in baggage myself. Sadly, Qantas cancelled the morning flight and insisted I had at my own expense to therefore book a nights accommodation at Melbourne airport. Additionally they rudely refused to check my bag through to Auckland at checkin saying that it was impossible because I was not flying all the way on the same day. What sort of airline service is that? I will never travel Qantas again.

### "3 hours on hold!"
Not Verified |  Qantas changed my flight time twice and when I called them, I waited for 3hours and 10mins before a call centre person answered! 3 hours! As it turns out they had put the fight that I had originally booked and within a minute I was put back on that flight! For the premium airline in Australia this is just not good enough Qantas. 3 hours on hold! Even Telstra don’t make you wait 3 hours!

### "Don’t fly with Qantas"
Not Verified |  Nobody expected covid. I get that everybody wants to secure their financial well-being, but it’s unacceptable to be penalized for canceling a flight early due to increasing numbers of infections and lockdowns. I canceled my flight when Queensland imposed a two week mandatory quarantine for any visitor. Months later when I’ve become unemployed, I reached out to Qantas for a refund only to be told that I had canceled too early and would be given a $500 cancellation fee. I tried reasoning but was only ignored. I was told that I could report a complaint on the company website. I did and a month later, I asked the representative from twitter when I was going to get a reply. I got one a day later, reiterating the same from the twitter rep. It was then that I noticed that the twitter rep and the person who responded to my email was the same person. I have spent more than a month being ignored, misdirected and delayed only to have the same person tell me the same thing through a different platform. I showed my Australian friend (who recommended Qantas) this and he couldn’t believe it. Qantas is held in high regard there but that doesn’t entitle a company to give someone the runaround when he’s trying to get a refund. It doesn’t entitle a company to deny a refund because of a cancellation caused by quarantine measures by the government. I took the penalized refund. I couldn’t afford not to. Don’t fly with Qantas.

### "haven’t heard anything from them"
Was on hold for more than 2 hours, after that was forced to give review without any help from them then got hung up by Qantas. First I was been told that will get my refund within 6-8 weeks, second times is 8-12 weeks and it’s been more than 20 weeks but still haven’t heard anything from them. I was told that no email will be issued until refund been processed and can’t do anything online nor email, not answering call.

### "Where has the hands on service gone"
Not Verified |  No problems with actually flying with Qantas, but cannot understand why a big company does not have a help line. It is not always possible to get online, I waited 40 mins before giving up. Where has the hands on service gone where you can ring and actually talk to some person to offer assistance. Very disappointed in your help service with crackling music that I had to listen to for 40 mins before I gave up.

### "On hold for over an hour so far!"
This review is more about the total inefficiencies of the Qantas customer service 'system'. We most recently booked flights domestically from Adelaide to Cairns. Due to the travel restrictions from Covid19 ex Adelaide, we can't travel. However, Qantas changed our outward flights which required an overnight stay in Brisbane. Why? No idea, given we can't travel anyway. So now the fun starts to cancel and get a refund. You are supposed to be able to do this online, but no they insist you ring them. On hold for over an hour so far! The Australian Tax Office responds to phone calls quicker that that! I understand they are busy. But they are wasting so much of their time and ours by not having the ability to handle a lot of customer service matter via email. If it gets a bit 'complicated' then by all means, a phone call may be necessary. What about a call back system like most other companies use? They will save a huge amount of their staff's time and we will save a huge amount of time and frustration.

### "Let's get back what is owing to us!"
I paid over $3.5k for Business Class seats for partner and myself for a return trip from Brisbane to Darwin. Suddenly without warning Qantas cancelled our return flight and offered a different date that would not suit. The flights were then held in as a flight credit. After losing my job due to covid I decided I need that money back. I was initially told that it would take "up to 12 weeks" to process. Absolutely ridiculous! They took my money instantly, cancelled my flight without explanation but yet take 12 weeks to return my money? I wasn't having it. I've now received a message from Qantas saying, quote: "I've had a message from Qantas saying, quote: "There has been an decrease in the time frame for refund as some of the backlog has been cleared and hence if the system does not release payment in 50 days [of your refund request], we can expedite it to the refunds team for manually processing the release of the payment. Bombard them people! Let's get back what is owing to us! I'll never use them again

### "terrible customer service"
I had my tickets cancelled (without notification from Qantas, terrible customer service) I asked for a refund and someone, by email, told me they were going to send me a refund email. After 25 days and 9 emails with no response, I didn’t even have the refund email, so they are probably planning on giving me my refund by 2025. I’ve already spend significant amount of money calling them from overseas, with contradictions every time I’ve spoken with someone. Your customer service has been absolutely terrible. I got another ticket cancelled a week ago from Air New Zealand. They’ve been so professional. They’ve sent me the refund confirmation email within 24hs and a week after I have the refund. I can not believe I still can not get qantas to send me a simple refund email. It has been almost a month and no one from the company had the decency to even reply to my emails.

### "friendly kiwi staff on board"
Polite friendly check-in at Christchurch. I've flown Qantas from Christchurch on average at least once a month pre-Covid19, so the staff recognise me and are always welcoming. Lounge was fairly quiet today, it's the Manaia lounge, so can be busy as it's also used by Virgin Australia. The usual friendly welcome here too. On-time departure and friendly kiwi staff on board for the leg to Brisbane. Arrived on time, simple process to transfer to the domestic terminal. No queue at the business security lane, so through to the lounge in no time. On-time departure from Brisbane and friendly service on-board. Swift exit at Sydney.

### "I was denied boarding
The website did not provide any useful information and waiting time on the phone to get customer service is 3-5 hours. Qantas did not advise passengers that a Covid test is required for flights to Thailand. On March 27th during the check-in at the Sydney airport the Qantas staff asked me =to provide a Medical Certificate from the airport medical center which cost 95$ and which was completely unnecessary because when I brought this certificate, they asked me to provide a Covid test and I was denied boarding as nobody advised me to bring this test to the check in procedure before. As a result I lost my ticket for the connection flight from Bangkok to Europe. To my complaint Qantas replied that it was not their duty to warn passengers about check in requirements.

### "transferred into credit voucher"
My flight was a round trip from Melbourne (MEL) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) via Singapore (SIN) and due to pandemic, I was notified by the airline that my my itinerary was change and on the next day, my flight was cancelled and my remaining flight would be transferred into credit voucher and can be use for future flight booking. Below show the second part of my itinerary which should be departing from KUL to MEL via SIN. Timeline: Day 1 I postponed my flight on this day and it charged me AUD $243.30, which initially mentioned on the web page that postponing flight would cost me $0 but there is a hidden fee applied, which did not show nor mention before. Day 2 I received an email from the airline regarding changing of my flight. But it did not give me any option to choose from besides changing my itinerary on my behalf. Day 3 My flight was cancelled by the airline and was notified that my remaining flight would be transfer into a credit voucher with their company and I could making future flight booking with no additional charges, note that differences in fare would apply. And I would get a confirmation about details of my credit voucher via email within a week. It also mentioned in the same email that this conformation email would outline the option available for me. Day 4 Spoke to Qantas Airline on Facebook about the situation and was told that in my case, I was told that I am not allow for refund as it is a half flown booking, and because of this, I could not get my confirmation about my credit voucher on email. Besides that, I was told by customer service that I would be the one owe them money if they were to reassess the cost of this flight because cancellation fee would cost AUD $400. Note that I bought this round trip with the cost of AUD $849.02 with additional fee of AUD $243.30, which sums up to AUD $1092.32. This timeline illustrates my experience with Qantas and I wanted to say that this is not a four days experience, I altered the day for privacy purposes but the order of this sequence is correct. This experience with Qantas made me feel that it wasn't an airline that I thought it would be because I have been hearing good thing about this airline but with this experience, the value for money went down for me. Ground service wasn't anything special. Economy seat in this airline wasn't anything special but thumbs up for providing blanket and head phone (disposable headphone). Cabin Staff service was similar to most airlines but overall I would say it's pretty good. Food and beverage was great as it was already included in the ticket itself so no additional fee or hidden fee for this. Entertainment was provided.

### "made us buy a new return ticket"
Not Verified |  Was in Spain en route to Amsterdam to fly home in June on our once in a lifetime retirement trip. Caught up in the Covid horror and had to return to Barcelona to fly home to Sydney, Qantas would not allow us to change the departure airport from Amsterdam to Barcelona even when we offered to pay the difference - neither did they offer a credit for the flight (which they were telling Australians they were doing). They made us buy a new return ticket to get home from Barcelona and when we got home our insurance doesn't cover Pandemics either. Our insurance was booked in November. Don't we take out insurance to cover unforeseen circumstances - what a joke. Talked with Qantas said I should have read the fine print. Missed the point completely but hey who needs customers.

### "refused to provide refunds"
Qantas has refused to provide refunds to those who have cancelled their flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I have been saddled with $1000 in change fees for two tickets on flights that are not occurring. Qantas has a fundamental disregard for the health and safety of their customers, and dishonestly applies policies in order to maximize their bottom line. I will never consider flying this airline again.

### "refused to refund"
Melbourne to Barcelona via Dubai on Emirates flights. Tried to cancel the flight that i booked via online agent (Gotogate). My agent asked me to contact Qantas, but Qantas refused to refund my money despite I requested cancellation 3 weeks before my flight. Neither Gotogate responded my email and calls.

### "What an expensive trip flying in a bus"
We had to fly with Qantas on 5 April from Sydney to Perth as after that date we would not be able to enter WA even though we are Western Australian residents. Qantas charged us AUD$5185.10 for 2 business class seats and it was for one way fare. Just as we were leaving the hotel in Sydney on 5 April, we received an email notifying us that there would be no food, no wifi and no entertainment. What an expensive trip flying in a bus. While we were waiting to board the bus, we were told that it would have cost QF AUD$200,000 to have wifi, entertainment and food per month. Perhaps if QF Executive had taken a pay cut perhaps we could have at least some food. Never again with QF.

### "Worst flight I've ever taken"
Sydney to London. Worst flight I've ever taken. Delay of five and a half hours before take off. Left on the plane for about three hours while refuelling resulting in about 27 hours onboard the plane in total - lights off for the duration of the flight. I think more than half the passengers' baggage was lost. Getting in touch with Qantas to find out the location of my stuff has been impossible. No communication at all. Awful customer service all round. I will never fly with Qantas again.

### "a really terrible experience for my family and me"
Horrible experience during covid 19 travel restrictions. I had a one way ticket back from Australia to Singapore on Qantas and a one way ticket up from Singapore to Australia on Scoot. When the travel restrictions kicked in, I got an email confirmation from Scoot on the refund of travel credits. With Qantas, I have not gotten any email confirmation and what's worse is that my booking has now disappeared from their website. Their call centre agents speak condescendingly and very rudely. I would strongly recommend not booking with Qantas despite their competitive prices as it has been a really terrible experience for my family and me.

### "comfortable with a wide seat"
Melbourne to Osaka via Sydney. My booking with Cathay Pacific using Qantas frequent flyer points was abruptly cancelled by Cathay Pacific without any offer of rebooking. After a long wait the Qantas call centre booked me on this Qantas service. Check-in was smooth. The domestic lounge in Melbourne is well-appointed with reasonable food choices. My  flight to Sydney was comfortable with a wide seat and a pleasant if somewhat bland vegetarian meal. On the connecting flight to Osaka the seat was also very comfortable though lacking in storage. The service was friendly and efficient. My vegetarian meal was better than on many carriers. On the other hand, the alcoholic drinks offered were distinctly second-top shelf, unlike on some Asian carriers. Both flights operated on time.

### "They will rob you blind"
Not Verified |  Qantas is gouging customers during a global pandemic. Do not use them!! I have flights scheduled in May for myself and my daughter from the USA to Sydney. We are traveling to see my son who is studying abroad. He has been recalled by his University due to the pandemic so he is returning home. As of today, Qantas is announcing they are canceling all Int'l flights through the end of May. They are only offering a 12-month travel credit even though they are canceling flights. With my son returning to the USA, I have no plans to travel on Qantas in the next 12 months. In order to cancel my flights since I won't be using their voucher, Qantas is charging a cancellation fee of $500 per ticket for the International leg and $250 per ticket for the domestic leg. So I paid $2500 for both tickets, they are canceling my flight, and they want to charge me $1500 in fees! This is terrible customer service! In a time of crisis like this, they should be doing the right thing and waive these extremely exorbitant fees. They are ripping off customers and meanwhile, they will end up getting millions of dollars in federal relief when governments bail them out. This is completely unacceptable especially given the fact we are in a pandemic and they are the ones canceling. Your travel voucher does me NO good. I strongly suggest not flying Qantas now, or ever. They will rob you blind if something goes wrong and they need to cancel. Not to be trusted.

### "the vouchers are virtually useless"
Melbourne to Tokyo. This flight was cancelled by myself before the Australian Do Not Travel warning. I indicated I wanted a credit card refund not voucher. Then they indicated (after the Australian Travel warning) that they had made my refund into a voucher instead. I do not want vouchers as I do not intend to travel for a while. Also, I paid by credit card - vouchers will mean I will have to incur Credit Card debt of more than $7000. This is totally unfair and I am unsure if it is legal. I cancelled on my own accord and I am willing to pay the cancellation fee. I need to reimburse my credit card. This action does not encourage me to travel with Qantas anymore so the vouchers are virtually useless.

### "not notified of booking failure"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Singapore. A booking with Qantas appeared to be successful in that they sent me a promotional email containing a booking reference that seemed to correspond to the booked flights, but nothing else for over 2 weeks. When I tried to again access my booking, I came up against a “your flight details have changed, click here to accept new flights” but nowhere to click and no new flights. Called Qantas (40 minutes on hold). It seemed the flights had not been booked, but unable to explain why. They initially tried to sell me a replacement that involved an 11 hour stopover, before selling me exactly the flights I tried to originally book. I complained about not being notified of the booking failure. There then followed a pointless series of emails, first addressing a problem I had not complained about, then insisting that the rebooking was actually them notifying me of the problem and not as a result of me initiating matters. Ended with “I appreciate you may be disappointed by our response, we have considered your concerns and I'm unable to assist you any further. Thank you again for taking the time to write to us.” Mistakes happen. Companies can be judged on how they respond to them. Qantas neither responded to that error adequately, nor investigated adequately, nor owned the problem they created.

### "Simply not good enough Qantas"
Not Verified |  Perth to Singapore. Flights cancelled due to Coronavirus. No problem. But I can't get through to Qantas by phone or their app. Been waiting on response on app for 9 hours. I kid you not. On phone for 2.75 hrs. Due to fly in 2 days and simply cant get through. I realise they are busy but this is ridiculous. Simply not good enough Qantas.

### "treated my friend like an idiot"
Sydney to Tokyo. A cabin crew treated my friend like an idiot because he can't speak English on a flight to Japan and made her ask twice do you want a coffee. Staff were laughing and joking the entire overnight flight at the back of my seat. If you can't at least make your passengers feel safe during the flight, but constantly fear getting insulted or wake up to disturbance just because staff are tired and human, I don't think you are in the right profession.

### "probably the nicest crew member"
Not Verified |  Recently flew with Qantas on QF 0071 10th Feb 20 from Perth to Singapore and the cabin crew were great on that flight. We were in economy class and staff treated us like VIPs despite it being a full flight and also having to deal with some very demanding customers. Hoss is probably the nicest crew member we have encountered. He was efficient and did his job with patience and humour, a credit to Qantas.

### "They are the worst airline"
Johannesburg to Sydney. Worst airline when it comes to assistance with changing flights and reimbursement of costs as a result of their delays. Stuck in Johannesburg overnight with no luggage and 12 week old twins. Received no assistance or information. Only when we started to become angry did they even respond. Then told us to spend out of our pocket for any necessities we required for the overnight stay (I.e nappies, formula, food, hotel stay) and that we would be reimbursed in full when back in Australia. After returning home to Sydney, the Qantas so called ‘customer care’ made the whole claim process so difficult and then after all that decided not to refund all the international transaction fees I incurred (not by choice) when spending on those necessities. They are the worst airline. As an Australian, I am ashamed to call them our national airline. Fly any other airline if you can. Don’t waste your money on them.

### "won't be flying Qantas again"
Not Verified |  Perth to Auckland via Sydney. Dismayed and won't be flying Qantas again. Paying extra to fly on a Qantas plane only to get the same vegetarian meal on both flights Less than 2 hours later. And on first leg we had No electronic device to view in flight entertainment. Having to hold your own personal phone for 5 hours. Borrow head phones from the lovely cabin crew. Not our idea of getting better service

### "Keep away from Qantas!"
Hong Kong to Melbourne. I booked my tickets with third party travel agent (Trip.com). One day before the departure, Qantas sent me an email and a text message with a link of Qantas Coronavirus Waiver Form to request me to cancel my tickets since I was stayed in Mainland China in the past 14 days before departure. Because I was booking with third party travel agent, I can't use that form. So I contacted my travel agent for assist to cancel my tickets and book with Cathay Pacific. Later on, Qantas refused my travel agent's refund request with the reason that I didn't meet their special policy. I can't understand why they ask me to do that cancel ticket action due to my situation is listed on their waiver form while they refuse my travel agent's refund request because I was not direct booking with Qantas. That's totally not fair. I lost nearly $3000 with nothing just because Qantas' email. Now they're not admit their fault. Keep away from Qantas!

### "Highlight: on time. Low Point: snack"
Adelaide to Sydney transferring to Sydney to Gold Coast. Two flights. High points for on time. Otherwise not much more provided than a budget carrier. Sector 1 depart 10.35 arriving 13.00 served a few tiny mini choc chip biscuits. So incredibly sweet so early and full of saturated fats. Sector 2 dep 14.05 arr 14.35 with time adjustment served 4 or 5 wafer thin small crackers with a tiny tub of very very sweet commercial salsa. Why not buy a sandwich from wollies and fly budget airlines. At least you wont arrive malnourished. Black seats were filthy with many old and unidentifiable stains. In this age of sanitiser and covid19, it aint going to help much here. Charcoal seat modules and trays also filthy. Crew on both flights polished if not a bit robotic. Dont ask for a plastic cup with ur drink. Its not in the formula and the robot gets confused. Definitely dont ask for ice. The robot is programmed to deny. Seatback IFE wasnt worth putting on the headphones. Legroom minimal. Very tight. Highlight: on time. Low Point: snack.

### "refuses to refund flights"
Sydney to Osaka. Qantas refuses to waive the cancellation fee for destinations impacted by coronavirus and refuses to refund flights to areas like Japan. I've called many times through our travel agent to hear the same old refusal. Terrible service. Will never consider Qantas again and I would advise anyone else to stay away. There are better options.

### "I'm very disappointed"
Not Verified |  I'm Ukrainian passport holder. February 22nd 2020, I, my wife and 3 years old baby were about to check in for our flight from Queenstown to Bali with connection in Sydney. I bought tickets on the official website of Qantas airlines. There was a connecting flight in Sydney: same airport, same terminal, same airlines and only 2h to next connecting flight to Bali. So in Queenstown Qantas staff didn't allow me to board as my Ukraine passport requires me to have a transit visa to Australia even I was not going to go out of the terminal. I supposed to go through transit (transfer) corridor. I have been travelling a lot and I have never experienced the situation when visa is required for transit in the airport same terminal. So of course I didn't know about it. But I accept that the governments of different countries sometimes might have strange rules. The problems were: Qantas did not even try or intend to inform me about my visa either during the booking or prior to flight. It's a special rare case, and I believe, I should have received a notification while booking or after via email. Please, improve your online booking system and add this feature. Its easy to do for your IT. Moreover, in my ticket is stated "A visa is permission for a non-citizen to travel to or transit through a particular country. To find out if you need a visa for travel to a particular country, visit the IATA Travel Centre". So I visited IATA Travel Centre, input all my details and it did NOT say that I have to have transit visa to Australia. Please, check third party sources before you refer there. Even IATA can provide inaccurate information. During check-in in Queenstown, I was not raising my voice or so, but just said that its a fail of Qantas. A rude lady (employee of Qantas) wasn't happy about that. I asked her what is the solution and she said that I should buy new ticket from another airline or "go back and stay in your country". I find it discriminative instead of trying to help. Please, do better training for your team. 10-15 min after "failed check-in" I came back to the check-in desk (to another manager) to get some an insurance letter that I wasn't board. A lady asked me to wait and came back after 5 min saying that I should contact customer service or submit online form. I was trying to call and robot said me that waiting time was between 1h 25 min and 1h 55 min. So I tried to submit the form but after inputting all details, it was not sent. Thus, I couldn't reach a customer service to get an insurance letter. Please, make it possible to reach your customer service online. It's not the end of the world. I'm very disappointed, it was just bad, Qantas.

### "The crew were fabulous"
Dallas to Sydney. A long flight at a touch under 17 hours. Heavy headwinds all across the Pacific. The crew were fabulous. They had arranged with the ground staff at Dallas for a block of 3 seats in the economy cabin so ended up with plenty of space (it helps to be a frequent flyer with Qantas). One of the escape doors was inoperative so 100 odd seats were blocked out which meant the rest of the main deck was packed. Four hours in I was asked if I minded moving to accommodate passengers whose air con was not working. So needed up being shifted to Business. The A380  business class seat and amenities were magnificent.

### "huge shout out to CSM"
Sydney to Dallas. A quick flight (relatively at 14 hours 15 minutes). The one thing I am struggling with is the IFE selection. Qantas seem to have becoming a bit more art house with their films but Netflix loaded up on my phone and a book plus sleep saw the time pass. No food taken due to a big splurge in the lounge. On time departure and early arrival by 5 minutes so all fine. Now the cabin service. Fabulous and a huge shout out to CSM Nicky and her team and Richard in the main deck. Many people knock Qantas for their service but truly sparkling on QF7/8.

### "Staff  very friendly and helpful"
Sydney to Melbourne. I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and the plane left on time. It was nice to a flat seat on such a short flight! The meal (pork cutlets) was quite good and as always with Qantas Business, the wine was excellent. Staff were very friendly and helpful too.

### "I tried to cancel my flight"
Not Verified |  I had a flight ticket from Hong Kong to Sydney at the end of February in flight QF118 and I tried to cancel my flight with full refund but in spite of other companies (Emirates, Qatar Airways etc) were offering this possibility because of Coronavirus, Qantas was charging a 2000 HKD fee for this cancellation. I do not understand why a serious company do not offer this option in this epidemic situation.

### "I would not have upgraded"
Sydney to Singapore. I decided to treat myself and bid for an upgrade to Business Class on my Xmas flight. I paid an additional $625 on top of the Economy ticket for an upgrade. Arriving to check in I was told there was no seat for me. After waiting 40 minutes they came back to tell me there was a seat available. On board there were no Business Class meals available for me. It seems like i missed half the benefits of upgrading with the delay in checking in & no food upgrades. I would not have upgraded if I knew I would be receiving only a fraction of what Business Class is.

### "The organisation was very bad"
Denpasar to Brisbane via Sydney. The worst ending to a great holiday I have experienced yet. The flight was delayed 2 hours before check in began, from a departure time of 2120 to 2315. What makes me confused is that Virgin notified their passengers over 12 hours before departure time, as my sister in law was travelling with them on the same night back to Australia. Qantas had no ground crew in Bali so everything was organise by the airport team. The Lounge they offer to their premium passengers was absolutely disgusting, everything about it was not great and I would never recommend it. The cabin crew were good at best, some were grumpy and others pleasant plus the customer service manager was definitely NOT a standout. Once airborne, I headed straight to sleep as the flight was about 5.5 hours and I was exhausted at that point due to the delay. Before landing I had a small breakfast of oats and coffee, the oats are one of my favourite things to eat so 1 point to Qantas. My connection to Brisbane was changed 4 times, finally arriving into Brisbane roughly 1500. The organisation was very bad on this occasion and the communication was little to none.

### "pretty poor service"
Not Verified |  I don't want to give a poor review because some aspects are great. The staff are great and the inflight service is great. But when it comes to rewards flights and limiting certain legs of the flights, it's woeful. I tried so hard to book a rewards flight return to Tokyo from Brisbane. But no matter what date I chose, they wouldn't let me fly the return leg home. They made me use a Jetstar flight to Cairns, check everything out (snow bag), and check back in to the Qantas link flight. You also couldn't amend anything for the Jetstar leg through Qantas. You had to do it through Jetstar. Then when I asked Jetstar they said I had to do it through Qantas, Qantas said the opposite. This was a never-ending occurrence, and a major pain. Also, you don't get free meal service and inflight entertainment with the Jetstar leg. Even though it's booked through Qantas. Rude if you ask me. So not only do I have to take 2 flights and the trip is much longer than necessary, I have to pay for extras on Jetstar. I think that's pretty poor service.

### "food and courtesy from FA's was fine"
London to Sydney via Singapore, I'm on a Qantas A380 almost monthly so that amounts to 24 sectors a year to London or Dallas. Now with that comes a certain degree of knowledge of what happens at every stage of the journey. In a premium cabin the experience is different to economy. But as a Qantas frequent flyer I know what the level of service will be (courteous, friendly, professional, occasionally a bit cold). The service, food and courtesy from the FA's was fine. I rarely eat on planes having dined in the lounge but had a bite on this occasion. The Australasian crew up to Singapore were a laid back bunch who were just fine. The English crew from Singapore to London (and the other way) were just great. They have a difficult job and appreciate a smile, thank you and a bag of candy. My only gripe is about the IFE: just could not seem to find anything decent to watch but Netflix on the phone crammed with stuff fixed that. Qantas are not perfect but then nobody is.

### "no food and no information"
Sydney to Singapore. We arrived from Fiji by Fiji Airways, a really pleasant experience with awesome flight attendants and good leg room, but continuing on Qantas was just the opposite. The space was bad even for an economy. On the way to the runway the plane shut down and we came to a standstill. On the 4 hrs waiting on the runway, not even one time drinks were served. We were travelling with 2 Kids (2 and 4 years old) and after app. 3 hours stuck on the runaway with no drinks, no food and no information, I asked the flight attendant for some small snacks for my Kiddies and with a look of hatred I was told that they dont serve food on the ground, only when airborne. After 4 hours we went back to the gate, deplaned as some parts had to be repaired. Things can happen on a long trip, but its up to the airline how to handle it and in 20 years flying over 100k miles per year, I never had a crew handling it that unprofessional.

### "worst customer experience"
Not Verified |  New York to Sydney via Los Angeles. Probably worst customer experience on airline in 15 years and solely down to lazy attitude of staff. Last leg was 15yr flight and virtually no service on the leg. The usual drinks of water or juice were never handed out and you were left to go back past economy cabin to try and find a water. No staff around for most of the flight and when they were there they would not get up but just continued talking amongst themselves. Never seen such lazy attitude on a Qantas plane and after meeting the service manager Onboard it was clear why they acted that way. Really disappointing to see an airline degrade and the arrogance /entitlement of the staff. Lots of better alternatives to fly with nowadays so try Jal. Cathay or even American.

### "cabin crew were pleasant"
Brisbane to Denpasar via Melbourne. Check in was easy as there was no line and our baggage was sent all the way through to Denpasar. After security and a relaxing Lounge visit it was time to head to Melbourne. The flight was 10 mins late and having only an 1 hour to make the international sector I was a little anxious. Luckily we landed in Melbourne on time and the flight to Denpasar was delayed by 30 minutes as well. The cabin crew were pleasant, even congratulating my partner and I on our recent wedding. The catering was delicious, including the drink selections. The only disappointment was the IFE selection, being an older B737-800, the entertainment system is definitely not the best. We landed in Denpasar only 15 minutes behind schedule, a pretty good start to our holiday. Overall, Qantas offered a great service but I think they need to use a wide jet body on this route as there Business Suite offers a greater hard product.

### "substandard budget airline"
When you purchase Qantas International Business class you expect Business Class not a substandard budget airline Premium Economy. Their own website says their seats offer much more recline than the reality. Garuda offers lie flat for the same price on their direct flights MEL-DPS. The Qantas seats are similar to Jetstar Premium but ours could not be reclined fully or the footrest lowered except with a great deal of force from us and the crew. The seats are adequate for day flights but hopeless for the overnight return flight. The Qantas ground, lounge and cabin crew offer excellent friendly service as do virtually all of their SE Asian and Middle East competitors. The Neil Perry food choice is adequate but only if you like everything overwhelmed by chili except for one pasta choice. Our first two choices were sold out (with only 10 in Business class) so we settled for third best a lamb sandwich which could not be eaten because the chipotle was so overwhelming. The snack before landing was either chili laden Thai fish cakes or a sweet potato spring roll which was again overwhelmed by chili. Other airlines offer a much more balanced food choice.

### "will never use Qantas again"
San Francisco to Sydney. The worst customer service. If there is a problem and you call, the response is always the same. There is a two-hour wait due to the large volume of calls. No call back option exists. The premium economy cabin is not nearly as good as Air New Zealand's. We will never use Qantas again.

### "Business Class lounge is outstanding"
Sydney to Brisbane. Check-in fast and efficient. Qantas Business Class lounge is outstanding. It's definitely one of the reasons to fly Qantas instead of Virgin in business. The aircraft was a little tired, but crew service excellent and the food was above average. Priority luggage works well (unlike some airlines), bag was one of the first out.

### "last time I would fly by Qantas"
Not Verified |  The first and probably the last time I would fly by Qantas. The initial flight QF 81 was cancelled without any explanation, which is unprofessional. The next flight, which was 7 hrs later, was again delayed, we kept sitting in plane for an hour at least due to refuelling issues, which made us miss our connecting flight. Utter chaos. We get to Bali, after missing the connecting flight, folks dont know where to send us. Qantas had 5 hours to figure that out. They finally put us on Jet star flight and eventually miss our luggage. That was the nail in the coffin. Totally unacceptable.

### "ashamed to serve food like that"
Noumea to Sydney. The flight itself was quite good : even if we had a little delay because our plane arrived 30 minutes late to Nouméa, the pilot was able to compensate by bringing us to Sydney with only a 5 minutes delay. The service was correct but not exceptional, I felt that the stewards were cold with us and even a bit exhausted. The food was not good at all : I mean, apart for the Kit Kat chocolate bar and for the glass of water, it was really bad. I was supposed to have rice with tuna curry and the rice was partly crunchy on the surface and mushy under the surface, the tuna was overcooked, the curry had a faint spicy flavour, so, I was really disappointed about it. I'm conscious that airplane food is not always exceptional or good but  I would be ashamed to serve food like that to people. The inflight entertainment is good as you have a screen on which you can watch movies, play games, listen to music, etc. I would say that it's the biggest positive thing about this flight. Ground service was okay, but they required us to get a tourist visa for Australia even if I was just doing a stopover which was less than 8 hours (and normally, when you're in transit for less than 8 hours, visa isn't required). I found that weird, but Qantas ground staff in Noumea airport insisted on it, so I had to do so and I paid for it. But, finally, it didn't serve me at all on the next flight, so I paid like 40 euros for something that I never used in Sydney airport. I'm unsure about recommending this airline for the time being,. but according to all what I said, it will be a little "no" for this time.

### "It’s time to vote with our feet"
Perth to Cairns via Brisbane. For a long time the only thing keeping customers flying the substandard and frequently late service of Qantas has been the frequent flyer program. However as the airlines delays exceed that of Jetstar it is time to reconsider. The man who pays himself $20+ million per year to ensure the plans are packed and the seats are smaller as larger planes are reallocated to other routes is laughing all the way to the frequent flyer bank. Points are worth less than ever and yet people continue to pay more. It’s time to vote with our feet and get off this airline. As a customer I would never buy shares in this airline so as an investor I’d like to think the airline lifts its game.

### "look after your customers"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Sydney. Overbooked flight by 50 passengers and said they had to cut numbers due to bad weather. Then tried to blame Expedia booking but took one passenger on the same booking and left another stranded. Keep passengers 5 hours after departure before offering a hotel. Then had no way of honoring tickets paid for months ago, so started offering refunds that were not available 8 hours earlier. Never again. Start to look after your customers, this one won’t be back!

### "Worst flight of my life"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Auckland via Sydney. Worst flight of my life. The staff are so rude and not interested in doing their job. Our flights were all Very delayed with no further information. And the boards displayed were incorrect to what was being announced. I've never had a pleasant experience with them and I travel a lot. Personally the only reason I do travel with them is because it's the fastest way to South Africa. If it wasn't for that I would never recommend them to anyone ever.

### "a very pleasant trip"
Melbourne to Sydney. I had a very pleasant trip. The departure was mid morning. There was a delay with the departure that was not the fault of QANTAS. The IFE system was fine, although I miss the access to music. Staff were very pleasant and a small but pleasant snack was served with juice and coffee.

### "Staff were very friendly"
Sydney to Melbourne. I had a pleasant evening flight. Staff were very friendly and they served a pleasant meal. ( Bangers and Mash!). The IFE had no private screens, but that didn't matter for such a short flight. Also appreciated the coffee and juice!

### "he was not assisted"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Perth via Melbourne. I booked return flights for my dad. As he is 80 years old and never flown via transit I requested wheelchair assistance. It was heartbreaking to hear he was not assisted for his flights over. In Auckland he had to walk and Melbourne he was only taken halfway and told to walk the rest of the way? Not knowing where to go and almost missing his flight. My father was very stressed and upset. For his return back to NZ I made sure to enquire that he would be assisted throughout his trip. And I would like to thank Olivia from Perth QF check in  who was amazing and ensured my dad would be looked after and thank you also to Lee for taking him to his flight. Melbourne Qantas staff however, still tried to do the same trick and drop him halfway again. My dad requested they take him all the way and they did. But only cause he spoke up and insisted. So this may be a continuous issue in Melbourne that needs to be addressed if they are doing it all the time.

### "missed for drinks twice"
Qantas flights are pretty good in general, except the service was so bad. The crew director was working so hard to cover the flight attendant's mistake. I was missed for drinks twice and before I have ordered my meal and told that chicken is out. I guess this is the last time I fly with Qantas again.

### "don’t book with Qantas"
Sydney to Coffs Harbour. Firstly, my Qantas flight out of Australia was so delayed I literally had to run to catch my connecting flight, and I’d left myself two hours between flights. But planes can be delayed so can’t point too much blame here. Secondly, on my return flight Qantas kindly bumped me off my ticketed half 8am flight from Sydney onto the 11.30 flight. Their excuse for doing this was that the first plane in the morning was smaller than they’d sold tickets for - so what ensued was then a bumping knock on. How can a company try to justify that it’s ok to move customers off a flight they have purposefully booked and paid for months in advance? My new bumped onto flight was then so delayed instead of arriving at my destination at half nine a.m. it ended up being 2.40 pm. Finally, the return Qantas flight was the last leg after flying internationally from Manchester, England. As a result of not having showered for nearly thirty six hrs whilst travelling, and now sitting at Sydney for an extra four and a half hours, I asked at the ‘customer services team’ at the Qantas desk if I could use a shower in the Qantas lounge, just a shower, not free alcohol, a comfy seat for a few hours or even free food, just a shower and they so kindly said ‘no’. I wasn’t a member so I couldn’t use the facilities. So if you’re looking for a reliable company that Don’t bump you off a flight you’d booked and paid for months in advance don’t book with Qantas. Want to do the right thing once they’ve bumped you off your flight, trying to somehow offer an apology and say - let you use a shower, then don’t book with Qantas. Want to leave the customer service desk with tears in your eyes, feeling like the whole scenario is your fault and that you are causing the customer services team problems, do book with Qantas!

### "Two very different experiences"
Wellington to Brisbane via Sydney. Two very different experiences, which leads me to believe the front line team offer an inconsistent product. WLG to BNE was very good, everything from check in, security, lounge and through to boarding was efficient, though boarding could have been somewhat more organised. The cabin crew on my first flight were super friendly and very attentive. Catering was great too, although it was the first time I didn't finish my food as I had eaten in the lounge as well. IFE was average, I did manage to find options to pass the time. Seat was comfortable but I wished Qantas used a plane with their business suites. After arriving and passing through immigration/customs at Sydney international I made my way over to the Qantas terminal, which was a bus on the land side. SYD to BNE was delayed once again, for no good reason at all. Actually, they didn't have a legitimate reason. The cabin crew were terrible, especially the Customer Service Manager. She put on a show when she had to, and then go back to being a grumpy person which would rather be doing nothing at all. Catering was non-existent, a tart and some yoghurt could be served in economy but when you pay for a premium product you do expect better service. Overall, my experience was very mixed and the flight between Sydney and Brisbane was the worst domestic Business Class I have experienced.

### "my worst international flight"
Brisbane To Auckland. Check-In was somewhat non existent, the ground team just look so unmotivated plus I find the check in area at Brisbane International a complete inefficient shamble. Security was quite fast, one positive so far and after a great visit to the lounge things goes bad once again. The aircraft hasn't even arrived, no information was given with passengers waiting an extra 20 mins before boarding. I just don't understand the lack of information, just be transparent and let passengers know the aircraft is being delayed. The boarding process was quite abysmal. Qantas just can't seem to get priority boarding correct even though they are trying their best to fix it, it's actually not that hard and your team just seem lazy. The cabin crew was not even close to good, on this flight they are just robots. At this point nothing will be a saving grace, I hope someone from Qantas read this and pass on the feedback. Lastly, inflight service and IFE was average. This has to be my worst international flight so far.

### "seats for three of us at different places"
Due to travel Melbourne to Dallas via Sydney on 11 January. Travelling through family with a 7 year old kid. While traveling from Los Angeles to Melbourne, airline assigned seats for three of us at different places, although ticket for all of us is bought at the same time. Before I traveled, I went to the website to select seats, it never worked. They show not even an attempt to assign seats together. When asked about it, they are careless as if they have nothing to do with it. My return flight form Melbourne to Dallas, I tried to check in online. I am unsuccessful in selecting the seats. See the attached image. I did it many times and have no success. My travel with Qantas is really uncomfortable. While I traveled with other airlines, I never had issues with seating while traveling with family. I tried to call the airlines, the phone prompted waiting time of 1 hour 25 minutes. I waited 1 hour 25 minutes on phone and had no luck in getting in touch with customer service. Airlines need to have some commonsense on allocating seats when travelling with a family in a 15 hr flight! !

### "an experience worth repeating"
Singapore to Melbourne. The First Class product leaves nothing to be desired from other airlines with a similar offering. From the online booking experience right through the very efficient ground process right through the comfort of the pillows provided, I cannot highly recommend this product. Even though other airlines offer fully enclosed suites, I wouldn't change the lay out and comfort of the Qantas First Class set up. The spaciousness of the A380 combined with the lay out of the seats and the use of privacy screens make you feel comfortable and if you have issues with confined spaces you will never feel trapped. The female cabin crew and the Customer Service Manager were very professional yet approachable. Each was very unique in their own way coming across a very genuine. The customer service was expeditious and friendly. The combination of the hard product and the style of the crew on the fight make it an experience worth repeating any time.

### "Customer service superb"
Sydney to Brisbane. Everything was perfect. Customer service superb. We lost a phone and Claudette from Qantas Baggage Services was amazingly helpful and very efficient. And we love the world's best safety profile.

### "Not sure why we bothered"
Hobart to Adelaide via Melbourne. We checked into our flights the night before and on arrival at the airport checked in our luggage, printed boarding passes and attached bag tags. We then waited in a queue while one staff member processed the ever lengthening line, including doing the complete checkin for most of the others. Meanwhile, even Jetstar had more staff and efficient processing. Not sure why we bothered doing the right thing by Qantas.

### "fly with an alternate airline"
I booked a Jetstar flight through the Qantas website. I tried to cancel it within 30min of booking and this was not possible. I contacted Jetstar who told me that the flight was booked through Qantas so i had to speak directly to Qantas. I called Qantas and was told there was a 1.5 hour wait and if i wanted I could leave my number and name and they would hold my place in the queue and call me back. Nothing happened. I called again and received the same message but still no call back. I called the following day and waited 1hr 45min on the phone. I spoke to the customer service agent and she told me that I have to go through a resolution dispute system with Jetstar by filling in an online form. This form will then be assessed by a team who will decide whether i am entitled to a refund. Now I ask what intelligence is there in a system which is designed to waste people's time on the phone & online, waste administrative resources addressing the dispute and making people really angry at the end of it all when they could easily implement a policy that allows you to cancel your booking within 24hours of commitment. This is the system in the US. It works perfectly well there. There are no endless pages of terms and conditions you have to trawl through of legal jargon to understand. And everyone gets it without wasting people's time. Surely it would be cheaper to refund my $160 flight than the wages alone involved in 'resolving' this dispute. But I was told by the CS agent that this is not Australian Consumer Law so Qantas is within it's rights to waste everyone's time and achieve nothing but resentment and hostility. If you are such a great airline then why don't you lead the way and show the rest of them how a reputable business is run. Go over and beyond what is the most basic Australian Consumer Rights and be a true leader and champion. I have been a Qantas Frequent Flier member now for over 15 years. I have accumulated lots of points which i gleefully kept for that big trip and continually used your services and airline. I am now going to use all my point and choose to fly with an alternate airline if it is an option. Congratulations.

### "On arrivalthere was no luggage"
Not Verified |  Bundaberg to Sydney. My flight was cancelled. I was put on a later flight but when I boarded, they had assigned my seat to 2 people and someone was in my seat. They then removed another lady from the flight and gave me a seat. I asked the crew about my luggage. If I was not supposed to be on the flight then it made sense that my case would not be on there either. The cabin staff assured me they had checked and my luggage was on board. They lied it wasn’t. On arrival in Sydney there was no luggage and they couldn’t trace it. This is the third time Qantas has lost my luggage in twelve months. Seems to be a regular thing now. The only good thing about this terrible day was Steve. He works on the desk at Sydney airport and finds missing bags. Steve goes above and beyond and will not give up until he finds your luggage.

### "latest seating is very comfortable"
London to Perth on the Qantas Boeing 787-9. Now have been on it in economy and its fine. Premium was a step up and just made it all the more comfortable. This is an aircraft with higher humidity levels so just come off feeling better. The Premium cabin is small and has the latest seating which is very comfortable. The IFE is one that folded into the seat as I was at the bulkhead. Usual standards of service in the cabin and the F & B was fine. Light chicken noodle salad. Snacks available throughout the flight and the most helpful and nice FA's (Shan, Shai and Sharni). The aircraft may be the same but what differentiates is the quality of cabin crew. On nearly all QF international the crew are just great (domestic can be hit and miss on Qantas). On the start of my journey was on QF7 and the IFE selection was a bit mixed. Same here but Netflix, book and sleep sorted that out. London to Perth is usually around 16.30 hours but this time we did it in 16 hours. Personally I still find it incredible to get on in London and step of in Australia, albeit that there is still another 4 hours to go to Sydney for me.

### "very satisfying trip"
Sydney to Dallas. I am biased but  happy to point out flaws with Qantas. This is a regular run to Dallas Fort Worth so know what to expect. Received an upgrade to Premium which was nice. The A380 cabin upstairs is compact and quiet. Aircraft was one of the ones that had not been refurbished, so older style of seating and IFE. Problem with upgrades is you cannot choose where you sit. It was at the bulkhead. Positive being that you have no one reclining into you. Negative. I am tall so not quite enough room to stretch out. Its a comfortable seat though and managed to get some decent sleep. Being a QFF, the cabin manager does come by for a personal thank you and greeting which is a nice touch. F & B up to usual standards. Normally the IFE selection is good but this time could not find anything that really appealed. Luckily had Netflix loaded up plus a book. All in all a very satisfying trip.

### "refused to refund a downgrade"
Brisbane to Hong Kong. Qantas refused to refund a downgrade. Due to an aircraft change, Qantas downgraded me from the paid booking class in Premium Economy to Economy. The airline’s customer services have been completely unwilling to rectify the issue, taking on average 2-3 weeks to respond to each round of emailing. I have at two junctures spent lengthy periods on the phone to their call centres, but am ultimately told I need to email them. They consider the matter case closed. In any other circumstances this would be considered fraud or theft. You pay for a superior product, you are delivered an inferior product.

### "Will not fly Qantas again"
I flew with Qantas in October from Brisbane to Singapore and it was the worst experience. They served me dry fruits on board and I broke my tooth. I reported it to the cabin crew straight away. It seemed like they did a report on their tablet and advised me that I will get an email from the Qantas customer care and they will pay to fix it. No emails from Qantas were received. A couple of days later I emailed them myself and got a reply back 2 weeks later, stating that I need to wait another 14 business days for a response. A month later I gave up on waiting, emailed them again, no response. I called them, queue was too long and they were meant to call me back in 2.5 hours. I waited 6.5 hours for a call back. Got through but guy from Qantas call centre couldn't help me and transfered to another department where I waited for an 1.5 with no response. Called the next day and after 4.5 hours in queue was unlucky enough to speak with a very rude customer service Representative who advised me that I could have broken my tooth by eating anything else at whatever point. Will not fly Qantas again and will not recommend it either.

### "each trip is always disappointing"
Sydney to Singapore. My family of 5 booked the tickets several months ago. Our booked return trip was Sydney direct to Singapore on QF1 5pm arrive SIN at 2205hrs. The night before departure while we try to check in, it shown that the flight was cancelled and we were assigned to another flight which required to transit via Bali to Singapore. To my surprise when at the airport, QF1 was still flying directly to Singapore as per planned schedule but my entire family was pushed out of QF1 to put onto another flight with transit at Bali. We were suppose to reach Singapore at 2205hrs but in the end we reached around 0100. There was not a single message or email to inform on the changes, We paid for a direct flight to save time and in the end were provided with another transit flight with another airways (KLM -Flight delayed as well). Spoken to Qantas at check in but reply that there’s nothing they can do. If the flight was actually cancelled, We understand and accept situations does occurs however in this case it was actually flying as planned yet put us to another flight that caused me many problems with my personal schedule due to the transit delay of more than 3 hrs. Believe Qantas did it purposely for profit by over booking and transfer some passengers to any other flights. There will about 12-15 other passengers together with this same situation and all were taken by surprise and so infuriated by Qantas greed and ethic. I had flew Qantas 5 times and each trip with them is always disappointing. Will not fly with Qantas unless given no other choice.

### "time in transit doubled in Sydney"
Sydney to Hong Kong. Flight canceled, no mail, no explication, Route change, destination change, plane (first we have to go in Singapore in an A380, finally you had to go to Hong Kong in an A330) change, time in transit doubled in Sydney, then we do to take eta (charge 84 euros!). Worst meal, no tray, only a main, no starter, worst dessert. Only one drink in all flight duration (9 hours!) food poor quality. Crew with no smile or warmth, we paid to choose seat and that be lost in the new itinerary.

### "Service has become appalling"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Perth. Service has become appalling and they run late. You never arrive on time with Qantas and always arrive irritated at the terrible service. Come on Qantas, lift your game

### "Do not fly Qantas"
Los Angeles to Sydney. Do not fly Qantas. They are a scam promising to reserve preferred seating. I paid a lot of money 11 months ahead of time for preferred seating and day of flight they assigned me to worst seats on plane. Said sorry it happens, and refunded me the difference. No amicable agreed solution. Complaints don’t get back to you. Do not fly Qantas, they lie.

### "the worst air travel ever"
Brisbane to Auckland in April 2019. This was the worst air travel ever. On approaching the gate for ticket scanning I was yelled at that you are only allowed one bag. As we all know you can have a cabin size bag and a small hand bag as I did. The small bag was a pilot bag. After a heated chat the angry man started to cancel my flight. The plane was ready to depart. It was not possible for my bag to go down below as the ground crew had closed the doors. I gave the man my $400 bag that was returned damaged. I was told that the cabin was full and this is why I have to give him my bag. When I finally got into the cabin I checked the locker above my seat which was empty. I waited an hour at the baggage claim without anyone able to find my bags. I spend my whole trip without my luggage only for it to arrive the day before I left.

### "Very disappointing"
Not Verified | Sydney to Perth. Rude staff with very little to zero assistance at check-in. They seem to wish for travellers to miss their flights, not much concern about assisting you if you’re not sure what’s happening or ask for assistance. Very disappointing!

### "the food has become so poor"
Not Verified |  Hong Kong to Melbourne. This has been my fourth medium haul flight with Qantas in the last few weeks. I’ve been a loyal QFF for many years, but have watched as cost cutting and low investment in cabin product have ruined a once outstanding airline. Apart from having to wait for three hour minimum wait times to the call centre (7 hours to reply to questions about onward travel on the app/sms/bot), the food has become so poor that I now dread flying with them. Of particular note is the shocking breakfast options in Business. I know this sounds entitled, but if I’m paying for business class then I expect something more than a burnt, squashed croissant and three drips of yoghurt after a 9 hour flight, the chef that puts his name to this rubbish should be ashamed.

### "so inconsistent"
Not Verified | Johannesburg to Sydney. I almost exclusively fly with Qantas, but they are so inconsistent with their product in economy. On my flight from SYD-JNB, which is a daylight flight the whole way, we were given complimentary comfort pack of eye-shades, earplugs and toothpaste/toothbrush. On the return flight from JNB-SYD, which is an overnight flight, no complimentary pack was handed out. It would seem more necessary to get the comfort pack on the overnight flight. However, I shouldn't complain because it has been about 8 years since I received a complimentary comfort pack in economy on any of their flights. 1st world problem, I know, but consistency is what drives customer loyalty.

### "This is infuriating"
Not Verified | Tokyo to Brisbane. Unfortunately, I was not able to go on my trip to Australia due to an illness in my family. I am writing a review of my experience on the cancellation process for this airline. I could not figure out how to cancel tickets on their website, so I have to call the customer service. The first attempt I waited 45 minutes to talk to a human and could not wait any longer. The second attempt I waited 1 hour 5 minutes before someone picked up. The rep answered with only, "may I help you? which was a little odd. She then would not assist with cancellation and insisted I use the website. Finally found the cancellation function, but it told me to call customer service. This third call was answered in 54 minutes. This person helped me, but her mic kept cutting out and her accent was so thick she was unintelligible. I am now on the phone for the fourth time to fix the issue, and as I am writing I am 1 hour and 26 minutes on hold. This is infuriating.

### "very disappointed with Premium Economy"
My wife and I are Lifetime Qantas Club members and are regular international travellers. We recently flew Qantas Premium Economy from Melbourne to Singapore and return and were very disappointed with Qantas Premium Economy on their A380-800. Both aircraft appeared a little tired and in need of updating. On the outbound flight QF35/03NOV MEL/SIN there was refuse from the previous traveller still in the seat pocket and under the seat in front. The ONLY benefit that we perceived over Economy was the extra legroom and the Upper Deck appears quieter than the lower deck. The Premium seat is marginally wider than in Economy and the legroom is definitely greater however that is where the comparison ends. After two hours the seat bottom was hard, the leg/foot rest is useless and must have been designed for 4ft leprechauns. We found it impossible to get sufficiently comfortable to sleep on the overnight flight. Meals on both flights were very ordinary with little difference to what we have previously experienced in QF Economy. On our return flight QF36/20Nov SIN/MEL the menu offered a Teriyaki Chicken Salad or Pesto Linguini or Black Bean Beef with rice. We chose the Teriyaki Chicken salad however they had run out of it. I then decided on the Pesto Linguini which had dry linguini and I left most of it on the plate. If the menus are an example of Rockpool Sydney then I pity them. The wine list states Premium Australian wines however the only wines on offer were a very insipid Pino Noir and a very ordinary Chardonnay. No spirits were offered. The cabin steward referred to my wife as 'Darling' even though he had never met her. Overall we do not feel that the substantial fare difference between Economy and Premium Economy was justified on this occasion. Having flown in all classes on many airlines over the years we can confidently say that the best Premium Economy we have is experienced is on Air New Zealand MEL/AKL/LAX and Business Class on Japan Airlines MEL/TYO/LON.

### "Qantas has gone downhill"
Well where to begin, I tried to change my port of destination but the cost to change was so expensive. It was cheaper to suspend the last leg and book the new destination with another airline. There is no way to talk to someone or simply ask a question unless you are prepared for a long wait. The wait time is from 2-6 hours! Who has time to sit on the phone for that length of time! Then after making 3 calls (each call being a minimum of 2 hours), I received my eticket only to realise nothing has been changed! Another 3 hour call the day before flying when I had 101 better things to do! Really Qantas has gone downhill. Not even a decent call centre in Australia. On our return, the airline we chose to rebook our last leg of the flight and so first to return, said that my Qantas leg of the journey had been cancelled! Really! After 30 minutes at the desk the problem was resolved. Needless to say Qantas will be the last choice to fly with. I doubt we will ever get apology or anything else, for the annoying and frustrating experience, but happy to warn others about this terrible experience.

### "I prefer Qantas"
Brisbane to Perth. I fly a lot and most of the time it’s with Qantas I prefer Qantas as I believe the service is second to none. The economy seating Is in need of superior seat but just on the long haul flights from Perth it is a killer when you have just come off night shift. Food options are lovely but if you don’t like anything on the menu there no other options for you to purchase, so think there should just be a option or two more.

### "meal consists of three items"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Auckland. The menu said Rockpool inspired by Neil Perry or words to that effect. Entree: Maggie Beer pate, consisted of a plastic pot (like motels serve jam in) with a tear off foil lid. Placed on a plate with a piece of toast and four cornichons. Main: A pie, yes just a pie, sat on the plate. Because it was a business class meal there was a squirt of tomato sauce on the top and a spoon of mushy peas on the side. Desert: An ice cream on a stick, just like you would buy from any corner shop, remove the wrapper yourself. I don't understand why it takes a celebrity chef to put together a meal that just consists of three items that anyone can buy from their local supermarket.

### "staff are very accommodating"
Brisbane to Perth. Very happy with the service onboard. The staff are very accommodating and know what they are doing, definitely will be flying Qantas from now on and not Virgin.

### "not my airline of choice"
Perth to Brisbane. I booked this ticket a while ago and requested a window seat. When I went to check in 24 hours before the flight they had allocated me a middle seat right at the back of the plane. I tried to ring Qantas and it took me 20 hours to finally get to speak to someone. I advised that I suffered from a little claustrophobia and preferred a window seat as it did not make me feel as closed in. The lady on the phone assure me that I had a window seat on this journey and the return journey and told me not to worry. I got to the airport only to see that my seat had not changed, I asked for assistance and was told that there was nothing they could do about it, I spent my journey feeling like a bloody sardine, sat in the middle of 2 burly blokes, one that sniffed constantly and the other that did not appear to know what personal hygiene was. As per usual, they ran out of food choices once they got back to the back of the plane. I have previously advised Qantas about my issues with confinement, yet they still plonk me in the middle. The hostess was very surly and unapproachable and looked as though she wanted ot be anywhere but here - now I know why Qantas is not my airline of choice, I only fly them if my employer is paying for my flights.

### "I'll avoid flying with them"
Not Verified |  Qantas cancelled my flight two hours before the flight and replacement offered was for the next day, despite Qantas had two other flight on the same day. No explanation was provided as why the flight is cancelled as weather was very nice and other airline didn't have any cancellation on the same day. they didn't give any hint about overnight accommodation or food coupons . As I needed to be in Sydney the next day, I cancelled Qantas and got a ticket from Virgin for 455$. Afterwards Qantas didn't pay for the replacement ticket and proposed a refund (to be paid in 14 days of 379 $) . When after several contacts and chatting them for three days I accepted their refund (My time apparently more valuable than Qantas reputation ) then I asked for an amended tax receipt that reflect the refund and they say that they are not able to give me an amended tax receipt and I need to raise it with customer care and this is going on forever! In short Qantas doesn't have processes to help you with cancellations and they don't give a damn about your circumstances or their own reputation . I'll avoid flying with them as much as possible and you better do the same.

### "great inflight experience"
Auckland To Brisbane. 8 hours before departure I checked my app and the flight has been delayed until 6:10pm, approximately 1 hour and 40 mins later then scheduled. Since I had work today, I kept to my original plan and arrived at the airport at 12:30pm. The Lounge was adequate enough, giving me the best environment to focus on my work. Closer to boarding, the ground team never let any passengers know why the delay even happened and I find this practice quite odd. There is always a legitimate reason, but I assume no one wanted to be blamed. The Cabin Crew were the saviour of the flight, really going out of their way to make sure passengers were cared for from the "welcome" to inflight service. The CSM was a standout as he offered me a drink before any service had even begin. Food and drinks were much better on this flight, plenty of options to choose from. IFE was again quite limited though I did mange to find some movies of my interest. The aircraft used offered lay-flat seating, much better then the 737-800 business product. Overall, a great inflight experience but I will go out of my way to find out why the delay happened as time is precious.

### "just so unprofessional"
Brisbane to Perth. I was feeling unwell for I suffer anxiety, I asked to be moved for I had no room in the seat I was in, usually I am fine but on this occassion, it was very crowded, The Flight attendants Thomas and Matthew the Korean attendant were fabulous, they ran that flight that day!! As for the manager on that flight she was quite rude knowing how I was feeling. I left second last off the flight , walking up the ramp there was an elderly lady struggling with her bags on her own, she gladly took my arm after I offered to help, and carried her bags and my shoulder bags as walking past there was a line of flight attendants waiting to board the flight talking and not once did they offer to help, when we reached the lounges there was two flight attendants just watching us we struggle. I later said why wasn't this woman helped there response was "the woman refused a wheel chair" I said surely you could of helped her in other ways, carrying her bags, the worst thing out of this the two flight attendants just stood there arguing with me after a five hour flight. Not once did these attendants ask if we were okay whilst struggling. It was just so unprofessional.

### "great customer service"
Brisbane To Auckland. Check-In was super easy as I had done so online, but just incase anything goes wrong on the app I always make sure to get a paper boarding pass, plus it's something I collect. After a quick Lounge visit, I made my way to the gate, how disappointing that boarding didn't start but another 20 mins of waiting was appropriate. No announcement of any kind, and we found out onboard the logistics had to be sorted as the plane came straight out of the hanger. The Cabin Crew were borderline exceptional and one of the best crew I've had by, especially the Customer Service Manager. She interacted very well with passengers and thanked us for flying with Qantas, even shaking our hands when the journey was coming to an end. The seat itself is a highlight as I love the medium haul product Qantas offer. Food quality was very good, I just wished the portions were larger. IFE was okay, not many options that intrigued me and the less content didn't help. Overall, an excellent service with great customer service shining through.

### "They should be transparent"
Melbourne to Perth. Flight had issue as they said it has been struck by lightning while flying inbound. Flight was delayed for 40 minutes to run checks but at the mean time they were arranging flights for connecting flight passengers and telling them secretly this flight is cancelled. Questioned the staff a few times if this flight is still departing so we can make arrangement for our urgent engagement at destination but was not given an answer. 3 hours later finally they announced flight is cancelled and all the flights are full for the day by then. Some lucky passenger got flight for the night while some of us got told to transit further away or continue to wait. Compensation? $15 that won’t even get you a meal in airport and horrible horrible treatment from the Qantas staff at the gate! They should be transparent and told us earlier on, the person running the checks have left the plane ages ago! !

### "not travel Qantas business class"
Tokyo to Sydney. I would not travel on Qantas business class. Further cannot see how the business class can be charged so much more than economy, unless the latter has also deteriorated. The food options were nothing to write home about. The red wine tasted like vintage. Each time I needed to use the lavatory, I had to wipe the seat, drain water and dispose of paper towels left in wash basin. I don’t blame Qantas for the before. However, the cabin crew should make sure that things are clean at random times during the flight as the SIA cabin staff do in economy. I realise that SIA is not up to the mark it was years ago but they are much better than Qantas. I’m sorry to say this as they were great. My father use to work for Qantas and he would roll over in his grave if he heard of my experience. I fail to see how they can justify their sponsorship of various sporting and other activities. Maybe they need new management at the top level.

### "won't let us sit next to each other"
Booked Melbourne to Paris via Dubai operated by Emirates, the trip hasn't even started yet and it already sucks. When we pay a premium to book with an Australian airline, keep the money in AUS, support aussie jobs, and sign up to the frequent flyer program in order to build a relationship, why throw it all down in pieces with such small errors? Lift your game if you want loyal customers. You represent us internationally, and we expect better service from you. Your morals are not what our country represents. You won't let us sit next to each other, on a 24hour long haul flight. Why? Do you want us to suffer whilst having screaming children in our ear? Firstly, we have to call Emirates in order to do anything with the flight, and then each of you just points the finger at each other and says neither of you are responsible. You are both destroying each others reputations. Someone wear the pants, and take control of your customers experience, otherwise destroy both of your brands. $100 to sit next to each other whilst travelling Secondly, what's the deal with additional baggage? We don't even have the option to book it in advance, for the same finger pointing between you and Emirates. Then, once you find the rates amongst all the confusion it is $100/kg!It is unfair, and destroys your customer experience. How about trying for some quality difference between yourself and the other airlines, because if you continue to provide service that is no better than the rest, you force yourself to compete on price and have no unique qualities about your product. Consider how you can be different. Finally, you have a 2.5 hours wait time for telephone service. When we finally get a return call, five hours later, we receive sub par service from overseas call centres. Are you really a proud Australian business? Is that acceptable levels of service for customers you try so hard to win over as loyal through your FF programs which you spend millions marketing. When you provide these levels of service, your tarnish your brand. You leave a sour taste in our mouths, and we haven't even tried to cabin food yet. Hopefully you lift your game before lift-off.

### "every single time is delayed"
Melbourne to Singapore. If you want to be on time don't fly with Qantas. I travel to Singapore every 2-3 weeks from Melbourne and every single time I fly the flight is delayed. Today we are over an hour delayed. 2 weeks again, same situation, the trip before that, delayed by 5 hours and on and on it goes. This airline can not operate their aircraft on time. Also, despite A380s flying in and out of Melbourne every day they don’t keep parts In Melbourne. This makes delays even longer while you wait for parts to be flown from Sydney. If you want to be on time and not have connections ruined, don’t fly Qantas.

### "do not use Qantas"
Brisbane to Honolulu via Sydney. If you’re travelling domestically in Australia, it’s a great trip. If you’re travelling internationally, I would 100% recommend another airline: do not use Qantas. Of course, if you enjoy food and beer/wine running out before the trolley gets to you, then this is definitely the airline for you. If you enjoy doing that really annoying thing with headphones where you have to get the wire in a certain position in order to hear out of both of the earphones (attempted with multiple different headphones! ), then again this is definitely the airline for you. These didn’t happen just once this happened on all of our international flights with Qantas. The silver lining was the 2, possibly 3, ply toilet paper, which gives you somewhat hope that it’s not the world’s cheapest international airline after spending thousands of dollars (even though it’s prices are comparable to some of the more higher-end airlines that are 10 times better?). Please keep the Spirit of Australia in Australia.

### "the worst service"
Not Verified |  Hong Kong to Sydney. Every time I called Qantas reservation team, I waited for at least 1 hour to connect to a consultant. One time even waited for 3 hours! Their frequent flyer team and reservation team didn't talk to each other, so even I spoke to a FF consultant, they couldn't solve my problem and said would need to connect to the reservation team. And I needed to wait another 2 hours. Needless to say I need to repeat my details and story again. It just wasted my life to talk to them. They even didn't respond you in email. Anyway, the worst service.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service Checked into a Qantas flight to Darwin at Brisbane domestic airport. Wanted to see if I could get an exit row as I'm 196 tall. There was no one in the international transfer check in and the Qantas employee told me to go through. I got to the counter and the Lady there became rude with me. I said could I please see if any exit seats are available for my domestic flight today. She says, "you can do this at customer service, we don't need you here". I joking said, "thanks for helping me and not telling me to xxxx off". She then says, "I was thinking it just didn't say it". I've never gotten so much rudeness at a check-in counter anywhere with any airline. If I've made a mistake and got in the wrong line there are better ways to treat customers. If I talked to people like that where I work, I would be there much longer. Great way to start a long day of travel.

### "experience could not have been worse"
Perth to Melbourne. My experience could not have been worse. Poor service at Qantas club, flight was late, inflight entertainment not working, checkin bag drop rejected my bad, had trouble finding help, then had to queue up while 1 person was at the Check-in/Assistance counters, wifi is so slow nothing will stream. Caption said flight was late because the aircraft was late out of Melbourne, however i had a text 12 hours ago that the flight was delayed, so that is rubbish. I used to talk Qantas up all the time, now i fly virgin, what happened Qantas, i used to be proud of our national carrier, not any more.

### "the deteriorating service"
Melbourne to Perth. As a frequent flyer with Qantas I’m becoming very disappointed with the deteriorating service over the last 20 years, in almost all areas of their business, including: - poor phone & online customer service (long wait times, phone dropouts, no replies to messages or emails) - reduced leg room (comparable to budget airlines) - in-flight entertainment regularly non-functioning - increased number of flight delays and often do not receive any notifications of these delays (on app, SMS or email) - rude and disinterested cabin crew - bland meals served in cardboard boxes The addition of free WiFi on some routes is a great addition, other than that I’m struggling to think of any good reason to remain a Qantas customer.

### "Worst service ever!"
Singapore to Hobart via Melbourne. Qantas has just cancelled the flight last minute on day of travel with just an sms notification. Initially i have thought it was a scam sms as I can't find any information in the Qantas website or online "manage booking" site. No service at all to assist or even explain what was going on. I had to call relentlessly to get to a dial tone on the hotline and waited for more than an hour before a human answered. This is totally unacceptable and Qantas is not a least bit apologetic. Worst service ever!

### "more like a low cost carrier"
Sydney to Denpasar. I booked an economy flight being only 6 hours and the last time I flew business on the a330 couldn't justify the price over the sub standard service. I was quite shocked on board this flight, cabin was filthy and old, we had ipads instead of inflight entertainment systems. When the flight crew were doing announcement the PA could not be heard over the ipads, the ipads charging cables were broken. Cabin crew friendliness, attitude and a willingness to help a 4/10. The meals were quite possibly the worst I have ever seen on a full service airline. Cold stale dinner served in a cardboard box, no trays to have our bread or dessert placed onto. Instead they place it all on the dirty seat trays which is very unhygienic. This is more like a low cost carrier. Ive only been a silver QF frequent flyer for 2 years but i think after this flight i will be returning back to velocity/ krisflyer programs

### "service and food was below average"
Singapore to Canberra via Brisbane. On board service and food was below average. When we arrived at Canberra one of luggage gone missing and airport luggage service informed me it will arrive in next flight from Brisbane and they will deliver at my home by 4.00pm. After spending whole evening waiting for the bag I called baggage service and waited for for 20-30min before some one pickup and informed that I should have called the office to let them know whether I will pick up or they will deliver. It is a  disaster. I am now certain that I will have to go to the airport tomorrow pay parking fee and pick up my baggage. I will not recommend this airline.

### "My seat was comfortable"
Sydney to Bangkok in August 2019. Early check in for flight and the check in was fast and courteous. Luggage labelled for priority treatment. Boarding was quite quick and easy. There was the customary towels and welcome drink after initial boarding. The flight was delayed by nearly an hour cause by both late arrivals and weather. None of the delay was made up during the flight. My seat was comfortable and easily converted to a flat bed. I had quite a good sleep on the plane. I had my meal late in the flight (a deliberate decision on my part) and the food was quite tasty and the portion size adequate My luggage was late off the plane. It should have been amongst the first group but there were many economy class bags before mine was delivered. The late arrival and late delivery meant that I was late getting my rental car and got caught up in Bangkok peak hour traffic. This coloured my experience of the flight.

### "was a terrible experience"
I had a transit flight from Bangkok to Queenstown via Sydney but my flight from Bangkok was delayed for almost 3hrs! And they kept holding at the Sydney airport for 30 mins before landing which made me miss my flight to Queenstown! They changed my flight to Auckland and had a domestic transfer to Queenstown! I had to take my baggage and cleared customs in Auckland which took a very long time to finish. The most unbelievable thing is there is no ground staff stood by to help .. no priority lane and my baggage was the last bag on baggage claim. I ran like crazy to domestic terminal to catch my flight to Queenstown which I could make it like 1 min before they closed the check-in counter. This was a terrible experience.

### "No compensation for cancelled flight"
Sydney to Melbourne. Rude staff. No compensation for cancelled flight. Barely any notice of flight cancellation. They texted me 1 hour before my flight that it was cancelled (no warning, no delay, just suddenly cancelled). They automatically booked me on another flight 5 hours later. I called customer service and was on hold for 1.5 hours. Customer service refused to listen to what I had to say and kept interrupting me saying that "I can possibly book you on another flight.". But I didn't want another flight, I wanted to know why my original flight was cancelled and if Qantas would give me any compensation for the delay (food voucher, taxi refund, flight voucher, upgrade, literally anything). After she interrupted me 3 times in a row she finally listened and told me that I had to ask the people at the airport. I asked the people at the sales desk at the airport and they told me to contact customer service! I will never book with them again if I can avoid it.

### "Absolutely disgusted with Qantas"
Absolutely disgusted with Qantas and will never fly with them again if it can be avoided. I flew from Mexico to Los Angeles, over 5 hour stopover then 15 hours to Sydney then on to Melbourne with Qantas. I imagined my luggage would be transferred to the Melbourne flight but I had to collect it and it took ages to come through. I was getting a little nervous about missing my flight. I put my luggage on a trolley and went to find the bus to take me to Qantas which was about to leave when I got there. Luckily a nice man on the bus helped me lift my suitcases on to the bus. When the bus arrived I couldn’t lift the two heavy suitcases and my 2 pieces of hand luggage. The bus driver got angry with me, said he was on a schedule and to hurry up. I’m a small woman travelling alone and I just couldn’t manage. The bus driver started yelling at me, I finally managed to drag the suitcases off the bus, by this time I was in tears. I was so distressed when I went through security that I was sent for a second security scan. I only just made it to my flight.

### "shocked by the terrible meal"
Hong Kong to Sydney in early Oct 19 and was shocked by the terrible meal offered with my business class ticket. I can't imagine Qantas even feels confident it's presentable enough for business class. Let alone I can hardly even cut it up with knife. I brought up with Qantas after the flight but the response was disappointing without genuine apology. I wouldn't have Qantas as my first choice anymore if they hold this attitude.

### "everything went incredibly smooth"
Singapore To Brisbane Via Melbourne. Early check in at Changi Airport was a breeze as there was a premium area for priority passengers and was available 12 hours before departure. Though the ground team were a third party company, they were very accomodating and pleasant during the process. After immigrations, we explored the airport as no lounges were open until mid afternoon. Security checks happened at the gate, a very different process and in my opinion was very efficient and quick. The cabin crew on this flight were a lot better than my departure out of Melbourne. As it was a 7 hour flight, I decided to opt in for a quick supper and head straight to bed. The crew understood that sleep and rest was precious on red eye flights that even during meal service they had dime the lights down enough to set the mood for sleep but can still serve food for other passengers. During the flight, the customer service manager greeted me and my partner with arrival cards and express cards for immigrations into Australia, a nice personal touch that I appreciate from any airline. The seat itself was comfortable enough and I did manage to get 3 hours of sleep but are definitely showing their age. IFE was really good but the older generation screen limits the options they can upload and the quality is not the best. Breakfast was delicious, options of oats, fruit and energisers was what I needed to start my day on arrival into Australia. Overall, everything went incredibly smooth with no issues in the slightest and I would recommend flying with Qantas into Asia as they offer good connections with their partner airlines into other destinations.

### "worst airline I've ever tried"
Sydney to Auckland. It was my first time to see a flight has less than 10 blankets for the whole aircraft. The aircon was too strong so I asked for a blanket. One stewardess told me soon they will distribute the blanket. I should not have believed her. After taking off, another stewardess only pass the blanket to a customer who sat at the front. I and another customer who sat in front of me raised hands to ask for the blanket, the stewardess simply ignored us. After passing all the blanket, she walked to us and said the blanket can only given to kid which was a big lie. We witness she gave to adult customers. My family was furious, the passengers in front of were furious. I would never ever use Qantas Airways anymore. The worst airline I've ever tried. Too bad I can't rate Qantas 1 out of 10. Even 1 is too high for such bad service.

### "they were as bad as ever"
After some bad experiences of Qantas in previous years, I try to steer clear of them, but this time, I couldn't avoid flying with them. On this route, they were as bad as ever. On the London to Singapore leg, the in-flight entertainment system wasn't working, and the blanket smelt unwashed. On the Singapore to Sydney leg, the Australian crew members were abrupt at best, conveying the strong impression that they were far too good for the job. As we neared Sydney, and it was clear the flight was going to arrive late, I asked one the chances of making the connecting flight to Canberra: he said "catch the next flight", and his partner quipped to him: "Should have said "Catch a bus! And Qantas wonder why they are losing business to Singapore Airlines. I made the Qantaslink connection to Canberra, but only because that flight departed late as well, as it almost always does. All in all, the usual grim Qantas experience.

### "haven’t Qantas lost the plot"
My wife and I have just flown business class from Melbourne to Europe return via Singapore. The international flights included Cathay Pacific, Swiss Airlines and Qantas. The Cathay Pacific and Swiss flights were very good, service was top notch cabin crew were excellent and the food great. Then we come to Qantas, Singapore to Melbourne on QF 36 03/10/2019. Well haven’t Qantas lost the plot - the aircraft was delayed an hour and when we did board further delays caused by a door that wouldn’t lock so consequently 2 hours late leaving Singapore The cabin is very old and dated on the A380 with the 2+2+2 configuration, no hot towel on boarding no tablecloths, cabin crew not that friendly then to top it all off breakfast was either a roll, croissant, muesli or fruit I thought for a minute I was on Jetstar. Qantas like to promote luxury but in fact it is becoming a high priced, low cost airline offering very basic services, other carriers from Australia provide a better service.

### "has lost it's spirit"
Perth to Singapore. The spirit of Australia has lost it's spirit and no longer cares about their customers. My wife and I flew Qantas from Perth to Singapore on the 30/09/19 with the return flight booked for 6:40pm on the 09/10/19. We had to check out of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel at 11:00. I checked onto the flight on line and dropped our baggage in at the Changi Airport and waited. At 12:30 pm I received a text stating the flight had been cancelled. There was no explanation or advise on what to do. Not even an apology! I tried calling Qantas but no one would answer. We tried to speak to someone from Qantas at the Airport but no one was available. When passengers arrived at 4:30pm to check in they couldn't and the Qantas staff who arrived at the same time had no idea the flight had been cancelled or what to do. They made calls and said they had no idea what was going on. After some time they told us the flight had been rescheduled for the following night. I had no baggage as I had checked it in. Qantas rep said to go to lost and found. As a result I had to go through customs to gain entry and again to leave with my bags. Taxis were arranged and we were put up in the cheapest hotel they could find, the Boss Hotel. My wife and I could not move in the room unless we placed our bags on the two single beds and the toilet was so close to the shower screen we couldn't sit on it properly. The window looked out onto a dark concrete wall. And the lighting was ridiculous. 2 powdered coffee and milk satchels provided for our stay. Food vouchers were provided for a nearby bar/kiosk. We were told that a bus would take us to the airport at 9:30 am. I received a call from the hotel in the morning advising that the flight had been cancelled again and we were to keep our rooms. I received a email from Qantas stating the flight was now scheduled for 8:40 pm on the 13/10/19. The only flight I could get out of Singapore was on Air Asia via Malaysia leaving at 9:30pm 10/10/19 arriving in Perth 5:15am 11/09/19 cost $2.300!. I have tried cancelling the Qantas flight for the 13/10/19 but I can't cancel on line, the site says I must call Qantas and after 90 minutes on hold I was finally able to cancel my booking and get a refund, in 21 days. I can accept that things go wrong, and flights get delayed and cancelled. I can’t accept Qantas not keeping us informed or providing at least basic advice as what to do.

### "crew always chit chatting"
Melbourne to Singapore. What annoys me is the crew tend to always chit chatting between each other when they are serving the passengers not looking at the passenger when serving as they are busy in their own conversation with other crew members /colleagues. And they were so busy chit chatting while serving they forgot my dessert - so i asked for it - the crew just handed it to me with no apology and no eye contact while continue chit chat with her colleague and laughed away. And some crew would knock into your elbows while pushing the cart roughly around and no apology extended like they don't care. Some crew won't even smile just go about their work like robots to do the minimum task. When passenger ask about the menu the crew don't seem to know what they are serving ! Can't answer basic question like what is the meat in the menu for example. Not sure they will say. Just a general lack of care or interest or a smile i would say about the service not that they are rude or anything. Just in their own world not engaging with passengers.

### "it was an okay service"
Brisbane To Singapore Via Melbourne. Domestic connections in Australia are easy especially through Melbourne airport as all terminals are in the same building. Check In was a breeze along with security for domestic and international flights being quick and efficient. After a quick visit to the first class lounge, it was an on time departure to Singapore for our holiday. The cabin crew were a mix bag, some were particularly warm and personal while others were cold and not present. As of late I have found the Customer service aspect very hit and miss and I hope Qantas reiterate this important aspect back into their core values and not rely on the ticket sales and frequent flyer program to save them in the long run. Catering quality was above average, nothing I would highlight but the time frame was so long that it felt like it took over 2 hour for the meal service. IFE was average, this doesn't help as the old hard product prevent Qantas from adding more content and better quality screens. Overall, it was an okay service but once they retrofit all their current A380 it would enhance the quality of the inflight experience.

### "not offer even a bottle of water"
Brisbane to Sydney. After boarding people on aircraft, get delayed 1 hour and 40 mins and changed airplane and boarding people again, during delay not offer even a bottle of water or anything as apologies.

### "economy was a misery"
Sydney to Santiago. I was wary after reading so many bad reviews online. I have been a member of QFF for almost 25 years and Plat for 8. Travelling in economy was a misery on both legs of this return ticket. The first leg I was at least pleased to receive good quality food and there was some attentiveness provided by the crew who walked around with jugs of water and offered refills sporadically during the flight. Maybe at 2hr intervals. On the return leg there was announcement at the start of the flight telling passengers that they must get up and refill the water bottle handed out at start of flight (we all know that water from plane tanks is risky, especially on a 25 year old 747). There was then no drinks service throughout the flight. After second meal service (7 hrs into flight) there was no service for the remaining 6.5 hours. The economy crew remained huddled in the curtained-off galley. I went down and politely asked for a coffee. The flight attendant was unpleasant, did not smile and made me feel like I was asking a favour. This crew was particularly rude, except for one nice attendant in the business cabin that said hi. I am so disappointed that this is the standard provided by our national carrier. Qantas you are letting your country down. I will get a Oneworld Emerald status match from another oneworld carrier and use Qantas for my lifetime gold when I have to fly for work. I've had good business class experiences on Qantas but if this is how you treat the majority of your customers they will definitely be one offs. I'd say you need to address your training and leadership standards. The maintenance of the aircraft is also an issue, my entertainment system was also faulty and seat uncomfortable and I am a normal size. Qantas has plunged to the standard of many of the US and British carriers in the nineties. They have actually since tried to lift their game but Qantas seems to have just gone there! I'll be sticking to the Asian and Middle East carriers from now on for my international travel.

### "they just want to get more money out of you"
Not Verified |  Bought return tickets with Qantas from Sydney to Singapore. The way there was a good. On the way back, however, my other connecting flight was running late so there was not a chance I was going to catch my flight with Qantas back to Sydney. I rang Qantas a day ahead letting them know of my situation and asking about my options. A very inexperienced customer service lady put me on hold for over 45 min (now that's a waste of roaming data!) Only to explain that they could put me on a different flight with a price difference of nearly 1000$! Also, upon my demand to give me at least a partial refund, she stated that the tickets are non refundable and I only got about 100$ of tax back (tickets were worth about 800$). Good thing I notified them, because apparently I was just about to miss my flight, there is a hefty 500$ no show fee! Qantas should be aware that things do change for people. Bad weather happens, flights get delayed and rescheduled. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they just want to get more money out of you instead of providing you with more suitable options. I ended up cancelling a reservation and buying a brand new flight with a different airline. Never flying Qantas ever again! Very disappointing.

### "Will not fly Qantas again"
Adelaide to Brisbane. Horrible check in and bag drop process. No line to get bag dropped only self serve and no signed place to get service or information. Wasted 30 mins getting palmed off from very unhelpful staff. The auto bag drop is cumbersome and does not work well. If they employed real people would be awesome. Will not fly Qantas again. The rude lady just blamed us for not putting labels on correct side of case yet no signage about that until you are at bag drop.

### "Poor service for international flight"
Melbourne to Los Angeles. A distinct lack of consistent and willing cabin crew. There were intervals of over thirty minutes where no cabin crew were seen walking down the aisle. By contrast, even flying domestically on US carriers like Delta cabin crew were constantly visible carrying trays of water to order to customers. When I went to ask for water the cabin crew took over twenty minutes to bring it over. Food was also insufficient in quantity given the flight duration. I’m not a big eater, but had I not brought food along with me I’d be seriously hungry. The inflight entertainment was also subpar. Even if one was to pause and later resume a movie or TV show, a 2-minute advert would play (the same advert over and over. I suspect I watched it at least thirty times) Poor service for a domestic flight let alone an expensive 14.5-hour international one. Next time I’ll fly with American Airlines for 30% less.

### "seats are too tight"
Singapore to Melbourne. At Singapore airport, I asked if I could get extra legroom seat as I'm 6ft 4ins. No plane full was the reply. Got on the plane, the seats are too tight for long journeys, knees touching the seat in front only good point was being in the aisle seat. Really uncomfortable trip. Pre-trip I had tried to get on the Qantas seat booking page, no access. Then there was the food - really poor verging on disgusting. Finally, the plane was downright cold, no wonder they are making a profit, it's at the expense of economy passengers.

### "service was excellent"
Melbourne to Sydney. I enjoyed my flight, the service was excellent. A very tasty dinner was served (roast pork) and the wine was excellent. IFE was limited, No personal screen, but that didn't matter for such a short flight.

### "Qantas uses a widebody"
This is one of two planes I regularly fly between Melbourne and Sydney. When flying around dinner time, you get a hot meal and an alcoholic beverage on this domestic route which is nice. Sometime the food is ok, sometimes the food tastes plasticky. Anyway, at least the IFE through an iPad provides enough distraction for an hour or so of the flight. Even though the route is short, Qantas uses a widebody due to the volume of passengers as the flights are usual quite full which makes it more appealing than VA flights that are exclusively flown on B737s. The flight was typical of what I experienced on most of the Qantas flights I've had on this route.

### "You've lost me Qantas"
Brisbane to Tokyo. This was my first flight with Qantas and I was very disappointed. My meal on the way to Japan was inedible and one of the crew members repeatedly bumped into me while navigating the aisles. Unfortunately coming back was worse! Dinner option for the last section of the plane was sushi, the other 2 choices had run out. I'd been eating Sushi for 2 weeks and was over it. I was offered something from business class after their service. An hour later this hadn't arrived. All I had received was a dessert and no cutlery. My friend asked the staff what was happening and she stated that I had refused the offer (not so). Anyway finally the supervisor came to my assistance and I was given a meal but the service really was not good enough. Other foreign airlines I've travelled with have provided a much better service for money. You've lost me Qantas.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Sydney to Hamilton Island. Awful airline, from the booking process to inflight service is appalling. I always bite my tongue and never want to leave a bad review but I’ve had enough. Qantas customer service is non existent. I will never fly this airline again.

### "All flights cancelled or delayed"
I have flown four flights on Qantas between Melbourne and Sydney in the last 10 days. All flights were cancelled or delayed. What sort of airline is this? There excuse is either wind (of which there is none today in Sydney or Melbourne) or mechanical failure (in which case we should all be worried because all flights got cancelled today so all planes have broken down).

### "Utterly disappointed"
Sydney to Dubai. Incredibly disappointing interaction all around. Even though Qantas is a member of the OneWorld alliance they offload some of their flights to another carrier who isn't a member and is known to be an unpleasant and unprofessional airline, they also allow virtually no changes, upgrades, or consideration for individuals utilizing oneworld alliance frequent flyer programs. I've made the mistake of booking through them this time, but it will be the last time I do so. Utterly disappointed.

### "Not that good an experience"
Not Verified |  Singapore to Sydney. Not that good an experience. Had initially booked on Emirates via Brisbane but the flight got rescheduled and hence called and rebooked the flight. The phone customer service was excellent and I was rebooked on a direct Qantas flight. At Changi, the queues were extremely long and even though we arrived well in time we almost missed our flight and our bags were left at Changi. Aboard the flight, the service was above average but nothing special and the flight arrived and departed on time so no complaints there. Qantas is a good choice for travelling between Australia and Singapore but I would recommend booking Emirates or Singapore if it works out for you and budget isn't an issue. Paid 500 one way which is reasonable as it was the peak holiday season.

### "ridiculous amount for excess bags"
Johannesburg to Wellington via Sydney. We decided to make the move to New Zealand from South Africa. We flew business class via Sydney and really thought our trip will be without any problems. We paid a lot of money and knew from the beginning we will have to pay in due to our excess baggage. The problem that I have with Qantas is that they did not offer any migration ticket for business class travelers. Got to the check in counter and started the process to check our bags in, what a eye opener. They charged us more then half of what our ticket cost for our extra bags. I flew with Emirates before to New Zealand and have not payed that amount for excess bags. That was a ridiculous amount to pay for the excess bags. The lady did give me the offer to book our bags online and then we will pay cheaper, why don't we have that option at the counter and only online? You would though as a business class traveler you would get some benefits for the amount that you are paying. Booking our bags online did safe us a small amount, but not by that much. Really think Qantas is ripping the customers off with what they are charging and no immigration tickets for business class passengers! !

### "Pretentious staff and airline"
Sydney to Broome. Pretentious staff and airline. I was waiting in line to board, upon being told that beverages can’t be taken into the tarmac, I turned to ask the question, can I finish the drink? But before I could finish the question, their staff snatch the drinks from my partner and I. No chance given to submit the drinks willingly. I felt offended and belittled, so I wrote to the customer care, and I was fronted with lies and a ‘I couldn’t care less’ attitude from their executive relations office. I proposed questions that they refused to answer, and gave some pathetic excuse that they’re closing the complaint. The pathetic answer? They refused to put into writing. They continue to say that an intrusion of personal space and theft is appropriate behaviour for their staff. They can’t get anything right; bags being shipped to different cities to where their passengers were. Can’t take off on time and other basic operations they cannot get right. They have left me stranded in a foreign country because the easiest task of checking clients tickets (technically ‘PNR’s’) was not done. Next time try ‘I’ ‘R’ ‘Enter’, not that hard. When I called customer care to try find a way home, you should have heard the lies they said to denounce blame. They charge premium pricing, because of a heightened self perception of significance, if you ask why their prices are significantly more expensive, they won’t be able to give you a legitimate reason. If you read the T&C’s of their tickets, they only promise to get you from A to B, the lack of quality service and recognition that their clients are human beings is not actually mentioned.

### "What a joke airline"
Not Verified |  Disgrace. Still has not improved, delays in Melbourne understandable due to weather, but no confidence is given when there are further delays in Sydney. 12.10 became we will let you know shortly. At about 1.50pm notified us 2.45 take off due to engineering issues. Started boarding 40 passengers and then came an anouncement that captain has asked to wait. Such a debacle. How about this Qantas, provide reliable planes that stop breaking! (2nd time that I experienced this in 2 weeks), provide a clear explanation, provide some refreshments. And inform your staff what is going on! What a joke airline.

### "the service was atrocious"
Tokyo to Brisbane. My husband and I purchased business class tickets so that we could have adequate legroom, be able to sleep, receive good service and have decent food. The customer service on the flight from Japan, however, was basically non-existent. After boarding we were essentially ignored and not offered the usual welcoming drink. Then, the first thing the crew did after take-off was to ask whether we wanted the bed made-up, this was before the food was served! The most insulting part was dinner. The salad put in-front of me was premixed with the dressing and too acidic for me to eat. Other airlines provide the dressing separately so that it can be added to taste. The bread offered was not warmed, as it is on many airlines, and we were not asked if we required any more. The main course of rice with a watery minced beef on top, but as it was delivered on a small plate the dish was a soggy mess. The food not only looked disgusting, but being soggy, was inedible. The crew, however, did not bother to ask why I did not eat the food, or offer an alternative, they simply eventually picked it up and said nothing. Although I was able to eat the dessert, it was not presented with any courtesy. Breakfast was also interesting, as I ordered cereal, yogurt, milk and a black tea. I was given a small bowl of cereal, but with the yogurt and milk mixed - not with the yogurt separate. Interestingly, when I requested milk for the tea, the crew member was surprised! I cannot understand why Qantas serves food to its customers in such a way, where all ingredients of the one dish are mixed on the same plate! Basically the crew could not be bothered and the service was atrocious. This is not the first time I have travelled business class with Qantas, but this flight was by far the worse in terms of both food and cabin service. At this stage I will not travel Qantas again, especially business class, which costs more than on any other airline.

### "attendants were courteous"
Sydney to Cairns. I was able to use the domestic business lounge owing to One World emerald status, and the lounge had a variety of food and fresh juice despite it was a domestic lounge. Aircraft was clean, and attendants were courteous. The flight was on time.

### "Horrendous customer service"
Tokyo to Melbourne. Horrendous customer service - our flight was delayed that night and they kept us on the plane for nearly five hours with no food or water. At one point they turned the air conditioner off, and we were in the middle of summer. They eventually let us off the plane as the airport was closed. The chief air steward told us that Qantas would not be finding us accommodation due to the G20 Summit in Osaka,  600km away in another prefecture. We were abandoned at the airport as the staff had their accommodation sorted. It's been nearly two months since my flight and Qantas will still not reimburse me for my out of pocket expenses the night of the flight. They have changed their mind on what their cancellation policy is and how much I'm entitled to be reimbursed. I am also left to question whether this airline is racist as Caucasian passengers on that flight have been reimbursed for more than what I am claiming, yet Qantas is still making me send them copies of my receipts.

### "the Qantas app and free wifi"
Not Verified |  We booked our Brisbane to Sydney return flight with Qantas Frequent flyer points. I had my own wheelchair with me which they checked in for free and provided one of the Qantas wheelchairs which was fine. Got to board first (which unfortunately means you un board last because you have to wait for help) a Qantas wheelchair was waiting for me on arrival into Sydney. The plane from Brisbane to Sydney had inflight entertainment on the back of the seat and free wifi plus you could use the Qantas entertainment app on your device. Many options. We were on a early morning flight so got served breakfast, only a small meal but it’s only an hour and a half flight so it’s fine. Was asked if I wanted a pillow and blanket when I boarded which was helpful. Flight back was the same except no entertainment on the back of the seat but there was the Qantas app and free wifi (their wifi is 10/10) was a night time flight so got served a hot meal and a drink, I picked the wine. Both flights we had to sit on the tarmac for 45 mins but wasn’t that bad.

### "step up your game"
Auckland to Melbourne. Traveller on QF158 on the 18 August- unfortunately the flight experienced engineering issues and had to be cancelled. This is understandable. Nonetheless, the following organization for hotels/ bus/ information regarding postponed flight and tickets, luggage pick up etc was very poorly executed. The staff should be trained better to organize and provide more detailed information regarding this. Most people were left confused, asking each other what was going on/ what we had to do. The flight was postponed to the following day at 7am. I would have expected given the previous days events, for utmost care to ensure there were minimal delays and that things would operate in a clockwork manner. This was not the case. The flight was delayed again,  arrival was approximately an hour delayed. Qantas, you need to ‘step up your game’.

### "I cannot fault the service"
Singapore to Melbourne. I cannot fault the service my partner and I received. Cabin crew were amazing, friendly and fully professional. Food was hot and flavoursome. Will definitely fly with Qantas again. Thank you for a lovely flight home, after us travelling 30 hours with other airlines that day, it was a truly pleasant surprise and experience.

### "Worst flight ever"
Denpasar to Melbourne. Worst flight ever. Ovens apparently not working so no meals were provided. Lights in bathrooms not working. My husband asked for water, the crew member gave him the whole “you should have a bottle in your seat”. He had to explain that he hadn’t, which i think even if he did, why not just give him another one?! When I asked when are the lights gonna be switched off since it was a night flight, the crew member answered ironically how they couldn’t serve in the dark but yet the switched part of the lights off. My eyes were hurting at this point. On our way to Bali in July, they gave us food but by the time they reached me, there was no chicken left. I told the lady that I’m allergic to fish but she didn’t even give me an extra bread or anything. Wasted my money on what I thought was a better airline than Jetstar etc, but just going to choose jetstar from now on

### "flight itself was uneventful"
This is a regular run for me on Qantas from Sydney to Dallas so as a known quantity it really is very familiar. I was in the economy cabin and sat just in front of the galley so it was a bit busy but nothing too disruptive. Could recline my seat without having anybody behind complaining. Being a Platinum frequent flyer has its perks with a personal meet and greet, Jack and Coke to start of the journey and the CSM dropped off some noise cancelling headphones. Food was untouched as I had loaded up in the lounge. The flight itself was uneventful and had a spare seat next to me so could spread out a little. The IFE was not used much save to check the flight map. Have discovered the joys of Netflix. Many folk complain about Qantas and its service but honestly I'm not sure what they anticipate. If you are in a premium cabin then the level of service is different. In Y, the FA's have a lot of people to feed and look after so personal touches may not be there all the time. All in all a satisfying flight as always with on time arrival.

### "Highly recommended"
QF2 from London to Sydney. The first leg was an upgrade to premium and then economy from Singapore. Unfortunately had dined like a king at the London lounge and so with the gate upgrade did not enjoy the delights of premium. It is a superb place to be and the difference is palpable. It is business lite as opposed to economy enhanced. Had seat 24K which is an exit row plus also has the luggage bin next to it so a great place to store your stuff and as additional resting place. F & B were great (had the beverage part not the food) and attentive service. Highly recommended. The run from Singapore was in the main cabin and a world of difference as you would expect. Courteous but the FA's were keen to have the PAX fed and off to sleep. It was a quick run, 6.25 mins so around 3-4 hours maximum between meal services.

### "the crew were great"
A swift trip on QF7/8 to Dallas. The actual flying part was fine an regulation. As always a great experience in Premium. The F7 B were great as was the service. Now the problems. This particular craft was involved in a delay in LAX a few days before. Clearly had some gremlins. The 12.30 pm departure became 1.30pm and then 9 pm. It final got away at 10.55 pm just before the Sydney curfew. Qantas were on the phone to the government seeking a waiver but refused. Fortunately everyone was loaded up swiftly and underway. A 2pm arrival became a 10.45 pm in Dallas so that blew up my afternoon there. Now the knock on effect of this was a delayed departure two days later. It was the same crew coming back and regulations required a 52 hours gap. So a 10.30 pm departure became 2.25 am. Despite all of this the crew were great. Big shout out to them.

### "bad experience I had with them"
I had connecting flight from Jakarta to Sydney and onto Auckland. Flight was delayed from Jakarta without delay I suppose to have more than 1 and half hours to my next flight which is from Sydney to Auckland. Delay is understandable, but the way they handle connecting flight that are delayed in unprofessional. Soon as I arrived in Sydney I immediately ran to my gate flight is 7.10am i arrived at the gate 7.10 i still saw luggage being loaded to the plane but no one at the gate, so i looked around for transfer desk, found one, i explain them what happened and the lady show no empathy at all jut like robot, print my new boarding pass and luggage tag and that’s it. No sympathy for the situation what so ever. This not the only bad experience I had with them, not to mention bad service, food is horrible too.

### "another satisfying flight"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Similar experience to my flight up to the Gold Coast from Melbourne. Friendly, professional staff who enjoyed what they were doing. Check in quick. Departed and arrived on-time. Baggage on carousel as I arrived in the baggage collection area. No personal video screen this time which did not bother me. A light lunch of a good quality pie. Price was not much more than the low cost carriers. Overall, another satisfying flight.

### "still awaiting for their respond"
We had our vacation in South America flew from East via Sydney with our first stop in Chile. Travelling time was much shorter compared flying via West. With airlines competitive promotional fares and the convenience of e-booking, we booked our flights with SQ and QF respectively. We know of the fact that we do not require entry visa to AUD meeting transiting requirements. SQ checked our baggage through to SCL on our outgoing flight. However, it was a nightmare on our return journey. We arrived at SCL airport 3 hours ahead prior to flight departure. It was a long queue when we arrived at about 10am. We were attended for check in about 45 minutes before departure. To our astonishment, QF refused to check us due to separate flight booking. Only then we learnt QF does not have baggage agreement with SQ hence they were incapable to check us. The solution was to have ETA to enter SYD, check out from the immigration and re-check in. As time was of the essence we requested the staff to apply ETA at a fee. However, the staff concerned deserted her counter and returned after about 15 minutes later. Worst of all the supervisor was all along sitting on the next counter knew of our predicament. The supervisor in question did not take her initiative to attend to us or exchange roles with her peer to resolve the situation. I felt that she knew time was running out, she tested our ignorance by telling us ETA will take 2 working days to process. Only on our insistence that it is 24/7 she processed upon our request. Nevertheless ETA received but QF flown without us. Neither did she render any assistance in getting us another flight home. We had to pay for any exorbitant fare on another routing home. We lodged our compliant to QF requesting for compensation and still awaiting for their respond. We queried SQ and they replied that our baggage were checked through to SCL based on their baggage policy for interline passengers. I fail to understand SQ is able to go the extra miles and yet QF is unable to do so. With the competitive air fare and people travel extensively, shouldn't all international carriers collaborate to serve interline travelers.

### "I will not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Hawaii via Sydney. I could not rate this service low enough. After more than 3 hours delay at Melbourne we flew to Sydney and were rushed to a waiting bus and then to a waiting plane. Missed claiming tax refund due to lack of time. When we got to Hawaii we discovered our luggage had been left in the rain in Melbourne (where it poured all morning during they delay) as all of our clothes were drenched. Rang customer service and after waiting more than 2 hours left a complaint and were told someone would call me to discuss within 2 days. That was a week ago and no contact made with me. They don’t care about their customers. The flying kangaroo has become s national disgrace. Although I’m a member I will not fly with them again.

### "the food was the worst"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Perth. I think Qantas have lost the plot - the food was the worst I have ever tasted. I was on row 50 going out, they ran out of one of the three options available which I would have chosen,so I went for the salmon salad thinking they cannot ruin that -  it was absolutely shocking. The plane was quite late leaving, electrical fault and on the return trip there was no TV on the back of the seat hostess said it was an old plane which they usually don't use on this route. If this was all Jetstar then I would accept it for the cheaper price thinking you get what you pay for, but for the money that Qantas charge very unimpressed.

### "service was just disinterested"
Not Verified |  Singapore to Melbourne. Consistent with my recent experiences flying Qantas, the service, even in business is extremely sub par. After being shown to my seat, I was left out of the initial drinks run. I also did not get a menu (others had this ready in their seat). They forgot my pajamas and I had to ask for this. The quality of the food has also deteriorated in the last 3 years. In addition, the quantity has dropped significantly - I am sure Qantas will tell you this is in the name of wellness in the air, but I suspect this has more to do with cost cutting. Food service was perfunctory at best. General service was just disinterested and sometimes bordering on disdainful. I was returning to my seat from the toilet and instead of swivelling to give way to the passenger, the cabin crew just walked straight right at and into me without apologising! They have so much to learn from the asian and middle eastern carriers, and so much to catch up on in terms of levels of service, I cannot imagine Qantas has the audacity to charge as much as they do for their flights. I would fly Qatar (oneworld) or Singapore Airlines (Star Alliance) any day above Qantas. I have been a loyal QFF, but am now voting with my feet.

### "disdainful check in agent"
Not Verified |  I was flying with my mom from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. The tickets were booked on 2 separate bookings and I wasn't able to select a seat for my mom next to me despite picking an empty row. I went on online chat to get this sorted. After a 30 min chat, all the online agent was able to do was link our booking to alert the check in agent that we are travelling together. At check in, we had the misfortune of being served (or rather not served!) by an unhappy disdainful check in agent. I explained our predicament and after asking twice, he reluctantly checks and tells me "nowyou are seated together". Through our encounter, he sighed and dragged his feet at every query and request as though I had asked for his first born! I often fly business and maybe I have forgotten what it's like in economy, but this is unacceptable for any class of travel! Fast forward to the cabin. I now understand his smirk when he he uttered the above line. He had seated us in the last row of an A380 next to the toilets. I have no idea why we had been treated with such hate and disdain when all we had been was polite and courteous. The onboard service was marginally better, although for the most part perfunctory.

### "does not mean you will get that seat"
Sydney to Perth. Caveat emptor - Buyer Beware. Paying extra $65 for a specific seat which is confirmed and Qantas has taken your money does not mean you will get that seat when you get to airport. I select my flights specifically on availability of exit row window seat availability for purchase which I happily pay the extra $65 for the seat. I am 6ft 6inch 130kg and I am not fat. I am simply a large very well built and very fit man. I choose this seat which I pay extra for to allow me to lean to one side to make flight more comfortable for myself and passenger next to me. I received my electronic receipt, Seat selection confirmed and payment $65 received. I check in online for ease at airport and my seat is not what I paid for. Is in middle of plane crammed in between other passengers. It just happens sometimes. It is what it is talk to counter staff at airport. Arrive airport early and talk to check in counter staff. Response, It just happens sometimes. Nothing I can do. The seat you want is allocated to someone else. (I paid and Confirmed booking how can this happen) Response. Don't know it just does nothing can do about it. Go online and fill in complaint if not happy. Go to customer service counter. More of the same. Just happens? What sort of deceitful response is that. How does it happen and why do you take payment and confirm selection only to mess passengers around. As a passenger I paid extra for specific seat and meet every one of your requirements for selection.

### "Friendly, professional staff"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Check in then through security to boarding gate took approx.15 minutes. Minimal waiting. Departure delayed by 15 minutes, however kept well informed. Mid-morning snack of 2 large decent quality cookies. Friendly, professional staff in the air and on the ground. Luggage was on carousel by the time I arrived in the baggage pick-up area. The seat was comfortable with limited leg room, however I accept this as a trade off for the considerably cheaper airfares we pay in economy these days (compared with several years ago ). Free wi-fi available, however I did not use. Overall a highly professional and efficient airline which I will continue to fly. Look forward to the return flight tomorrow.

### "customer service does not exist"
Not Verified |  Adelaide to Melbourne. I booked a flight on line and never received an electronic ticket via email - and rang the 131313 number the next day 24 hrs prior to my flight as they said the centre was busy they offered a returned call - this returned took 5 hrs before they rang- I was then put onto an automatic waiting line and was told I was next in line. I then was required to wait a further 20 min for somebody to actually speak to me. The customer service does not exist - to wait that much time to seek help is unacceptable.

### "customer service is very poor"
Brisbane to Port Hedland via Perth. I fly with Qantas a lot for work and have done for leisure, and I just don't get why it's expensive to fly and the customer service is very poor. Contacting them is very difficult and using their chat service online is only useful if you have a whole day to waste on waiting for them to reply. It's a chat Qantas not email. I definitely would not recommend using them. It seems like they have a bee in their bonnet when they don't realise that we are the customers.

### "What shameful treatment"
Adelaide to Nadi via Sydney. I have never experienced such a disruption What should have been a straightforward flight was turned into a farce. Fog in Sydney delayed flights and so 12 passengers from Adelaide were late getting in and we rushed to the gate to find our International flight had left! We then had to return via immigration retrieve our bags and be put on a flight via Brisbane arriving in Nadi 13 hours after our original arrival. This is for a flight 4 hours away from Australia. We were given a voucher for 15 dollars. What shameful treatment. Poor communication wrong messages and this airline has a supposedly good reputation.

### "staff were very friendly"
Sydney to Melbourne. An enjoyable flight. Again, as with the flight to Sydney it was cancelled. But I was able to take a flight departing 90 minutes earlier. The staff were very friendly and efficient. They served a very tasty and filling salad. IFE was limited. No personal screen, but that didn't matter for such a short flight. Again I miss the option of music!

### "Overall an enjoyable flight"
Melbourne to Sydney. Unfortunately my flight was cancelled, but it was a blessing in disguise as I was able to fly an A330 instead of a 737 which had a much better seat. There was a delay boarding and departing unfortunately. The staff were very friendly. IFE was OK, it's such a pity they no longer offer music. The food (Chicken Kiev) was quite average for a business class meal. Economy on the way home was tastier. The wine served was excellent. Overall an enjoyable flight.

### "Qantas has fallen way behind other premium carriers"
Not Verified |  Sydney to London Heathrow. Sadly Qantas has fallen way behind other premium carriers in many departments. I usually enjoy flying A380's due to generous cabin space and comfy seats, but Qantas offers perhaps the worst example of this aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were old and in a poor condition, tray tables damaged and entertainment screens not working. Seat pitch was also really poor, with my knees easily pushing against the seat in front. Mercifully there was a spare seat to my left so I could twist to the side. The biggest disappointment was the food on offer. The chicken main course was almost inedible, served with chewy spinach and bland potatoes. No starter, cheese or crackers, nor side. The dessert was a flabby mousse that I left. As for breakfast, it was a tired fruit salad with a snack size muffin. Honestly the worst food I have ever had on any airline in the world. I wouldn't ever fly Qantas again for long haul, especially given the price you pay for the lack of quality. It's not surprising that Qantas now only scrape into the four-star category; to me it should be three star at best.

### "A very standard experience"
Sydney to Melbourne return with Qantas Airways. Terrible weather conditions in Sydney/Melbourne caused delays which had a flow on affect throughout the day. I was lucky as my flight was just slightly delayed and arriving only 30 minutes late. The boarding process was slightly chaotic because of cancellations making the schedule more tight. Cabin crew were mediocre, almost robotic but on the return flight they were more lively and enthusiastic. Catering of snacks and drinks were delicious and the IFE offering great options to pass the time. A very standard experience for domestic travel. The main thing to work on is the Priority boarding as it needs to be enforced.

### "very disappointed with my flight"
Singapore to London. I was very disappointed with my Qantas flight from beginning to end. As a frequent flyer I was able to use the lounge in Singapore which was disappointing in it's food offerings. The flight to London was on a very old A380 which I believe was to be renovated soon. Qantas has cut down on the meals you only get the hot meal option with no salads ,vegetables or even desert. No more trays. Needless to say it is inadequate for such a long flight. Frequent flyer status is no longer acknowledged on Qantas flights as when I travel on other one world airlines. The choice of movies were fine but the screens were antique! I was given a small mineral water bottle on arrival on the aircraft but when I went to get more water I was told that they do not carry bottled water on the aircraft anymore because of cost savings! The air hostess was very hostile and annoyed at me for this. So I drank small cans of coke instead. The crew all had their own large bottled water with their names on it to make sure passengers don't take it! I was shocked, have never experienced this on any full service airline in my 40 years of flying. The crew were cold and stern and there were no drink runs throughout the flight. They do not answer any calls either. The toilets were not kept clean. Before landing we were given a small meal again a small container. I was very disappointed and hope that Qantas will reconsider carrying at least bottled water on their flights in future.

### "another great experience"
Sydney to Gold Coast. After a long flight from Amsterdam to Sydney via Dubai on Emirates it feels like you are home when you board a QANTAS plane and this was no exception. Despite a short flight time of about an hour and a gate to gate time of about 80 minutes the service included a drink before takeoff and a hot meal during the flight all served in a friendly and efficient manner. Overall another great experience with QANTAS.

### "so penny pinching"
Melbourne to London via Perth / Paris. I am outraged to find out that in our next flight which is to Paris in July that we are not entitled to a pick u car in Paris airport as I was told today that our flight from London is on BA. Well that is correct as we booked from Melbourne to Paris and as Qantas did not fly to Paris the only way to do it was via London. We have flown before many times via booking on Qantas although often on a Emirates flight where we have had pickups each of the 4 legs. What a complete rip off Qantas to wriggle out of it. Despite paying an enormous amount of money each to be precise and spending about 20 plus hours on Qantas flights and only a couple of hours on a BA flight Qantas penny pinches and by refusing to pay a car pickup. Because we are flying back on Emirates flights we get a pickup from our hotel in Paris and to our home in Melbourne. We are both longtime QFFs, currently Platinum, and are so angry about Qantas penny pinching illogical approach. I spoke to a person today who assured me if we had stopped in London it would have supplied it. Just not good enough. So many other airlines do provide it. The answer in case any one is interested is to book on Qantas but fly on actual Emirates planes or actually chose to fly other airlines who do provide pickups Yes first world problems etc but so penny pinching.

### "will never fly Qantas again"
Not Verified |  Ground staff at check in need more training and are slow. Flight was delayed by 1.20 minutes due to staff disorganisation and we missed our connecting flight. The ground crew in Bangkok didnt want to assist us in reimbursement and refused to put us in a cheap hotel for the night even though it was their fault. Cabin crew were lazy. 1) Left side the plane got served food and the other half got served 30 minutes later. 2) Crew gave left side ice cream, other half waited 2 hours for theirs. We all had to reach over one another to put our rubbish in the bag that a steward opened and walked down the plane with, he would not pick rubbish off peoples tables (no service). 3) Three of the seats infront of me would not return to the uprite position. The head rests pushed tour neck forward causing upper back and trapeze pain (bad seat design). 4) Food served was 1 meal 2 hours into the flight. Boarded at 9 am, got in the air just after 11 am, food at 1.30pm. They seved a snack (tart dumpling 1.5 hours before we landed in Bangkok (9 hour flight). Usually that flight consists of 2 solid meals. I am a frequent flyer and I will never fly Qantas again. Garuda in the 1980's is better than Qantas in 2019. Thai Airways is just so easy on every level and go above and beyond to make flying hassle free.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Cairns. We booked our return flights thru Qantas but the first flight was designated to fly with Jetstar. We knew we had to buy food on board the flight so brought our own but were shocked to discover we did not get any water or a cup of tea without having to pay. There was no inflight entertainment either. Considering our return flight home was with Qantas and included lunch, water, a cuppa and inflight entertainment we are annoyed that we paid the exact same price each way. Also, staff were somewhat brusque on Jetstar compared to Qantas.

### "A terrible let down"
Sydney to Tokyo. A terrible let down. 60+ minutes to check in (At Tokyo - 1x employee checking in the entire economy section). 60+ minutes to disembark the aircraft at Sydney (this was unacceptable really). I ordered GF meal, I didn't receive it. The flights were on time which is good I guess and the cabin crew were friendly. Airlines such as Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways offer a far superior service at a better price. I will not be flying Qantas again sadly.

### "weakest link is the cabin crew"
Sydney to Singapore. Generally well-run ops, flights departed/arrived mostly on time, pretty decent catering, and fairly efficient boarding. Cabin interior and seats are a little old, and not the most user-friendly. IFE is fiddly but content offering is decent. The weakest link is the cabin crew: efficient but cold. On my SYD-SIN flight, a crew member dashed past my (upper-deck Economy) seat with the catering cart on the way to First presumably, catching and crushing my foot against the seat back and not stopping or looking back despite a very audible "OW" from me. Cabin service is not that hard.

### "ranked 4 star but expected more"
Sydney to Denpasar. Qantas ranked 4 star but expected more when it comes to service and especially food, beverages and entertainment choices. Travelled with my husband whom has limited mobility and the staff were helpful but when meals served very average. Entree one dish just plonked on table as also main and asking for dessert was like pulling teeth. My husband asked for a toothpick but was told Qantas dont have any. Really. After meal staff disappeared, no follow up on flight for beverages. Limited chouce of films and dont even bother for the snack prior to landing. Dry cold cornish pastry again just plonked down. Thats it. Have flown Vietnam Airlines business and they outshine Qantas. Maybe some of their staff need to reconsider their profession.

### "the service is extremely poor"
Not Verified |  My wife and sister flew Qantas from Sydney to Vancouver via San Francisco on 4th June. Unfortunately after collecting their bags at San Francisco and having them forwarded to Vancouver they were never to be seen again. They boarded a cruise ship on 6th June with bags and with no real plan by Qantas (Westjet) on how they might receive them. Losing your bags may be a hazard of flying but lack of service when customers are seeking help should not be. Qantas say it is not their problem and you cant contact their carrier from Australia - the phones repeatedly ring out unanswered. Joining a cruise without bags and with no assurance that you will see your bags again for the next 14 days ruins expensive holidays. Qantas may be a good airline but the service is extremely poor.

### "experience was worse than expected"
Qantas is a legacy career and known for good service and great catering. My business class experience on an evening flight was worse than expected. - Flight attendants in business looked rather uninterested and definitely lacked some sparkle or a desire - No proper headphones- just standard from Economy which is weird for a legacy career - No menus distributed - Warm and cheap sparkling wine which is called as champagne, very bad choice of red wines, no spirits offered, no pillow or blankets are distributed (only by a request) - A choice of meals is strange and not coupled with an entre or a desert: cheese plate is an option #1, the portion is not big, only cheese, nothing else is included; tomato soup is an option number 2 - a soup alone, nothing else; option number 3 is a chicken with rice, looks like a good portion but again - no entre or a dessert. When I asked for any desert going with a tea - a tiny cookie was offered - No table cloth - Seats are large and offer a bit of recline and leg stand. - I was flying with a 2-month-old child and my first request for some water was ignored as staff were busy chatting with a flight attendant from Economy class A day before I was flying Qantas in Economy and experience was much better - very motivated crew passionately servicing passengers, extremely tasty warm egg and ham sandwiches, very prompt service. I compare Qantas short domestic flight with the same 1 hour and 15 minutes Aeroflot flight on a Moscow-Saint Peterburg flight - Aeroflot business class is outclassing Qantas on everything - French premium champagne, a wide range of spirits and fine wines, noise-canceling headsets, proper beautifully decorated table service, extensive menus, each meal contains a salad or entre, a proper dessert. I am disappointed with Qantas and very surprised by a fact some Russian and Europeans airlines (not even mentioning WEmirates or Qatar service on 1-hour flights) are completely outclassing Qantas. Probably a lack of a real competition here in Australia plays a bad joke with Qantas.

### "Toilet was filthy"
Auckland to Brisbane. Paid for the works only to find on both flights Auckland to Brisbane and Brisbane to Auckland that the screens were not that interactive - you repeatedly had to press the screen to get it to work - gave up in the end, headphones either didn't work or only had sound in one ear. On the trip back one choice of food - salmon salad - as none of us eat fish - too bad so we were provided a piece of pizza bread and small pack of crackers for a meal. Food, alcohol and tea/coffee all served at the same time. My son asked for a coke got a coffee? Toilet was filthy. On reporting this to a steward told they'd deal with it later after having their dinner - meanwhile everyone was walking it through the aircraft. Couldn't understand/hear the head steward on speaker. Pilot not great either - terrible landing in Auckland. Better service on China Air and Korean Air.

### "refused entry into the lounge"
Adelaide to Melbourne. I fly with Qantas exclusively and currently a gold member. I travel to Melbourne very regularly and the last few weeks i have been refused entry into the Qantas lounge in Melbourne when i have asked if i could please simply get a glass of water and use the toilet facility, usually on 5 minutes max. I find this very very disturbing that only a few months ago this was no problems at all at the Melbourne Qantas domestic lounge. I would like to know the real reason for this and would like to know in this day and age how can anyone refuse anyone the right to simply ask for a glass of water etc. As a loyal supporter of Qantas for over 17 years and continually being a gold member with them im wondering what their issues are with what is wrong with them and their staff. I would like to hear what others might say or if others have had the same experience or feedback because i feel what is happening is down right bad.

### "incompetent airline that is Qantas"
Hobart to Queenstown via Sydney. I’ve just had the worst flight experience with Qantas. Firstly we were delayed by half an hour on the Hobart to Sydney leg of the journey and the staff didn’t seem to care that a large proportion of passengers were catching connecting flights in Sydney. On arrival into Sydney I had 10 minutes to run from the domestic terminal to the international terminal, go through passport control and then go through security screening for a second time - why?! I literally made the Queenstown flight by the skin of my teeth but unfortunately my bag did not. On arrival into Queenstown it became apparent that’s my suitcase had been left in Sydney. This seems to have been the case with a number of other passengers on the SYD to ZQN flight! The sheer number of passengers who’s bags didn’t arrive is just sheer negligence in my view. When trying to get help in getting my bags returned, all I was told was “give us an address and your bag may turn up tomorrow” - definitely not very reassuring. And no specific time was given either - will my bag arrive in the morning? In the afternoon? In the evening? Who knows?! Props to Qantas for giving me $60NZD in compensation and a set of pyjamas and some toiletries - but it’s just not good enough. There was also a really lovely air stewardess on the Hobart to Sydney flight. The food onboard the SYD to ZQN was also ghastly - a terrible day and a terrible trip due to the incompetent airline that is Qantas.

### "competent flight attendants"
Melbourne to Auckland. Delayed out of Melbourne and IFE rebooted during Taxi. Despite delay arrived in Auckland on time and no further issues with IFE once departed. Good quality meal with 3 choices on a relatively short flight, the beef brisket was very tasty as was dessert. Attendant was willing to give me a couple drinks at once, full cans too as opposed to a plastic cup as I have experienced with other airlines. Extremely genuine, friendly and competent flight attendants. I've traditionally avoided Qantas in favour of airlines like Emirates, Qatar or Singapore, but was impressed with them and I will likely use them in the future. I chose Qantas this time because of baggage allowance of 30k being included where it would cost more with others on this route, good departure time from Melbourne and competitive pricing. baggage above 23k on others would have potentially incurred hundreds of dollars in fees.

### "did nothing to help us"
Cairns to Auckland via Sydney. It was clear there would be a problem making the connecting flight when the Cairns flight was delayed. Having arrived at check in 2.5 hours before check in time we tried to get a resolution from the check in person. We were fobbed off saying we could catch a train between the terminals in Sydney and that the plane would make up the time. We arrived 5 minutes before the boarding time and made our way to the other terminal on the bus provided, walked as fast as we could to Gate 53 only to find the doors closed. We then found that we had been offloaded because our luggage had not arrived. I think this is pretty poor of Qantas as they did nothing to help us out of the problem they created in the first place.

### "Unfair treatment to me"
Brisbane to Hong Kong in April 2019. Unfair treatment to me, preferential treatment the impolite customer seating in front of me.The one in front of me fully recline leaving me no space to even open the tray table. I talked to the customer in front but she refuse to re-adjust with a very impolite attitude. she had more than enough space. The cabin crew kept on saying she has rights. I am extremely clear I did not made threatening means, but the cabin crew threaten me for calling police. I eventually got my coffee spill, and had no space to work. May be she was following the rule, but definitely not humanistic.

### "Overall a good flight"
Osaka To Sydney. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes but was kept to the rescheduled time, great to have clear communication no matter how small. Check In was a breeze, followed by a fast and efficient security and passport control process. Our gate was reached by taking an internal train with boarding followed soon after. This was a red eye flight back home and being in economy is not the greatest when it comes to a comfortable sleep, extremely hard to have a decent sleep in my opinion. I normally would fly Business during an overnight flight. The food was decent, good options but portions need to be bigger. The Cabin Crew were friendly and professional, acknowledging me during the flight. Overall, a good flight but it was just difficult getting a decent rest.

### "expect better service and food"
Christchurch to Tokyo via Brisbane. Friendly staff. Really disappointing catering. Firstly the air hostess decided not to give me and a few other passengers around me the pudding. I didn't have a chance to ask for it as.they flew down the aisle so quickly. For the snacks, my aisle didn't get offered any fresh fruit. Again unsure why half of the economy cabin got this while the other half got ignored For the last 'meal's of the flight I wasn't offered any drinks, and neither was a passenger in front of me. I assume.it was an oversight on the flight attendant's part but again I couldn't catch her attention as she had already gone way down the aisle. I had to go to McDonalds upon disembarking as the food was so unsatisfying. These flights aren't cheap and I would expect better service and food satisfaction than this

### "Very unpleasant experience"
Adelaide to Perth. The flight attendant offered earphones to the lady sitting next to me, but he didn’t offer them me. So I called out the attention of him but he didn’t hear me. So I ended up to touch his arm to get attention and I got told off. He said that with loud voice “say excuse me madam!”. Very unpleasant experience. He should go through the hospitality course again and learn how to serve customers. Never wanna use this airline.

### "a very good service"
Sydney To Osaka. Check In was very fast due to no one being in the line and even going through passport control and security check without the Express Path, it took less the 15 minutes. The First Class Lounge was good, but the lady attending our section was an utter disgrace with a very bad attitude, she doesn't deserve to be employed by Qantas nor should be allowed to be in Australia. The flight was on time with departure and arrival, slightly early actually. An improvement with onboard catering was a plus, and IFE was decent with some good options to keep you entertain for 9.5 hours. The Cabin Crew were average, but my spirit did lift when I was recognised for my Platinum status with Qantas and was given a set of pyjamas and amenity kit as a 'thank you' by a supervisor. Overall, a very good service and I would not hesitate flying with again in economy to Asia.

### "brilliant flight all round"
Melbourne to Sydney. Domestic business class flying at its absolute finest. An internationally configured A330 with lie flat beds for a 1 hour 20 minute flight, a very tasty roast chicken dinner with some fine red wine to accompany it. Best of all a Cabin Manager and crew who were highly engaged with passengers, delivering top class service with a smile and very good humour. After a very early start to the day and a long day of meetings, just what you need for the trip home. A brilliant flight all round.

### "pleasant flight with an outstanding crew"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Los Angeles with Qantas. Very pleasant flight with an outstanding crew - friendly, attentive and seemed to really their job. Lunch out of Brisbane was delicious and efficiently served. Seat comfort in the new business suite very good. The only complaints would be too few toilets and poor selection on the inflight entertainment.

### "the most frustrating experiences"
I almost never leave reviews unless the expected service is a complete joke over a consistent period. It feels like every single time I am either traveling from Sydney to Melbourne or Melbourne to Sydney my Qantas flight is delayed for the most ridiculous reasons. From the last 14 flights between these destinations I have maybe had one arrive on time. Yes there are some circumstances that they cannot control but there is a point where it is no longer coincidence. Qantas international is great for me but Sydney to Melbourne and Melbourne to Sydney flights are some of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had. No matter if I book an early or late flight the result is the same. I guess I should consider myself lucky that my flights aren't being cancelled? Today's flight was delayed for an hour because of paperwork. My flight yesterday there were too many carry on bags (why allow people to take 2-3 on? ), Followed by a spill on the tarmac, followed by planes needing to take off before us, followed by not being able to finish taxi off because a plane wing is sticking out too much and to top it off the draw bridge isn't working. Unbelievable. I really feel for the pilots and flight crew if they have to work in these ridiculous conditions constantly. I know that the airline industry is low margin so they have to make constant cuts but this has completely ruined my image of Qantas. I cringe when I see the "Australia's preferred airline" ads that are forced down our throats. Joke of an airline.

### "don't care about customers"
I would never buy a business seat with Qantas. The Audio wasn’t working for me and my wife, they couldn’t work it all the flight. The food tray was broken, couldn’t put the food. when I called and complained they tried to make it as normal, nothing important, and tried to bribe me with 2000 frequent flyer points -  what an insult. When told them not good enough never got back they don't care about customers or service.

### "I would recommend"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Impressed with customer service. Very warm and welcoming specially the staff Pooja. I would recommend Qantas to my friends and family.

### "got me on another flight"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. After missing my flight due to a delay from another airline Qantas have now got me on another flight. This was a massive help to me as I was worried that my insurance wouldn't cover it 100% but they saw the correct documents and followed through..

### "Service was friendly"
Adelaide to Melbourne. I enjoyed my early morning flight on Easter Sunday. It left and arrived on time. There was nice breakfast that wasn't that big but was fine for such a short flight. Service was friendly and efficient. IFE was OK, It's a shame that music is no longer offered though.

### "who designed the toilets"
Brisbane to Melbourne with Qantas. Staff service levels drop significantly on full flights. This one is no exception. In addition to no overhead locker space and no screen for entertainment. It seems its a bring your own device flight. Just wondering who designed the toilets they work well if you are the size of a pre-schooler.

### "Very bad service"
Sydney to Bangkok. Very bad service. Feels like a low cost airline. Staff need to be better trained about their service mind and the polite way to talk with passengers. Mid flight, they just ignore passeners that need help. They just chitchat and had fun at the end of the cabin. The food was not good at all. I really question myself as to whether I was travelling on a low cost airline. No more with Qantas!

### "I was very disappointed"
Wellington to Sydney. Qantas failed to impress. The cabin seemed quite nice however this did not continue throughout the seat, with tiny legroom and an incredibly uncomfortable seat, the cabin was a large letdown. 3 and a half hours on this aircraft was very tedious. The crew were rude and I recall the flight attendant having a go at the passenger on my right after she had forgotten his meal request 3 times and he didn’t say please the third time - the first two times he said it. The crew didn’t seem to put much effort into the customer satisfaction and were no help when it came to arrival card information. The food was nice however the inflight entertainment system was extremely laggy to the point it was impossible to use, the 737 options for entertainment are very week and I’ve seen a much larger selection on multiple other airlines operating similar sized aircraft (such as the A320) . All in all I was very disappointed with the service qantas provided. The wifi didn’t work despite crew attempts to have the passengers connect.

### "delay let the experience down"
Sydney To Auckland Via Melbourne. The journey started off positively with great attitude from ground staff during check In and super fast security thereafter. The first leg from Sydney to Melbourne was 20 mins early which helped with my slightly tight connection but since Melbourne is one massive building with 4 terminals, it was very easy to navigate onwards to your international connection. The Melbourne to Auckland segment was delayed by 1 hour and 10 minutes due to one passenger not showing up on the plane and the aircraft it self being delayed with its own arrival into Sydney. The ground and cabin crew did their best to notify the passengers but the delay was not made up during the flight. The crew onboard were super friendly, a very attentive service then my previous flights over the Tasman Sea. Surprisingly too, was the catering as there were good options and tasted delicious. IFE was not up to scratch, fair enough the B737 is mainly use for Domestic journeys but in my opinion Qantas needs to add more content if they intend to switch this plane model between domestic and international routes. Overall, a great experience but the delay did let the experience down.

### "no leg room at all"
If Qantas want people to choose them consistently they have to allow a little more room. Uncomfortable seat and no leg room at all unless you are quite small. Food ok. Service fair but will not be the first choice generally travelling internationally. Limited choice of entertainment.

### "They did not seat us together"
Hobart to Melbourne via Brisbane with Qantas. Bought 2 tickets online, asked if we wanted to select seats and we said no as we didn't care where we sat as long as we were together. They did not seat us together! Didn't realise till we got to the airport and the staff weren't bothered and advised we needed to pick seats together when we booked. Not impressed that when buying tickets together you aren't automatically seated together! You need to make this known when booking.

### "a smooth and non-stressful series of flights"
Before checking in and arriving at the airport, I was advised by Qantas that the flight had been delayed by about an hour and I had received a new departure time for the first service (TSV-BNE). This meant I did not have to arrive to airport as early as first planned. Upon check in I was also advised that I had been pushed back to a new connection to Melbourne. I questioned ground staff if there were a chance of being put on an earlier connection, as the one I was put on was two hours later. The Townsville ground crew were awesome and checked to see if my preferred flight had any spaces. Although this flight was full, they said they would advise me if there were any no shows once we arrived in Brisbane. The first flight, despite being late, was up to standard. The second flight departed on time and the plane was equipped with free wifi, this is an excellent feature and speeds were adequate enough to stream in HD. A small dinner was served on this flight and was nice. Arrived in Melbourne on time and bags were received relatively quickly. Overall, a smooth and non-stressful series of flights, despite the potential for being these things.

### "crew was great"
Brisbane to Townsville. Check in was quick and easy and with live updates on flight status sent through on regular basis, this airline really adds a peace of mind factor. On top of this, the fare could be managed easily via the Qantas app or website. Boarding time was slightly behind schedule (about 10 minutes), but was still done quickly. We were advised by ground crew that it would be a full flight and advised passengers board by row number; the aircraft was therefore less 'congested' for boarding, filling from the back forward. Despite the slightly late boarding, it being a full flight and busy time at Brisbane airport, we departed only 15 minutes behind schedule. The crew was great, friendly, experienced and worked well as a team to serve the aircrafts needs. The flight deck advised us that we would arrive at Townsville on time and we did. Snacks were served; biscuits and cheese, which was adequate for that time of the day. On the entertainment front, this was one of the 737's which had not yet had wifi access installed, which was a shame because it is really good on other flights. But the rather good Qantas entertainment app could be used to stream their content - much better than the comparable Virgin product. Overall, a pleasant flight to Townsville.

### "my wifi wasn't working"
Not Verified | Melbourne to Sydney. Boarding and closing doors for departure was very quick, which I was very happy about. I had window seat 23A, as the window seat is my preference. There were less people towards the back of the plane which was another plus. The seats were nice quilt stitched ones, reasonable for a short flight of just 1 hour. Because I was on an very early morning flight, breakfast was served. I enjoyed my meal though basic was satisfactory consisting of Evia Greek Yogurt and Blueberry Crunch with packaged apples and fruit and coconut ball. My only gripe was that my wifi wasn't working onboard the wifi equipped aircraft.

### "flight was quick and very smooth"
Sydney to Melbourne operated by the A330 on that date. After a delay due to the aircraft being late from maintenance and the traffic congestion of Sydney, boarding began at 08.05. Having just joined the Qantas Frequent Flyer programme, I earned another 1600 points for the return. This particular A330, in the new Silver Roo livery, and has the updated interior. I was seated in 39K, a window seat as it was only a 1 hour flight. Apart from the fact I had only one seat next to me, I like the fact there was no seats behind me, with curtains dividing the my section and rows of seats behind. Economy is in 2-3-2 configuration. The red seats look sleek and contemporary. The TV screens were of decent size, with a good selection of movies. Breakfast was served, with a delicious toasted bacon and egg sandwich. Beverages were served including coffee, tea and orange juice. Overall, the flight was quick and very smooth.

### "friendly and efficient"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. Qantas has improved since I last flew with them. On my flight we were served lunch, a delicious beef and onion pie, and juice/soft drinks. I bought a glass of white wine. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient.

### "crew friendly but robotic"
Hong Kong To Sydney Via Brisbane. 2 days before my flight, I received a notice from Qantas my Request for an upgrade to Business Class for the first segment was successful. The Hong Kong to Brisbane flight started off with some much needed Lounge visits, followed by an on time departure. I had mixed opinions about Cabin Crew, friendly but very robotic. The food onboard didn't help either, I only had a main dish and it was just not great thought desert was decent. The suite was super comfy and I actually had a decent sleep. The IFE was good, not great comparing compared to past experience. After passing through Brisbane airport procedures and changing terminals, I was on my second flight home to Sydney. The domestic flight was very routine, nothing outstanding.

### "friendly and efficient"
Melbourne to Singapore. Air staff were friendly and efficient, and chatty when approached at the galley. Staff were generous with the drinks service and snacks when requested.

### "food and service was great"
Singapore to Melbourne. Baggage drop staff were extremely happy to help with a seat change, explaining a variety of options both upstairs and below. Boarding was extremely well organised and easy. When I realised I was starting to have my first ever panic attack, I approached staff in the galley during boarding and let them know what was going on for me, and requested a solo seat if possible after take off. They were extremely kind and helpful, rearranged seating before take off, providing water, a hug, and offers of company as well as privacy. Three seperate staff checked unobtrusively in order to confirm I was able to fly, and as soon as staff were able to move about after takeoff, I was checked on again and provided a chocolate bar and more water. Staff were very kind throughout the flight, balancing both my need for privacy and providing care. The food and service was great, as was the IFE.

### "attentive and friendly"
Melbourne to Sydney. I enjoyed the cabin crew hospitality. They were very attentive and friendly. While the red wine served (a 2016 cabernet sauvignon) was really good, the food offering was pretty average.

### "Qantas was quite variable"
Melbourne to Los Angeles via San Francisco. My recent trip to Canada via the United States with Qantas was quite variable in the quality of experience between two of their premium products. We flew Premium Economy on the A380 from Melbourne to Los Angeles and then were happily upgraded from premium to business on the new 787 from San Francisco to Melbourne on our return. The service in Premium was exceptional - the best I have experienced. The food was delicious - for me a stylish and well presented lamb shank and my wife a terrific fish dish. And the service was cheerful and frequent - including regular water service and snacks. Breakfast was similarly good. Top marks all round. The business leg that we were so anticipating on the return was a little disappointing. The food prepared by the caterers in the states was surprisingly tasteless, overcooked in every case and disappointing - both meal services. The salad with supper was simply indescribable. The crew were much less conspicuous on this flight (of course the idea is to not be too conspicuous) but you didn't feel encouraged to ask for anything. No water runs and little sight of the crew. And they were very short of PJs in business and were all one size. This time around the choice of movies was surprisingly thin. The new seats in business were OK but not exceptional.

### "boarding was on time"
Brisbane to Sydney by QF525. This flight was a code share flight. I bought the ticket by China Southern, so the flight number was CZ7552. But there was no information screen in the airport showing this flight number. The boarding was on time. The flight time was only 2 hours, but the staff gave some cakes to every passenger.

### "The seat is narrow"
Singapore to Melbourne. Similar to the review by Loke Foo of 13 March 2019, I also have issues with the A330-200 business class overnight flight, this time Singapore to Melbourne. The seat is narrow and when reclined to the bed position I felt hemmed in. As a tall person with large feet, the narrow confines of the footrest area prevented me sleeping on my side. The provision of only one toilet for 28 premium passengers on an overnight international flight is unacceptable for an airline that claims to be a premier, full service airline. Whoever made this decision needs to be given a reality check about the expectations of premium paying passengers. Finally, the egg and bacon roll presented at breakfast looked like a lacquered show-case you see in Asian restaurant windows. The egg was dry and tasteless. But full marks to the crew who gave excellent service. They must find it extremely frustrating and annoying trying to provide good service with a near constant queue of passengers waiting in and around the galley for the one toilet, but they always kept their cool and highly pleasant demeanor.

### "Can’t recommend enough"
Dallas to Brisbane via Sydney. Awesome experience, had the most lovely check in with Peter, his friendliness and attention to detail was nothing short of wonderful. Attentive service both ways, great food offerings and a homely feel. Can’t recommend enough!

### "worst flights I've taken"
Los Angeles to Brisbane. I took two Qantas flights recently to visit Australia. The first from Los Angeles to Brisbane, and the second was the return portion from Sydney to Vancouver, Canada. They were the two single worst flights I've taken in 20 years of flying. On both flights my gluten free meal didn't make it. 28 hours flying time without food. Even though I ordered it 4 weeks before departure, I was told they didn't receive it in time (?!). A few minutes later, the same cabin attendant then gave me a bread roll and a regular meal as if we hadn't just has a conversation about gluten allergies. After picking at something I thought I might be able to eat I became painfully ill. A pain that lasted 3 days after the flight. As I was getting off the flight, a cabin crew member told me it was my own fault for eating their food. Nice touch Qantas. The return flight was worse. It was delayed by 25 hours due to an engineering issue. This resulted in a missed connection which gate staff assured me would be reimbursed so long as rebooking occurred through the One World network. After paying significantly more money to stay within the network, and presenting the receipts as instructed, Qantas customer service told me they wouldn't be reimbursing the cost. Furthermore, they lied about providing passengers with a letter at the gate explaining this. No such letter was ever given to passengers. So I arrived 25 hours late, +$500 out of pocket, and most gallingly, after following every instruction given to me by Qantas staff, being told by customer service that it was my own fault. How does this airline even exist in 2019? From gate staff, to cabin crew to customer service, every single person was rude, condescending and confrontational, not a single one of whom accepted responsibility for anything. Every single inconvenience, delay and cost, no matter how small, was my problem, my fault and my cost to bear. Never, and I can't stress this enough, never fly with Qantas. No airline is more deserving of bankruptcy.

### "worst national carrier"
Sydney to Auckland. Just the worst airline. Every time I fly with them they are delayed and they seem to have every reason that its not their fault. Truly the worst national carrier. If you can avoid them.

### "extremely disappointed"
As I boarded a QF 642 flight from Perth to Sydney on Sunday 7th April, the man at the gate was so rude to me. He scanned my boarding pass and then told me to 'follow the correct line next time' (while pointing to the economy line). If he had bothered to check my ticket he would have realised that I was travelling in Business Class. I felt extremely judged and I don't feel that this was acceptable practice for an airline like Qantas. I have been a Qantas Frequent Flyer since 1992 and this experience has left me extremely disappointed to say the least.

### "worst airline ever"
Singapore to Sydney. Qantas is worst airline ever. They cancelled my international flight and then processed the refund (after asking 10 times) by deducting 300$ from the ticket amount. Their customer service is so rude they put u on hold and go away for 40 mins only to disconnect your call.

### "could not enter their lounge"
I flew on frequent flyer miles awards from Alaska Airlines. San Francisco, Sydney to Christchurch. Qantas took rewards mileage for business class, however the only business class they made available for ticketing purposes was Sydney to Christchurch. On every segment of this except Wellington to Sydney, a business class seat was available, rather than let me sit there they chose to leave it vacant. I was offered the choice to upgrade for $1,500 each way on the international to and from USA. I declined paying for the business class seat twice over, explaining to the Qantas ticketing agent I had paid for it with mileage rewards. Secondly having Qantas take the business class mileage and because I was issued only the economy class ticket, I could not enter their lounge in between flights. Upon arriving in Christchurch my baggage never made it through, there wasn't anyone to do a claims after 24 hours, I was told that I needed to do it when I left Wellington, there I was told do it in Sydney and Sydney’s baggage office told me that it was all outsourced to the Philippines and I needed to do it via the internet. It’s tough and not made easy if they screw-up. All situations seem not only wrong, but dishonest.

### "inconsistencies in comfort and service"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Sydney. Flew Sydney-Santiago QF27 on 24/2/19. Didn't like the auto check-in and baggage drop in Sydney. Neither worked properly and we had to ask for help. Staff that helped were friendly. Plane was an old 747, cramped and shabby. Service was patchy, one half of the plane were served food well before the other and we twice failed to receive our first choice of meal as they'd run out. The entertainment system was down initially and it took some time for them to fix it. Flew Los Angeles-Sydney QF12 on 30/3/19. Preferred personal check in at LA to auto check in at Sydney. Better plane this time, a newer A380, but service still patchy with one side of the plane being served well before the other, I was starting my meal as my husband finished his. The food on both flights was quite good for an airline and service on board was friendly but not efficient. The flights were part of a package as otherwise we've learned not to fly with Qantas due to inconsistencies in plane comfort and service. Can't beat Singapore Airlines.

### "staff courteous and very helpful"
Brisbane to Melbourne. I had a very good flight. Check in was easy. The plane departed on time. A very tasty meal was served and the wine was excellent. The staff were both courteous and very helpful. If it wasn't for the recent decision to axe music on domestic IFE, I would have given a review of at least 8/10 .

### "passport queue was horrendous"
Singapore to Perth. Arriving at passport control at Qantas terminal in Perth at nearly midnight only 3 x passport officers on duty and no auto channels! The queue was horrendous - and took many times longer to be processed than any airport I have been to in the last decade.

### "Dinner was very tasty"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Check in was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Dinner was very tasty and it was thoughtful to be offered an extra beer! Again it is a pity QANTAS no longer offers music on their' domestic flights. Apart from that I can recommend QANTAS as the first choice for flying within Australia.

### "I enjoyed my flight"
Adelaide to Melbourne. I enjoyed my flight. Check in was easy and the plane departed on time. The staff were very friendly and the dinner they served was very tasty. My only complaint is that it's a shame there is no longer music available on QANTAS IFE domestically. It is too short a flight to watch a movie or even a TV show. Music makes for a much more relaxing flight .

### "no more than a low-budget airline"
Hong Kong to Brisbane. This is my third flight with Qantas in the past 12 months and each departure has been delayed: the first time for 5½ hours departing Brisbane, second time for 1 hour departing Los Angeles and now this current flight Hong Kong to Brisbane delayed for 55 mins. Qantas is no longer the ‘pride of Australia’. It is now Jetstar with the flying kangaroo on its tail. Over the past few years, Qantas has become a very poor relative to this once great airline. It is now no more than a low-budget airline that charges full-service fares. What a joke!!! I know Alan Joyce has brought the airline from the brink of bankruptcy to being ‘in the black’ financially but at what cost to passenger loyalty? In fact, after this flight, I will never ever fly Qantas again. There are far, far better quality international airlines than Qantas to choose from that take pride in providing service excellence to their passengers. As for meals and amenities! It was about 9.30pm (approx 1½hrs after take-off) before the meals and drinks cart came around. Why do passengers now have to wait until meal time before the drinks trolley comes around? I’m not a big drinker but a nice refreshment once up in the air would have been very welcome. The menu had a choice of 3 main meals, a vegetable with rice, a chicken casserole with mashed potato, beans and carrot (my choice) and a fish with rice. My meal was tasty but very, very small. This came with a small mousse as dessert, a small bread roll and a choice of an alcoholic beverage. No further alcohol was served. Gone are the days where a good sized food tray came with entrée, main, dessert, fruit and cheese and biscuits. No snacks, not even a small bag of nuts, were served at all during the flight though the menu did state that fruit would be served mid-flight; I saw no evidence of that. We were woken for breakfast approx. 3am Hong Kong time (5am Brisbane time). Breakfast consisted of a small tray of fruit: 2 triangles of watermelon, 2 small wedges of apple, a round of dragon fruit, and a piece of pineapple; a small sweet muffin, accompanied by tea, coffee or fruit juice. That was it!! The amount of food & beverages provided over the almost 10 hours we were aboard this flight was very inadequate and would not have satisfied my 4 year old grandson. I’m a small person (female) weighing 57 kilos so I am not a big eater, I was starving by the time I arrived in Brisbane. Amenity packs are no longer so I walked to the back of the plane and asked a flight attendant if he could provide me with ear plugs. Reluctantly he found a pack. I asked if he had an eye- mask and he said ‘No’. He must have had a pang of conscience as he then looked in another drawer and found more earplugs and a mask. I was very thankful as like most passengers in economy, I don’t sleep well on a flight and earplugs and eye-mask certainly help. As for in-flight service, there isn’t any. From this final experience of flying Qantas, I get the impression that the service and cut-backs in food and amenities is all about cost-cutting ie: keeping costs down and the shareholders happy. There is no consideration for economy passengers in fact, I have the impression that Qantas finds economy passengers an inconvenience and thus are treated as not worth looking after. It is a very sad outcome for all – Qantas as a brand has gone the way of the dodo. Customer service does not exist in Economy.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Wellington to Cairns via Sydney. Terrible customer service! My flight was cancelled so we had to stay an extra night in Sydney, now after 3 months and daily emails to them I still have not had my refund of extra costs paid even though I have provided all my details to them. The phone number goes to staff that don’t care or the phone gets disconnected over and over. Won’t fly with Qantas again.

### "Poor customer service"
Melbourne to Denpasar. I received a call from Qantas at 5pm Friday night, (travelling Saturday afternoon) stating they had to down size the aircraft, so they offered me another flight at 9am the next morning on Garuda which was impossible for us to take due to taking our animals to boarding. Qantas then offered me a flight to Perth (Qantas domestic) then Jetstar flight to Denpasar. I booked with Qantas because of lots of delays and poor customer service from Jetstar. This not only added an extra 6 hours to our flight but we had to purchase our meals, drinks and no entertainment. I wrote 2 emails of my disgust with their treatment of us and I received 2 responses. 1 stating it was due to mechanical reasons and the other stating they had over booked the flight. When I asked for a letter to claim the extra costs, they told me that I didn’t have any extra costs and would not provide me a letter. Obviously they just lie and tell you anything but the truth. After not giving up, they finally offer me a 3000 points. I believe because used a combination of points and cash I used to book my tickets some 8 months prior, I believe I was considered the lowest ticket cost, that’s why they offloaded us. I have been a long term customer and a Qantas Club member for over 25 years. Poor customer service.

### "premium economy seat very comfortable"
Sydney to Hong Kong Via Melbourne. A very early departure out of Sydney so everything was routine. In my case, I had an international connection so I wished ground team started a bit earlier. Once in Melbourne, navigation was simple and easy as it is one main building connecting 4 terminals. The flight was delayed over an hour and to make it worst it was a remote gate, which meant a very slow bus ride to board the aircraft. The premium economy seat on the 787 was very comfortable, slick and very adequate for a medium haul flight. The Crew that were serving my cabin were outstanding especially one particular crew member, she was just great at her job. IFE was decent, though I didn't find much options I liked this time. To end, we actually arrived on time into Hong Kong.

### "not care about their customer"
Mumbai to Sydney via Bangkok. I made my entire booking via Qantas trusting them as one of the top ones. Qantas selected the following - Mumbai to Bangkok (jet airways), Bangkok to Sydney (Qantas). My original flight from Mumbai to Bangkok was cancelled and after a lot of discussion they provided me the same flight the next day. they refused to provide me overnight stay for another alternate flight whose layover was long enough. I had my hotel reservation done in Sydney which I had to pay even without using it. I was told to fly first and then ask for the compensation for the same. Later Qantas said we take no responsibility even though you selected Qantas as your main service, we will neither compensate you nor help to get any compensation from Jet Airways. I spoke to Jet Airways and they blamed Qantas and said they will provide you with the compensation as you did not book the flight directly with us. I called Qantas again and after being on hold for 2 hours they tried to pretend as if they were calling Jet Airways to help and cut the call. It was the worst customer service experience ever. Nether Jet nor Qantas took the responsibility. As per me Qantas should have taken care of the entire matter and sorted it out internally with Jet Airways as per their policy and provided some compensation or at least helped to make a conference call with Jet Airways and sort the matter but they were not only rude but did not care about their customer.

### "the worst customer service"
Auckland to San Francisco via Sydney. I would not recommend anyone to fly with Qantas and I will never be flying with them again. My sister and I flew from Toronto to Auckland via Dallas and was supposed to be Sydney but ended up being Brisbane and then finally to Auckland. The return trip was Auckland to Sydney to San Francisco to Toronto. Not one leg of the trip left on time and when we left Dallas to supposedly fly to Sydney we were informed almost immediately after takeoff that we would likely have to stop in Brisbane to refuel as there were strong headwinds over Australia at this time of year and we would likely not make it to Sydney. This extra stop was going to take an extra 2-2.5 hours which meant that we would not make our connection to Auckland. Finally we were told that we were going to Brisbane and that everyone on the plane would have to get off and take a different flight the rest of the way. In what seemed like the most disorganized way possible we were finally put on a flight to Auckland but in the process they misplaced our luggage and when we got to Auckland our luggage was not there and that ended up taking until after noon the next day before they finally cleared it and brought it to us. Then on the way back we got to Sydney ok, but once there the flight we were taking to San Francisco had a technical issue and boarded about 2 hours late. Then we were told when we got on the plane that this was a really old plane and this was its last flight ever! After we got to San Francisco it was going to be taken to the desert and retired; isn't that comforting to hear when you're late getting on a plane because of a technical issue! This plane was so old that the screens didn't even have a flight path so that we could see what time we were due to arrive in San Francisco and because of the different time zones we were going through we had no way to know if we were actually going to make our next flight. The staff at one point came around and told certain people that they were not going to make their connecting flight and they had been booked on a different flight but they didn't have anything for us; they said if they didn't have any information for us that meant that we should be able to make our connection. So then we finally get to San Francisco only to find out that unlike what we were told in Auckland we now had to completely go through security again and re-check our bags which took forever and when we finally got through the customs line and got to our gate we had missed our flight and there was not another flight to Toronto for 7 hours! So we sat and waited for 7 hours and then finally got to go to Toronto, where we had missed the hotel room we had booked because we didn't get there until morning. The manager at the Qantas boarding gate told us that we could put in a claim for this lost hotel booking, but when we did so we were informed that Qantas would not pay for this because they claimed that the technical issue on the plane was not their responsibility. Whose responsibility is it then, is what I'd like to know?!? Also, they ruined one of our checked bags, one corner ripped right open, and this happened on the way there but when we tried to get them to take responsibility for this they said this is also not their responsibility. This airline has the worst customer service I have ever experienced in an airline and I will never fly with them again.

### "fail to deliver"
Brisbane to Sydney. I haven’t taken a Qantas domestic flight for a few years, so I decided to pay the “premium” cost of a Qantas ticket compared to some low cost carriers. For what is essentially double the cost of other carriers, I got a flight with no IFE screens, a lunch of a pre Packaged quiche that was unedible after one bite and a final surprise when we landed of a suitcase with a wheel missing. The suitcase is a decent quality brand that is less then a year old and in that year is has been on some budget carriers (such as Air Asia) and survived without a scratch. I can only imagine how the well the Qantas baggage handlers must have handled it to case a wheel (including it bracket) to go missing Next time I need to fly domestic, I will be flying a budget carrier, where I’m happy to pay an additional cost for food which is actually edible, and with the money I save I can buy a new suitcase. Qantas you want to be and charge for a premium service, but fail to deliver on all fronts.

### "still room for improvement"
I have three issues with the Airbus 330-200 business class fight of Qantas from Singapore to Sydney. Seat - the new business class seat is very narrow and small, especially the footrest area after the bed has been extended to lay flat mode. I was not able to sleep on my side because my feet were not able to fit the footrest area. All the panels in the new seat are supposed to provide privacy for the passenger but they do also have the unintended effect of making the seats feel much smaller. Lack of toilet - There is only one toilet for the whole business class. There are 28 seats in business class and the business class passengers to toilet ratio must be the worst among all the premier full-service airlines. In the morning after breakfast was served and before the touch down at Sydney, the queue for the toilet was so bad that I did not even get a chance to go before we arrived in Sydney. Those 330-200 with the older version of business class seats have 2 toilets in Business class. I am wondering if Qantas chose to reduce the toilet number in order to fit in more seats. Coffee - The coffee that Qantas serves for breakfast is the worst that I have tasted for a long time. It was too diluted. After milk was added, the colour of the coffee was whitish brown. The coffee was definitely instant coffee. Qantas should invest in a better-brewed coffee machine for business class passengers. Hope that Qantas can look into the above three issues. Services have also improved a lot in the last few years and there is still room for improvement.

### "disgusting response"
Brisbane to Tokyo via Sydney. Here is an outline of events. Our flight from Brisbane on the 20th of December 2019 was delayed due to bad weather in Sydney. We were then kept in a holding pattern above Sydney for an hour or so, only to arrive in Sydney with a short time to get to our connecting gate. We were madly rushing to get to the new gate, only to find out that the gate had changed (which we weren’t notified of) and had also been delayed while they waiting for passengers being diverted from another flight. Now waiting for another couple of hours in the Sydney airport, we are finally told that the plane has engineering problems. After another half an hour of waiting we are told that the flight is cancelled because either the problem was not fixed or they couldn’t take off, as it was too late. My family and I then waited to find out what was happening next. After they had seen to all the local Sydney residents, we were next told that we were being put up in a hotel. When we arrived at the apartment, we were told that they couldn’t check us in because the Qantas credit card had been declined. At this time it was after 1am in the morning and we had been travelling for 8-9 hours. As a 6 person family, I was surprised they put us in an apartment that slept 4 people. Two of my children had to sleep on the floor. The hotel was not able to supply any roll out beds. We were also told that we had a $50 to spend per person, however when we arrived at the unit, there was clearly no where to get any food. So I had to go for a walk to find a Nightowl convenience store to find some food for the children. Likewise in the morning there was nowhere to find breakfast so I had to go out and find somewhere, being unable to use the credit vouchers I was told we had. During this time we had received no communication updates from Qantas with regards to our flight that had been rescheduled. When we arrived at the airport, I approached a Qantas person to check in our luggage. They directed me to another location, which we all followed. Upon arriving there, (I believe it was the standby counter) we were told that this was not the place and directed to another place. When we arrived there, we got in a queue to check in our luggage. About 15 min into the queue, a Qantas supervisor started coming over to us, yelling and shouting at us in an extremely unprofessional and disgusting way, telling us we were in the wrong place and that this counter was shutting. To which we informed her, that we had been directed by another Qantas staff member to come here. Eventually she allowed us to stay. However 10 min later, another family was coming over, which infuriated the Qantas supervisor even more, and again another shouting session occurred. She continued to complain loudly enough for everyone to hear, how bad it was that people were coming over. The other group was actually being accompanied by another Qantas staff member. So vicious was the shouting and exchange it brought the other Qantas staff member to tears, which made all of us and our family extremely uncomfortable. After a good deal more waiting we finally were at the stage of checking in our luggage. Only to be informed that they could check us in, but we needed to take our luggage somewhere else – to the oversized baggage section as the conveyor belt operators had left and it was no longer being used. The whole experience has left a terrible taste in our mouths, and a disgusting response from Qantas in regards to reparations

### "not eligible for a refund"
Brisbane to Melbourne. I always like to be positive. My rule is “If you can’t say anything nice don’t say anything at all”. However today I feel I need to make an exception to the rule in light of my recent experience with Qantas. On Thursday 21st Feb I flew to Brisbane with my husband for a conference. On Sunday evening 25th Feb as we were on our way to the airport for our return flight I had a serious fall down 15 steps. I was rushed by ambulance to the Mater hospital where I spent the night being treated for broken bones, lacerations, sprains and multiple bruising. On discharge the Hospital gave me a letter for Qantas confirming that I was unable to make my flight due to a Medical Emergency. After several days of to and fro messages with the Qantas Bot asking for a refund for my missed flight (to cover the cost of eventually taking another flight home to Melbourne), I am horrified to be told that I am not eligible for a refund as I was a No Show. Qantas was advised well before the departure time that I had had an accident and was in hospital. The irony is that had I attempted to take the flight Qantas would not have allowed me on the flight in the condition I was in. I’ve always respected Qantas as a reputable Australian airline with the good old Aussie Spirit of caring for its customers. No more! I now believe that Qantas is just another heartless profiteering company who cares nothing for its passengers, has no morality or business ethics and belies the appearance of a humanitarian spirit.

### "friendly, polite and efficient"
Not Verified |  London to Perth. Flight late leaving London but time made up during the journey. Check in at Heathrow easy and efficient. Cabin crew friendly, polite and efficient. Inflight entertainment good. The seats were comfortable for such a long flight. Food was above average for an airline. A small snack bar was provided on a help yourself basis and was free. On arrival at Perth there was not enough staff at immigration or customs, resulting in long queues.

### "Certainly don’t rely on them"
Melbourne to Perth. Qantas takes a hard line on not letting even a very frequent flyer take an earlier flight, but are soft on timing and both there and back were an hour delayed. Food was revolting. They even gave my preassigned seat to someone so chucked me at the back where it was deafening. If you have a choice, bypass this mob. Certainly don’t rely on them if you have business meetings! The lounge has gone from good to awful. Cost cuts have reduced ‘meals’ to racks of stale bread and tubs of kraft singles, ‘sandwich meat’ and tinned tuna with a do it yourself sandwich toaster. But it’s the regimented stratification of service that really gets to you. Once, it was subtle and reflected Australian egalitarian culture. Now you are really made to feel like you are unwelcome if you fly main cabin and use the qantas club rather than the multiple super duper’ lounges for the plutocrats that Qantas target.

### "meals were so disgusting"
I had the opportunity to travel with Quantas for the first time on my journey from London to Singapore (roundtrip) and I will never travel with this airline again. The staff was nice, seats average, where they lost the most amount of points for me was in relation to food and inflight entertainment. Usually on all of the long hall flights I travel on they offer such a range of amazing movies in different languages and varieties, but on Qantas they merely offered a few movies and out dated 'horror ones' there were no tv shows nor any documentaries it was all very lackluster. My biggest area of disappointment regards food, especially since I had requested a vegetarian meal. Now I am not a picky eater, but the meals offered were so disgusting that I was only able to take a few bites. When the meal arrives it is the main dish only on a trey with a piece of bread and desert in the bag thus taking away from the whole cute inflight meal aesthetic. It was very difficult for me to figure out what it was that I was going to eat as the food items did not look anything like food, I had to read the label in order to understand what is being offered. I did try the meals and could only stomach 2 bites each. I really wonder if the chef had tried what he had made, because it is a great disservice to the customer. This chef either needs to be retrained or fired, if he/she will go into retraining they should collaborate with those from Emirates, Korean, etc. Furthermore, the vegetables were so over cooked that any nutrients that should have been available ceased to exist.

### "friendly and cordial service"
Singapore to Auckland via Brisbane. Got window seats on both the flights, which were on the same plane. Glad to have the seat next to me free, so nothing against legroom. Cabin crew had friendly and cordial service, with smiles present. Had a sizeable supper on the first flight even though I was informed there'd be breakfast, was pleasantly surprised. Beef paired with Bloody Mary was well eaten. Breakfast was muffin and fruit with coffee. Decent to good. Second flight had another breakfast, frittata with bacon and sausage and coffee, was good. Again, with an empty seat and cheerful cabin crew who helped me with my arrival cards as well. IFE was a bit lacking but decent selections. Pleasant journey with Qantas.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Brisbane to Mackay. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Delayed then delayed and delayed again on our first flight with no reason given. Then on our flight home we were delayed again. Staff are extremely rude and can’t even smile or try to help in any way. Tiger Airways is a much better airline. Qantas is a massive waste of money. Will never fly with them again.

### "choose again - probably not"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Sydney. Was looking forward to trying out Qantas International again after 15+ years of choosing other airlines due to poor quality and service on my last flight. This time it was a mixed experience. The A380 is a fantastic aircraft  and I've been on the Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Malaysian and Emirates versions previously. Unfortunately the Qantas version had seen better times. This plane was old and although the seating was new, you could tell the rest of it had taken a beating including the carpets, toilets and galley. The flight attendants on this plane (although very polite) verged on the wrong side of professional vs casual friendliness and as we were seated next to the galley, we overheard way too much much casual gossip and cattyness which I felt was not doing the airline reputation much good. Our attendant even commented that he was 'exhausted' before the flight even took off. What was good : the food was pretty decent for economy, as were the free flowing tim-tams and bundaberg ginger beer available from the fridges at the back of the plane - well done, a nice touch and keep it up. Would I choose Qantas again? Probably not. The competition (particularly Singapore Airlines) has a better, more professional product. More needs to be done to bring Qantas up to this level. I'd start with updating the plane and staff conduct.

### "excellent domestic product"
Perth to Adelaide, a fantastic experience. I was traveling with an elderly passenger and initially we were not seated together. I asked a ground staff member if they could change the seating arrangements. It was not a problem and the staff member at Perth airport rearranged the seating, and did this with a smile. The aircraft was comfortable and clean, cabin crew friendly and service without a flaw. We had a choice of three meals, plus cheese and crackers, and beverages included soft drinks and alcholoic drinks. Fifteen minutes or so after lunch was served the cabin crew came around offering tea and coffee. I recommend Qantas and they offer an excellent domestic product.

### "really good experience"
Sydney to London via Singapore. A really good experience. Qantas lounge and boarding not the best but upstairs on the A380 is a comfortable calm experience. Lovely cabin crew on first leg (I slept much of the second so didn’t notice so much), a really good Neil Perry dinner, one of the best dishes of Barramundi I’ve eaten. A treat to be made an Espresso afterwards. Though the window seat requires crossing the next seat to get to the aisle it is a very comfortable seat to relax and sleep and the massage function is a bonus. Slept much of the second flight using provided pyjamas. Woke to an excellent. freshly cooked scrambled egg and smoked salmon breakfast. Flight on time and luggage on belt quickly.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Sydney to Melbourne with Qantas. I enjoyed the flight. Check in was very easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The meal served was very tasty and it was nice to have a glass of beer. My only complaint was the IFE. It is such a shame that we no longer have access to music on domestic flights. It makes a flight so much more enjoyable. There is no time on a 60-90 minute flight to watch a movie or even a TV show.

### "this was my worst experience"
I have been traveling for the last 12 years but this was my worst experience. As I am leaving Australia for good, the 30 kg allowance on baggage was not enough. I knew this would be a problem so I called Qantas customer service 4 times and was told repeatedly that I cannot pre-book extra baggage and the staff at the airport would help me out. This was not true as the man serving me was one of the rudest Australians I have come across. He had no manners and absolutely no courtesy. He also didn't know his job. I was more of a burden for him and he had no intentions of helping me out and didn't know what I would have to pay extra. After 15 mintues of me trying to explain my situation to him and it falling on deaf and dumb ears I had no option but to reduce my baggage. I was a willing customer okay to pay for extra baggage but because of the mans arrogance and not wanting to do his job I had to leave behind the gifts I got for my family. I will never recommend anyone to travel with Qantas. Terrible airline and horrible staff.

### "This time it was very bad"
Melbourne to Cairns. What a bad experience. Sometime it is ok. Sometimes its bad. This time it was very bad. 8cm sandwich for a 3h30 flight with a single candy as dessert. It would be better to say we are a low cost company, bring your own food! Staff impolite and border line, chief purser should have retired 15 years ago.

### "Terrible customer service"
London Heathrow to Perth. Terrible customer service. All the cabin crew wanted to do is go to their elegant rest area whilst we all were squashed in the most uncomfortable seat. For both dinner and breakfast I did not get my preferred meal.

### "outstanding service"
Adelaide to Perth a real pleasure to fly with Qantas. Friendly cabin crew, clean aircraft, good inflight entertainment and outstanding service. This is an Australian domestic flight and Australians when flying domestic. Lunch included two choices of hot meal, alcoholic beverages or soft drinks and tea or coffee. Having cut my finger during the flight, a flight attendant was most helpful, providing first aid. After the cabin manager came to personally see me to check everything was ok. The crew could not do enough to assist with this matter. Qantas is a fantastic airline.

### "Very slack work"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Adelaide. My flight and many others were canceled last night due to a storm in Sydney. Understandably such things happen and the inevitable chaos ensued, but it took Qantas over two hours to figure out to tell waiting customers this. Now 20 hours later waiting for my replacement flight, just received a message stating that this flight has been delayed another hour and a half - ok that happens. But surely they know much earlier than this when delays and cancellations happen. My time is important too and waiting at the gates isn't a pleasant experience. Qantas let us know earlier what is happening. Very slack work from our national carrier.

### "it’s simply not worth it"
Bangkok to Sydney. Having just flown with Cathay, Finnair and Qatar business class all previously in the past 3 weeks it was an excellent opportunity to compare Qantas and where it sits as a quality air service provider. Sadly it rated a long distant last. It started with the Brisbane Business lounge at the international terminal where the food was scant and not worth eating. The staff were pleasant but the best bubbles they could serve was about a $12 Australian sparkling wine that really very ordinary. Every other carrier offered French champagne in their service offering - but not Qantas. Boarding the plane in Bangkok, the crew looked confused and tired and overall the service was minimal on-route to Sydney. The champagne served onboard was one of the cheapest available and the food was very ordinary. I had the salad as a starter and then the green curry vegetables and noodles. The green curry sauce has split and curdled and was very ordinary. The fresh fruit was nice. Breakfast was a bacon and egg ciabatta sandwich - they don’t serve hot breakfasts any more on Qantas flights! The entertainment was good, although the headphones are the poorest quality out of all the flights and my first set were faulty. The toilets were the same size as economy - small! Whereas the other airlines had much roomier bathrooms. The bathroom had paper towels whereas the others had cloth. There were no creams or amenities in the bathroom whilst the others all did. The plane was looking tired. The travel pj’s were a nice touch and comfortable. Overall Qantas is not rewarding its business class travellers with service and product offerings for which they are charging a premium price. It’s simply not worth the money. They appear to have cut too many corners to squeeze every cent of savings from the budget, but they forget the client is paying substantial money for the privilege of flying with them and it’s simply not worth it. Qatar Airways  was a standout and are simply exceptional in every aspect, Finnair were also excellent, and Cathay is a little tired but still streets in front of Qantas.

### "a decent offering"
Wellington to Brisbane Via Sydney. The return journey was measurably better then my departure for Wellington 3 days prior. Check-In and security was very quick considering how early it was, though Wellington airport is another story. Departure was on time with an early arrival. Inflight Service was efficient, but it was an early morning flight with most passengers catching up on sleep or having breakfast while keeping to themselves. Cabin Crew were friendly and polite, I did notice a lot of conversation between them and It should be minimise as they are working. IFE was limited, only a handful of movie/tv shows are good to watch. Overall, a decent offering but I do think a widebody jet should be on this route.

### "There was nothing to fault"
Auckland to Sydney. Excellent flight. Punctual, good quality meal with three choices available. Staff were professional, friendly, and efficient. Updates from the flight deck were informative without being intrusive. IFE in A330-300 is excellent. There was nothing to fault about this flight.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Brisbane. Terrible customer service and lost baggage services. My baggage was never put into my connecting flight. After talking to baggge services at the airport I was told my bag would be deliever in the afternoon after I landing at 7:45am. After waiting all day in my hostel lobby with no extra clothes and any of my belongings. I checked their online baggage tracker and it said my baggage has not been tracked. I tried calling baggage services and was put on hold for more than 45 minutes. After being tried of waiting I hung up and tried to contact them through their live chat. I was told my baggage was on a flight from Melbourne and would arrive at 1:30pm. Waited all day and no baggage. Now being 4:30 I decided to call and try the live chat again. And again no answer on phone and the live chat told me to call the same number I’ve tried calling twice already! I finally got a hold of someone and I was told my bag is on a flight from Melbourne at will arrive at 5:30pm! And still has to go through customs and deliver. Not gonna get my baggage till 7:30pm and has totally ruined by first day of travelling! Let alone I’ve been traveling from Canada for more than 21 hours. I will never fly with Qantas again. Very poor customer service!

### "Overall nice airline"
Brisbane to Singapore. I enjoyed flying QANTAS. Rather comfy cabin. Legroom is a bit tight (79 cm) but it's bearable. Food was a bit disappointing. Main course was a not so good steak with potatoes. IFE was poor. Cabin crew was ok, professional. Overall nice airline, but expensive.

### "Intensely disappointing"
London to Perth. I travelled with my elderly mother on this route. Our seating area hadn't been properly prepared - Mum had no complimentary water or breakfast order form - this took several requests to sort out, as staff seemed very disorganised and a bit frazzled. We seemed to be in an invisible pocket as far as getting served meals, we had to ring for breakfast to be served to us when all around were eating. Much of what we were served was actually incorrect according to our requests, or inedible. It was like being stuck in a terrible cafe that you couldn't walk away from. Coffee was undrinkable, barely warm, and flavourless. I was served toast which was so parched and charred you couldn't eat it, and a cold poached egg straight from the fridge, not even slightly warmed. Staff were unsmiling. We were so surprised to get service and food that were way inferior to what we would normally get in economy class! Intensely disappointing.

### "budget airlines are far better"
Sydney to Bangkok. The flight in both directions was made terrible by the crew, who were the rudest I've come across. They hid in the galley for most of the flight, rudely brushed aside requests for service, and mechanically handed out one plate of food and one drink for the evening meal, then a cardboard box as an excuse for 'breakfast' (see photo) just before landing. Check in was via a machine, so can't really comment on how bad the ground staff might have been. Awful - budget airlines are far better.

### "thought service was fantastic"
Gold Coast to Melbourne with Qantas. Flying back home, I had Seat 1D, which was an aisle seat which meant I could get up anytime without disrupting the passenger next to me. I like the red plus leather seats, nothing overly special but does the job for short haul trips like mine. We departed on time without a hitch. The plane's wifi was fully functional the entire flight. I thought the service was fantastic, topping up my wine before it was even finished and without asking. The food was great with chicken and rice. For a short trip, the business class in the B737-800 was reasonable.

### "thank all the staff"
Not Verified |  I would like to thank Qantas staff for their fantastic service they have given my wife flying from Medowie to Rockhampton, my wife cannot walk very far as she suffers from infosemia and is a diabetic the Qantas staff had wheelchair waiting and at the changeover in Brisbane they were fantastic. I would like to thank all the staff for their great work.

### "Team onboard were great"
Brisbane to Wellington Via Sydney. The trip started off smooth, easy check-in process with fast security and on time departure from Brisbane to Sydney. Team onboard were great too followed by decent catering and IFE. However, from Sydney to Wellington thing went slightly downhill. The trip was over an hour delayed due to late incoming aircraft so by the time I reached Wellington and go through the airport procedures, it was 2am by the time I actually went to sleep. What I find most disappointing, is the fact that they made the delayed announcements when it was time to actually board for the original time of departure. It's very simple to keep communication transparent. Service and IFE onboard was decent during the second flight, though it was too late at night to actually appreciate it.

### "disinterested and unhelpful"
Los Angeles to Brisbane. Totally dissatisfied with Qantas. Flight cancelled without explanation. Automated email notification from Qantas to which you cannot respond. I now have a layover, more travel time, arrive a day later than planned and due to this will have no one to pick me up from the airport and I will need to travel at least an hour to the coast from Brisbane. Will miss welcome home plans on Monday night. Staff I spoke with were disinterested and unhelpful. I have been offered no compensation or remuneration. Could not be less pleased with my situation and how this has been handled. Will be advising all friends and family against flying with Qantas. Absolutely appalled and will never fly Qantas again. Frustrated and annoyed. Disappointed is an understatement.

### "was not a good experience"
This is my third time flying with Qantas. It is late for almost an hour. My first trip was on January 11 from Bali to Sydney. It was not a good experience. The service was so bad, the stewardess was impolite. I was surprise, I was pregnant and they were just squeeze me in tight corner when i wanted to go to the lavatory. Second time, my flight from Sydney to NZ. Its even worse the airplane small, seat very uncomfortable and they broke one of my suitcase (the wheels and upper handle) and i went to the baggage service counter. They didn’t do anything unless i go to their repair store which is out of the airport. First of all im traveling from very far and this is half of my trip and second of all it was a waste of my time yet i didnt get any solution. Please do improve your service. Because im one of unhappy and disappoint customers of yours.

### "I was very disappointed"
I was very disappointed with the flight from Sydney to Perth for the following reasons. This flight had no entertainment whatsoever, only a drop down small screen about 3 rows in front which showed a feature on racing cars which I had no interest at all. My husband’s seat was faulty, the Steward came along the tried to fix it but no luck and as the plane was completely full he just had to put up with it. The air hostesses did come along and offered champagne to both of us and also a bottle of red wine. There were only two toilets down the back of the plane for Economy and one up the front for Business which meant that there was a line half way down the plane with passengers waiting to use the toilet. When I did eventually did get to the toilet it was quite dirty and disgusting.

### "airplanes were spotless"
Vancouver to Melbourne. I flew Qantas times, two long and one short. The service on all three was awesome. On the longer flights, Qantas offered a menu with three choices of meals plus choice of wine, beer etc. There were pillows, blankets, headsets, ear plugs, tooth brushes and so on offered to all passengers. The airplanes were spotless, modern, full entertainment package, great monitors with flexible positioning for optimum viewing, and so on. All in all, it was very refreshing to have this level of service and comfort in economy class , something that was normal in yesteryears but had perished in the North American market.

### "have not been able to call them"
Sydney to Milan via Dubai. I have been terribly disappointed in QANTAS as on two occasions when I have needed to speak with a customer services member urgently and I have not been able to call them. The line is even worse than centrelink because the call hangs up on you after 20 minutes. Today I have tried calling them on the 131313 number 4 times with no joy, after we urgently need to rebook a ticket as my boyfriend is stranded in Australia. This was also the case when I wanted to check on special baggage. I cannot express just how frustrating this experience has been and I am appalled at the poor treatment of customers in pretending that it is possible to contact QANTAS when in fact it is near impossible. if your flight goes well no worries the aircrew staff are always friendly, because they are real genuine people, but in this case when something goes really wrong or if you need to check something with them it is a nightmare due to the fact they have severely cut customer communication channels to what seems to be an extreme degree.=

### "has been nothing but hassle"
There was no food available other than cooked breakfast on either of the 2 breakfasts supplied on the flight. My wife is allergic to mushrooms but no continental breakfast available. Air stewardess stated we should have pre booked meals (in a condescending way). We did pre book, and tried to stipulate allergy. Only nut allergy could be selected and breakfast was not a choice on the pre booking. We did email Qantas before our flight, to explain the allergy. Never had a reply. Adding insult to injury, all 3 checked in bags were badly damaged. We immediately complained on arrival at Melbourne airport and followed it up, as requested, with an online claim. Several phone calls and several emails later, Qantas agreed to replace the bags. That was nearly a month ago. We now have to buy bags to get back to UK as the bags never arrived. Delay tactics and arrogant attitude. When the supplier has messed up, the least they can do is make reparations painless. This has been nothing but hassle with many hours wasted chasing up replacement baggage.

### "food options significantly limited"
Santiago de Chile to Sydney. I flew Qantas on my return route back to Sydney and was hoping for a better experience than that of LATAM. Unfortunately this was not the case. The flight left SYD late and the snowballed the SCL - SYD flights, transfers etc. Checkin: Disastrous, long lines at SCL, surly staff and far from welcoming. Boarding; DISASTROUS; absolute chaos! Completely disorganised, no process, no space, for queuing processes, pax getting angry with one another as they tried to access the designated queuing location ie Priority, 30-50, 50-75 etc.... The tension in the air was high and far from relaxing. The responsibility of this chaos lied with SCL Qantas staff so it was a Qantas problem not a SCL Airport issue. Flight: I was incredibly anxious having to fly 14hrs or sit in economy for almost 16hrs by the time you can land time etc on a 747-400 in seat 71A. The seat was terrible and does not compare the the newer aircraft ie LATAMs 787. The kind pax in front reclined for most of the trip, which gave me 20cm between the seat and my face. The cabin crew were the usual older Qantas cabin crew, who were efficient and as pleasant as they needed to be only. Being at the back, food options were significantly limited. They rearranged the menu and brought forward dinner instead of the mid-flight snack. Most annoying but i believe it worked for the crew. The crew did walk the aisles with water which was more than LATAM crew did. My seat, 71A was a two seat row and felt i had some extra leg room on the side which made the experience slight more bearable. As beautiful and as majestic as the 747-400 is she is an old bird and as such makes these long flights very uncomfortable and would see this flight much more improved if and when they switch the aircraft to a 787. Food options were better but not by much than the LATAM alternative. Overall the experience was ok but not great. I paid $3300 for the ticket in November for late Dec/Jan so i didn't feel that it was value for money.

### "occasional arrogant attendant"
Not Verified |  Very poor customer service experience at the gate. I had a laptop bag that was 8kg or 7kg if I took the laptop out and they made me check it. On top of being 60 minutes delayed. I did not plan for the additional time to wait for bags and will miss my reason for going in the first place. I fly with Qantas and pay a premium because I never have to deal with this not picking budget airline approach like Tiger or Jetstar. This was a very unfortunate experience. I do find Qantas staff in general to be okay but then you find the occasional arrogant attendant too often.

### "the most horrid experience"
Canberra to Denpasar flight. I have been a loyal Qantas customer and decided to book with them for our honeymoon ( scheduled departure of 22 December). Had the most horrid experience as a customer. First flight was cancelled and rebooked the next day on a multiple lag flight ( Canberra, Sydney, Darwin, Denpasar) with Jetstar completing last lag. We had already missed a night of our honeymoon. To add insult to injury, Qantas left our baggage in Sydney and they did not arrive until 26 December. On contacting the airline (customer service) they declined any responsibility of the delayed baggage, saying it was Jet Stars responsibility as they flew us the last lag of the flight- although the the bags were left in Sydney and never made it to Darwin! Was extremely disappointed by their response and failure to acknowledge their customer responsibility.

### "A huge improvement"
For the first time flew London to Brisbane via Perth on Qantas' 787 and experienced the new business class. A huge improvement for Qantas having aisle access for all seats. The individual seat amenity such as personal space, storage space and the seat itself is great. The London to Perth leg was 15 hours and 32 minutes which is not bad for such a long flight. The 787 cabin ambience is an improvement over the 747 and the A380. The food offerings were plentiful as were drinks. Cabin service was friendly. Between meal times, requests for hot chocolate and other items were quickly actioned. The entertainment options were vast and the screen was very responsive to touch. Toilet access throughout the flight was not an issue. Between meal times, there was a good variety of snacks to choose from. Arriving in Perth, very quick immigration clearance and a five minute walk to Qantas domestic to put the bags on the belt for Brisbane. The flight from Perth to Brisbane was on a 737. Again, the service was excellent. For this 4 hour flight, water runs were made. Both flights departed and arrived on time. This was the first time flying from London to Brisbane via Perth. Would I do this run again, probably not only for the reason that if I fly over Singapore, I can land directly in Brisbane and get a stop and a leg stretch. If I lived in Perth or Adelaide, i'd always be flying London - Perth. This experience was enjoyable.

### "disorganized, and unhelpful"
Sydney to Johannesburg. Definitely choose another airline - disorganized, and unhelpful. Seriously delayed flight and disastrous airline. The flight was delayed by 6 hours in Sydney causing us to miss the last flight out from Johannesburg to Cape Town on arrival. Next connecting flight was 7 hours later. I paid $800 extra to fly with Qantas as it was the most direct route. I have always flown with Emirates, but didn’t want to have the long connection. Had I flown with Emirates it would not only have cost me less but would have also been a shorter flight. Sydney to Cape Town with Qantas took almost 30 hours to get there. They also then seated us separately even after having checked in initially with two seats together, they messed that up. Waited at the airport Qantas desk at check in for almost two hours trying to check in and sort that out as it was total chaos at the airport Qantas lines. The stewards and hostesses on the plane in general are unhelpful, giving you a distinct impression that everything and anything is too much trouble for them, I have flown Emirates, Air France, British Airways, Turkish Airlines internationally and never seen such chaos and had such a disappointing flight for years. The extended flight cost us time and money and great discomfort. Will never fly Qantas again.

### "You are practically in the service galley"
Not Verified |  Qantas QF2, A380-800. Whatever you do don’t pay extra for seats 79B or 79C. However if you like having staff and customers falling over you, standing on you, crashing into you and running over you with the service trolleys these are the seats for you! I cannot believe that they actually charge extra for this “extra leg room” seat. You are practically in the service galley and subject to constant noise throughout the flight. Even when they finally drew the curtains, to mask the galley, people and staff were still coming in and out, to get things, and as they were coming from the light into darkness couldn’t see where they were going and crashed into you. Oh and do not bother raising this with “customer service” as they are not at all interested, and all you receive is a standard reply, which basically says “we do not care.” I won't mention the Breakfast, 1 piece of fruit and a small danish! Or that their headphone, jack plugs, remained in the sockets and ripped my trousers as I got up, for which they require a receipt to reimburse me (having a laugh as obviously I keep all my receipts for everything just in case!)

### "choose a different airline"
Sydney to Johannesburg. Customer Service personnel of Sydney Airport think it's OK to yell at you because you dare to question why there is only one person checking people in, while there were 7 behind the desk. I reported this to them on their website, but no reply. I will choose a different airline next time.

### "stewardess was very rude"
Sydney to Bangkok. On a long flight my daughter's seat rest was not working, when complained the stewardess was very rude. Food is terrible. When returning could not book online, only way to do was by paying extra $ 40 per ticket per sector to select a seat. That means for 5 of us extra $ 200, not advised. Terrible food again, a wrap and a sandwich for 8 hour pluse flight. Should have listened to my kids, never again.

### "a very bad experience"
Sydney to Port Macquarie, this was my first flight with QANTAS but gave me a very bad experience. I like to take photo especially inside the cabin. I can understand that every airline would have their rules and regulations to take photo inside the cabin. The incident was happen when I try to take photo inside the cabin, the steward run to me and used a very rude tone warn me that I do not allow to take any photo of their cabin. I follow his instruction and put down my camera without any single word, but he shouted at me and wanted me to delete the photo immediately. Although he being rude to me I still follow his instruction to delete the photo of their cabin. After he confirmed I deleted the photo and he just went away. When the aircraft landed and I walked out from the air craft, the 2 cabin crews never want to look at me and just shown a hatred face. I might did wrong to take photo of their cabin but I do not deserve a shout and rude treatment from them, I can understand that not all QANTAS cabin crew behave in this way but these 2 cabin crews were the worst cabin crew that I ever met. I will never use this airline again.

### "Absolute garbage"
Not Verified | Adelaide to Sydney. Absolute garbage typical in Australia pay more and receive less. You do not get a meal now it is a snack and when I asked about lunch was told that was for flights between 12pm and 2pm. We have a 2-hour journey from Sydney to Adelaide leaving 11.55am but that 5 minutes if the difference between a snack and lunch. If I board a 1-hour flight from Sydney to Melb at 12.15pm I get lunch but this is how corporate Qantas like to treat Australian domestic business class passengers. Our flight last week luggage came out 45 minutes after all the economy just not good enough and with little competition no reason to lift standards.

### "Goodbye Qantas!"
Qantas is all too hard! From the moment I tried to book the flight the headaches started and continued right through to the end of the holiday. Without waffling on about the rubbish standards Qantas now adhere to, unless they are the last airline in town, I will never be using them again. You try and support your national airline, but having the lions share of the market creates complacency and arrogance. Goodbye Qantas!

### "shocked with the bad service"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Melbourne via Los Angeles. They left our bags in LA and didn’t notify us till few minutes before landing giving an excuse no place on the plane. Didn’t supply us with necessities and when you call the customer service they don’t care, We had to spend two days in Melbourne sitting at the hotel ignored completely by Qantas, it’s a shame on Qantas to treat the passengers this way, would never recommend them again we were shocked with the bad service we had.

### "they never reply"
Kuching to Brisbane via Singapore. I am writing this review regarding the Qantas customer care service. Together with my spouse and daughter, we purchased our travel tickets via Qantas Airways website under two separate bookings. These are multi cities travel and we have made separate bookings because my daughter traveled earlier but her return tickets were the same time and dates with us. The problem arouse during our returns from Melbourne, Australia. On 29 Nov 18, when we checked in at Melbourne Airport, we requested for our bagages to be checked all the way to Kuching but the staff told us she cannot do that and she advised us to pick up our baggage at Kuala Lumpur. She also reminded us to pick up our boarding passes for Singapore/Kuala Lumpur at Changi Airport; then upon arriving at KL,pick up our luggage at Kuala Lumpur and check in at KLIA for the KL/Kuching flight. All our flights were on 29 Nov 2018. Because of time constraint, we missed our flight for Kuala Lumpur/Kuching. On the night of 29 Nov 2018, when we checked with MAS regarding the re-arrangement of our connecting flight from KL to Kuching, the staff told us to refer to Qantas since we have purchased our tickets via Qantas Airways website. Qantas does not open any counter or office at KLIA so I have to call their office at Kuala Lumpur. The telephone always got disconnected in the midst of conversation. Finally I managed to talk to one staff but he was not helpful. Because we have missed our flights so our appointments in Kuching for the following days have to be rescheduled. We have to purchase new tickets in order to travel from Kuala Lumpur to Kuching on 30 Nov 2018. When I wrote to Qantas customer care for them to give us letters to show proof of no boarding or no show, they replied and asked me to write to MAS. When I told them it should be their responsibility to give us the letter, and until today three weeks already passed they never reply. We feel that Qantas should be responsible to advise us when we make travel arrangement and bookings, especially under multi cities travel;  to compensate and help us in re-arranging our travel for the flights that we have missed; and to give us the assistance that we need and not just ignore and keeping quiet.

### "the poorest experience"
Adelaide to Sydney. I arrived at Qantas two hours before departure already having checked in the previous day. I was using the electronic ticketing machines which at first froze on me, making me go to another machine which then told me I owed qantas an extra 200$ for luggage that was complimentary included in the package. I then went to staff and asked for assistance where staff were rude, telling me they could not help and I should go back to the computer, I went back to the e ticket machine again and it didn’t work, annoyed I went back to the staff and asked for assistance (the guy didn’t even get off the counter to help me and he wasn’t even busy). To add drama to this there is a delay to my flight and I have no idea when we are leaving as Qantas did not send me any details of this delay. This included on the extra time I’ve had to wait in line, the random cost that I never was told about as well as the rude customer service that was too lazy to help as well as three faulty e ticket machines has made this the poorest experience even before going onto the plane. I normally don’t take luggage and now I can see why, Qantas is meant to be a first class AAA Airline get from this experience I would have preferred going to a cheaper airline where this attitude is expected.

### "service was top notch"
Sydney to London via Singapore. My partner and I flew business class in the forward section of the upper deck. Boarding was quick. Full business class section. The service from all flight staff was fantastic. A couple of times the Flight Service Manager came around to say hi and inquire how the service was. And the service was top notch. Requesting a couple of drinks along the way was no hassle. The meals really tasty. The barramundi fish especially was cooked to perfection. But to top such a long flight off, land at Heathrow, off the aircraft and out the front of Terminal 3 within half an hour. Great flights.

### "extremely rude and unhelpful"
New York to Melbourne via Los Angeles. I booked a full business class ticket for my 2 year old son and I to Australia on Qantas.com to visit family. The first part of the flight from Newark to San Francisco was scheduled for 3pm however due to engine issues, we were advised every 20 minutes there would be further delays until we boarded at finally at 6pm. Once we boarded, the power shut down and we were delayed an additional hour and a half on the plane. For those of you with young kids you can imagine how hard it's starting to get traveling alone with a toddler. The flight landed around 10.30pm and as a result we had missed our connecting flight to Australia. I was advised by the airline crew on board that there was an 11.15pm flight to Sydney that we should take instead as the airlines are partners. When I disembarked from the plane with my two year old, whom was screaming and crying for hours due to the unsettlement of the delays, I noted my stroller was broken during the flight. So I had to carry my son, carry-on a broken stroller to the entire other side of the airport to try and board this flight. We get there and they advise us that the flight is full. It's now midnight. I ask when they will be re-booking us on the soonest flight out and they tell me all the Qantas agents have left and I will need to call online to rebook my son and I on a flight out and should go collect our luggage. I go with my son to collect our bags. I wait an hour and a half, our bag doesn't come off, at the same time, I've been on hold with Qantas customer service now for an hour and half and no one has answered... its now almost 2am in San Francisco airport on my own with my two year old. I try to find where our bag is being held as I'm almost out of diapers, we have no clothes etc, no one is around to help. They airport staff all advise me to come back in the morning... its now been 2 hours on hold with Qantas. With no other choice, we leave the airport at 2.30am having never been to San Fran and try to find a hotel for us for the few hours left of the night. We go to one hotel nearby... sold out... we call another car to find another hotel nearby, it's now 3.30am, we finally get a room and check in. Due to the late time and last minute, they did not have a crib for my son so he needed to sleep in a bed, I armed it best i could with pillows of course, but at 4.30am i hear a huge bang and outcry, my son had rolled off the bed and smashed his face in the corner of a nightstand, blood everywhere. I settle him and luckily he was ok and have him lay back down with me, did I mention its now 5.00am and I am still on hold with Qantas Customer Service, (that's 5 hours!). At 5.15am I finally get through and was put on hold. I wait 45 minutes on hold again and the agent informs me there are no seats today and would need to fly out a different day. I explained how that wasn't an option with no bags or clothes or hotel rooms planned further and I look online and see that there are seats. I found seats on a flight out today I said. She argues with me and says to go ahead and book it if it’s ‘true’ (because I have nothing better to do at 5am with a baby... ) and that the check in agent will move the flight over when I express any charge concerns, you can imagine my level of fed up at this point. I explain to the woman the situation, how long i had been on hold and that we must be on the next flight out, she was extremely rude and unhelpful.

### "Qantas you are pathetic"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Sydney. Late boarding of aircraft as Qantas crew stuck in heavy traffic in Bangkok. Due to this failed to get 9.00am plane from Sydney to Melbourne. Breakfast not served in economy class as Qantas claimed too much turbulence. This can only happen with "the spirit of Australia" - Qantas you are pathetic. I will never fly with you again.

### "back to Qatar Airways for me"
Not Verified |  Perth to Singapore and onto London. Baggage at check in was 44kg - 4 kg over allotted weight but I had no hand luggage (7kg) allowed. Check in staff made me take clothes out at desk to get it to allotted weight and gave me a carrier bag - wonder why Qantas doesn’t have many business class passengers. Went into lounge and no alcohol allowed but can buy some in the rest of the airport - nice to be treated like an irresponsible child - back to Qatar Airways for me.

### "Absolutely dreadful"
Perth to Singapore. Absolutely dreadful,  we asked specifically if there was restaurants & duty free at the Qantas international departures as we had quite a bit of time to fill, and we assured there were lots. There is a tiny out of stock duty free and a Black Wood “restaurant” which did not serve hot food as "the chef is not here". Terrible service, a disgrace for an international airport! My husband was travelling for business my son and I going on holiday. No children play area

### "no air conditioning for relief"
Cairns to Sydney Via Brisbane. To start off, the plane was sitting in 36 Degree heat on the tarmac with no air conditioning for relief. All passengers were so hot you would be sweating even if you weren't moving around. Cabin were doing their best to make sure customers were comfortable in the unbearable heat. Not much catering on the flight and IFE was quite limited which is due to aircraft type. Departure and arrival was on time, a very reliable service.

### "Rude, totally unwelcoming"
Melbourne to Singapore on QF 35 on 20th November with my wife. There was a slight delay at the departure from Melbourne and when we got into the aircraft we were quite surprised to see the poor state of the cabin. The chairs still had food particles left from the previous flight and the tray tables were not wiped. Both our chairs had faulty reclining options. (52D/E) Since we were going on a holiday our spirits were very high positive so we ignored the poor cabin condition and sat on our seats. Then came the cabin crew with the meal service and they were an absolute match to the state of the cabin. Rude, totally unwelcoming and they were under the impression that they are doing us a favor. I got the feeling like we are travelling as a bunch of prisoners being transported from one country to another. No customer service at all. Also during the service my wife asked for a certain cocktail and the stewardess looked at her very sarcastically then laughed and offered a different one. They were also skipping passengers during the tea/Coffee service and rushed through that service. We finally arrived in Singapore and I was much relieved to leave that hostile environment. Approximately 2 weeks later we had to fly back home from Singapore on the 4th December. Singapore to Melbourne on QF 38. I must admit the consistency Qantas proved with poor cabin status and crew behavior was astounding. SIN/MEL sector my tray table was not cleaned and had some visible oily residue on it which I had to clean. The cabin crew that served in my area were unsmiling, arrogant and gave the impression that they are not happy to do their job and we the passengers are a nuisance. I felt very uncomfortable to just ask for a glass of water because most of the crew that worked in my area looked so grumpy. I must admit there was one stewardess that came for a short while maybe from business class to help and she was very pleasant. The meals that they serve for 7+ hour flight was a joke. There’s a hot snack they serve after takeoff and 2 hrs before landing to Melbourne the choice of food was an over cooked omelette or a plain fruit bowl. Come on people the hot omelette just comes by itself and no yogurt or fruit to accompany it. I have flown with Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Sri Lankan airlines in the same MEL/SIN/MEL sector and the customer service and the choice of meals serve these other airlines provide are far superior to Qantas. I would sincerely hope that Qantas will take these complaints seriously and ensure that proper service is given to the passengers in these flights.

### "best described as unprofessional"
Sydney to Perth in August 2018. Prepare to experience service that can be best defined as ‘two flavored’. While my outbound flight from Sydney was excellent, the staff on the inbound flight from Perth were below average. While some were very courteous, a majority of the team was unfriendly and were even seen yawning in the cabin during the meal service. I don’t think there is a more direct way of telling your passengers ‘I’d really rather not be serving you’. The tray table had filth from the previous flight which was promptly cleaned after notifying this to the staff. Furthermore, about 30 minuted before landing, to everyone’s misfortune, a drunk passenger started harassing passengers in the rear economy section and shouted offensive slurs. This is not the fault of Qantas, obviously, but the way the crew handled this situation is at best described as unprofessional. Clearly clueless and inexperienced on how to deal with such a situation. The upside of the flight is the entertainment system, I am thoroughly impressed by the way in which even on domestic sectors, there is an extensive selection of movies to keep you entertained for the full duration of the flight. Food is palatable but Qantas has served better meals.

### "a complete let down"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. The Dreamliner and service by Qantas was a complete letdown. Firstly, Qantas didn't pre board families with children. Things went downhill from there. Even though we paid for seat selection, it was not honoured and we ended up with seats at the very back. Qantas have refused to refund as apparently these seats are in the same class as row 56 which we chose. I think not, who would choose the back row? The seats hardly reclined and were rock hard. The kids meals were inedible. Two of my 3 children are Autistic, and no help was offered, or given when my youngest child was sick. The constant flushing of toilets and loud conversations from cabin staff kept my children awake. This was a 14 hour nightmare journey. I would much prefer to fly on an A380 than this little plane. It may have pretty internal lighting and automatic shades on the windows, but this doesn't make up for the fact that space is tight and the seats are shocking. The better than you attitude of Qantas staff was just the icing on the cake. Never again.

### "needs to step up its game"
Sydney To Brisbane Via Cairns. The trip started with a visit to the Lounge for some much needed breakfast. Both flights were on perfect schedule with boarding really efficient and prioritising premium passengers during the process. The inflight service was average, nothing great about the catering either. IFE was good, just lack options and as for the Cabin Crew, no one really stood out. Qantas really needs to step up its game to keep up with the world's leading airlines.

### "very reluctant to help me"
Sydney to Brisbane via Townsville. Was going to arrive late for this flight due to unforeseen circumstances and could not even locate a number to alert the check in desk that I would be on the flight but was late (by late I mean, I would arrive twenty minutes prior to aircraft departure). When I arrived, there was no check in worker to alert the gate of my late arrival and as such I arrived at the gate two minutes after boarding had closed. With the aircraft sitting still on the tarmac for another ten minutes, I pleaded with crew to assist me as I was there but they were very reluctant to help me and did not offer any help in rescheduling me a flight beyond telling me I could sit at the gate and look up other flights. Will never attempt to fly with Qantas again and do not recommend this airline to anyone who apparently does not possess the ability to see into the future and predict if they will be late.

### "happy with the service offered"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. As our recovery flight from Jetstar was sent to Qantas our boarding passes were not forwarded in the system. Staff helped us recover our passes despite it not being their fault on their end. They assisted us, supported us and offered us a different flight, flying 45 minutes after our original one that Jetstar has poorly ‘organised’. Extremely happy with the service offered especially from these two lovely air hostess’. Will definitely be flying again with Qantas after this great service.

### "efficient boarding"
Auckland To Sydney. A very smooth journey which began with a visit to the First Class Lounge. Departure was on time paired with efficient boarding. Cabin Crew were incredibly friendly. For once the catering was spot on as I had a large fruit platter, filling and fresh. IFE this time was not up to scratch, not the best content. The flight landed early, but the downside was having to wait for the bus to take us back to the main terminal. Overall, great service from Qantas.

### "crew were outstanding"
Melbourne to Narita return. Both flights left on time and landed on time. The cabin was clean and seats were quite comfortable. The food was quite good, the wine even better. But like any flight it is the crew that can make make or break it. On both flights the crew were outstanding. Very friendly, efficient. Great job done by cabin crew.

### "Constant flight delays"
Melbourne to Sydney. Constant flight delays when flying domestic. Customer service is appalling with no notice of delays or apology. Forced to wait 3 hours in airport with no compensation. Will not be flying again. Other Australian airlines would be better suited for domestic travel.

### "crew were friendly and jovial"
Enjoyed this 1 hour 10 min flight from Canberra to Melbourne. The self check in was good with staff helping. I wish it was like that in Melbourne. The crew as we boarded were so friendly and jovial. The best crew in fact I’ve experienced on a Qantas flight. The plane was full on this night (6th November). The plane was quite old but clean. No entertainment and seats tight but didn’t matter on such a short flight, A fair bit of turbulence. We were given a beef sandwich and drink. For a short flight it was fine. It was a shame my husbands suitcase contents were damaged. That marred this being a great experience.

### "flight was exceptional"
Not Verified |  
Economy class from Singapore to Brisbane. I haven’t flown Qantas on an international route for a while and had forgotten how the good the cabin crew are. The flight was exceptional from start to finish but it was the cabin crew who made all the difference with their professional but relaxed service. The food was the best airline food I have had in a long time and the entertainment available was good. We departed on time and arrived early.

### "made everything a lot easier"
Not Verified | My original flight from Melbourne to Sydney was cancelled so I was moved onto another flight. I was placed at the back of the plane and had concerns about getting to my connecting flight to Tamworth. I told the flight attendant my concerns and she was extremely helpful. She notified other staff of my concerns and also other passengers concerned and they tried to sort out a solution. They came back later to tell us towards the end of the flight they would move us all to the front of the plane which they did. They stored my carry on bag in an extra cabinet so it would be close to the front and they helped me make my way closer to the door once it was time to go. If the airline staff at Qantas didn’t do what they had done I would not have made my connecting flight to meet my partner who I haven’t seen in months. I am so greatful for their help and I would definitely fly with Qantas again. They made everything a lot easier for me.

### "Absolutely disgraceful"
Canberra to Melbourne. Absolutely disgraceful, every time I have flown with QANTAS my flight has been delayed by at least an hour, it feels like its impossible to get good service from QANTAS anymore, utterly useless. Flight times printed on tickets can be completely disregarded and just hope that you get to fly out within a couple of hours later

### "taking time not to refund me"
Bali to Nadi via Sydney. They destroyed 2 brand new surfboards that were carefully protected and packed inside a travel board bag and, since the happening, 2 months ago, they rarely get back to me and when they do, they keep asking for documents which I have already forwarded them 3 or 4 times. It looks they are just taking time not to refund me for the damage. If you care about your baggage, book with another airline. It's intolerable the way they have treated my bag!

### "highly recommend Qantas"
My Daughter & I flew from Singapore on flight no 3K 556 to Melbourne. Just 15 mins into flight I become violently ill, with constant vomiting, and dizziness, the staff on board were there in seconds to assist me. The concern and compassion shown towards me and my daughter, "who was very alarmed by my condition" were of an incredible standard. The Staff on that flight did their utmost to ensure my comfort and privacy to see me through to my destination,and allowed my daughter to remain with me. One staff member remained with me most of the time, Monitering my condition. Also the ground staff, who went out far and beyond to assist me to the Airport Doctor. My Daughter and I will highly recommend Qantas, and we fly with them international as well as domestic, thank you Qantas.

### "Appalling communication"
Not Verified |  London to Perth. One week after arriving in Perth I am still without luggage. Appalling communication from Qantas. Very limited access to internet but have provided a friends contact details so absolutely no excuse for this substandard service. I am furious! The case has a valuable outfit in it which has great sentimental value. Trip of a lifetime, I am substantially out of pocket purchasing 'essential' items.

### "offers a sub-par product"
Sydney to Brisbane. Qantas is demonstrably worse than its peers. I fly frequently both in Australia and overseas. Qantas is one of the worst airlines I have flown with. Flight attendants are supercilious and demanding and have zero customer service. Food quality is mediocre. Seats have become increasingly cramped, even when compared to other airlines such as United. Qantas charges a premium price but offers a sub-par product.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Perth to Singapore. Having never flown with Qantas internationally before, I was pleasantly surprised with the service that I received on my flight from Perth to Singapore. The crew on the flight could not be faulted and were some of the best that I have experienced throughout my travels. As I was travelling on my birthday, I was personally greeted by the cabin services manager which was a nice touch. As it was an A330-200 in the domestic configuration that was used, iPads were provided rather than the seatback screens, however I found these to be more responsive, and the content on them was a very vast selection. Given the timing of this flight, and the quality of service provided, I would not hesitate to travel with Qantas again on this route.

### "not allow us to be seated together"
Sydney to Los Angeles. We were on a group tour to Australia via Qantas. We were advised by the tour company that Qantas would not provide a seat selection until we checked in at the airline. Qantas then would not allow us to be seated together claiming since it was a tour group booking that all members would be assigned seats in a certain area and It was our responsibility to make arrangements with other members of the group after we boarded. We later learned that several members of our group were assigned seats with their spouses and spread throughout the aircraft, We also noticed there were several unoccupied seats which could have been utilized to have spouses sit together. Regardless if I am with a group or not, I should be able to sit with my spouse. That is not a good policy to split spouses, especially on a long, long, trip. This was our first experience with Qantas and may be our last.

### "the worst Qantas performance"
Hong Kong to Brisbane via Sydney. On the day of travel managed to arrive ahead of planned departure, so I thought I would enquire as to an earlier departing flight. No one at the airport so called their contact centre. Well, that's where their problems start. 3 attempts to even talk to someone. First time cut-off after being on hold for 35mins, 2nd cut-off again after 35mins, final third time got to talk to someone after being on hold for 20mins! Then told yes there are available seats, but it will cost AUD300.00 to change! Not worth the trouble or the effort to save 3hrs! Then the flight!. Well this must have been the oldest A330 in the world. Seats were dirty, cushions compressed over time, therefore uncomfortable, and IFE screen that looked like it belonged in an Antique shop. Most phones are available with bigger and better quality screens. Thus entertainment was also in the antique category, not much better than the very old style single big screen in the cabin of years gone by! Qantas must have dug this aircraft out of the museum! And to top it off they seem to have this unique habit of sitting someone next to you, when just across the aisle is a complete empty row. Menu hasn't changed for months (I fly regularly so it becomes even more bland after seeing the same slop for 6 months) Overall by far the worst Qantas performance to date.

### "a good little trip"
Having travelled on all three airlines that go to Canberra from Melbourne, Qantas is the best. Bigger plane so only 35 minutes journey time, pretty reliable, and it was less than half the price of Virgin on this trip. You get baggage allowance 23kg, plus a nice snack, this was a pack of pink cookies and a drink. Even seat back entertainment which was a surprise. We departed and left on time, although the seats were very tight and I noticed the tall guy across from us had to sit with his legs at an angle to fit. Luggage was fast All in all a good little trip.

### "friendly, efficient and professional"
This is a very regular run for me. Out on QF1 and back on QF2. It was by and large an uneventful run on both legs. Typical service from the FA's ie friendly, efficient and professional. Being a Platinum QFF and sitting at the back means you get a few extras. A couple of glasses of champagne were brought out and express passes for London. Nice touches which help. Now a word on my usual gripe. I know its a first world problem. The Qantas Singapore lounge is fabulous but getting there and back all within the 90 minute turnaround, a shower and meal is impossible with the volume of people going there and the distances involved. That's why Dubai was so good in terms of ease of access. On both the outbound and inbound I took refuge in the BA lounge next door. Gripe apart another satisfying trip with my favour carrier.

### "Very dissatisfied"
Christchurch to Canberra via Melbourne. Very dissatisfied. Flight was scheduled to board at 1.40pm at 2.00pm call over the PA that the flight was delayed at there was be more information at 2.15pm. 3.00pm and an announcement over PA that flight is delayed until 6.00pm. As our connecting flight left at 6.05pm we knew we had missed it and sought information about what would be happening at the connection. Gate staff could give us no information and gave us a number to ring that could tell us more. Rang the number numerous times over 3.5hr wait and could not get through or recorded message told us they were having technical difficulties. Our own research shows that there is not a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Canberra at an appropriate time but guess we will see as no one can give us any information.

### "an average flight"
Osaka to Sydney. I have mixed thoughts and feelings about my latest experience with Qantas. Overall it was an average flight, everything was routine but that's where the Cabin Crew had the best opportunity to raise the standards to show international passengers and frequent flyers what the Qantas brand is all about, little did that come across. I don't expect much even though I have a Platinum tier with Qantas, but I do expect the standard service and anything above that, is much appreciated. One thing that is obvious with the cabin crew is their inconsistency in regards to addressing customers, the customer service manager called me 'sir' rather than my name and addressed another passenger by name. I know it's a small issue (and some people could careless) but it says a lot about the training or lack of. Moving on, the hard products was amazing as the Suites were very comfortable. Food and beverages were up to scratch with dinner and breakfast provided. I'm hoping my next flight will be of the service level the Qantas brand is known for.

### "Give me Jetstar over Qantas every time"
Flew Darwin to Brisbane. Red eyes are never fun, but I think Qantas domestic service has dropped below the other so called budget airlines. I would place it last in the available domestic airlines. The seats seem very close together and uncomfortable. You are constantly feeling knees in your back, but can't help but return the favour to the person in front of you. They do provide pillows and blankets, but the aircon is turned up so high, that it's like being in a sauna. The hostesses are friendly enough, but seem bored with it all. The service provided takes no account of the time of day, serving the standard small meal and drinks when you just wanted some shut-eye. And when they finally do turn off the lights, the big old fashioned roof mounted screens provide enough light pollution to make you feel like your in a disco. Uuugh. Give me Jetstar over Qantas every time!

### "an above average flight
Sydney to Melbourne. Pretty much that standard experience of a non-low-cost Domestic airline. Upon boarding headphones were made available for self-pick-up. The seat was acceptable with slightly above average legroom and average cushioning. The in-flight Wi-Fi was a great touch-up for the fact that it's free unlimited and it's actually fast enough to stream YouTube at 480p. In addition, the food offered was pleasant with good seasoning and flavors plus a very generous selection of drinks to accompany. Overall an above average flight and would definitely recommend.

### "Will never fly again"
Sydney to Houston via Dallas. First time flying Qantas after many years. Have cancelled my Qantas frequent flyer membership. Will never fly again. Nor will I be bothering to accrue any status. What sort of airline issues status credits that expire after 3 days. Qantas does. Nice way to keep people on lower tier status. Flight delayed leaving and arrived late. Missed the connection although one of my bags went on the plane I was supposed to be on. How does that work when you have to retrieve your bag on arrival in Dallas. I would not recommend American Airline eithers. They offer first class tickets and no lounge access. Or they offer lounge access but no complimentary drinks. Love it when an airline suspends drinks service due to turbulence that never eventuates. I feel for Qantas it must be difficult having to compete with airlines that offer customer service and modern planes. A380 business seats should have been replaced years ago. Not sure why bags are marked as priority. They don’t get priority.

### "Overall, above average"
Sydney to Perth. My first time flying Qantas business class domestic. Love the seat with massage function & the blanket is a cotton blanket not a cheap fleece type. As I was on a morning flight, food was so disappointing but the Lounge made it up prior the flight. Entertainment was good. Crews were great. Overall, above average.

### "profit is now more important"
Sydney to Canberra. Amazing how QF treats it’s Lifetime Gold/ concurrent OneWorld Emerald customers - with utter contempt! Arriving in Sydney after 40 hours of flying half way around the world my flight into SYD was 40 minutes late with more delays waiting on the taxiway for a gate, i.e. a total delay of about 1 hour (although not QF‘s fault). It then took more than 20 minutes for priority baggage to be delivered. Upon arriving 45 minutes before departure of the connecting flight trying to check in at the transfer desk for my connecting flight I was told, after some discussions in relation to the ticket, everything was fine but that the flight had now closed 2 minutes ago and the check-in staff refused to rebook me on the next flight but told me to go CX (the delayed flight) to have the ticket reissued although the original ticket was issued by. After some marathon throughout Sydney airport, CX reissued the ticket which was then not accepted by QF. Instead, and to add insult to injury, QF charged me an additional $200 for reissuing the ticket. Upon my question if I could book a frequent flyer flight, I was then told that i could not book a flight using frequent flyer points as this was not possible on the same day (I have now found out that this was incorrect).In the past QF waived the change fee in such instances, i.e. circumstance beyond the customer‘s control), but I guess profit is now more important than providing a service to premium customers. After some 10 years of Platinum with QF and now Lifetime Gold and OneWorld Emerald, QF certainly needs to lift its game to get me back as customer.

### "food is perfect for my taste"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Sydney. Though I was upset with Emirates removing A380 flights to Australia and replaced them with the Qantas fleet, but it was my first time on Qantas and so far it's straight forward and perfect, only just. The Boeing 737-800 has in-flight entertainment systems but it has less variety of movies and tv, and the flight path option is not the best. But the food is perfect for my taste, I don't mind plane food and I don't usually critique plane food. As a very tall person myself (6 foot 3 or 4), It was difficult trying to reach for my window seat (especially in a Boeing 737), and the windows are low to the point where I had to bend down slightly to see the view. Maybe I'm not used to experiencing a flight like this as a tall person. I'd be better off on the aisle seat next time I travel. But the service though is very decent, and they did really well with consistent schedules (despite the 30 minute delay on another flight back home which doesn't bother me), and their check in and bag drop kiosks are very convenient, especially for my first solo travel.

### "Seats cramped and uncomfortable"
Brisbane to Sydney. Check in via mobile app received an e-boarding pass. On previous occasions Qantas Gold customers were offered the opportunity to select exit row seats free of charge but this privilege is now gone with customers having to pay $20 for an exit row. The line for Priority Security Screening is now longer than the regular line as is the priority boarding lane. Pays to just use the regular customer lines as everybody seems to be a Gold member these days. In flight entertainment did not work on this flight and despite being told over the PA that extra reading material would be made available none actually was available. Seats are narrow, cramped and uncomfortable and food is average at best. New slimline toilets are cramped and make you feel like you're in a coffin. Crew service was pleasant but basic. Qantas management seem to be removing the last remaining benefits of flying with them. They're willing me to try other airlines.

### "Qantas bad For business"
Johannesburg to Sydney. Qantas bad For business! My wife and I flew back from Johannesburg on Sunday October 21. The 747 was the oldest in the Qantas fleet and really showed her age. One of the two business class toilets was not working (fixed later in the flight), my audio visual system was not working properly and storage doors in the toilet would not close completely. Worse was they ran out of the only two good options for food on the menu. My wife also found limited food options in business when she flew Qantas to Johannesburg in early October. I said while I do not blame the staff for running out of food, for all the money paid for business class it was not good enough! As a compensation I was offered a crew meal. My wife pre-ordered the beef but it was inedible! The seats were old and did not fully recline. I understand Qantas is retiring all of the 747's however while they continue to fly them, they have an obligation to provide adequately maintained aircraft and for the prices they charge in business a full selection of meals!

### "product was definitely dated"
Sydney To Hong Kong. Due to Fog blanketing Sydney, there was a delay with the Aircraft arriving for on time departure. The delay was around 2 hours though arrival into Hong Kong was only 1 hour later then expected. I chose to fly this route for the start of my holiday as it would most likely be the last time I will fly this aircraft before Qantas retires them like the majority of the industry. Hard product was definitely dated but it still had its charm. Catering was well done, better then the last time I flew to Hong Kong. The Cabin staff weren't amazing but they were present and helpful when needed. Overall, a solid offering.

### "will never fly Qantas again"
Bangkok to Singapore via Perth. I am a one world emerald frequent flyer. The reason I am willing to pay more by flying Qantas rather than cheaper competition is because I get lounge access, priority and I get to pick my seats. I got to do none of this because part of the trip is done by another airline. I will never fly Qantas again, just not worth it.

### "not be flying Qantas again"
Not Verified |  Tokyo to Melbourne. Definitely would not recommend. To start with we had to change our flights due to work which ultimately was our fault, but to do this it cost us a lot more to change than loose our flights all together. So we ended up paying a ridiculous amount for our flights which would have got others business class seats. Then to top it off, our return flight we weren't even sitting together or even near each other. For the price we paid, this is beyond ridiculous. Especially when we booked these flights over 6 months ago. We should have at least been sitting next to each other. The food was average and the entertainment that was listed was not what was showing on the plane. Will not be flying Qantas again!

### "Will not be booking again"
Sydney to Johannesburg. Tired, dated, and well worn premium economy cabin. The ceiling was dirty, TV screens small (same as most economy). I essentially paid twice the price for the flight for extra leg room, and hopefully marginally nicer food. Flight attendants were very friendly, but from experience Singapore, and New Zealand air offer substantially nicer Premium Economy experience. Will not be booking again if I can avoid it.

### "very disappointing"
Jakarta to Sydney. Very disappointing. When I went to the gate around 7pm, there's bad news, our flight was cancelled. Then we was told that our airplanes which is QF42 is at Singapore, not even on the way yet. After that, we got accomodation, but was waited from 8pm to 11pm just to get my baggage! I don't know what the problem is with this airline, the staff is really slow and we had already dropped our phone contact to get the update from this airlines but you know what? There's no news! Other peoples got their accomodation at 11pm, and I was waiting for my baggage until so I found my own accommodation. The flight is rescheduled to 7pm day after that, so I've arrived at 4pm and queue to check in until it 6pm, which is the boarding time. This airline is not worth it - very disappointing.

### "terrible customer service"
Sydney to Perth. Qantas Flight delayed in LAX and when arriving in Sydney for flight to Perth we had to be downgraded. Understandable due to previous delays and no Business Class available on the next flights. Now three months later and contacting Qantas 5 times for a refund due to downgrade, the refund has still not been processed. Customer Care is absolutely terrible online, had to make a telephone call and sit on hold for a hour. Emails sent, no reply. More emails sent, no reply. When a reply did come they asked for information I didn't have. I replied I didn't have that information, and no reply. Absolutely terrible customer service for thousands of dollars in flights and 6 years of frequent flyer membership.

### "very attentive and willing to help"
Sydney to Cairns Via Brisbane. During a week with wet weather, both flights departed and arrived with no issues. The Ground and Cabin Crew were amazing during both flights, very attentive and willing to help. IFE was great as new content kept me entertained and food and beverages were standard, no stand out in that department. Lastly, the Lounge visits before both flights were very good, I especially love the fresh look of the Brisbane Business Lounge.

### "best Customer Service I’ve experienced"
Cairns to Sydney Via Brisbane. The journey started off with a delay due to engineering problems. Though only one announcement was made, we finally departed roughly around 1345 local time. Once airborne, the Cabin Crew were absolutely amazing, by far the best Customer Service I’ve experienced during a domestic flight. The Customer Service Manager welcomed me back and even took my meal order before anyone else. This is a first, as it usually only happens on International flights. Outstanding Service, as I have noticed a decline over the last few months. IFE was slightly outdated but it kept me entertained. The plane arrived into Brisbane around 1545 with a shorter transit time of 1hr 15min until my next flight to Sydney, instead of my 2hr wait if the plane departed at Cairns on time. The onward flight to Sydney from Brisbane was very routine, on time departure/arrival, efficient boarding, lovely Cabin Crew and updated IFE. Great job Qantas.

### "Boeing 747 needs to be replaced"
Johannesburg to Sydney. I am a regular on Qantas and their A380 and Boeing 787-9. So in comparison the Boeing 747 serving this route needs to be replaced. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just old and looking and feeling its age. Everything else is up to QF standards but time to retire the Queen!

### "No idea why Qantas left Dubai"
Sydney to London return via Singapore This is a regular routing for me but the first time via Singapore since Qantas left Dubai. The flights were uneventful. On time at every stage. The F&B is fine if not exceptional. Flight crews were very friendly and efficient. Now the issue of switching to Singapore from Dubai. I'm in a minority that hates that move. Being a frequent flyer and having lounge access meant jumping off at Dubai, pass priority screening and straight up to the lounge. Say 7 mins from leaving the aircraft to being in the lounge on a good day. On the outbound this time the craft parked at Gate 24. To get to the lounge meant at least a 15 minute walk and the same back. So did not bother. On the inbound we were closer but the queues to get into the Singapore lounge were ridiculous so stepped into the BA lounge next door as a OneWorld flyer and freshened up there. No idea why Qantas left Dubai but it deprived loyal frequent flyers of some of the best lounges in the world. I know this is a first world problem but if you spend a lot of time on planes you need those lounges.

### "Free drinks appreciated"
Flew Qantas Airways from Melbourne to Canberra. Unfortunately there was a delay with the departure, but it wasn't too bad. The staff were very friendly and helpful. To me it is disappointing that passengers can no longer access any music on their flights except via their own device. But it seems I am in a minority! Free drinks were very much appreciated. The only food offered was cheese and biscuits, but that is not too bad considering it was such a short flight.

### "staff efficient and friendly."
Canberra to Melbourne. Check in was fine and the plane left and arrived on time. The staff were efficient and friendly. For a short flight the food on offer was OK. Cheese, dip and crackers. Coffee, tea, water and juice was also included. One thing that is a bit irritating with QANTAS is how often they change their' schedules and times! It's also a pity that there is no music available.

### "lunch time servings were miserable"
Sydney to Jakarta. Overall good but not great - As Australia's leading airline flying out of Australia's biggest Sydney Qantas needs to ensure it lives up to all the hype they publish about Food and Beverage. Seats and Entertainment were fine, crew while typically Australian (relaxed & informal) did not work well as a team. Food service was slow, portions tiny and Neil Perry should give some tips on how to plate up his dishes. To be fair the galley on the A330-200's are tiny and it's very hard to prepare the food, made worse given 28 business class pax have 1 toilet and this is cheek by jowl with the food prep area. This was a lunch time flight and servings were miserable, wine selection good. Qantas is well behind its competitors when it comes to F&B and high end service. Suggest to the CEO and the "Manager Customer Experience" take a few flights on your older aircraft in Bizz Class to less attractive destinations (say Jakarta and Manila) and then determine if your service offering is as great as you expect it to be - are your less experienced crew allocated to your B List Destinations?

### "no rights to use the second seat"
Denpasar to Melbourne. I asked for business class upgrade or next to me an empty seat in economy. I was explained none was available for me in Denpasar. But it was possibility not to sell seats next to me. I was brought in wheelchair by another kind Indonesian girl which was in striking contrast with Qantas crew. My seat was 6C. Two seats next to me were vacant - I was hoping relax my legs. Suddenly the crew relocated a girl from 5E in order to provide the double seat to the guy from 5F as apparently, he had longer legs. I tried to object but the flight attendant asked me whether I paid for that seat. I said No because it was not possible. She said you have no rights to use the second seat. Small aircraft, rows so close to each other, PAX could barely pass each other. I am a frequent flyer for 20+ years but was treated that badly and unfairly.

### "cabin crew were very efficient"
I flew with Qantas from San Francisco to Melbourne last week. It was a 15 hour long flight. I had a great experience. The flight was comfortable. The cabin crew were very efficient and warm, I want to give them 10 stars for the service. Food was delicious, especially the hot breakfast. Not only Australia's best, Qantas is one of the best airlines in the world. If any airlines can make one feel at home in the air, it's Qantas.

### "all our seats were re-arranged"
Qantas refused to refund our seats that we did not get. We were traveling as a family of 7 (2 grandparents from each side, my husband, my 4 year son and myself). We paid $30 per seat so that we could sit together and watch out for each other because some of the grandparents are in their 80's and do not speak English. However, when we checked in, we found out all our seats were re-arranged and in the worst possible way! Our 4 year old child was assigned in middle seat no where near his parents. In addition, the family was divided in half, separated by the service station. What bothers me the most is that there seem to be no obvious reason for them to re-arranged seats in such a devastating manner - it was not a full flight. I saw quite a few empty seats in the back. We spoke to the woman who was the head of the stewardess about the problem upon boarding, she said she would try to see what she could do, but she never got back to us at all. The seats were horrible seats for a few reason. First, our family of 7 were completely separated and my wife and I could not take care of the old and the young easily. Second, there were a lot of traffic and noise from crew and other passengers because they were next to the Service station.Third, we were always the last one to receive food service because of the location. This is a problem when we have 4 year old and 80 years old who were diabetics. In addition, the person in front of us had her seat reclined so far back, it was hard to get in and out of our seats to go to the bathroom. We as a family travel internationally twice a year for the last 10 years. This flight is probably the worst one we had ever been in.

### "an absolute nightmare"
Honolulu to Melbourne via Sydney. My recent trip back from Honolulu was and still is an absolute nightmare. Coming from someone who's travelled some of the lowest rated airlines in the world whilst backpacking around Asia my expectation of customer service is very low and I guess I had an expectation that if anything was to go wrong with Qantas we would be looked after, how was I wrong. We were notified that one of our bags was held up (despite providing both bags to Qantas at the same time at the domestic transfer lounge) and that the second bag would be delivered to us the following day and we would receive a phone call advising a 3 hour window our bag would be delivered. Not ideal as we had been away for a while but we sucked it up and figured it could be worse. The following day we received a call saying our bag had arrived and we would receive it between 3 and 6 pm. At 8pm we had not heard anything further and our bag still had not arrived, after calling Qantas baggage services and being on hold for 45 minutes (something that we are quite used to now) we were told the courier had arrived at 1pm but couldn't find our bag and they had no idea where it was. They suspected the wrong courier may have taken our bag and it would come back eventually and they would call us the following day. After not receiving a call the next day we called back and nothing had been received. The 3 staff were laughing at how ridiculous the situation was, something we took great offence to. 3 days later we called back for an update and asked kindly for some form of allowance for everyday items and advice around whether we could start replacing a few items. A member of staff thought this was quite reasonable and couldn't believe we weren't offered anything prior but after speaking to her manager she offered 2 x lounge passes. Absolutely useless, we have no plans to fly Qantas and there's no way they will help us in this situation. We of course declined this offer. Forward 21 days until our baggage would be considered lost we submitted a lost baggage claim for $3.9k - We were offered $2k as a final claim and asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and a form which relieves Qantas of any responsibility. I've been asked to do this despite 2 members of staff admitting it was 100% Qantas' fault. They couldn't believe couriers could just take whatever bags they wished and there was no need to sign in or out bags. We are told we are free to claim the additional through travel insurance something we have no intention to do. Qantas need to take responsibility for what they've done and simply reimburse the full replacement cost of our items.

### "prices are competitive"
London to Melbourne via Singapore. The seats are nice  by economy standards, the IFE has a lot to offer and drinks are served complimentary. I sense that meals became less tasty recently and they might want to consider getting back to previous quality. But it's still my best bet from Europe to Australia, partly because stop-overs in Singapore (or Dubai in the past) are timed well, enough to get a decent stretch and visit the butterfly garden and short enough to not waste time. I will choose Qantas given their prices are competitive (which they often are).

### "let down by operations"
We experienced 2-hour delays on QF23 Sydney to Bangkok and on the return sector QF38 Singapore to Melbourne. Flight tracking shows this is quite normal especially on the SYD-BKK sector. We arrived at BKK with 30 minutes to get through immigration and re-screening for connecting flight to Phuket. Incorrect information given to our travelling companion by Qantas check-in staff regarding uplifting of luggage in BKK and rechecking in for Phuket saw items purchased in SYD confiscated at re-screening. The checked-in luggage was in fact checked through to Phuket. On arrival to Phuket I found my luggage did not make it. On departure day, we received notification that QF38 was going to be delayed leaving SIN which meant missing our onward connection to NZ. As I was in Business Class, I was rescheduled with additional flight from MLB to SYD and then to NZ. My travelling companions fared worse. They were rescheduled to fly on a different airline the following day. This meant having to stay an extra night and extensive layover in MLB for their flight to NZ. On arrival, their luggage did not turn up. I feel very sorry for the crew having to explain and apologise for the delays and the inconvenience not of their doing. They were the saving grace in terms of their professionalism, friendliness and attentiveness on-board. The new business class seating on the A330 is a fantastic product however the food overall is slightly below par to that of other airlines. Overall, inflight service fantastic only to be let down by operations.

### "Inflight service was efficient"
Sydney to Brisbane return. Both flights were very smooth from beginning to end. As it was a return trip, online Check In made it very seamless as I only had carry on baggage. All my trips started off with a visit to the Business Lounge, with the Brisbane Business Lounge far superior than the Sydney location. Qantas really needs to update the space as it's getting very dated. Both flights departed on time, Inflight service was efficient with decent food and beverages and IFE was great with new content added. Keep it up Qantas.

### "kids meal nobody else wanted"
The flight on Qantas from Brisbane to LA (two times) and even my flight to Tokyo the food ran out of beef and chicken and I am always offered the left over kiddies meal. This is the 4th time with my good hard earned airfare I have been offered a kids meal nobody else wanted. This is terrible customer service and after speaking to a staff member from Qantas she doesn't seem to know what to do or care about it either. She said 'what do you expect me to do". If I went to a restaurant and paid for a nice meal and they offered me a left over kids meal, or a meal someone else has already touched, would this staff member be happy.

### "inflight service quick and efficient"
Sydney To Gold Coast. A fairly smooth flight, with Check In and Security quick and painless. Then it was a visit to the Business Lounge for some much needed breakfast. Priority Boarding was enforced, amazing to see great Customer service. The flight itself was very smooth, with inflight service quick and efficient and great content from IFE. Departure and Arrival was on schedule.

### "Such a terrible service"
I was flying with Qantas from Auckland to Singapore via Melbourne and then to Colombo with Emirates. When I arrived in Colombo found out my luggage wasn't there. After complaining Airport staff found out it was still in Melbourne and never transferred to my flight to Singapore QF35 and Emirates did not receive it from Qantas in Singapore. To make things worse they kept postponed sending my luggage day by day and finally, I received it after 5 days. By then I had to cancel my trip to Kandy, buy new clothes for me as all my clothes in the luggage, and also hire a vehicle go back again to Colombo airport to pick my luggage and go through all the trouble as Colombo airport service was terrible. I spent two more weeks in Sri Lanka and kind of expecting some sort of compensation or at least a letter of apology from Qantas. I have experienced a similar trouble with Kuwait Airways and they were very fast in service recovery. But nothing from Qantas. When I came back to Auckland I sent my complaint to Qantas and to my surprise they keep passing the responsibility to Emirates which I flew from Singapore to Colombo. How could Emirates pick up my luggage in Melbourne which was under Qantas? I flew into Melbourne with Qantas and flew out of Melbourne with Qantas and It was Qantas who is responsible for transfering my luggage from QF158 to QF35. Unfortunately, Qantas customer services do not admit it's their fault. They not only ruined my holidays but also not giving reasons why my luggage was not transferred and why it was delayed 5days. Such a terrible service I will never fly with horrible Qantas again.

### "behaviour was inappropriate"
Santiago to Sydney. The behaviour of the in-flight crew on both flights was inappropriate, for different reasons. On the flight to Santiago, I at one stage went back to the service area to request more water for us both, saying words to the effect of "Could I get more water for my partner and I?". The female attendant then queried, "Your mother?". No, my wife" I replied, at which she then said words along the lines of "We were wondering if you two were a couple, my colleague asked me what my gaydar told me about you". I found this statement to be inappropriately familiar and quite unprofessional. When I returned to my seat with the water, upon relating the exchange to my wife, the crew member suddenly appeared in front of us, saying "Are you talking about me?". Again, I found this behaviour odd and not a little bit creepy. Needless to say neither of us felt relaxed for the remainder of that flight. On the return flight, the female cabin member appeared put out by being asked for the slightest thing. We are not demanding passengers by any estimation, and are well aware that crew members have numerous duties to attend to. However, when the cabin member was walking past me, I attracted her attention and requested a drink for each of us. The reply was a deep and very audible sigh, followed by words to the effect of "I'm very busy at the moment you know, I have the pilots' dinner to organise". I stated that I understood, just when she got a chance. However, this "you're so putting me out" behaviour was repeated every time we asked for something or had a concern, such as when the lettuce was frozen solid, or when the pork was so tough I could not even cut it, let alone eat it (please see attached photos). On the subject of food, there is some expectation of edibility in all classes, let alone Business Class surely? I'm sure Neil Perry would not be pleased that his "signature menu" was so poorly executed. No one in that cabin had edible salad, all were frozen in one lump, and my "replacement" meal for the tough pork was beef that was not much better. I was left hungry as I could not eat either meal. When we requested some snacks due to being hungry, the male crew member said "Oh you want to keep the chocolate? Well, you are a growing girl". Again, to address a woman of 50 in such a way is not "cute" or "friendly", just odd. I would suggest that your staff need further training in not over-stepping the line between "friendly" and "creepy". In contrast, I have to say that your partner airline, Latam, which we flew for the remainder of our journey both ways, although not as "fancy" in terms of the seat/bed arrangement, were unfailingly friendly, helpful, and not once did we get the impression that we were an imposition to them, which was the impression we received from the crew member on the QANTAS flight. We have flown Business Class with Singapore, Lufthansa, and Emirates, and have been impressed and delighted every time with the helpfulness of the crew and the standard of the service and food. To be so disappointed, on two out of two occasions (congratulations, you have a perfect score), with our national carrier, was an unpleasant surprise, and has led us to the conclusion that, given any other choice, we will not fly QANTAS Business Class again.

### "definitely fly with Qantas again"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. We hadn't flown with Qantas for many years, but booked with them in Business Class for recent flights to and from Los Angeles. We were very happy with the aircraft, the crew, the food, and everything else connected with the flight, except (tongue in cheek because it's not really that important) - the female crew uniforms. There is nothing attractive about black, pink and orange! We will definitely fly with Qantas again.

### "simply do not appear to care"
Singapore to Perth. Loyalty means nothing. After spending a considerable amount of time searching and planning for a 'suitable and available' flight where frequent flyer points could be used, (which I might add is no easy assignment) I booked the ticket, only to be emailed 3 weeks later advising the flight times from Singapore to Perth have been changed, with a new arrival time of 00:50. As we are based in Adelaide, this change now means we will be sitting in the airport overnight until the first flight out at 06:45. (I am empathetic to flight time changes and it is what it is), however my real gripe is that Qantas Customer Service (which is somewhat of an oxymoron) just simply do not appear to care about their loyal customers. I asked if I had any alternative options and suggested I would be happy to change our return flight to Melbourne, however this was promptly rejected without hesitation. To top it off, when I sent an email to Qantas voicing my disappointment and suggesting maybe a long standing loyal Frequent Flyer member may be provided with alternative options, I received a generic email response simply stating: "Thank you for contacting Qantas Customer Care. For all pre-travel related queries, please contact our reservations team on 13 13 13. The team are available to assist 24 hours a day, 7 days a week". It would appear Loyalty and real Customer service is a thing of the past when it comes to Qantas.

### "the declining service"
Cairns to Brisbane. Customer service with a bitter attitude. After no entertainment for 15 minutes I approached the head stewardess and asked to change the entertainment - she immediately said you can’t be here the toilets are at the back (pointing over my head). I said I don’t want the toilets, just the entertainment changed as it finished 15min ago, she said no? I then had to proceed to the rear of the planeand ask the other three hostess who were having a snack if they could change the entertainment. The entertainment was changed. I fly Qantas 30-40 times per annum and unfortunately have come to accept the declining service, recently I was exposed to Virgin for the first time and was very impressed with the service in comparison to Qantas. The food option did not compare, but it’s about flying anyway. Now I am in a position where I walk away from 9000 lifetime status points and start again with virgin for the experience of better service.

### "excellent service"
Sydney to Brisbane. Best Airline. Excellent service. No worrying about purchasing extra luggage it's included in the price. Free Food on board. Free entertainment. Definitely would recommend to others. Definitely I will be continuing to use Qantas!

### "miss connecting flight"
Wagga to Adelaide via Sydney. Flight out of Wagga delayed by 30 minutes caused me to miss connecting flight. To top it off flight stewards rocked up after we where supposed to be boarding. Took off from Sydney at the time I should have been walking in the door at home. This is the second time in 3 months I have travelled with Qantas and the second time this has happened.

### "Plane felt really old and dated"
Sydney to Hong Kong with Qantas. Business Class checkin queue was long and slow - over 10 groups in the queue, and only 3 counters open (staffing issue?). Staff member was really nice though. Seat configuration doesn't offer any privacy for solo travellers: 2-3-2 in bottom deck and 2-2 in top deck. Plane felt really old and dated. The TV screen was tiny and movie selection very limited for a 9hr flight. Way below par compared to Cathay and Emirates. The two attendants looking after the top deck were mixed - one gentleman was attentive and polite whilst the other lady didn;t really seem like she wanted to be there at all. Main course was nice (had the Barramundi) but the second course before landing was just a small bowl of overly salted rice.

### "excellent and professional service"
Flew Sydney to Brisbane. Best Airline - Service was great - No worries of buying extra luggage, it's all included in the price - free food on board - free entertainment - definitely recommend Qantas- I will be flying Qantas from now on. Thank you Qantas for your excellent and professional service.

### "an excellent employee"
Brisbane to Singapore. I just want to write a review to thank an excellent employee of Qantas airways. This morning I arrived in Brisbane only to find out my third party booking had provided me with incorrect times for my flights, causing a 25 hour layover and having me arrive home a day late (meaning I would miss the wedding I was to fly home for - cue absolute public melt down!). Phil helped me for over an hour in amending this, reassuring me and talking me through everything that needed to be done alongside chatting with the third party to help rearrange my flights with hardly any time to spare. A true gem who made my whole morning a lot easier than it was turning out to be.

### "totally unimpressed"
Melbourne to Auckland. I know Emirates are combined with Qantas now, but wow what a downgrade in quality of airship. I’m used to a nice clean, quiet plane to travel in that’s why I choose Emirates, but both ways on our return trip as Emirates don’t fly Trans Tasman anymore, the Qantas plane was dirty, no aircon at the start, running out of food choices by the time the stewards arrive to us. I will be looking to other airlines to travel with in future, totally unimpressed.

### "I would definitely recommend"
Perth to Singapore. Not my first time flying Qantas, but it has been a long time, so I was interested to see how much had changed. The aircraft was pleasantly clean and cabin crew were warm and friendly when boarding the aircraft. The seat had a pillow and a blanket which was nice to see, however because this was a day flight, I stored them in the overhead locker for the duration. The flight left slightly late, and  we ended up arriving slightly late into Singapore. The in-flight entertainment was in the form of personal iPad devices with the Qantas Entertainment App which allows you to select a large variety of films, TV series, audio books and more. I must say that this is one of the best in-flight entertainment systems in an economy cabin that I have seen. The iPad is much more responsive than other seat-mounted sets which get outdated very quickly. I was able to watch 3 films on the flight, all in good quality. The headsets they hand out leave a lot to be desired but they do suffice. (If you have your own, bring them as they'll fit the iPad). My meal was booked online before the flight so it was promptly brought out and was very tasty, and the ice cream and chocolate bar later in the flight were a very nice touch. The crew also kept drinks filled and kept offering tea/coffee which was very good to see and was appreciated. This route is competitive from other airlines, and I think Qantas will give them a run for their money. I would definitely recommend!

### "relaxed and friendly"
Sydney to Perth. Check in, albeit faulty with bags at first, was very smooth. Flight left and arrived on time. The aircraft was very well maintained and the Inflight entertainment was remarkable. Breakfast was hot and fresh. The best part of this flight was the crew who were very relaxed and friendly. They know how to look after their customers with genuine courtesy. I should however note that the safety demonstration was complicated to follow because the audio did not match the demonstration being shown manually.

### "reason not to fly Qantas"
Sydney to London via Dubai / Moscow. Be careful with booking with Qantas, you may think you are booking a flight with the standard baggage allowances etc because you are booking via their website, but this is not so, as I learned. If your flight is a code share, then you are receive the same baggage allowance, if the flight (even though booked on the Qantas website as part of the ticket route) does not share also a Qantas flight number - then you are open to whole new mess. British Airways Baggage Allowance 23kgs. Qantas Baggage Allowance 30kgs. All the same trip, all booked through Qantas online, and not one word of pre-warning or advisement shared at the time of making the booking. In-fact when I looked at the online ticket confirmation, no mention of baggage allowance is made at all. If you do call to check, (hold for over 1 hour to talk to a Qantas rep), you then get advised, no, nothing they can do, unless you wish to cancel your ticket and re-book elsewhere. Another reason not to fly Qantas.

### "free Wi-Fi was offered"
Cairns to Sydney. The aircraft felt new, great lighting and seats on this flight compared to the way up from Sydney to Cairns. Online check-in was a breeze and ground staff were fantastic. The flight was smooth and inflight entertainment was available on own device via the Qantas app with a decent selection of content. What was great was that free Wi-Fi was offered throughout the whole flight, this touch of service really elevated the whole flying experience. Snack served on board was small but did its job on a short flight.

### "not able to find a solution"
Brisbane to Auckland. After a problem with the ticket It was impossible to contact them by phone or email. At the airport even with a very simple problem, like changing the name on the ticket, they were not able to find a solution or even trying to help a customer. Employees so rude with terrible service.

### "a bit hit and miss"
Flight from Sydney to Cairns with Qantas was a bit hit and miss. The online self check-in was easy and flight boarding was a breeze. The aircraft was an older 737 and its age was showing when entering the plane, the cabin, seats and carpet felt old and worn out. Staff on board were attentive and friendly and the snack served was small but tasty. In flight entertainment was offered in the form of Qantas App allowing streaming of a pretty decent selection of content to personal devices.

### "Never again will I fly Qantas"
Sydney to Beijing. I paid extra for legroom. The seat I was assigned did not recline though, it was broken. The flight was full and there was nowhere to move to sat I had to sit upright for 12.5 hour flight. In addition, the aircraft was really old and grotty. The seat back screen was tiny and the sound only worked in one earpiece. I complained to the cabin crew and they said they would arrange compensation but nothing happened. I complained to Qantas by email but no response. Never again will I fly Qantas.

### "worst customer service"
Melbourne to Singapore. Qantas has the worst customer service. There were numerous errors in our Emirates booking and they don't admit their mistakes. Their staff at the airport are very disrespectful and arrogant. Never recommend this airline again!

### "never trust Qantas again"
Singapore to London Heathrow. My son was booked to fly 2330 August 5th with Qantas unaccompanied minor service. The flight was delayed, but ground crew told my aunt the flight had left, that she could go home. In the end, the flight was delayed for more than 24 hours, but Qantas ground crew did not contact any relatives, despite having all the numbers. In the end, my aunt was contacted by a worried airport staff member. The flight tracker was not accurately updated for several hours so none of us were aware the flight had not left. Very dangerous- recommend do not book Qantas UM for your child! Singapore Airlines is more expensive, but a whole better class of service. Will never trust Qantas again. Promised full investigation but highly sceptical this will take place

### "avoid the miserable 737"
Not Verified |  I go from Sydney to Auckland frequently (6 trips a year each way) & avoid the miserable 737 Qantas flights commonly used on this route. The A330-200 flights I choose instead are almost always between 30 minutes to 2 hours late departing in both directions "due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft". About time Qantas sorted this out. Even if they take off on time they invariably arrive late "due to Sydney air traffic control" which is probably true. Good features of these trips include a decent meal service (particularly the "salad" option) although not as good as the now discontinued Emirates Syd-Akl flights meal service which was a "blast from the past" in terms of quality & quantity. Seats newish and OK for a 3 hour flight but several A330-200 planes have now got no IFE screens. Instead you get given an ipad which might work some of the time on Wi-Fi. Of more concern is a shiny silver metal bracket on the seatback in front of you apparently designed both to hold the ipad in position during flight but also on takeoff & landing clearly could impale itself in your forehead in any kind of emergency braking situation. So unsafe. On some flights you are told to leave the I-pad in position on the seatback (safer) and on other flights you are told to remove it (exposing the bracket) on takeoff & landing.

### "was upgraded to business class"
Brisbane to Christchurch return. Check-in easy. As am Gold Frequent Flyer, was given a priority boarding card. For the first time ever, the card worked, was given priority access at security, the attendant even stopped the line and slotted me in front. The Qantas Lounge at Brisbane International is welcoming and comfortable. While lined up to board, a message on my phone indicated that I was upgraded to business class, the first time in 12 years of flying with Qantas. A nice touch to a great flight. At Christchurch Airport, off the plane and out the front door of the airport in 15 minutes. Can’t beat that. The return flight was uneventful, row 4, front of economy was dressed up like premium economy on the bigger jets, including pillows and noise cancelling headphones. Only let down for this entire trip was the 40 minute wait for bags at Brisbane International.

### "service was ok but not extraordinary"
QF2 London Heathrow to Singapore in business. Uneventful flight. The service was ok but not extraordinary. Pre-dinner drinks are apparently not offered anymore. Quick meal service. The food was bland, but maybe I have chosen the wrong option. QF36 in premium economy. The food was better than the previous leg in business. The premium economy seat is fine except when the passenger in front of you puts his seatback in the sleeping position. There is no decent way to get out of your seat. The passenger in the middle seat who wants to get out will have to do some gymnastics to get out of the seat. Strange situation with the seat allocation. I had the bulk seat 24F and the day I had to travel this disappeared from my seat listing. Calling Qantas I was told I had to be reseated because an infant was booked in that seat. Well, as you may guess there was no infant in the seat or using the bassinet. Neither was the passenger who took my seat related to the other passengers in the same row. I don't mind to be reseated if this seat would have been used for an infant, but I do not want to get incorrect information if this is not the case. This is unprofessional behaviour of the airline towards their top tier travellers.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Travelled from London Heathrow to Sydney with my 11 year old daughter. Flight was very busy and was assigned seats 74 A & B. The seats were very comfortable with lots of leg room. The under seat foot net was again very comfortable and allowed me to get a good nights sleep. The crew were very friendly and helpful (on both legs). The only issue I had was that the headset plus was inside the left arm rest, this kept on being dislodged when I moved around in the seat. I would happily travel with Qantas again, and have recommended them to friends and family.

### "the overall flight experience was amazing"
Brisbane to Sydney. A very smooth journey with some amazing Cabin Crew. I was greeted very well during the boarding process, and take off was on schedule compared to my previous flight. The inflight service offered a lunch service with plenty of beverage variety. IFE was slightly limited though the flight was just over an hour long, so it was adequate. The Crew stood out most from recent memory. They were beyond friendly, great to chat with and incredibly engaging. Touch down in Sydney was bumpy because of strong winds and the overall flight experience was amazing.

### "issue with deplaning"
Sydney To Brisbane. Everything started off fine, from Check-In to Lounge access and boarding. From there, it was a 30 minute delay because of baggage and cargo being loaded and the finalisation of paperwork. I don't understand why there are so many delays when they operate a wide body aircraft on domestic routes, something always come unhinged. The onboard service was good but it did not make up for the unnecessary delay. IFE was limited, not the best content by past experience. Once we landed into Brisbane, there was another issue with deplaning as we were delayed by another 10 minutes because the pilot couldn't park appropriately. By this time you can definitely tell a large number of passengers were getting irritated by the simple fact a trained pilot couldn't park a plane properly. I will fly Qantas, but if they can't sufficiently fly an A330 for domestic routes without consistency in schedule, just stick to the 737 as it's so much better this way plus it will free up a wide body aircraft for International routes.

### "disappointed with lunch"
Travelled on Qantas business class on 11/7/18 departed 1210pm from Melbourne to Brisbane. Dissatisfied and disappointed with lunch meal selection. The selection is either a potato leek soup, a sandwich or a salad that I think is not appropriate for substantial lunch. The reply I received from Qantas was also inadequate and dismissive. The reply was full of the airline promising high quality and variety of food and beverage selection but unfortunately they failed to deliver from my personal experience. I am wondering what they offer in their economy class for lunch if I did not travel in business class. Recently the airline has removed all music from IFE on tv screen or IFE app even on audio page still showing extensive selection of CD library from latest pop , jazz and rock to classic albums are available. So be prepared you need to BYO your music. Only Podcasts, talking business and kids audio books are available if you are interested in. Cabin staff has also advised no more Movie will be provided from drop down screen on 737 aircraft. So please download the App before you travel especially if you travel from overseas.

### "Very bad experience"
Not Verified |  Canberra to Tamworth via Sydney. Qantas decided to waste 40min in Canberra this morning, making the arrival in Sydney 40min late. The staff on the Canberra to Sydney plane asked me to get of first and run to gate 1 where ground staff had been advised that i was coming. After waiting several minutes for my bag that was tagged premium hand luggage i ran to gate 1 only to be told that the flight had closed 8 minutes ago. They booked me on the 12.30pm flight and said bad luck, cant do anything else. When asked about a lounge pass the reply was no! Very bad experience.

### "surprisingly little legroom"
Perth to Brisbane. This was the only flight Qantas offered to BNE on a widebody aircraft (all the other direct flights were on a 737) so I opted for this red-eye flight to Brisbane. After terrific service from the ground crew, and a short delay boarding, I was surprised to see a lack of seat back TV screens onboard, but an iPad with a variety of audio and video entertainment. The meal service was a snack, and rather than a breakfast being served prior to landing, only bottled water was provided. The seat had surprisingly little legroom. Crew on this sector were all terrific. Immaculate service, and I would recommend.

### "a wonderful flight"
Brisbane to Adelaide. Terrific ground service, and a wonderful cabin crew on 2.5hr flight to Adelaide. Dinner service was wonderful, with a choice of Pork Curry with complimentary beer and wine. However, the aircraft itself was an ancient 737-800 from the old generation, with drop-down LCD screens that were starting to show their age. Despite this, it was a wonderful flight.

### "new seats are comfortable"
Sydney to Osaka on a refurbished A330-300. Due to mechanical fault the flight was delayed 5 hours with Qantas giving regular updates. Due to this, arrival in Osaka was in the middle of the night with no option of public transport into the city. Qantas arranged several buses to varying locations for passengers. Service onboard was very good, including staff dealing very well with a difficult situation of an arguing couple. The new entertainment system worked very well. The new seats are comfortable, although the foot nest is awkward. A proper folding down foot rest would have been much better. It would have been good to have received an amenity kit on the return flight.

### "polite and friendly to a fault crews"
It was hard to fault this short haul flight with Qantas. The terminal at SYD is spacious with easy self-service bag drop and helpful staff if anything goes wrong. There are many shops, cafes and facilities right up to the gates. Boarding was efficient and on-time both on our outbound and return flights. The real gem of these flights were the polite and friendly to a fault crews who greeted each passenger with warmth and by name on arrival. During the flight despite it being only a short 1 hour trip, the crew were professional and delivered a snack and drinks service which was very tasty and very much appreciated. The whole process went smoothly from beginning to end and you can't really ask for much more. Qantas' short haul domestic product is certainly worth it over cheaper rivals, especially if you have checked luggage which is included in the ticket price. A great experience.

### "Could not fault them"
So impressed with Qantas. Could not fault them. Not only is their safety clearly the best in the world, their service was incredible. The pilots took the time to say farewell to the passengers. That’s never happened on Virgin that my employer used to book me on. Will be flying Qantas from now on.

### "were a little unsatisfied"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. We were a little unsatisfied with our recent trip from Melbourne to Los Angeles. The seats and entertainment were okay but the food served was very unpleasant. For example, they served a snack in the middle of the flight that was a samosa with gooey cheese and ham. Unsatisfactory food on a 15 hour flight made the trip unpleasant.

### "staff were bored with their jobs"
Johannesburg to Sydney. Having paid $4500 for business class, I was expecting the best service and food. Instead firstly, no wet towels when you board or when you wake up. Side by side seating, so you had climb over the neighbour's legs. Old, noisy as hell 747 jumbo. Small TV screen. The menu was on a piece of A4 paper with copying marks on it. No choice of wines. Red or white, Sir! Salad was four tiny pieces of lettuce leaf and a dressing. Main meal Ok but not outstanding. I asked for cheese and I was expecting a presentation board. Instead I got one small piece of cheddar, one small piece of Brie, three small crackers and three grapes! I had to ask for drinks. The staff were bored with their jobs and not willing to keep checking on you.

### "try to steer clear of Qantas"
Singapore to Melbourne. After a long flight, Rome-IST-SIN, on Turkish Airlines which was very good and especially the food and inflight service, to then embark on OF 0038 for Melbourne and was offered a "Calzone" which was a small bun filled with nothing like a Calzone, and an ice-cream on a stick, during flight only a banana and then for breakfast a small selection of fruit or a terrible Omelette, not even a bread roll, bad weak coffee, just disgusting. Qantas inflight service has improved a little but not compared to other International Companies. Shameful. Then because of fog in Melbourne, we were unable to land, diverted to Sydney and finally back to Melbourne 5 hours late, not the fault of Qantas but all we were offered was a shortbread biscuit, dry cracker with dip and a small bottle of water. Terrible, Once again I will try to steer clear of Qantas flights in the future.

### "was very impressed"
Sydney To Gold Coast. Check-In and security was smooth, afterwards I headed off to the Qantas Club to relax before departure. I was well greeted during boarding and was very impressed with the customer service. IFE was a bit limited, though the new content was a plus.Overall, the flight was very smooth sailing from take off, refreshment service and touch down.

### "Pathetic beyond belief"
Johannesburg to Sydney. Qantas has a huge problem staffing their call centres, desks, help-chat lines, and website. First be aware, that if you are using a browser that is not Internet explorer it does not work. Firefox does not work. If you try to access their online chat, it comes back they are too busy. There is no wait line. If you try to call it is a good 30 minute wait, at least. To save money the airline has clearly cut back on essential website design, and staffing needed to help customers. In fact there is no phone number even listed on their website that I could locate. Folks we are talking about a seriously deficient airline, unable and unwilling to assist customers. They do this, even though they charge extra for helping! So even making money charging for help, they cant be bothered. Pathetic beyond belief.

### "The seats were terrible"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Melbourne. Rung up customer services prior to my trip to find out if my plane came with movies at the back of the seat or if I had to provide my own tablet as it was not very clear on their website. This was a simple quick question that wasn't a security risk, however the customer service person grilled me with many questions firstly my eticket, name, age, address, phone number, where I was going to, day etc. All she needed was my eticket number to check on that particular aircraft. All I wanted was to know if I needed to carry my tablet by hand and download the app. It was getting thoroughly annoying with all the questions that were not relevant so I asked for a supervisor. She would not put me through to someone unless I answered all questions. This really put my attitude towards Qantas at a 1/10 even before the flight. After over 10 minutes on the phone, I was finally told that I had movies. After all that, a positive outcome. Now the actual flight: Staff on the flight were very friendly and obliging. The seats were terrible, the tiniest I have come across. The seat in front of me was pretty much at my knees and I'm only 5.7". Now the trays for food, you couldn't even lay these flat, they are situated too low on the backs of the seats. So the meal was very uncomfortable. The food was very nice and a good size. However, even though a few good points, seat comfort is the most important and the attitude of the staff member prior to my flight has put me off every travelling Qantas again. I only took this flight (one way Auckland to Melbourne) as it was the earliest in the morning other than Virgin alliance with Air NZ and I didn't want to fly Virgin due to no meals and no entertainment. However the alliance between Virgin and Air NZ is about to end, so I look forward to flying both ways on Air NZ in the future.

### "is a shambolic airline"
Sydney to Bangkok 14 June. Having flown with the domestic arm of Qantas 36 hours before on what could only be laughable such was the pathetic organization, an urgent need to fly to Bangkok  which meant the first available flight ex Syd and given I had domestic connections, Qantas was the only choice. Flight departure delayed and no information forthcoming as to why. Eventually informed we would be boarding late due to the 'late arrival'. Aircraft departs gate , Capt. advises technical problem and we return to gate only. Pax sat there waiting, waiting. Finally departed 2 hours late adding more stress to our already stressed circumstances. We were in Row 45 and whilst seated there observing the young female cabin crew member seated at the exit adjacent to us, having a wonderful conversation to 2 passengers also in row 45 seats A & B - only to hear the cabin crew member offer as soon as the seat belt sign went off, a drink (alcoholic) in real glasses - not the plastic served to other members in cattle class - whilst we looked on and waited (remembering we already had departed / waited 2 hours late) for what appears to be Qantas' mandatory 2 hours waiting time before they start serving drinks / meals after take off. This is a shambolic airline and given the circumstances behind the reason for travel, left us with a very sour taste in our mouth.

### "to provide boarding passes"
I had a flight delayed and was re-routed through San Francisco (this is a very common occurrence - almost an art form in that first world country with a third world airlines known as the USA). The airline refused to provide boarding passes for the connecting flight as they are contracted to do. As such you cannot get through that pasenger - friendly organisation known as the TSA to get a boarding pass because Qantas deserts the check-in early. So I stood there for 45 min watching my international connection board and depart. This is the second time Qantas has done this to me. No offer of a hotel, no attempt to address this serial problem. So if you want to get out of the USA use one carrier. OneWorld is a con - its all talk but doesn't happen, Qantas is so full they don't care.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Auckland to Brisbane. I used to always get acknowledged as a Frequent Flyer Gold member when flying but in the last six + flights I’ve had with Qantas from Australia to New Zealand and back I’ve noticed I’m not acknowledged anymore. It must only be Platinum members flying economy. That’s all good however you would also give me an express lane card to use when landing in Brisbane at night so I thought I’d mention that there isn’t an express lane at night so when I saw you giving them to Qantas frequent flyers I had to giggle imagining when they got off the plane. I can only imagine they are Platinum and above because I don’t get them anymore or get welcomed onto the plane like I used to. I flew last night and noticed a lady acknowledged the gentlemen in front of me then moved to my chair and I thought I’m getting welcomed back. She stopped, looked at me then moved to another man who was supposed to sit next to me but decided he wanted to move to an empty row for the space and went to him. Maybe I don’t look like a frequent flyer which is ok too. Then the manager comes through acknowledges the man in front, stops by me and kept moving. I thought maybe he also forgot the man who moved too. Qantas I only stuck with you because I would fly Emirates and you give me so many reasons to ditch you.

### "Uneventful smooth flight"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Uneventful smooth flight, departed and arrived on time. Sweet biscuits for afternoon tea were very nice. Flight attendants were fine. Bag arrived quickly on the carousel.

### "quality has slipped so far"
Melbourne to Brisbane. I was on a codeshare flight. My shock was at the airport when I found I’d been downgraded to economy. That I could live with but then apparently the weather in Melbourne caused a 2.5 hr delay taking off. Other airlines flights were not delayed, they took us for fools buying this lie. When we finally boarded the crew were miserable and surly. The lunch was awful. Choice of a Small ham sandwich or a few tiny morsels of chicken with a couple of wedges. A happy meal is bigger. The service and quality has slipped so far. Sad to see this one great airline slip so far. There were a few movies/TV shows on the back of seat screens. There was rubbish in the seat pocket in front and we don’t even get the magazine any more.

### "Incredibly disappointed"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. Incredibly disappointed with the lack of professionalism shown by Qantas staff today in handling flight cancellations due to weather. My flight was schedule to leave at 18:35 and was cancelled at 08:50 that day. However, I was not notified. When I got to the airport to check in I was told I would be put on the last flight that left at 20:45. I asked why I had received no notification and was told that they had attempted to call me earlier that day. I had missed calls from a private number but no voicemail and was expected to understand that as my formal notice of cancellation. At my departure airport I explained that getting into my home city 2.5 hours later would leave me stranded at the airport as the person picking me up was unable to do so at such a later hour and I was unable to arrange an alternate without more notice. I was told I would receive a cab charge to assist me and compensate for the inconvenience. When I got to Sydney I was denied any assistance and was told I was just one of the thousands of people that had been stranded that day.

### "had the best flight"
Myself and my work colleagues had the best flight thanks to the cabin crew. In particular was a stewardess and other crew that looked after us at the rear end of the plane. We flew from Sydney to Perth on QF571 and crew were humourous, entertaining and could not do enough for us. We had such fun on the flight that we even got selfies with them. I have been telling all my friends about this trip.

### "Very unpleasant flight"
Johannesburg to Sydney. Very unpleasant flight which started with me being bumped off my pre booked bulkhead seat. Only 300ml of water provided for a 12 hour flight, poor service, dirty toilets and insufficient hot meals for breakfast, this for passengers in the front of economy which get served first. Very expensive economy flight and I could have flown to Europe from Australia on a decent Asian or Middle Eastern airline for half the cost of the Qantas flight.

### "That 'lunch' was pathetic"
Flew Brisbane to Melbourne. Departed and arrived essentially, on time. Smooth flight. Flight attendants were fine. I am loyal to Qantas, but 'lunch' was either pistachio and cranberry (I'm allergic) balls or soy chips, which numbered about 7. The flight was from 11am to 1.20pm. That 'lunch' was pathetic. I wasn't expecting a smorgasbord, but something more would have been appreciated.

### "Excellent flight"
Melbourne to Auckland. Excellent flight, on time departure out of Melbourne. I quite like the new look of the cabin, black quilted pattern seats which were reasonably comfortable. The crew were very friendly and pleasant. This was the first time I'd ordered a vegan meal due to a change in my dietary requirements, I was very surprised how good the meal was, ratatouille with couscous accompanied by a nice glass of Ozzy red. It was a great touch when the crew came through with ice cream which of course I took and gave it to my daughter. I managed to take in two movies from the entertainment options. We got into Auckland 20 minutes early, a good end to a great flight.

### "staff were very cheerful"
I enjoyed the flight from Sydney to Melbourne. It departed and arrived on time. The staff were very cheerful and efficient. The dinner served was not large (roast chicken), but fine for a short flight. The wine was excellent. There was no seat back video screens but that did not matter for such a short flight.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
Unfortunately the trip from Melbourne to Sydney was delayed by over 30 minutes. Apart from that it was a very enjoyable flight. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The dinner (salad) was very tasty and it's always nice to have free drinks. Seat back screens were a pleasant surprise as well.

### "cabin crew very friendly"
Townsville to Brisbane may 14. Easy check in & boarding pass on mobile phone Townsville airport very quick through security check. Seat 28C near back of plane prefered seating & whole row to myself again a bonus on the return flight again. Boarded via stairs from tarmac at back of plane. This was a flight were meal served lunch & was served Very quick after take off. Gluten free  meal was the best burger I have tasted & generous size in fact very filling. The cabin crew very friendly & noticed on this flight were very helpful & generous with their time with children travelling unaccompanied.

### "Very good flight"
Brisbane to Townsville May 10. Check in & boarding pass by mobile phone & as only took hand luggage very quick through security check. Seat 28C & had the whole row which is always a bonus. This flight stated did not offer Gluten Free Meal but cabin crew if ask will seem to always have Gluten free biscuits or Rice crackers. Very good flight & arrived on time

### "extra seat room/aisle space"
Melbourne to Auckland. Revamped cabin like cabin on Boeing 787 is really great. The new features like excellent IFE, foot net really enhanced the flight. My seat 56F had extra seat room/aisle space because my row was 2-3-2 rather than 2-4-2, and  I could put luggage under seat in front of missing seat. The seat pitch has improved too. Food was very disappointing as portions were too small. But flight supervisor kindly offered me extra round of lunch. All flight attendants were quite courteous.

### "economy seats are comfortable"
The crew provide service with an Australian touch and combined with excellent in flight safety video conveys the spirit of Australia. The new economy seats are comfortable with adjustable headrests, one thing to note is the absence of a hand held controller; rather everything is controlled via the very responsive touch screen. I was very impressed with the catering on board, they served a garlic bread with dinner and a pork stir fry as the main with a chocolate cake for dessert and a great variety of alcoholic beverages on offer including a sparkling from Jacob's Creek. They provided a water bottle before the meal service but no hot towels throughout the flight. The bathroom used was clean throughout the flight, but they did not offer any amenity such as toothbrush/toothpaste as on Singapore Airlines. Try to avoid transferring from an international flight to the domestic terminal in Sydney if possible, it is to put it mildly not a pleasant process.

### "Excellent experience"
Excellent experience. Classic aircraft with an experienced friendly and hard working crew. I was lucky to get row 5 which is the only single seat row in mostly 2-3-2 configuration. Being in the middle seat of a 3 would’ve been not great. My experience from the lounge to luggage was 5 star. Great food and entertainment options, great seat and top notch service. The 747 is my favorite aircraft to fly and this seamless journey made for a perfect trip. I've heard Qantas was slipping lately but not on this occasion in the least.

### "flights will not be with Qantas"
Our Qantas flight from Sydney to Honolulu was cancelled on the morning of departure. We were given a Jetstar flight the next day. This left us a day short of holiday time and out of pocket for a night’s accommodation. When I got back I rang Qantas Customer Care (be wary about the last word as there is no Care) I was told “it is not our problem, you should have insurance”. The travel agent tried to help but got the same run around. As Qantas caused the problem I think Qantas should help with some sort of recompense. I give Qantas 8 out of 10 for a phone call and not an email when they cancelled the flight, but they lose that by the lack of response now. We are not frequent flyers but any future flights will not be with Qantas unless we get some answers.

### "enjoyable early evening flight"
An enjoyable early evening flight from Adelaide to Melbourne with Qantas Airways. Check in was easy and the flight left on time. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They also served a small but very tasty meal. IFE had no seat back screens but that didn't matter for such a short flight.

### "friendly and helpful"
Melbourne to Adelaide. I enjoyed my late afternoon flight. Check in was easy. The service was friendly and helpful. The food was fine for such a short flight and i appreciated the free drinks. It was a nice surprise when i was offered another beer.

### "was a pretty decent trip"
I recently flew with Qantas on the new QF9 route from Melbourne to London via Perth. It was a pretty decent trip and I'd now prefer travelling on this route rather than have a stopover in Singapore or in Dubai. The staff on both sectors were so friendly and nothing was too much effort at all. I'd ask them to fill my water bottle up and it would be no hassle. The in flight entertainment was pretty sufficient. I found some decent movies and TV shows on there. The food was the highlight, to be honest. I love it how they offer you three choices for the main meal, and one of them was a vegetarian option. Also, they won't stop offering food for the remainder of the flight. I found the seat was comfy, and the pillows were better. I found it was relatively easier to sleep on this plane than an A380. Not to mention, the plane itself was pressurised better.

### "great experience"
Kansai to Sydney. Great experience flying with Qantas from Osaka to Sydney in Business class. This plane features brand new cabins with very comfortable and private seats in business class and overall a stylish cabin. Service onboard was fantastic. Very friendly cabin crew, they offered to refill drinks, made our beds, got me a coffee last minute before landing etc. Food and drinks also very good. Inflight entertainment system was great too with a big selection of films and a nice, responsive touch screen. The only negative comment would be that if travelling with a partner, you're separated by a barrier which you can't lower so you can't really see each other or talk while seated. I can't really comment on value for money as this was a reward flight.

### "horrendous experience"
Shocked and disappointed at the horrendous experience flying with from Los Angeles to Sydney on 18 May 2018. Once the inflight dinner service started I was approached by flight attendant who rudely asked "do you want dinner? I responded "yes please, what are the options? And her answer was "read your menu! even though I had no idea a menu was stuck in my seat pocket. She then went on to put my food in front of me as well as the lovely couple sitting next to me. During the whole flight every time she served us she was impolite, impatient and almost aggressive. Not once did she smile or even tried to be remotely interested in our comfort. I have never felt so uncomfortable during a flight. I had planned on putting in a complaint with QANTAS once I arrived home but luckily I ran into a customer service manager whilst purchasing duty free items in Sydney. I explained the situation and he was apologetic and advised he would personally see to it that someone from head office contact me to discuss the issue. To date I've not had any communication from QANTAS and am not holding my breath. On another note, the food served during the flight was disgusting. Very disappointed to see QANTAS has completely lost the quality and service they once had. I will never fly with them again after this experience.

### "A330 is very comfortable"
Honolulu Sydney was quite good. Despite cost cutting (no hot towels) the seat, food and service were excellent. A330 is very comfortable, the food was very good and the attendants were friendly and efficient. Sydney to Melbourne was operated by a dirty, dingy 737 out of a dirty terminal after a wait in a dirty dingy lounge. The flight attendant did a wonderful job all by himself serving a full cabin in a short time. I actually felt bad for how hard he had to work serving a horrible meal in a filthy aircraft badly in need of refurbishment. The bathroom was dirty.The seats were dirty and worn.I needed a shower after 5hr experience. I can only imagine how bad economy was on this sector.

### "Customer experience is poor"
Paid $520 for flight to NZ for 4 days from Sydney to Auckland. Tiny aircraft and overloaded overhead baggage compartments. Frequent flyer with multiple airlines and Qantas is experiencing a degradation of service and and quality. The size of bags customers are allowed to board with are over sized, people knock into you cos of trying to cart huge bags down the aisle. Customer experience is poor. Tiny seats and dated Boeing. Needs an upgrade.

### "there were not individual TVs"
I was flying from Perth to Adelaide, a three hour flight. Upon getting to the airport I printed my ticket and went to check my luggage. However before doing so I asked the Qantas staff at check in to check my ticket and to tell me if there would be individual entertainment (TVs) on this flight. They said there were. I told them that I had asked this question to the Qantas personnel in Sydney two weeks earlier and they had told me the same thing on a five hour flight from Sydney to Perth and they had been wrong. I specifically asked that they be sure as I would check my computer if that was the case. They told me that they were sure there would be individual TVs for all passengers on this flight. Needless to say there were not. The second flight in a row, with Qantas, within two weeks of each other, to or from Perth where they had specifically told me that there would be individual entertainment for passengers and there was not. Perth is a very isolated city. Every flight to or from Perth to the other major Australian cities takes a minimum of three hours. It is not unreasonable to believe that in asking, specifically, about in-flight entertainment one should be told up-front and accurately what type of flight they should expect. This is below par for an airline who sells itself as a premium airline in Australia.

### "seats seemed smaller and more cramped"
I booked a ticket via American Airlines for Qantas flights for a trip. I was flying from Cairns through Brisbane and Los Angeles to my final destination, San Diego. The flights were OK, nothing to rave about. The seats seemed smaller and more cramped other international flights I had taken. The food was too salty and lacked texture, but otherwise was fine. The attendants were kind and polite but a bit too strict when I asked for a drink ("Sir, you cannot have two drinks at the same time" when I had about 1 or 2 sips in the bottom of the dinky cup, which I effortlessly finished on the spot). However, my main qualm with Qantas is with their "Customer Care" and agents and representatives. While I was in the air from Cairns to Brisbane, Qantas cancelled my flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles, and I received a notification when we touched down. Naturally, I was confused and annoyed - why did they cancel my long-haul flight and why didn't they tell me before I took off from Cairns? I called Qantas who said it was cancelled for "operational requirements" but I could take a flight the day after (wouldn't work with my schedule) or connect me through Sydney at a painfully early hour in the morning. However, I had to call American Airlines to actually book the seat. Since Qantas and American Airlines had literally zero communication and little to no knowledge of what was going on with my original flight (Qantas said they could not notify American Airlines and I had to call them), I had to spend about 4 phone calls and 2 hours on the phone trying to fix the issue. I eventually booked new flights that added about 12 hours of additional travel time. When I tried to speak to a representative on the ground at the Brisbane airport, he was incredibly unhelpful and curt (I'll cut him some slack - it was 4:30 am). He could not tell me why the flight was cancelled, could not file my complaints, and could not provide any information except "Qantas has a process and the process works. Well, I can tell you first hand that the process is extremely convoluted and difficult and does not actually work. I spent several weeks trying to reach Qantas "Customer Care" before I heard back. No resolution has been reached for a flight two months ago. Tip: skip the mess and reach out via Twitter. Or just fly with a different airline.

### "wouldn't trust a Qantas agent"
My family's flight from Brisbane to LAX ended up having a long delay (around 3 hours), due to a previous delay at LAX. The Qantas agent in Brisbane emphatically said that we absolutely didn't need to call Alaska Airlines (our US connection) and say that we would miss the connecting flight, even though it was on a separate ticket. We explained this extremely clearly and he said that, because Alaska are a Qantas partner, Qantas would take care of this for us in-air. Of course, this was false. We arrived in LAX with no connection information. Alaska was merciful and didn't charge us a re-booking fee, but that was their decision, not Qantas. I definitely wouldn't trust a Qantas agent in a situation like this again! Both meals were also quite bad on this flight. However, the flight crew were extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, Qantas is just an okay airline for economy passengers.

### "service was very friendly"
Melbourne to Canberra. I enjoyed my flight. It took off on time and the service was very friendly and helpful. It was nice to have complimentary drinks. Although the Qantas website mentioned that food would be included, all I received was a chicken sandwich. Not bad for such a short flight but maybe there could have been more for a full service airline?

### "it was an enjoyable flight"
Flew Qantas from Canberra to Melbourne. Overall it was an enjoyable flight. It departed and arrived early. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I appreciated the free drinks. The snack (cheese, biscuits and apple) was OK for a brief flight. Also I wish Qantas would not continually change the times of flight bookings. It can be a pain if there is limited time.

### "Staff were not sympathetic at all"
Terrible! So disappointing after a relaxing holiday to be faced with this flight. We departed Hong Kong after sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours. Jammed in like sardines in extreme heat. Now we are still in Brisbane because same thing has happpened engine issues. Still waiting to board new flight. I will never travel Qantas again! 2 planes, 2 mechanical issues. The $20 voucher just doesn’t cut it. 2 hours sleep in 24 hours with what should have been a simple flight. Staff were not sympathetic at all.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Wellington to Sydney. Absolutely horrible experience. We were told at the Wellington airport that 3 passengers out of 4 (family of 4 with 2 kids) have been moved to another flight due to weight issues in the flight? And the passenger separated was my little daughter who is under age to travel alone? When questioned the Qantas staff answer was I had bought a separate ticket for her and I had confirmation document to prove them wrong. The staff took no ownership and repeatedly said it was not their error and we were sent to 3 queues while my daughter was crying fearing separation. I had to have hard talk before they changed their mind and finally we were sent via Qantas. After reaching Sydney, we waited almost 1 hour with many other passengers and our baggage never arrived? We had to go and question Qantas staff and they said to lodge an entry with baggage services and we did it accordingly. When questioned as to why they didn't inform us, the staff said they too didn't know. Worse part us there was no apology and staff treated us as trouble makers. Why should we pay more and travel Qantas to see this kind of arrogant service? Disaster at its best

### "seamless and easy to navigate"
Sydney To Brisbane return with Qantas Airways. From check-in through to security, the terminal facilities provided by Qantas is seamless and easy to navigate. Once onboard the departure and arrival was on time. It was a well routined flight, which wasn't taken advantage by the Cabin Crew. I find the crew moving through the motions and not being personal with passengers, especially those with High Tiered Membership. I think some re-training is in order to motivate and drive the team to the next level of customer satisfaction.

### "possibly the worst airline meal"
I flew QF72 from Singapore to Perth and the flight was extremely full (possibly due to the school holidays). Business class passengers were asked to board first (after families with young children) and this is probably not a good idea as passengers in economy have to file past and queue through the front cabin in this single aisle B737-800. It really is not a suitable aircraft for this very popular international route. After all passengers were seated we were offered a pre-departure drink, an amenities kit but no newspapers or cold/hot towels. Soon after take-off, drink and dinner orders were taken but the menu choices for business class took me by surprise - three seafood choices (fish dumpling soup, salmon salad or a prawn roll) with only one meat choice (pork) for main course. Entree was a choice of soup or chicken salad - I elected to have the chicken salad and it was very nice. Not being terribly keen on seafood, I chose the pork for main course, however, it had already run out (as was the case for another passenger) so I eventually chose the prawn and celery roll. It was served cold and possibly the worst airline meal I have ever eaten. Basically it was a hot-dog roll with a few chopped prawns scattered over the top - totally tasteless and inedible. Drinks were topped up from time to time during the meal service, however, more attention was given to passengers after the the meal service was completed which is totally understandable. As there is no division/curtain between business and economy there seems to be quite a lot of traffic through the forward cabin so there is little chance of taking a rest in these domestic style seats. Fortunately the passenger in front of me did not fully recline his seat as was the case on the Perth - Singapore sector earlier in the year. Overall, the crew did their very best to take care of passengers, however, as mentioned before, this small aircraft doesn't really seem appropriate for this very competitive and busy international sector. I sincerely hope Qantas considers the reinstatement of their A330's sometime in the future. In the meantime, the business class menu choices need to be urgently reviewed (as does a division/curtain between cabins).

### "this is simply unacceptable"
Upon arrival at Tullamarine Airport we were advised the flight had been delayed 1.5 hours. Every hour thereafter, we were advised that the flight was further delayed. Eventually it departed around 2.30 pm - over 4 hours late. To compensate, we were given a meal voucher each for $15. I am not necessarily basing my review score on the delayed flight, as I know delays can sometimes happen. After boarding, I noticed each passenger had a pillow and blanket on their seat, however, on closer look at the pillow I noticed that it had been used previously - pillow slip was crumpled and was a little dirty and also, several long black hairs were attached. For me, this is simply unacceptable from an airline who believes it is a first class airline, a rung above most. The flight itself was fine. Drinks/meal service was acceptable. A snack (ice cream) was handed out during the flight. In flight entertained worked well, good selection of programs and a good size screen. For a tall man, the amount of leg space is very limited, but I knew this when I booked this economy seat.

### "friendly and helpful staff"
Brisbane to Melbourne. I enjoyed the flight. Very friendly and helpful staff. Check in was easy and the flight left on time. The meal served was very tasty and the white wine was excellent. They also served a very good coffee IFE was also very good for a 2 hour flight.

### "still had a good flight"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Unfortunately due to weather issues the flight was delayed by nearly two hours. I guess that can't be helped. But I still had a good flight. Staff were helpful, efficient and friendly and I enjoyed the small but tasty meal as well as a couple of Cascade Beers. There was no seat back IFE but that didn't matter for such a short flight.

### "extremely friendly, kind"
Dallas to Sydney. The plane was excellent,  seats were comfortable and reclined more than I anticipated. I liked that there was a camera at the tail of the plane, so you could see the take-off and landing, despite not having window seats. There was a huge variety of entertainment to listen and watch, the seat has a USB port to charge devices. We sat near the end of the plane and the staff that took care of us were extremely friendly, kind, and accommodating. My request for a gluten-free, vegan meal was missed, but the staff gave me options based on what they had available and even advised that I call the airline a few days before my next flight to ensure my request was confirmed for my trip home. Unfortunately, one of our luggages got lost (we weren't the only ones from the flight and apparently the same happened with my brother), but Qantas was great at handling it  - they provided us with two personal kits (pjs and some toiletries) and a pre-paid credit card to purchase some new clothes in the meantime. We got our bag back after 2 days, when we arrived in Melbourne. We will be going back to Oz again and we definitely be flying with Qantas when we do!

### "was upgraded to Business"
Auckland to Sydney. My flight was departing at 650 AM so I was incredibly tired and was hardly awake at Check-In. As I was on my way to security and customs, I realised I was upgraded to Business Class and was very happy indeed, it definitely put a smile on my face. After a visit to the Lounge, the boarding procedure began. I liked the fact Qantas has consistency with priority boarding. The cabin crew were very pleasant on my flight, it began with pre-departure drinks moving onto breakfast and after service drinks. IFE was very good, loving the new content every time I fly with the Red Roo. Overall, it was a smooth journey with every aspect on point, not much I could fault.

### "I do not rate this airline"
London to Sydney via Singapore. I do not rate this airline and will avoid it if at all possible on all future flights . Qantas staff on the whole were disinterested; on my outward journey my in flight entertainment was not working. I asked staff three times to rectify the problem but all my requests were ignored. Ground staff at Sydney we’re dreadful - one of my co passengers had to que whilst carrying her three month old baby! No offer of early boarding for the elderly, disabled or families with small children were made. The menus were very limited and the standard of the food well below that offered by other airlines I have recently travelled with. In flight entertainment was poor with limited choice (when the systems were working). To make matters worse my scheduled flight from Singapore to London of 11.45 has been delayed by four hours; I have been notified by email (two hours before departing for the airport) with a local telephone number to call if I have any queries. Needless to say the number which I have called repeatedly, is not answered! My experience of Qantas in a nutshell is that it is uncaring, shoddy and unreliable; I would certainly not recommend it  - what might look like a cheap deal may end up costing you more in inconvenience as indeed it has me! It is sad that such a great Country is let down by its National Airline.

### "food and service a disaster"
Singapore to Perth in March 2018. Checked in at self serve counter, it was easy but a helpful ground staff  assisted me, then she led me to the baggage counter. The check in was quick and without any dramas. The boarding wasn't as friendly, a younger crew member didnt even bother to say hello or welcome the passengers. Through out the flight she was hostile. The senior crew members were very friendly and courteous. My seat came with a pillow, blanket and headsets. No hot towels or snacks were given. The seat pitch was below average and I felt very cramped towards the end of the flight. IFE was good. The food and service was a disaster, it was slow and disorganized. 2 hours take off, I hadn't received any drinks and when the food trolley reached us, they had only fish with steamed potatoes and broccoli. It was served with a bottle of a water and bread roll. The food looked and tasted bad, more like what you get on low cost or regional airlines. Finally the drinks trolley arrived when people had almost finished their dinner. The crew member was lovely though, I had a James Boag, I was offered another beer later and she remembered what I was drinking. Then came the Weis Mango & Cream bar along with KitKat which was some consolation even though they cost only about $1.50 in supermarket. The cockpit crew was very professional, the announcements were probably the best I have heard from a captain. They updated us even on the maneuvers they were going to make and landed the plane smoothly despite heavy turbulence. The flight arrived on time and checked in luggage came out quickly without any damage. Overall the flight was disappointing. Food was bad, comfort was minimal and didnt get the service you would expect from Qantas.

### "Poor customer service"
Flew Qantas Airways from Auckland to Melbourne. Poor customer service. No loyalty in frequent flyer program. Delayed but should be expected from this over priced carrier. Staff clearly need training in all aspects. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Avoid this carrier as all that matters is profitability.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Darwin to Brisbane. I fly regularly interstate on Qantas. On this first flight they served Couscous salad with Falaffal and mint yoghurt lunch - this meal was a great and delightful treat! I look forward to more healthy tasty meals Qantas will provide as their vegetarian option for their customers. I don't like white sugar in my hot drink and I hope Qantas will offer honey as an alternative sweetener instead. It was overall a very pleasant trip.

### "was absolutely terrible"
Auckland to Brisbane. Delayed flight which was meant to replace the old Emirates flight. Food and Service was absolutely terrible. I could not eat my food. They ran out of blankets, pillows food and Ipads. I asked for water 3 times and received nothing. We were told that this is just a domestic flight and we dont have all these things on board. Well we paid for an international flight so why not?Emirates are a far superior airline. Luggage took forever to come from the plane and most connecting flights were missed so people had to be accommodated in Brisbane. I will never travel Qantas again Disgusting ! ! !

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. Absolutely terrible experience. The flight attendants forgot to serve me the meal as well as forgot to give me a customs form. When I asked one of them politely about it, she acted inconvenienced and made it seem like it was my fault. The flight ended up being 45 minutes late and the staff made no effort to assist me to my connecting flight. I actually arrived 30 minutes prior to my next flight, but the attendants refused to let me board saying it was too late to board. I had to wait 5 more hours and was promised a meal ticket that I never received. Overall, a horrible experience. Qantas, you have lost a customer.

### "crew service was good"
Canberra to Perth. Check-in at Canberra airport was easy as there is priority lane for oneworld Ruby and above passengers. I am currently Silver with Malaysia Airlines Enrich which grants me the same privilege as the equivalent tier on Qantas frequent flyer program. Absolutely disappointed that there is no announcement made for the delay in departure from neither the ground staff nor cabin crew once we boarded the plane. The plane was further delayed again due to aircon malfunctioning inside the main cabin. It was extremely warm. I am offered an exit row so plenty of leg room and the seat is comfortable. No fixed headrest which makes long flights on the single aisle jet a little difficult. Dinner was served and there was 3 options. Food was generally fine, different beverages including alcoholic ones offered to passengers. Cabin crew service was good or above average. Free WiFi on board and USB port to charge devices which keep me happy.

### "This is terrible"
Flying Melbourne to Brisbane on one of my usual business shuttles as a regular Qantas customer. Nice welcome coming on board, pleasant service, something hot to eat and spare seat next to me - almost like Business Class on some European airlines. However, flight completely spoilt (as was my next flight after this) due to the seat back IFE Qantas have now installed on this aircraft. What dingbat in Qantas thought up the idea of having seat back screens with games installed so that the person behind me could punch the screen for 2 hours without stop as he played his game all the way from Melbourne to Brisbane. I noticed the guy sitting in the aisle seat across from me doing the same thing. The end result is being punched in the back of the head non-stop making it impossible for me to rest my head back at all. This is terrible! What otherwise would have been a pleasant on-time flight completely ruined by being punched in the back of the head for two hours. I was only grateful it wasn't a longer flight.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Flew Qantas from Auckland to Brisbane. Worst seat pitch I have ever encountered. The sear pitch is so tight that it is near to bodily injury. Cattle transport could not be worse. The staff were friendly though. Food as always in economy is far away from tasty. Will try to avoid flying Qantas again.

### "all cabin staff just disappeared"
QF2 flight from Dubai to Sydney. I took Emirates A380 in 2017 for the same route so good opportunity to compare Qantas and Emirates level of service. Since the flight ticket was more expensive I was expecting something nice. First deceptions came as soon as I sat in my seat: reduced room for legs, no USB plug to recharge my phone, small screen with very few interesting movies, meal rests and hairs on my tablet, and no glass holder on the back seat so you are compelled to have the tablet on your knees to put the glass on it. The boarding started an hour earlier than expected which explains why the plane was looking so dirty inside, they probably did not clean it at all despite the plane staying at least 3 hours on the Dubai tarmac. As a result, the boarding was finished one hour earlier than departure time, so we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited, three hours in the plane before takeoff. No green light given by the control tower apparently. As soon as the ascent was done the staff started to get the meals ready and it took them 1 hour for them to get ready with the meals. I somehow had the impression that it was the first flight for the entire cabin crew. Another hour and a half before finally receiving a meal to eat which was OKish but the portion size and meal quality were below Emirates standards. I enquired with the staff about the next time a meal would be served in order to know when I could sleep he said "I dunno, but you'll get some snacks in a couple of hours". Yeah, nobody saw any snacks coming during the entire flight, then all cabin staff just disappeared, I have not seen a single one of them during 9 hours. Probably all went to sleep at the same time (very smart move in case there is an emergency). At some point during the flight the sound of the TV stopped functioning for my neighbors and me. The crew came to check and quickly left by saying "sometimes things just go bad". Great. I then took the opportunity to look at the entire cabin configuration and it actually looked pretty depressing. Black seats, non-led lightning, damaged trolleys. Emirates does a much better job here with night sky rooftops and dimmed led lighting. After more than 9 hours without eating anything I started to feel pretty bad so I was happy to see the crew preparing the second meal of the flight (note: there were 3 meals on Emirates + 2 snacks) but again they were completely disorganized and it took them ages to get ready and serve everybody. My meal was almost cold when I received it, again it was OKish but I just needed to eat something otherwise I would have fainted so I ate it, and the portion size was still bigger than if I would have taken the alternative: an apple. That was my first and probably last time flying with Qantas.

### "one of the highest quality domestic flights"
Check-in was as quick as ever using the kiosk and automated bag drop. Love it. Flight almost full so boarding took a while. Plenty of space in the overhead lockers. Legroom acceptable and the cabin of the wide body aircraft is very quiet compared to a 737. An IPad is supplied and has a wide range of content streamed to it. Kept me well entertained for the 5 hour flight. Breakfast was a box containing hot sausages, baked beans and corn cakes. Very tasty. The crew also did another drinks round mid flight. This has to be one of the highest quality domestic flights you could take anywhere.

### "terrible experience for First Class passengers"
My experience in First Class on this flight is definitely worse than the Jetstar Business Class I have taken before! Table setting was minimal, no salt or pepper, my fish with rice was terrible salty, the sauce on my salad was wrong - I asked for palm sugar dressing and got balsamic instead! 2 choices of bread slices. What happened to 3 choices of bread rolls and garlic bread? No offer of ginger ale top up or any other drinks during my meal and what happened to trolley servicing in First Class when there is a full flight? Is it that troublesome to go an extra mile for paying customers? In-flight Entertainment - I watched "Wonder" and "Wonder Woman" but the movies kept pausing and lagging, it felt like Qantas had downloaded these movies from a pirated site hence the bad quality! Apparently my husband had the same problem too. What a terrible experience for First Class passengers. An hour before we land, I asked for another Evian bottle of water (500ml size) and was told that each passenger has one only and if I wanted more water then she has to bring my empty bottle to the galley to be topped up with bottled water. Are you telling me that all the money and points we paid for the flight, Qantas cannot afford to give their First Class passengers more than 1 bottle of Evian water? And how confident am I to believe that it was topped up with "bottled water" - not! This whole episode makes me feel like Qantas is seriously cutting costs so much that they must be in financial trouble, what else is Qantas cutting cost on I wonder. Some of the crew walked up and down the aisle like elephants. Its a night flight. Passengers are trying to sleep. Be gentler and quieter. Can't imagine the noise level if I was seated near the galley. Smiles from the crew at boarding and disembarking does not make the terrible experience during the flight any better! After this, I don't think my husband will be on Qantas Business or First again.

### "no order was established"
Sydney to Bangkok with Qantas Airways. The Check-In process was effortless as I had priority due to my One World Sapphire status. When custom and security was cleared, it was straight to the Lounge for breakfast and relaxation. Boarding was chaotic with a long queue, no proper announcements were made and no order was established. Once airborne, the 9.5 hour flight was smooth sailing with very little turbulence with departure and arrival on time. The food served was quite good, but the portions need to be bigger. IFE was favourable though I think more content should have been added. The quality of Cabin Crew was good but nothing to applaud about, no one really stood out or went the extra mile.

### "a great friendly crew"
Great flight with a great friendly crew. The IFE was amazing with an incredible number of choices that made a 9.5 hour flight fly by. The meal choices for economy was excellent with all the drinks you wanted. One of the best economy flights I have ever had with a quite comfortable seat.

### "3 bad planes in two days"
Perth to Melbourne. Three planes very wrong in two days all Qantas. Some of my people working on a job at Crown Perth had to get over there on Tuesday 20 March. They were at the Melbourne airport at 6.00 am ready to go. That plane had air condition problems and they had to fly a plane from Sydney for them to change to so they were about 5 hours late. I flew to Perth on another airline no probs at all and arrived early. Some of my workers were coming back to Melbourne on the 1.30 pm flight and it was delayed for 45 min. Myself and one of my workers were booked on the 3.00 pm flight to arrive back in Melbourne. There was a message that the plane cabin temperature was too hot so we could not board until it was cool - how does that happen. Then about to board and one of the crew members came off sick and we all had to sit down again until they found a replacement crew member. (Not sure why all that happened after the air conditioning issue. Then we finally boarded and everyone was on and they sat us there in a very hot plane for about another 20 min and the ipad movie pods were not working. Plane finally got off the ground at 4.30 pm. It is the flow on that they do not see. It meant my workers had done too many hours so I had to give them today (Following day) off. So the project we were supposed to be finishing today has to be re scheduled for next week. People on the plane did not seem to mind so much but as I knew there had been 3 bad planes in two days that all affected me and my work I had to say something. Not the crews fault - Qantas management I would think.

### "service should have been much better"
Tokyo to Sydney. On boarding we were shown to our seats 39J and 39 K we were asked by the flight attendant if we would like a drink, we were given a glass of bubbles by someone who definitely didn't give the impression that he wanted to be there, a bottle of water was also given - no smile just a feeling that we were an inconvenient part of the flight, dinner was fair but no choice of desert as indicated on the menu, we were asked if we wanted red or white wine, when we asked for champers there was a roll of the eyes and an expression of nuisance. After dinner the lights went out and the curtain came across the galley, not once during the 9.5 hour trip were we asked if we wanted water or anything - we are the type that does not like using the call button - breakfast was very basic, a squashed up ham and cheese croissant or cereal and fruit, no hot breakfast - most economy flight breakfasts are better , the B747 is showing it's age with noisy airconditioning and tired toilets, flight was on time but service should have been much better, I will stick to economy in future - especially as I pay for the flights myself.

### "two flights be so different?"
Auckland to Sydney return. How can two flights be so different? AKL-SYD was terrible and SYD- AKL great. AKL-SYD was the worst ever, food inedible. Powdered scrambled eggs, soggy hash brown, bacon and sausage disgusting. Cabin crew appeared tired. Aircraft dirty, used headphones and chocolate wrappers in seat pocket. In flight entertainment screen kept changing films, didn't work SYD-AKL was a total contrast. I chose the new salad option which was delicious. Crew were great. New self checkin is fantastic and quick whilst ques for regular checkin was long.

### "Not worth the money"
Hostile ground staff at the gate. Very friendly, very senior cabin crew. Surprisingly (for Qantas) soft black seats showing evidence of previous meals and passenger hairs. With the large threatening words "tablet use only. Max 1kg" in your face all the way. Seat pitch tight and toilets like vertical coffins. The only meal choice was vegetable green curry at 10.30am. Or an apple. The other choice appeared to run out about half way down the cabin. Not surprising with green curry that early. One hour before landing given a frozen fruit juice ice block labelled "made in China". From an airline that rests on Aussiecentric marketing. At descent, offered a chocolate of a brand known to taste like soap. So nothing appealing to eat in over 4.5 hours. No seat back entertainment. Overhead screens glarey and barely visible, showing some superhero movie. Why is it you can fly Sydney - Melbourne and get unnecessary seat back entertainment often but never on a 4.5 plus hour flight to DRW. The only difference from a low cost carrier was the fast checkin and age of the flight attendants. Arrived hungry and felt ripped off and certainly not relaxed. Not worth the money.

### "very good and consistent"
A quick trip to London and back on QF2. As mentioned elsewhere the QF service on mainline is very good and consistent. Check in at LHR is very efficient and we had the QF duty manager there greeting the priority customers. The flight itself was uneventful on both sectors to and from Dubai and onto Sydney. On time arrivals meant a smooth comfortable experience all round. I am a Qantas fanboy and this is my 16th A380 sector in four months. Undoubtedly there will be those PAX who travel and find faults. Qantas are not perfect but better then the majority.

### "consistent with mainline service"
Sydney to London via Dubai. Cheaper and easier to fly to London rather than to Berlin direct. Qantas are very consistent with the mainline service. Check in at Sydney was fine albeit they are moving to an automated self check in service. Now being a QFF gold and likely platinum soon, it is nice for FF to have a check in agent to do the work and as a small reward for the money spent with the airline. But technology waits for no man. The Sydney Qantas lounge is in need of more space and a good spruce up. Flight was fine and on time arrival. Had a long layover as was waiting for QF9 and a colleague travelling from Melbourne so made the most of the excellent lounge. QF9 to London was fine albeit late arriving and departing to LHR so a 12.40pm arrival was an hour late. Now as for LHR - nightmare. Long long long walk from the bay to passport control and the place was absolutely packed.

### "staff were very friendly"
I enjoyed my flight from Gold Coast to Melbourne. There was a bit of trouble checking in with my FF card but the staff were very friendly. The plane left on time. The staff on the plane were efficient, helpful and friendly. The lunch (barramundi) was delicious. As usual, Qantas serves excellent wine. IFE was fairly limited (no seat back screen), but not too bad considering it was only a two hour flight. Just one problem to note. My seat belt sign came off before the other passengers which could have caused confusion. Overall, a lovely end to my break.

### "much better on my return flight"
Sydney to Brisbane return. One of my most memorable domestic flight to date. The outbound to Brisbane was very routine from easy check in, relaxing lounge, friendly crew and great punctuality. It got much better on my return flight, as the experience was lifted by the Customer Service Manager. Once the flight was airborne for Sydney, he decided to offer me, along with the passenger beside me a bottle of water and welcomed us back and said "if there is anything I can do to make your journey more comfortable, please let myself or the crew know". I was taken by surprise and blown away by the gesture as it rarely happens when flying in economy. The rest of the crew were also pleasant. WIFI was on offer, the speed was decent and the IFE had new content, amazing as always. Looking forward to my next trip.

### "nice to have free drinks"
Adelaide to Melbourne. I enjoyed my flight. Check in was very easy and smooth. The flight departed on time. The staff were very efficient and friendly. TIFE was quite good as well, nice to have a seatback screen for such a short flight. The food served was tasty as well and it's nice to have free drinks included. It is a bit strange that so many passengers take so much luggage on board when it's so easy to check in and check out, especially since checked in baggage is included. Maybe Qantas could be a bit stricter?

### "more than enough legroom"
Qantas Premium Economy experience from Sydney to New York JFK was all class, and more like Business Class minus the flat bed. Crew were friendly, engaging, called you by name and seemed interested in passenger well being. Business class quality food and wine and comfortable seats with more than enough legroom even when the person in front is in full recline. Flight home delayed due to weather in New York but Qantas offered to pay up to USD 200 for a hotel and upgraded me from NYC to LA to Business class. The sector from LA to Sydney in PE was just as good as the flights outbound. I managed to get just on 8 hours of sleep which I have struggled to do on any long haul flight. Qantas is often bagged as a national sport here in Australia but on the strength of these flights they have won my ongoing loyalty and then some. Very impressed all round. Only slight downside was having to transit through JFK Terminal 7 which is a construction zone.

### "service was excellent"
It’s a long trip from Melbourne to London via Dubai, but my partner and I had a lovely journey. The service was excellent, especially the leg from Dubai to London where the staff were incredibly patient and helpful with my partners special eating requirements.

### "No hassle on this flight"
Darwin to Sydney. Check in was straight Forward. No hassle encountered. Boarding straight forward with hiccups. Flight was uneventful. A long internal flight with refreshments. On arrival,baggage arrived soon after. No hassle on this flight. This is just what I like.

### "a hassle-free journey"
Melbourne to Alice Springs. Checking in was very straightforward. Helpful staff. Boarding smooth even though it was a full flight. Cabin crew were helpful. Flight, served refreshments very efficient and in a business manner. The plane departed and arrived on schedule. This is how I like it. It did not appear to be a new plane but it appeared clean. Arrival with a short wait for baggage at Alice Springs. It was a hassle-free journey. Really appreciated it.

### "staff were lovely"
Sydney to Bangkok. The ground staff helped me with a baggage issue after someone on the phone had given me the wrong information, the flight left on time, seats were comfy, entertainment choice was extensive, food delicious, and staff were lovely. When I came to ask if there was any chance I could get another coffee, the air hosts made a pot just to give me a cup, and then also gave me extra left-over banana bread, with more to hand to the people around me. The host looking after my section, was incredibly sweet and thoughtful, and even brought me another dessert to have with the coffee, when I hadn't even asked for it. They're just little touches, but it makes enough of a difference that I want to tell people how much I love this airline, and am bothering to write this review.

### "Did not get the goods we paid for"
Did not get the service and goods that we paid for. Paid for a Qantas flight from Brisbane to Melbourne that included a hot meal and entertainment and received neither! The entertainment was only provided on an app but you had to bring your own device - phone or laptop. We were not advised this before travelling so presumed they would supply TV screens or tablets, just as they did on our flight the week prior. There were not enough hot meals on the flights, so we missed out on this as well. Poor service from some of the hostesses, the only positive was a lovely gentleman steward who was friendly and understanding.

### "42 mins queuing"
Melbourne to Sydney. Qantas get your act together. Got to airport expecting plenty of time to get through the normal check in procedures only to spend 42 mins queuing to get through security screening. Even the staff were stressed with the constant stream of people asking express processing as they were late for flights. Not happy.

### "found the experience humiliating"
Sydney to Wellcamp. Dash 8-400 Turboprop Flight about two thirds full. Two male cabin crew one very efficient and friendly, the "supervising" male extremely rude and unpleasant. I would like to seek clarification on a few statements and expectations made by the head of the cabin crew on our flight on the 17th January from Sydney to Wellcamp Toowoomba. Three of us had travelled to and from Perth on business. With only 20 minutes to transfer from one flight to the other, I had purchased three steamed dim sums from the Sydney terminal café precinct. I carried them onto the plane and our team shared them mid-flight when the cheese and biscuits had been distributed by the cabin crew. I had placed the plastic container and the wrappings from the snacks supplied by the crew in a small plastic bag (the one I had carried the three dim sums onto the flight in). When the rubbish was being collected by the cabin crew after all on the flight had finished eating, the cabin team leader said “I will not be collecting the garbage you have brought onto the flight. We have limited space, you will have to keep it on your lap and take it off the flight with you. If there is any room in our trash once I have finished cleaning the cabin, then and only then, will I remove it.” He then walked off leaving the rubbish with me. I was left dumbfounded, wondering what I had done to offend the man. The flight was two thirds full. I was seated in seat 8B beside a large gentleman and, as I am 105 Kg myself, mid-flight I changed seats to the third row from the front where the whole row was empty. Five minutes later the same cabin crew member asked me to return to my original seat. I explained I was cramped with two large men in the one row and that the 8 or so seats around me were vacant so what harm could it cause? The cabin crew member said in a stern voice. I’m instructing you to move back to your assigned seat.” I said “I have been using QANTAS for 30 years and had never been told that I could not move seats after take-off especially when so many were vacant.” he responded, “The flight needs to be balanced” I said, “when I checked in online there were numerous seats all over the plane that were vacant, I could have picked any one of them, how did you determine who weighs what and then decide where they should sit?” he said, “Return to your assigned seat immediately!” and walked off abruptly. Again I was left shaking my head in disbelief and so were the other passengers on the plane. A number of whom urged me to make a complaint about the cabin crew members rudeness. I now find myself writing my first ever letter of complaint. Can you tell me the QANTAS policy on bringing food and by association, the wrappings onto a flight? Can you clarify the QANTAS policy on moving seats when a cramped situation can be overcome by the relocation of a passenger? I found the whole experience humiliating.

### "Very poor customer service"
Melbourne to Sydney. First time I have flown in a while. I am only a lowly silver member with a complimentary lounge pass due to being a silver member. Normally I would be travelling with my husband who is a gold member therefore I haven't had to use my pass. As he is already in Sydney I thought I would spoil myself and use the pass, not to be -
 Melbourne Lounge unavailable to complimentary pass holders due to renovations. I was informed that I could use my pass on the return trip, I will be with my husband so I don't need to use it then. If the lounge is under renovations then the pass should be extended Until the lounge renovations are complete I understand in the scheme of things I do not rate a second thought to such a big company like Qantas. Very poor customer service, this is just one of the issues we have had with Qantas in the last 12 months. I just wonder why Qantas even bother to try to make you feel special

### "Will never fly Qantas again"
Flight was two hours late leaving Sydney (and we had to change boarding gates). Okay, not so bad, I can deal with that. Arrived in Auckland, waited about an hour for luggage with about 40 other people from flight (those left with no luggage). We were told the luggage was put on a later flight, arriving after midnight (it was 7:00 p.m. when this happened) and that arrangements would be made to deliver our luggage the next day. Everyone had to stand in line to file a report - took about 20 minutes per person/group so you can imagine how long it took. We unfortunately had an early morning pick-up for an activity and had no clothes or toiletries. Didn't hear a word the next day so had to repeatedly call because almost impossible to get anyone on the phone. Checked tracking and it said they were still looking for our luggage. Bottom line is we received our luggage about 10:00 p.m. the next day. No apology from Qantas. Oh, and another other couple on our tour was still waiting for luggage that Qantas lost two days prior - different flight. Our tour driver said it happens all the time; she hears this from customers and it's always Qantas. Heard this from our hotel as well. Terrible customer service. They made no effort to contact us with updates or to apologize for the inconvenience and expense this caused us. Will never fly Qantas again. Wish we had known about this before we booked with them.

### "disorganised and unprofessional attitude"
I would not recommend flying with Qantas. This is a company that use to pride itself on safety and service. They charged me more than $10000 for a return flight for two people from San Francisco to Sydney. At that rate you would expect that they would do everything possible to ensure that you are comfortable throughout your flight. Instead, they forced my partner and I to move from the pre-assigned seats we had checked into 9hours before the flight was due. They did not give us a choice nor did they give us an adequate explanation. The seats we were moved to were cramped and the entertainment system did not work. Moving seats prior to a long flight when you had completely settled in and are about to fall asleep an hour after checking in is not only rude and frustrating but had completely ruined the end to my holiday. When I called to give feedback they requested a feedback form and informed that they would return my call within 3 days. 2 weeks later I had not received a call and when I called the staff member was dismissive and unhelpful to say the least. She was unable to provide any explanation for why I was moved. Not only that, she offered an insincerely apology and 10000 frequent flyer points. If you are charging a premium then provide a premium service, not a disorganised and unprofessional attitude. Nothing about this airline was acceptable or satisfactory.

### "Overall, an enjoyable flight"
Melbourne to Sydney. This flight was far different than my flight down to Melbourne. Not once did anything go wrong, and it was a full flight. The departure was on time and arrival was ahead of schedule. The FA were much more engaged, food and beverages was delicious and the IFE was great too, I did noticed the content was just slightly old on this flight. Overall, an enjoyable flight as I even managed to take a nap, great job Qantas.

### "need to keep punctuality standards"
Sydney to Melbourne. I fly this route regularly throughout the year, but have noticed every time it’s serviced by the A330 there is an issue. Qantas really needs to keep up punctuality standards if they are using a wide Body jet for domestic routes. Delays happen, but you need to be able to control them and if using the A330 for such short domestic flights becomes a problem it’s best to stick with a B737. On a good note, the flight was great once we were airborne, cabin crew were pleasant and food was pretty good. IFE was very good, and great to see new content.

### "Qantas offered good value for money"
Singapore - Brisbane - Christchurch - Sydney - Singapore in Economy Class, with the CHC-SYD sector operated by Jetconnect. The A330-200s flown between Singapore and Australia were fitted with Qantas' latest-generation seat and inflight entertainment (IFE) system, while the B737-800s offered a different seat with a similar IFE system (slightly smaller selection of content). The seat pitch was more than sufficient for me (at more than 180 cm in height), particularly onboard the A330, the depth of recline was acceptable, with the moving seat pan serving to minimise the inconvenience caused to and by other passengers. I found features such as the adjustable headrests and USB ports useful, the fact that these were present onboard the B737s as well makes them all the more impressive. The service onboard was sincere, with all requests attended to promptly and courteously. The cabin crew were attentive and conducted regular refreshment and rubbish collection runs through the cabin. Only minor touches such as newspapers and amenity kits were absent. The quality of the meals served (lacto-ovo vegetarian) ranged from good (breakfast on the flights to and from Christchurch) to excellent (all other meals), with the staggered delivery of courses (i.e. rather than on a single tray) and inclusion of snacks in the meal service allowing for some flexibility. A larger selection of mid-flight snacks would have been appreciated, though, given the rather small portions. The connections at Brisbane and Sydney were seamless, when the already-short connection at Brisbane was exacerbated by a delay in the flight from Singapore, airline employees were deployed at frequent intervals along the route between the two gates to guide passengers and expedite the transit process. In summary, for the roundtrip price of SGD 1354.50 paid, Qantas offered good value for money.

### "drive and motivation is not there"
Gold Coast to Sydney. An interesting flight, I found the FA's both good and bad at the same time. Now I know some people can work for a company for a long time, but some of the crew looked miserable and completely not enjoying their job at all. Great job to the other crew who really went out of their way to keep up Customer Engagement standards. Food served during lunch was delicious and the IFE was great, loving the new contents. I think some re-training is due, as the drive and motivation is not there.

### "An absolute sub-standard product"
Flew Sydney to Denpasar. An absolute sub-standard product on this route. Such a small aircraft for a 6 hour flight. The leg room on this aircraft is unacceptable for an international, full service product. I believe you would have a better experience if you flew Jetstar, Qantas' budget arm, on this route, as they use a B787. I would not reccomenend using Qantas on this route, unless they upgraded the aircraft to a A330, as they use on their Jakarta and Singapore routes. Unless this aircraft switch happens, I'll be sticking with Garuda Indonesia moving forward.

### "Seat space was good"
Sydney to Melbourne. Qantas T3 would be my preferred choice out of Sydney Domestic given the amenities, self-check in, bag drop and the Qantas themed decorations throughout. The Qantas Entertainment app together with the general overhead tv screens and inflight magazine made the difference between a good and bad flight due to it being full. Seat space was good. Only downside was the time it took to collect luggage in Melbourne although this was due to another flight.

### "Entertainment selection was good"
Hong Kong to Sydney. I generally prefer the Boeing 747-400 over other types of aircraft but sadly this one felt a bit worn. Seats were wide and there was plenty of legroom but felt hard mid-flight at the base due to wear. TV felt like it was tailored for my size but the icons on the buttons were rubbed off from years of use. The legrest did not seem to extend fully so I left it alone. Entertainment selection was good. In fact the default music channel was excellent - I never had to turn it down or change channel. Cabin service was not as good as previous flights and at times seemed irritable. There was plenty of overhead storage space but I did find the tiny seat storage pocket paradoxical.

### "Service was very attentive"
Sydney to Hong Kong. Business lounge was good. Service was very attentive whether it was to be served or for clearing tables. Business class facilities on the A380 is galaxies above any other. Was a wonderful experience with lay-flat bed, exclusive bar and lounge, and even a window in the toilet. I arrived at my destination feeling unusually energetic despite the long haul.

### "The food is delicious"
Flew Hong Kong to Auckland via Sydney. Qantas continue to be a solidly excellent airline. The ground staff are pleasant and helpful, even willing to answer my constant questions. The planes are comfortable, even in cattle class. The food is delicious and the fact that they have an open snack bar throughout the flight also helps for the stress eaters like me. The only problems with this journey were that you can't check in online and that the inflight entertainment selection in regards to movies was limited. You could only watch the latest premiere movies, no old classics or anything else.

### "with a fantastic crew"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Evening departure from Adelaide with a fantastic crew who worked hard, interacted with pax and delivered a great service. The meal was a choice between a chicken salad and a veg pasta. They were very generous with drinks service and worked pretty fast but very efficiently. Hats off to this wonderful team.

### "Onboard it was nothing special"
I was through checked from Colombo to Adelaide on this SriLankan code share flight and had no problems in picking my bags and dropping them once again in Melbourne. The staff at the automated gates were very friendly and helpful. The lounge was busy but well stocked. Onboard it was nothing special and the customer affairs manager never addressed any business class pax by names. There were two choices for dinner but water was never served and no refills unless if you asked. No pillow on the seat. There were 03 head sets stuck into the seat pocket obviously not checked and not cleaned prior. Considering Sri Lankan regional flights this was way below standards.

### "smiling and talkative cabin crew"
Very easy and fast check-in at Sydney airport. An excellent three hour flight from Sydney to Auckland! It was a non stop service from attentive, polite, smiling and talkative cabin crew. For at least two hours of the three hour flight they were all serving a very good meal, constantly refilling glasses, offering extra desserts, coffees, teas, etc. Cabin crews and many airlines should learn from Qantas what service is about and how to get passengers/customers to want to fly with them again.

### "FA incredibly attentive"
Hong Kong to Sydney. Check-In was a breeze, with security and immigrations located right next door. After the visit to the Lounge, I headed to gate 23 for boarding. There was a last minute security check, which I thought was unnecessary. I was attended to straight away with an offer of drinks, pyjamas and amenity kit. There was a delay due to congestion and we departed an hour later. Once airborne, dinner was served and It was delicious. After dinner, a turn down service was offered and my seat became a comfortable bed for the red eye journey home. 2 hours before arrival I was served breakfast and again everything tasted great. The FA on this flight were incredibly attentive, they were always present and offering additional services to make my experience more enjoyable. Lastly, the Customer Service Manager came around twice and thank me for flying with Qantas. Looking forward to the next journey.

### "a pleasant surprise"
Cairns to Townsville. This was a short 1 hour flight that turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The seat was comfortable and they served a small snack and a beverage. The staff were friendly. Overall it was good value for money. There are several smaller airlines serving this route and I have used some of them but their service is not comparable. Pleased with Qantas and will use them again even on short flights.

### "disappointed with the experience"
Dubai to Melbourne. My Emirates flight was operated by Qantas. I was very disappointed with the experience. First, the meals are substandard for a long international flight as they only served one hot meal just before landing. The chicken wrap and the pizza boxes were the worst food I ever ate on a plane. Second, it was so cold inside the plane and their blankets were thin. They keep running out of things. I dont know if it is because of my seating but i never received enough drinks or complete food as they kept running out when they got to my row. Fourth, the entertainment options are very limited and entertainment controls like remote and headphone jack were uncomfortable to use.

### "light load and plenty of space"
Sydney to Los Angeles. A trip to LA on Qantas and the Boeing 747-400 . This leaves at 6.25 pm as QF17 and gets in at 1.30pm on the same day. A superb time to arrive as QF11 (which I prefer as its the A380) gets in at 6 am and just a pain unless you have booked a hotel room for the night before also. It was a light load and so plenty of space. Usual QF standards of food ie satisfactory. The FA's were professional and friendly. The B747 was/is a great aircraft but its showing its age. The A380 style seating does lift it a bit although the seats themselves look a bit smaller than on the Airbus. The washrooms are well used! One notices the noise levels the most compared to the Airbus but it is a plane designed in the 60's. On time departure and arrival; the immigration lines at LAX were very light, automated entry and out into the taxi to LA within around an hour of leaving the aircraft. In summary, Qantas it is time to move the 747 to the old folks home.

### "clean, neat and tidy"
Flew Perth to Singapore. Check-in at Perth counter is easy. As a oneworld Ruby member, I was able to use the priority check-in lane to avoid the queue. On board the aircraft, the aircraft looks clean, neat and tidy, although I wish Qantas would deploy a larger aircraft such as A330 on this sector. Amenities include a water bottle, pillow, blanket and earphones. No fixed headrest onboard. Cabin crew announcements were clear. They are fairly attentive and friendly. The inflight meal choices are chicken salad, vegetarian eggplant masala with rice and naan, beef brisket withg polenta. All meals come with warm and soft garlic bread. I chose the beef brisket. The vegetables were overcooked but the polenta was delicious. The beef brisket is cooked to perfection, soft, tender and almost divine, if you pair it with a bottle of shiraz or merlot! It melts in the mouth when you eat it. IFE choice ranges is average and the touch screen not very responsive and occasionally lags.

### "substandard meal for lunch"
Returned to Sydney yesterday from the Gold Coast flying Qantas instead of Jetstar. Aside from the obvious benefit of free luggage, we were very disappointed to once again receive a substandard meal for lunch. This was on top of our lunch served flying to Coolongatta, where a lukewarm, tasteless sausage roll was our Neil Perry designed delight. Don't waste your money flying Qantas to holiday destinations such as OOL. Fly Jetstar, pocket the difference and take yourself out to lunch on arrival.

### "Seat was comfortable"
Sydney to Hong Kong. My first time on a Qantas A380 and it did not disappoint. Fortunately, during peak season the A380 is used and as an added bonus the First Class seats are used as Business Class and I was lucky enough to score 1A as my seat for the 9 hour journey. Cabin Crew were attentive before and after takeoff, and during the meal service, constantly keeping an eye to see if anyone needed further assistance. The Customer Service Manager genuinely welcomed me, along with other passengers during the flight. Definitely a step up from some of my previous Business Class experience. Seat was comfortable and has so many functions which can be easily controlled from a tablet. The food selection was delicious and well prepared. The overall experience during this flight has left a good impression within me. Can't wait to see the consistency of my return journey.

### "welcoming and attentive"
Melbourne To Sydney with Qantas Airways. The trip started with a visit to the lounge and great to see the renovations on the way. The flight attendants were great from start to finish, welcoming and attentive. After take off, the flight began with lunch and once again it was delicious. Though the flight was 30 minutes late we actually arrived into Sydney only 10 minutes after schedule. Very smooth flight overall.

### "experience of Qantas inconsistent"
Sydney to Melbourne. I find the overall experience of Qantas front-line inconsistent based on this flight. I never interact with the ground team at Check-In when flying domestically but the as for the Lounge team, they are very cold and uninviting. On the other hand, the Cabin Crew was smiling and seen throughout the entire flight. The only thing I would pick on during the flight, are the lack of announcement of safety instructions. There needs to be a balance of great Customer Service across the board.

### "a pretty good flight"
London to Sydney via Dubai. The return from London visiting family for Christmas. the flight was fine and the FA's were courteous. The issue was the dinner service, the risotto was inedible. Terrible. On time departure and arrival and when the only thing to complain about was one dish then its a pretty good flight.

### "another satisfying flight"
Sydney to London via Dubai. The crews on the A380 were professional and friendly. All meal services were fine as was provision of snacks. A stop at Dubai which was busy as always. It helps to have lounge access so a freshen up and onward to London. All in all another satisfying flight.

### "everything was very smooth"
Sydney to Brisbane. From Check-In to Lounge access and boarding, everything was very smooth. The flight was uneventful with minimal disturbance. Since it was an early morning flight, I normally would eat breakfast but decided to take a nap. The Flight Attendants were very present during the flight, it's great to see Qantas showcasing great Customer service during such a short flight. The plane touchdown on time and accessing the Brisbane Terminal was at ease.

### " dismissive and unapologetic"
Melbourne to Orlando via Sydney / Dallas. My wife and I booked flights from Melbourne to Orlando in December 2017. During our travel to and from the final destination with Qantas and its partner airlines we were met with a disheartening and unacceptable number of delays, errors, cancellations, and general lack of respect and care from the service members we reached out to for help. Lack of time provided by Qantas for connecting flight in Dallas resulting in a high probability of missing the connecting flight. Flight from Sydney to Dallas left more than an hour late, causing us to miss our connecting flight from Dallas to Orlando. New flights were issued which which added an additional hours and an additional flight and wait times to finally arrive in Orlando. We called and spoke to Qantas and the staff on the phone were extremely unhelpful and misinformed us and advised that there were no other options. Instead we spoke to the staff in the airport who were able to find a more convenient flight for us. Our flight from Sydney to Melbourne was changed by Qantas in error from December 2017, to March 2018. This was discovered by us, and not Qantas. We then has to contact Qantas to have this corrected. Flights home from Orlando to Los Angeles was delayed, and ground staff advised that this would not impact our flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. When we arrived in Los Angeles we found that this did in-fact impact our flight. The ground staff checked our names and rushed us to another gate as the next flight was about to leave, only to find we had not been placed on this flight. We were then sent to another gate where they advised the flight was delayed by 5 hours, leaving at 3am. After waiting, the flight was delayed further to 4am As a result of these constant delays, we missed our flight from Sydney to Melbourne, and were instead placed on a flight much later - leaving us stuck in Sydney airport for 3 more hours. In Sydney we attempted to seek support from the Qantas service desk but they were dismissive and unapologetic. Note that during this entire experience we had to contact Qantas, as no one contacted us to advise of any of the unexpected changes, delays and cancellations. While I understand that there are factors outside of your control, and occasional delays are inevitability, the errors made by Qantas and the general lack of communication, support, and disrespect from staff members is unacceptable.

### "staff very friendly and helpful"
I enjoyed my evening trip with Qantas from Melbourne to Sydney. The plane left and arrived on time and the staff were very friendly and helpful. They served a small but tasty meal and nice complementary drinks. The chocolates after dinner were a nice touch. The IFE had no personal screens, but that didn't matter for such a short trip .

### "efficient, helpful and cheerful"
Sydney to Melbourne. An early morning Christmas day departure. Fortunately the plane was punctual. The staff were very efficient, helpful and cheerful. A small but tasty breakfast was served, which was fine for such a short flight. The IFE was fine. No seat back screens, but OK for such a short flight.

### "mediocre at best"
Sydney to Hong in business class on an ageing Boeing 747. I do believe the whole package is mediocre at best especially compared to competitors on same route. The crew while courteous were overly casual and seems to ignore certain passengers while chatting away with others. Service requests were promised but never delivered . Food while tasty is minimal in portion and choices perhaps due to cost cutting for premium passengers? They also forgot the salad twice, same as my previous flight. Would still be ok for an upgrade but not worth it for a paid ticket.

### "seat had very little legroom"
I flew QF38 from Singapore to Melbourne in Economy only because Emirates (which code-shares with Qantas) was full. The evening meal was so below par - a "Calzone" (more like a stuffed bun, about 3" long) was served in a cardboard box! I would have done better to have purchased a sandwich from the airport to eat onboard - and this is a Full-service airline of some repute! Compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines, this meal was a real shocker! Even the meals offered by China Southern Airlines were so much better than Qantas' offering. Breakfast was at least the usual rubber omelette with bacon and sausage. It appears the wines accompanying the evening meal were very average, but at least they were Australian. But the coffee (Grinders) and tea (Dilmah) offered were quite good. On the plus side, it was a nice touch that every Economy seat had a small bottle of water (about 250ml) in the seat pocket. Actually, that saves the crew some legwork from having to repeatedly answer passenger requests for water as longer flights like these can make one quite dehydrated, The seat had very little legroom, and it was virtually impossible to find a comfortable position to sleep, especially when the passenger in front had their chair in the fully reclined position virtually all the way. Cabin service, while courteous, was almost non-existent. Unlike many of its major competitors, no refresher towels pre-takeoff and landing, no drinks offered after takeoff, only with the meal service. Despite being an overnight flight, no "goodie" bag containing eyeshades, toothbrush and socks were given, unlike SQ or EK. Entertainment was adequate but the screens were quite small, and not very responsive to the touch. I was quite disappointed with Qantas. Usually, I book Qantas but would always select Emirates planes (if available), which offers much more legroom, especially on their A380s. The Singapore Airlines A380 is also a bit more spacious but not as spacious as that of Emirates.

### "The service was professional"
Perth to Singapore on 4 January and as my ticket was purchased at the last moment and at this peak time, the fare was quite expensive (it was the same for all airlines and in all classes). I was a little worried that business class on this 737-800 aircraft which is used mainly for domestic and regional flights would be up to scratch on this international flight but the service was impeccable. Addressed by name, I was offered a pre-departure champagne and an amenities kit. Soon after take-off drinks were served, a menu provided and my order taken. The meal was excellent, the choices were good with an excellent variety of wines. The service was professional, courteous and continuous. The only complaint was that the person in front of me reclined their seat back about 1 minute after take-off and kept it in that position for the entire flight. The flight attendant, however, did ask if I wanted the passenger to put their seat upright during the meal service (this is a problem on this type of aircraft with these non-capsule seats). Another small concern is that there is no division or curtain between business and economy other than a small screen above the rear seats in business class. In fact, these rear business seats recline into the economy cabin as there is no bulkhead (but there is plenty of room to recline). Overall, this was a magnificent flight, excellent service and I wouldn't hesitate to fly this route again and on this type of aircraft. Of course my personal preference would be to bring back the A330's for this international service.

### "Qantas feels like United in its decline"
Flew Canberra to Auckland via Sydney. Alan Joyce has been so busy swanning around changing Australian society that he seems to have forgotten he is meant to be running a first class airline. Checking in was stressful with no real help at kiosks and then passenger chaos at Sydney Airport at Gates 26 A to G with no one helping to organise massive queues. I have been in TSA chaos at LAX but Qantas and Sydney Airport made the TSA look efficient. The crew on the actual flight were terrific. They are ill served by a complacent management hierarchy. I certainly won’t buy Qantas shares. They must be losing custom in droves. So sad for those doing the work on the planes. Qantas feels like United in its decline.

### "bad attitude of cabin staff"
Hong Kong to Brisbane. Amazing interiors, smooth flight. However, bad attitude of cabin staff. Service is disgusting, more like clock watchers and robots. They should be trained by flight companies such as Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific. It takes 1/2 hour for cabin staff to come after pressing the help switch. Asked for a blanket and direct response is, there should be one. Well wild cat, there is none and that's why I ask for one. And can I not ask for a extra blanket any ways? Hated my 8 hour flight from HK to Brisbane.

### "the service provided by crew was horrible"
I flew with family from Brisbane to Colombo. The Brisbane-Singapore-Brisbane service was on Qantas Airways. Overall the aircraft was very clean, modern with good entertainment system. The food was substandard, and add to that the service provided by crew (at least most members) was horrible. Some of them have no smile and are very unwelcoming. A couple of times they missed our meals and we had to go and ask them for it, no apologies. Even then ended up giving us the wrong one. A crew member pushed the trolley up the aisle hitting my hand very hard, again no apology, he just wandered up the aisle. A very overweight crew member found it hard walking along the aisle without brushing against passengers. Overall, pretty bad service.

### "they failed spectacularly"
Sydney to Johannesburg. The business cabin is really starting to show it’s age - seats need a really good steam clean  or to be overhauled and replaced with more up to date units. Entertainment options are good. Qantas often makes a song and dance of their Rockpool inspired dining, but overall food was awful. The menu was pedestrian and did not deliver - the person across the aisle from me sent his meal back. Fillet steak was grey throughout, the prawn starter was bland, and the panna cotta was weirdly goopy and overly sweet. The dinner menu was not much better with limited options that seemed worse than the previous offerings. I get that’s its airline food, but if you’re going to do it this badly then maybe it’s time to rethink your value proposition. The option to dine when suits you is all over the website, but the staff seem constantly overwhelmed so good luck trying to get any of the extra care and attention one would expect in the business cabin. Wine selection is extensive and might have made up for some of the lack lustre food performance, but good luck getting a glass of anything with staff being unable to handle the cabin size. If you do ask for anything they seem visibly annoyed. Normally there are snacks (sandwiches, fruit, etc.) available throughout the flight, and seeing as the meal options were so awful it would have been nice to try eat something else, but this was not offered by the attendants and the idea of requesting something seemed like a bad idea as asking for a glass of wine earns one a dirty look. For an airline that builds such high expectations they failed spectacularly.

### "Really wonderful service"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Flight left on time and arrived slightly early in Melbourne, the crew were friendly and efficient and the lunch options were delicious - a hot chicken pie or turkish sandwich with pulled pork. They both sounded and smelt so great that I was having trouble deciding on one or the other and so the flight attendant gave me both! Really wonderful service that made everyone in the row have a good laugh.

### "seat pitch of 30" isn't adequate"
Perth to Singapore. This flight was an Emirates code-share operated by Qantas. I tried to check in online so that I could get an aisle seat, the Emirates website directed me to the Qantas website, which as a code-share would not allow me to check in. So I fronted to the airport check-in counter (no kiosks available) 3 hours before the flight, was about the 5th passenger checked in, and was told the last available seat was a window seat (my boarding pass had sequence number 45). I had a pass to the Qantas Lounge, valid for "Qantas flight number"; my boarding pass said "Flight QF77" but the staff at the lounge refused to honour the lounge pass, claiming "your fare went to Emirates" - a spurious argument indeed considering the lounge pass was issued by my bank! Onboard, my confirmed special meal request had not been catered - fortunately one of the standard offerings was suitable. The aircraft looked band new, seat pitch of 30" isn't adequate for a 5+ hour international flight, but at least this was the 29-row layout (the 30-row layout must be intolerable). Thinking about it, of all the airlines operating this route only Jetstar gives less leg room. Movie system was a new touch-screen system, but the selection was pretty ordinary, and the sound kept breaking up. Departure had been delayed due to a paperwork error which the pilot 'fessed up to, but the flight arrived pretty much on time. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to use this service again, especially not as a code-share passenger.

### "Worst experience ever"
Sydney to Dallas. Just got off of the worst flight of my life. If you can not afford to upgrade your seats do not fly Qantas long distance. We are a family of 5. My youngest is 6 years old. The people in front of us reclined their seats the entire flight leaving us with absolutely no leg room at all. I literally had to stand and climb out of my seat to go to the bathroom. I could not move my legs an inch. I have no health problems but my feet were swollen and my knee locked up after 15 hours of being literally pinned in one spot. The cherry on top was the family in front of us would glare and make rude comments every time we even tried to move our bodies. Qantas is out to maximize occupancy to the detriment of passengers health and sanity. As an aside they did not accommodate my sons peanut allergy so he ate nothing at all for 15 hours. Worst experience ever.

### "attendant was not friendly"
Brisbane to Singapore. The lady flight attendant who serves our cabin was not friendly, forgot to serve us lunch and drinks, no apology, no smile. We had an issue with IFE so we tried to call staff using the flight attendant call button for help, but we get ignored, so after 10 mins we figured out by ourselves. Blanket was dirty.

### "Crew were courteous and professional"
The plane was over two hours late departing yet there was not a single announcement made in the Qantas Club updating passengers. The seat (4A) was comfortable but scuff marks on the surrounding panels had not been cleaned. Crew were courteous and professional. I had pre-ordered the panko-crumbed chicken and discovered a bone, thankfully before I swallowed it - an extremely apologetic chief purser removed and photographed it. The entertainment system was light on quality movies. The flight was smooth but the plane did not make up time en route and arrived two hours late. Luggage was on the carousel when I arrived. Overall, a fair effort, but I can't recommend an airline which nearly subjected me to an in-flight medical emergency.

### "Crew were excellent"
Return flight from Tokyo, overnight to Melbourne. A brand new Airbus, the Qantas 'Rainbow Roo', so in immaculate condition. Plane left and arrived on time with no turbulence issues. Crew were excellent dealing with a large number of children, especially the chief purser who addressed me by surname throughout the flight. Food quality high this time and included dinner after departure and breakfast just before arrival. A lie-flat bed included a mattress and blanket and more than adequately accommodated my 183cm frame. Range of films still not great. Luggage transferred to my eventual domestic destination of Adelaide, although late on the carousel. This is the Qantas I normally expect to fly.

### "Absolutely awful service"
Los Angeles to Broome via Melbourne and Perth. Absolutely awful service. They cancelled my last flight to Broome under bad weather but only provided room for one night of two. They also lost my luggage (I'm still waiting to get it back!). I waited 1 hour to get a customer service representative when I called. They told me they had no information on my luggage which is ridiculous as I have my luggage receipt and checked it in at my first departure location. They only gave me a small amount of money for me to buy clothes in my current location but nothing for the accommodation or food that I now have to buy as I'm stuck in Broome since I cannot reach my actual destination without my luggage. I do not recommend this airline. Service on the plane is fine but if anything goes wrong they will be rude and unhelpful (especially at the service desk in Perth).

### "We had a pleasant flight"
Melbourne to Singapore, very happy with overall service starting from check in counter. We wanted to change from aisle to to window seats the customer service supervisor happily did it for us. Loved the video safety instructions, the cabin crew were fantastic, food is normal, although the IFE needs to be updated (not important). We had a pleasant flight and arrived safely that was important. Would fly again with them in the future.

### "Great service and a good price"
Flew Sydney to London via Dubai with Qantas. A really good experience on QF1. It is a mammoth flight, 14 + 8 hours. Check-in great, lounge ok, boarding a shambles as the plane was too hot to board. So 400 people wait at a gate with no seats surrounded by hapless ground crew. From then on, all was spot on. Nice glass of champagne, excellent Neil Perry food, I’d pre-ordered a special. Really good wines, turned down the last glass and slept 9 hours. The flat bed is excellent, pyjamas, mattress, duvet and pillow all really helped. I’m not keen on the paired layout as if your neighbour moves a lot you can feel it. But although minimalist the seat does the job very well. Entertainment system is not so good, limited choice and screen in armrest. Short stopover and reboarding directly from Emirates lounge. Delicious bowl of soup then back to sleep before a good breakfast. Arrived early. Top deck of a 380 is always a good quiet place to be. Great service and a good price.

### "yet another enjoyable flight experience"
Flew from Sydney to the Gold Coast in the early afternoon on 11 December. I checked in online using the Qantas app before I arrived at the airport so I could go straight through to security. Boarding was smooth and cabin staff were very pleasant. For the first time ever my travelling companion had a cup of tea that actually tasted like a cup of tea on a plane - it was actually hot! The flight itself was rather uneventful, with a refreshment (cheese & biscuit snack) being served. There were no IFE screens, however you were able to download the Qantas Entertainment app and stream movies and TV shows from a network on the plane. Disembarkation was also very smooth, however the bags did take a fair while to arrive at the carousel. Overall it was yet another enjoyable flight experience with Qantas and I would highly recommend them for domestic travel.

### "courteous, helpful and polite"
My partner and I flew Brisbane to Vancouver via Sydney. Business class. Domestic leg was efficient and friendly, although an aircraft nearly full since it was the first day of school holidays. Sydney to Vancouver on a 747-400. This is a 14 hour flight. Seated in the upper deck. Two female flight attendants. They could have not been more courteous, helpful and polite. They clearly had some experience in their work. They made the flight while away with their service. Standard Qantas Business Class seats. Functional, gave opportunity to sleep and generally feel comfortable for what is a long flight. The Customer Service Manager introduced himself and shook our hands. The food and drinks were plentiful and plenty of varieties to choose from. This was a great flight and beaut way to start our Canada holiday. The 747's are a beaut aircraft, I hope Qantas holds onto a few into the future.

### "comfortable seats, and plenty of space"
Flew Brisbane to Johannesburg via Sydney. Early 4.30am check in in Brisbane, and surprised by number of passengers checking in for international connections - even more surprised by passengers checking in at 04.30 for 05.00 flights. Whereas Qantas could have taken the standpoint that passengers were too late, they actively managed the queue to ensure the late passengers made their flight. We were on a 06.30 flight so checked in for our connecting flights with no problem. Our flight left on time, and we were advised that flying time to Sydney would be only 60 minutes. Despite turbulence for the first 15 minutes, a full breakfast service was provided, with a choice of bacon and vegetable pie or a continental breakfast comprising yoghurt, banana muffin and cereal snack bar. Worth noting that the yoghurt was top quality. Boarding for the main flight was a different story. Renovations are in progress, so the departure lounge was very small, and a 30 minute delayed boarding resulted in much congestion, with no attempt to manage the situation. The lounge was packed resulting in lots of people waiting in the corridor. It was an eye opener to see the number of passengers boarding at the premier check in who considered they were exempt from queuing and were entitled to push in at the front. Boarding once started proceeded efficiently and we were soon settled with a glass of champagne, and from then on the service was superb. Qantas premium economy on the 747 is excellent. A small cabin, comfortable seats, and plenty of space. On this particular aircraft there was a bathroom within the premium economy cabin, which is a big plus. However so much depends on the service, and on this particular flight the cabin staff were top rate. This was a 14 hour flight, during which there were 2 meals plus snacks. We had the option of pre-booking meals from the advance menu, but elected to go with the on-board choices, which were very good. Overall this was an excellent trip.

### "a great performance"
Sydney to Brisbane return. Another domestic trip with Qantas, and great to see consistency from check-in to Lounge service, product and customer service. Both trips were on schedule, smooth and routine. Qantas serve proper meals on domestic routes, something that I appreciate compared to other airlines. Overall, a great performance and I'm looking forward to my next trip.

### "always feel so dissatisfied and disappointed"
Flew Melbourne to Perth. The airline is fine, getting you from A to B, but when you have any engagement with ground staff, I always feel so dissatisfied and disappointed. There appears to be no common sense amongst any of the ground staff. Or perhaps Qantas management is so tyrannical that the ground staff have no freedoms for using their judgement. Qantas, people pay more money to travel with you, but there is no difference between you and Tiger.

### "food and drinks above average"
Adelaide to Sydney. It was a pleasant flight for us with this airline. Departure and arrival were on time. The food and drinks were above average for such a short flight. The aircraft made a good impression and the flight crew was inconspicuous, fast and therefore pleasant.

### "a miserable long trip"
I had a miserable long trip from Sydney to Dallas. I was in the back row of the top part of an A380, seat 36F. There were three ladies in that row, myself included. We put the magazines from the net pocket in the top storage as there was no leg room whatsoever. All night my knees were pushed against the seat and the temperature was like a meat cooler. When the people in the row in front of us put their seats back, we were cramped beyond belief. I was on the aisle but the lady two seats over had a wall beside her and had great difficulty getting in and out of the row with the seats in front laid back. God help her if there were an emergency. I had an extra blanket in my carry-on that I wrapped around my legs and used the blanket they gave us on my torso doubled. I wore three shirts layered and used their blanket and was still cold all night. I couldn't sleep - which is unusual as I can sleep easily on most planes. In the morning people were complaining about the cold and rubbing their hands and arms so others felt the cold. Dinner was so awful, I only ate the bun, and small square of potatoes and the chocolate pudding. The broccoli/kale was burnt and tasted awful, the chicken was chewy and jellylike. I only had one bite. I suspected it either wasn't real meat or wasn't cooked properly. I was hungry in the night but I wouldn't exactly waste away so just endured. I was offered a chili cheese dog in the night but it smelled awful. The lady beside my had the lasagna and did not eat it either. In the morning, people were choosing the yogurt/fruit option. I don't think anyone wanted more cooked options from this flight. When we got on, The couple beside us on the wall - each had a glass of wine and the couple in front of them also each had a glass of wine. Then they were served a second glass of wine and the cart moved forward. When our row was finally asked - the attendant just said "Do you want chicken or lasagna? I told her chicken and then asked her if there was there a reason we were not offered a cocktail as the couples beside us were on their second" She said "Oh it was the lady's birthday and the other couple are newlyweds going home from their honeymoon". Then she asked if I wanted a cocktail and I said "Well I would have liked one twenty minutes ago when they got their second one but not now when I have my food". The sarcasm was totally lost with her and she just said ok and moved on. We got on the flight about 3:30 pm and dinner was all done and cleaned up by about 6:00 pm. It was like the staff just wanted to get it over with and by 7:00 pm, lights went down and so did the temperature. They have a big long fancy menu but you are not offered even half of the items. In Nov. I had flown Toronto to UK, to South Africa, to Sydney, to Melbourne, back to Sydney, to Dallas and to Fort Meyers, FL, I had seen lots of economy seats and none were this close or uncomfortable or cold. The couple right beside the exit door in the two seats along the wall looked well into their seventies. It wasn't the most comforting thought that they were in charge of opening the emergency door. The staff were distant - not friendly. Maybe the plane is just too big and it becomes a chore for them but it didn't feel as if they enjoyed their job. The trip of a lifetime ended badly.

### "the smallest seat since the 70's"
Qantas you should be ashamed of yourselves. I was so looking forward to coming home and on a Qantas flight too! So I get on and find the smallest seat since the 70's and the seat in front goes back with a clunk. No halfway decisions here! When the meal is delivered the tray is so small that the only thing they can deliver is a roll, and main and a pudding dumped down unceremoniously. The movie I tried to watch froze at least 6 times, I asked for a reset and got nothing. I just kept restarting the movie and going back to the freeze area and trying again, so also on another movie, same. Have flown in recent years, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore and a few others, all superior to this flight. Qantas used to be so good, what happened? The cabin crew need a serious retrain. Sorry, despite having a few Q FF points left I shall reconsider whether this is the best FF programme for me to be part of. Get your act together to rejoin the world class flights system that you should belong in.

### "could have been managed much better"
Sydney to Hobart. The flight was delayed by 45 minutes just because they had to get a handicapped person in the flight. I have been a frequent flyer and I understand this could have been managed much better. Other flights arrange for special management of this type of situation. Another 100 passengers are not required to wait if one person has to be boarded. Instead, the arrangements to bring guests this person on board and requesting the person to arrive a few minutes earlier could have saved time. There appeared to be another reason for delay of flight and it appeared that on boarding a handicapped person was just an excuse. They were still filling out fuel 15 minutes after the boarding time started. Their crew started to arrive at the gate many minutes later than the boarding time. This was frustrating.

### "IFE was superb"
An impressive Qantas Airways flight throughout the smooth 13 hour journey from Sydney to Santiago aboard a Boeing 747-400 with refurbished cabin. A welcome drink was served soon after I settled into my seat. The seat in premium economy was very comfortable with generous legroom and a foot rest. Country Road amenieties kit (eye mask, socks) was given to premium economy passengers, a nice touch. The IFE was superb with so much selection, but the touchscreen was less intuitive than the ones in newer planes. The crew were excellent, they moved and served really fast. The food (lunch) was a bit letdown, I had some grilled chicken and vegetables which looked very 'gourmet' ish but didn't taste super delicious, they weren't bad but I wouldn't have it again. The breakfast (omelette and sausages) was better.

### "outstanding value for money"
A very pleasant experience and outstanding value for money. Despite the endless flying time and given the miles flown it was very comfortable on board with great meals, good entertainment and attentive staff. I arrived happily inbound and outbound and would fly Qantas any time again. Flights were always on time, catering well above average, and staff just very pleasant.

### "crew were not overly friendly"
Flew Qantas from Canberra to Melbourne. It was okay. It’s just a short flight. The crew were not overly friendly or terribly approachable. I’d downloaded the entertainment app and couldn’t get it to work but instead of assisting, they just said try later. Not a fan of BYO tablet/phone and miss the screens built in. The seat pocket had crumbs and cellophane from a previous flight. They distributed drinks - fruit juice , water, coffee and a packet of the driest mini shortbreads ever. Ugh. The last time I took this route we got bottle of water and a muffin at least. For the most expensive domestic airline in Australia it’s now no better than Virgin.

### "last time I fly Qantas"
Sydney to Brisbane. After booking my seat online for me and my partner together, I arrive at the terminal and check-in. I get given two B tickets in two different rows. So we are both seated between two complete strangers in the worst seats possible and aren't even together. If Jetstar can seat us together than why can't Qantas! Why don't they offer a choice of seating next time and instead of having it in the fine print that cannot be clearly seen how about you put it clearly when you are selecting your tickets. This is the 1st and last time I fly Qantas! If you cannot get seating right yet your competitors can, then I'll be flying with them.

### "minimal staff available to help"
Melbourne to Perth. Qantas flight delayed 2 hours, then after boarding left on plane for another 2 hours before being told that another plane was coming from Perth and would then leave at 12.30 pm and allowed back into the terminal. No vouchers were available despite being told we would receive a $15 voucher - minimal staff available to help and no access to the Qantas club which was empty. Total disorganisation.

### "could not fault Qantas staff"
Compliment to Qantas staff. Our departure from Sydney airport to Bangkok was delayed as a result of a power failure at the airport. This resulted in us being unable to connect with our flight to Krabi. During the flight the Qantas staff informed us that they had made alternative arrangements for us with new flights the next morning and accommodation in Bangkok. The gentleman in charge and our steward could not have done any more to make us stress free, comfortable and valued. We cannot speak highly enough of these two gentleman. The captain of the plane even chatted to us. When we left the plane we were greeted by ground staff who directed us to collect our luggage and then escorted us to the transfer point for the hotel. We could not have asked for better service. We have been overseas many times and even though it meant we were delayed we could not fault Qantas staff for there help.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
Auckland to Sydney. My first time flying home on Qantas economy from New Zealand, usually I'm in the Business Cabin but on this occasion I was travelling with my partner and the A330 had the appropriate layout for couple seating. The trip started with a visit to the Lounge and on this occasion the food was delicious. The flight departed 45 minutes late due to the late arrival because of storms over Auckland, not something the airline can control though we ended up arriving on time, great job from the pilot and first officer. Flight attendants were very nice, always scene walking through the Cabin. Maybe it was my luck, but food offered on the flight was delicious also, I should have asked for seconds. Snacks was also distributed consistently. Overall a very enjoyable flight, I was definitely glad to be home.

### "needs a lift in performance"
Sydney to Melbourne. Another average performance by Qantas, but as I do fly domestically quite often nothing surprises me these days. Flight departed 20 minutes late because of incoming aircraft and arrived into Melbourne 20 minutes past schedule. Onboard service was good, not great. From what I saw, the Customer Service Manager was the only person you can hear speaking, other Cabin Crew seemed very quiet. Food was quite delicious, I especially enjoyed the dessert. IFE was disappointing, though some content was new it wasn't all that great. Definitely needs a lift in performance, as lately it has not been consistent.

### "makes flying quite impersonal"
Sydney to Brisbane return. From online Check-In through to airport security, everything was seamless. I find there is not many Ground Team at the airport besides the Lounge, which makes flying quite impersonal considering the large monopoly Qantas has on Domestic Travel within Australia. Both flights were on time, Cabin Crew were present and the IFE was updated, which is a bonus. Hopefully my next flight wont be so dull.

### "not be flying with Qantas anymore"
Adelaide to Sydney. We request wheelchair assistance online before travelling and was confirmed via email by Qantas. We arrived at the airport and the staff told us there is no wheelchair available and assistance was not provided. After telling them I have booked and made a fuss, they gave us a wheelchair and we had to push my father with COPD all the way. Getting off at Sydney, the wheelchair was not prepared during our exit of the flight. I am very angry and disappointed. If I allowed my father to travel alone and trusted this service it would have negatively affected his health. I will not be flying with Qantas anymore after so long. If you need wheelchair assistance don't fly Qantas. If you have a family member who needs assistance don't book Qantas and don't trust them. I have filed a complaint to Qantas and the reply was please accept their apology. If anything happened due to their failure to provide such essential service, is an apology enough?

### "the worst airline of the year"
Dubai to Sydney via Melbourne. I had a very disappointing experience with Qantas. Due to circumstances we wanted to change our flight form Darwin – Adelaide. Online we got a message “contact the office”. So we tried to telephone 131313. We placed three calls: the first one being 37 minutes, the second one being 20 minutes and the third one more than 40 minutes but we never got anybody on the line, only some completely ridiculous ever repeating message. So we purchased some internet time, and we tried the “chat”. It worked. But in the end the person could not help because there was a small fee involved, and he could not handle financial transactions. He advised us to contact either an office or by telephone. Contacting an office Friday at 9PM in Alice Springs is certainly not evident. And telephoning not possible. So service of Qantas is zero, nothing. We solved the problem by booking a flight Alice Springs-Darwin by Virgin Australia. 2. I don’t think anybody of the Management has ever travelled in economy class. The food is bad. On our flight Dubai-Melbourne we got as breakfast (after a flight of 11 hours) a small box containing cereals and some milk. Bread? Eggs? Fruit? On the similar flight Adelaide to Dubai operated by Emirates, we even got a choice of eggs, we got fruit, we got bread. On the flight Darwin-Adelaide we got as lunch a small box containing some Asian food. Nothing else. Honestly, the smallest roadside shop sells 10 times better food than this. It was simply disgusting,Drinks have to be paid for! On the flight by Virgin Australia we got a decent lunch and free drinks. Qantas have no official site where one can make complaints, and E-mail messages are not replied to, maybe somewhere next year – who knows. All this makes me sure to nominate Qantas as the worst airline of the year.

### "departed late, no explanation"
QF768 from Perth to Melbourne departed 2 hours late on 30/10/2017 with no reasonable explanation from ground staff. On board the flight attendant openly displayed her annoyance when asked to explain the menu. To avoid further annoyance to her I took the meal she had in her hand which was a mixture of refrigerated rice, boiled chick peas and chicken. Truly an apology for a meal. Customer service needs to be monitored by Qantas. It would be nice to send customers an email enquiring about their experience on board Qantas. Perhaps then would we see better customer service

### "consistently good service"
Consistently good service. I fly this route (Manila to Brisbane via Sydney) approximately 20 times per year, and find that the service is always genuine, warm and competent. On checking in was great by the duty manager who personally welcomed me, introduced herself, thanked me for flying with them regularly and let me know if there was anything at all in needed to let her know. Decided to attempt to use the Japan Airlines lounge under oneworld sapphire status for a change of scenery but was directed the mascor lounge across the way instead, who were happy to accomodate me as Qantas are a client anyway. Similar to the Qantas Lounge (which is so-so in Manila, but the universal case with all lounges there) but better range of food and more space - so would recommend giving this a go if stuck there. Once on board staff were excellent, taking care of everyone well throughout the entire flight. Aircraft the A330-200, so not as nice (smaller ife screens) as the refurbished -300’s flying into much of Asia, but still clean and well presented. Landed ahead of schedule and transited the Qantas Club for a shower, coffee and breakfast before heading onward on an uneventful connecting flight to Brisbane. All in all great experience!

### "Seats were threadbare"
We flew San Francisco - Sydney - San Francisco. While we flew in the last rows of two seats, we were more comfortable than most. Our main issue is with the condition of these ancient 747s. We flew different ones outbound from return. The cabin condition of these worn out planes is beyond pathetic. On the way out we counted several fluorescent lights burned out and flickering. Some had been replaced with different color tones. Seats were threadbare at the top of the back where people hold on. On the way back both headphone plugs did not work. Two overhead fluorescent lights came on early in the flight, and could not be turned off. We counted 14 overhead lights out in our section! It looked like a third world aircraft. Qantas: Time to put these 747s out of their misery and park them in the desert. Makes one think of how they skimp on the important maintenance! Also on the return trip we were delayed several hours with mechanical issues.

### "Very relaxed flight"
QF971, October 26, Townsville to Brisbane. Checked in on mobile but for some reason boarding pass wasn't forwarded on so when I arrived at Townsville airport I was issued with paper boarding pass, no ID asked for as they did in Brisbane. Townsville airport always very quiet, no queue when I've travelled and security quick and very friendly staff. Flight appeared full. Seat request 28c aisle. As soon as we had taken off I was immediately given my Gluten Free meal as it was a lunch time flight. It was a vegetarian burger and on the box stated all the other allergies it was free from, it was a very generous size and tasty. Also a rows brownie and drinks served. Cabin crew busy and polite and noticed one male cabin crew very helpful to someone travelling with a baby. Very relaxed flight and arrived safely on time.

### "it was a positive experience"
Flew Hong Kong to Auckland via Sydney. First long haul flight with Qantas. I was impressed with the new aircraft and the comfortable seats with generous legroom and rather large screens for IFE. The service was also very friendly and accommodating. However, there were also a few downsides: I had ordered a Vegetarian special meal, and the food was inedible – easily the worst airplane food that I have had for quite a while. Furthermore, Qantas does not allow you to choose your seat at the online check-in, which is a major inconvenience if you are travelling with people who are not in the same reservation. Fortunately, the problem could be sorted out by the Qantas ground-staff once we arrived at the airport. Overall, it was a positive experience, primarily because the seats were more comfortable than with most other airlines in Economy and allowed me to get some rest.

### "New comfortable seating"
A five day trip to Singapore starting out on QF 81. Being a QFF the whole Qantas experience these days is very satisfying. Check in is through the priority channels which makes life a whole lot smoother. I'm old school and still like to be checked in by hand and not have to go through the self check in bit. Up to the business lounge and this is where Qantas needs to do some work. It was a Sunday morning flight so the place was packed with the Asia departures which all leave in the morning. The F & B were fine but Qantas should look at extending the lounge. The flight itself was uneventful. it was a refurbished A330 so the ICE was the new touchscreen. New comfortable seating and the FA's were great. Asked for a Jack Daniels and Coke and was served a quadruple which nicely put me out for a few hours.

### "everything is always a bit rushed"
The return leg from a Singapore trip in QF82. It was the 8.20 pm departure which was a refurbished A330 and I think more comfortable than the 11.30pm departure which has the older product. It was a quick flight (7.15 hours) so everything is always a bit rushed. 1.5 hours for the dinner service, 1.5 hours before landing for the breakfast service and it does not leave a whole lot of time to sleep. The flight crew did their stuff very professionally and before long we were back into Sydney. A satisfying flight.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Melbourne to Brisbane. I enjoyed my flight. There was a slight delay because of excess hand baggage taken onto the flight but that was no big issue. The staff were very efficient and friendly. I was impressed by the meal that was provided as well as excellent wine and coffee. The IFE was very good as well. Overall a very pleasant flight.

### "seat was unbelievably uncomfortable"
Flew Qantas from Brisbane to Townsville. It was a return flight from Brisbane to Townsville. The first leg was on a B717 with good legroom and pretty comfortable seats. The refreshment they served was not too bad. There was a possibility of using Qantas app to watch TV or a movie onboard. The cabin crew were nice. The only negative point was that they changed my seat before boarding, without letting me know! It was disappointing. The return flight was a bad experience. It was a B737 and I had expected to be in a better aircraft. But I was so wrong. The legroom was awful and the seat was unbelievably uncomfortable. Upon landing I had a sore back. The cabin crew were disinterested. Besides, passengers had to pay for drinks. This was the first time I noticed paid service on a Qantas flight. The aircraft had small back seat screens with a choice between news, a few movies, and some travel information.

### "really disappointed with them"
Unexpected experience with Qantas. Actually I'm loyal customer with Virgin Australia, and this is the third time I fly with the Qantas. I always thought Qantas is the best airline in Australia but now I doubt it as too many things happens once I want to flight back to Sydney. My flight has been cancelled, and they only noticed me 3 hours before my flight departure. I told my wife that something happened with our flight but it is been solved. But unfortunately, once I arrive to airport and I have been told from ground crew that there is no seats available for our new flight, which means I have to move to next flight, and also i have to seat separately with my wife even so we bought ticket together and pick up the seats together more than weeks before when we bought the ticket. After that I try to ask him that is there other solution he can do for us, and he told me that there were still some people cannot check in, which making me feel that I am an lucky guy! Qantas charge the highest price within Australia domestic airline, but this time I'm really disappointed with them, not recommend at all!

### "too much happened for my liking"
Perth to Sydney. As I was waiting in the Lounge I looked over my shoulder and noticed my flight was cancelled, and the next flight out was at 2300 and that the plane will arrive the next morning because of the time zone. There was no reason given for the cancellation, and the ground crew just looked clueless, which just didn't help the situation. By the time I reach the Sales Desk, a lot of flights were booked out so I opted to get the earliest morning flight and Qantas put me in a hotel for the night, a nice gesture for the inconvenience. Next morning the departure was on time plus the Cabin Crew were quite lovely during the whole flight and surprisingly one of the FA remembered me, I did feel a quite special. Breakfast was delicious and further snacks was provided before landing. Once we landed in Sydney, there was a commotion at the back of the plane, the Cabin Crew were very frantic and looked stressed out. There was a medical situation with one passenger and a medical personnel was asked to volunteer for assistance. I definitely think the situation could have been handled a lot better. A better domestic flight this time around, just too much happened for my liking.

### "Cabin Crew were a highlight"
Melbourne to Perth. I had high expectations for this flight in regards to hard product and inflight service. I had a two hour transit after a flight from Auckland. I'm very happy to be flying on the Business Suite, as it's one of the longest domestic flight in Australia and using a B737 is a let down. The flight was delayed because of a late arrival from Sydney and there was not really any notice given as passengers were looking for answers. Once airborne, the inflight service began and once again the Cabin Crew were a highlight during the flight, very professional and caring. Lunch was served, much better offering than my AKL to MEL flight the same morning. IFE was a bit limited compared to international routes which is disappointing, definitely something Qantas need to be consistent on. Overall, a smooth flight paired with great service.

### "Cabin Crew were the highlight"
Auckland to Melbourne. Check In was done very efficiently, I was even given my boarding pass for my onward flight to Perth and after security and passport control, I headed off to the Lounge to enjoy breakfast. Once boarding began, I was greeted by the Cabin Crew who seemed to be more personal and genuinely care compared to my last few flights with Qantas. Once airborne, the inflight service began with breakfast (my second Breakfast) and to be honest it was one of the worst meals to date, as everything tasted dry and overcooked. I've started noticing that the IFE has less or more content depending on the route being served, and as a frequent flyer and a loyal customer I do think more is better. The Cabin Crew were the highlight of the flight, very attentive and present during the journey. Coming into Melbourne was the roughest landing I have experienced.

### "Boarding was well organised and efficient"
Flew Qantas from Tokyo Haneda to Sydney. Check in was well organised and efficient. Clearing customs at Tokyo's Haneda Airport was seamless. As a Qantas Frequent Flyer I had access to the well appointed Sakura lounge which had a good range of food and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The upper level of the lounge had comfortable lounges and massage chairs. Boarding was well organised and efficient. What made the flight, as with many Qantas flights that I take, was the quality of the crew on board. The crew was made up of very experienced flight attendants who carry out their tasks with the utmost professionalism and customer care. My daughter and I managed to obtain exit row seats in row 58 (for a modest additional cost) which made the 9 hour flight in economy much more comfortable. The crew on board made my daughter and I feel very comfortable and relaxed from the moment we boarded and we felt throughout the whole experience that we were in safe hands. Having flown on other airlines and with Jetstar in recent times I find that more often than not the younger crews inexperience in comparison is very apparent during the flight. They lack organisational skills and the care and repartee that you have with more experienced crews and I hope that this experience is valued by Qantas management as I believe it is one of the airlines greatest assets.

### "inconsistency in domestic service"
Sydney to Melbourne. A hit and miss service, I find the Sydney Qantas Terminal very sparse with no staff anywhere to be found base on the number of times I have travelled. It's well equiped with ticket kiosk and baggage machines but having no presence of airline ground crew is very impersonal. I'm starting to notice inconsistency in their domestic service, it can great and other experiences beg to differ. The Crew onboard my flight were quite robotic, not the best performance. Food was average, but the IFE was very good with new content. Thankfully it was a short flight, and I'm hoping my next flight won't be so grim.

### "a waste of time"
Travelled with Qantas on an Emirates codes share. Big mistake as if you require an extra legroom seat and want to pay. Qantas are unable to do anything for you. They just say sorry we can not access your booking please go to the airport early. Very tight seat pitch and if over 5'5" you are in for a nightmare. Overnight flight unable to rest at all, staff friendly but just want you to go to sleep. Entertainment OK, but the screen will be in your face if the person in the seat in front reclines. Will never travel again with Qantas or recommend. Very disappointing customer service from both facebook and telephone call centre just a waste of time.

### "poor communication of delay"
Sydney to Singapore. Business class on the A330 is the best of the business offering by Qantas. Cabin crew were great, professional with friendliness. I am not a fan of the Rockpool menu selections and found neither of the second meal choices satisfactory. The aircraft left 1 hour and 40 minutes late and made up about 40 minutes on route. Very poor communication of the ongoing delay on the ground detracted from the experience in the air.

### "pleasant trans-Tasman flight "
Auckland to Brisbane. Very pleasant trans-Tasman flight with Qantas. Excellent service and decent food. I was served a vegetable curry, ice cream and a piece of chocolate before landing. Furthermore, water was served throughout the flight. The only downside was the rather narrow seat pitch, even though it was still acceptable for a three-hour flight.

### "part of the cost savings announced"
Hong Kong to Sydney. Boarded aircraft after double security check, the safety video didn't work and the confused flight attendants stood dumbfounded finally someone took control. The onboard entertainment equipment didn't work until about thirty minutes into the flight when it was rebooted. There was rubbish jammed in my seat from a previous flight which wasn't cleaned up. The food was abysmal, obvious part of the cost savings announced. The toilets stunk, didn't flush properly. The cabin crew were tired looking embarrassed by the service they had to provide. The cabin wasn't cleared of used blankets, headphones etc prior to disembarking and we had to disembark such a large aircraft through one door at the front of the aircraft. Qantas is a third world airline when compared to the likes of Emirates, Singapore and the likes. I am ashamed to be an Australian if this is all we can offer from our national carrier.

### "outdid all my expectations"
Melbourne to Singapore. Flight was delayed 45 min due to technical reasons. Onboard the crew were a joy, the purser came to each passenger in business class and explained the delay, suggesting how to minimize the transfer delays upon arrival in Singapore. The crew were very professional in their service delivery. During flight they were present in the cabin offering drinks snacks etc. The business seat is comfortable with a duvet and a mattress sheet provided. The only gripe was there was only one washroom for a full premium cabin. .antas is a fantastic airline and this crew outdid all my expectations.

### "overall a very good experience"
Flew Perth to Melbourne and return. Pleasantly surprised. Traveled with wife, toddler and baby. Flight on-time, ground and inflight service was great, the staff were very helpful. Food was quite decent (2 choices on leg over, 3 choices on return leg), inflight entertainment was good. It was a overall a very good experience flying Qantas. I've flown a lot of international airlines over the years and I feel we take Qantas for granted here in Australia. There wasn't anything superb, but it all felt very good, and that everything ran like clockwork.

### "the worst experience"
I flew from Bangkok to Sydney for approximately 10 hours flight. It was the worst experience. The food was terrible and the portion really small for such a long flight. The flight attendant  was very impatient, the worst service you can imagine. I would never make this mistake again or fly with Qantas.

### "Cabin Crew were just so impersonal"
Melbourne To Sydney. Another average performance, originally my flight was meant to depart Melbourne at 6.15pm, but the flight was cancelled the previous night due to "Mechanical Reasons" which I highly doubt. I was booked onto the next flight which was 6.30pm, but what frustrates me the most is that I highly think they cancelled my original flight because it wasn't fully booked. I just don't see any reason as to why they need a 6.00, 6.15, 6.30, 6.45 and 7.00 in the evening, it is so pointless. Other than that escapade, boarding was early considering how full the plane was and I managed to only get an economy seat all the way at the front at last minute. Dinner was served once airborne, at which point I felt that the Cabin Crew were just so impersonal. They really need to lighten up! The journey was on schedule, that is about the only good thing with this latest flight.

### "service is a bit hit and miss"
Sydney to Melbourne. It was a very early morning trip, starting at 6:30am and to my surprise there was no one available to assist passengers until 5am. After receiving my boarding pass I headed straight to the Lounge to enjoy breakfast. It was a full flight so boarding was slightly chaotic. This is one of the longest flight between the two cities I have ever had because for some reason, the plane made a u-turn during the journey and the trip took almost 1.5 hours. Not Impressed by the slightest! Breakfast was also offered during the inflight service, IFE was updated with new content and Cabin Crew were pleasant. Lately the service by Qantas is a bit hit and miss, they really need to be more consistent, especially for domestic routes.

### "Cabin crew were very pleasant"
Sydney to Brisbane. Departure was on time, with a slight delay once on the runway as strong winds permitted only one runway to be available. Cabin crew were very pleasant, smiles all around. Hot food as offered during the flight and it was delicious. During the journey there was turbulent at times, but a smooth ride overall. Great job Qantas.

### "Very comfortable seats"
Johannesburg to Brisbane via Sydney. Very comfortable seats bulkhead window with plenty of space. Champagne on boarding was decent champagne as opposed to sparkling wine. Unfortunate 2 hour delay due to problems in starting engines - a sign of the age of the 747's perhaps, but the captain kept us informed and the crew supplied water. Once under way service was excellent, bar service with meal quickly following. Choice of two meals, including a beef stir fry which was very good. Good wines and attentive service throughout the meal. By this time my wife was asleep and slept for over 8 hours. She woke up once and the attendant produced a very tasty snack for her. The 747 is perhaps showing signs of age and is significantly noisier than the A380, but it is still a great aircraft. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, but so much depends on the crew who were top rate. Overall the premium economy service is good, and offers a lot of advantages, not the least of which is the lack reduction in queues and hassles. Due to the delay in leaving, a lot of connections were affected, but details of changes were made known before landing. We were just able to make the Brisbane connection, with ground staff organized to give passengers priority and ensure nobody got lost.

### "the let down is the meals"
Melbourne to Sydney. An otherwise pleasant and punctual flight on Qantas, using Business Class Upgrade so I could get some work done as Economy on Qantas' B737 is overly cramped for me. Nice wine and very good service but the let down is the meals. Qantas seems to have a fixation with cheese and cheese dishes - I believe all options on this lunch time flight had cheese somewhere in them! I wonder why Qantas (and some other airlines for that matter) don't realise that cheese and chocolate can make some people very ill. So the result was that I just had a piece of bread and butter for lunch - in Business Class. I'm dreading my next Qantas flight (which will be long haul, as you can bet most of the dishes will be centred around cheese, especially for breakfast. Oh well, sometimes I feel like I'm in a Monty Python film when flying Qantas and can remember the famous line: "Blessed are the Cheesemakers" - maybe this has become a Qantas slogan too.

### "experience was quite pleasant"
Melbourne to Sydney. Despite the flight being late for 1.5 hours because of congestion, the experience from the Business Lounge to departure was quite pleasant. I had trouble Checking In, but the Ground Crew were efficient with sorting out my problem and was able to retrieve my boarding pass. I was very happy to be seated in the Business Suite, the points upgrade was definitely worth it. An express lunch was served along with plenty of options for drinks and the cabin crew were lovely and approachable.

### "much more than anticipated"
Cairns to Hong Kong via Sydney. It was a very good experience, much more than anticipated! Everything ran smoothly and the plane / seats seemed pretty new. The seats were comfy, I had enough room for my legs (i'm 182cm tall) and the food was pretty good for an airline meal.

### "very average performance"
Melbourne to Sydney. A very average performance by Qantas. On time departure with an early arrival. The team were a lot more enthusiastic than my previous flight, addressing me and other passengers by name. The plane used had no entertainment screens, so my phone was an alternative to access IFE but the content needed an update. Snacks and drinks were offered, nothing substantial. I'm hoping my next flight is a bit more uplifting.

### "Crew were impersonal and very robotic"
Sydney to Melbourne. Started with a visit to the Qantas Club, a lot more peaceful this time around. To my memory there was no announcement of boarding call, which is quite odd but lucky for me I always make sure I'm at the gate on time, every time. Boarding was unorganised with the Priority lane not set up properly, and people not meeting the baggage requirement. Once onboard, the Crew were impersonal and very robotic which in my opinion is not appropriate for Qantas standards. The flight landed early into Melbourne, great to see performance of schedule is uphold to. Overall, I think the crew who serviced my flight needs a spruce up in training.

### "worst inflight service"
Melbourne to Singapore. The worst inflight service I have had, the attendants we encountered was rude, talked to each other loudly, having a casual conversation during serve the food, while we were waiting one of them to approach us. They served your food withought saying anything. Even gave an attitude that we did not pass our trash to her because she assumed she could not reach it.

### "will go somewhere else"
As a gold frequent flyer I have 46 kg baggage allowance. Booking a flight from Perth to Singapore, with stopover in Singapore. I'm checking in, everything is fine. Then half an hour later I get a call saying the second flight (which is Jetstar operated and has a QF number) only gives me 30kg baggage allowance saying I need to pay 280$ extra. If I had booked extra baggage allowance online I would have paid 18$ not 280$! This is how you get treated for all your loyalty and on gold status. We will give up our gold status and go somewhere else.

### "wish I cancelled my trip"
I was booked from Canberra to Gold Coast via Sydney which was suppose to depart Canberra at 4:20, re-routed to Melbourne then Brisbane and told free courtesy bus to the Gold Coast. Absolutely disgusted with lack of communication from Qantas staff and lack of knowledge I ended up stranded in Brisbane and had to uber the ride. Not happy Qantas, if you make arrangements stick to them. I asked for a refund in Canberra and I was told I would be looked after, how I wish I got my refund and cancelled my trip.

### "Really good flights"
Brisbane to Cairns, 90% full flights. Both flights departed 5 minutes early and arrived on time. Both flights on newer Boeing 737 aircraft with IFE. IFE appears to have been enhanced with more entertainment options. Leg room adequate. Snack service up and dinner service back. Drinks ample. Service from flight staff professional. Bags on belt within 15 minutes at both airports. Really good flights.

### "Seat pitch is acceptable"
Perth to Sydney is one of the longest domestic flights in Australia, a total of 4.5 hours, crossing 2 time zones. Qantas uses a spacious A330 for this route. Business class is the new pod style 1-2-1, economy class is 2-4-2. Depending on the model, some are installed with TVs, some are provided with a special iPad, which can be installed in front of you for easy-viewing. 2 USB ports to provide for device charging. Seat pitch is acceptable, It did feel a little cramped if the person in front of me reclines. Service is efficient and fairly friendly. A choice of 3 menus available, plus free flow of wine and beer etc. Icicles offered as desserts after the meal. Overall, it is a very good experience.

### "an enjoyable experience "
Sydney to Gold Coast. I haven't taken this route for 5 years and I'm very please to see Qantas uses an updated version of the B737-800, which included very comfortable seats with proper entertainment screens and adjustable head rest. Snacks and beverages were distributed after take off in a very timely manner as the flight was only 50 minutes. The staff were all very pleasant, smiling and addressing me by my surname. Overall, an enjoyable experience once again.

### "crews on top of their game"
Great flight with Qantas. Cabin upfront is fantastic and crews are on top of their game. Flew Sydney to Perth and back. All flights operated on time and we had no issues. Luggage arrived very quickly after landing. Lounge at PER was very good with great food choices. SYD lounge is also outstanding. I can't say enough good things about all of the employees that we made contact with. Flying the A330 and the VOD was a great treat as well. I wish we had such good choices in the US as Qantas.

### "crew were always present"
Sydney to Brisbane. It was quite a smooth flight from beginning to end, starting with an on time departure. Hot food was offered, which was a great bonus. IFE had great choices but I would prefer to have front seat screens rather than use my phone to access the content. The crew were always present, with big smiles all around. Overall, it was a pleasure to fly with Qantas again.

### "outdated hard product"
Singapore to Sydney. Excellent ground staff at the Qantas lounge in Changi, very helpful, friendly and professional. . Of the 2 versions of international Business Class that Qantas operate, this A330-200 was fitted with the tired and outdated Skybed seats. Angled flat beds in 2-2-2 configuration can't compete with the modern 1-2-1 fitout many airlines now use. That said I managed 5 hours sleep so it's a definite step up from economy and PE. Crew were cheery, a warm welcome onboard, I was greeted by the inflight supervisor and was offered a 2nd main course when I was still hungry after my 1st plate of supper service, which I appreciated. The food was very good, pork and tofu wonton noodle soup followed by beef fillet and roast potatoes. So overall, excellent service and food service, let down by an outdated hard product. Hopefully Qantas continue to refurbish or retire the last of these old birds.

### "crew did a great job"
On Qantas, QF 12, New York to Sydney via Los Angeles. Now from JFK it is a B747 which then converts to QF16 back to Brisbane. Usual efficient service and on time arrival into LAX to pick up QF12 back to Sydney. Usually this is a A380. Surprise! It was a B747 that had been pressed into service as earlier on in the week an A380 had broken down in Dubai so had a major knock on effect on the Qantas schedules. It was a refurbished B747 so had the A380 style of seating. But the venerable Queen of the Skies is showing its age. Noise, vibration, harshness etc is very elevated compared to the Airbus as you would expect from a design from the 1960's. Was dreading the flight back as the Airbus is very quiet and smooth in flight. Not as bad as I had feared and it's a good reminder of why the B747 revolutionised travel. The flight crew did a great job. We were 80 minutes late leaving due to some repair work but made some time up. The 747 is being pensioned off as the 787 kicks in. Thank you for your service in Qantas colours over the years.

### "mainline service is fine"
Another quick trip to the US with Qantas. Sydney to Dallas and then onwards to NY. QF7 to Dallas and these days it's great to report that the mainline service is fine. On time departure an arrival into DFW. Smooth sailing all the way. It is time for Qantas to rejig its menu. On the five trips to the US this year it has been identical. From Dallas to NY it was on an AA codeshare. American have their act together and painless journey to La Guardia on an A321. As per usual AA only give out a glass of water and bag of snacks. BYO!

### "extremely disappointing"
This was my first time flying Qantas business class as I normally fly Air NZ. The seats from Bali to Auckland via Sydney did not lie flat or incline much. The food and service was terrible. This was false advertising it should definitely not be advertised as business class. Extremely disappointing.

### Qantas Airways customer review
I am a regular business traveller and need to travel across the world for business purposes. This was my first time flying with Qantas from Mumbai to Sydney, as all other flights were sold out. The cabin crew were OK. My food preference was 'Hindu Veg Meal'. The food was packed in a red plastic packet. Overall, the only thing I liked about the flight was a kitkat they offered.

### "cabin crew were exceptional"
London to Melbourne, a wonderful experience. The cabin crew were exceptional, were very patient and kind to elderly passengers around us. Whilst  I have been fortunate to have previously flown Business Class I was a little disappointed that no upgrades were available for this flight but that disappointment was overcome by the wonderful experience I had in Premium Economy.

### "an outstanding product"
Hong Kong to Sydney. Despite having long queues at traditional counter counters, the bag drop counter offers fast track counters to passengers who checked in online. The 40 inch pitch seat surprised me. Seated at the window seat at the last row (28K), the degree of recline does not decrease. The flight was delayed for approximately 90 minutes. Flight attendants friendly. The Skyloft in A380-800 offers a snack bar and a place to chat with crew and passengers. The premium economy cuisine which offers remarkable alcoholic drinks from Hunter Valley and a choice of menu. The only thing that Qantas should improve for this flight is the portion of breakfast, which only consist cornflakes and fruit platters. The IFE doesnot go fullscreen when it come to the flight path, which is a bit disappointing for aviation fans like me. However, it is an outstanding product in terms of money.

### "no complaints about seat comfort"
Qantas (QF542) Sydney to Brisbane 16 July. Check-in and boarding pass done on mobile phone so much easier. Flight was delayed by 20 minutes. Qantas kept us updated saying they had found something they had found they were checking as they were not happy for us to board yet. Aisle seat as requested but the bonus on this return flight was other two seats empty and 3 seats behind empty so no complaints about seat comfort. Pilot apologised for delay but safety is a priority. Also he told us of the views so got a good view of Sydney Harbour at night and Story Bridge in Brisbane. Soon after take of gluten free meal served. Roast turkey and vegetables and chocolate cake. Cold drinks but no complimentary alcohol on this 17.35 flight. For anyone who is diagnosed coeliac Qantas gluten free meals are very good. Arrived safely even though late.

### "gluten free meal was very good"
Qantas (QF549) July 14 Brisbane to Sydney. Check-in and boarding pass on mobile phone. As only took hand luggage very quick through security check. Aisle seat near back of plane as requested. Took off on time. Dinner served on such a short flight so cabin crew busy all the time. Gluten free meal was very good. Rice and slightly spiced chicken, a moist chocolate sponge cake and cold drinks served. Alcohol offered complimentary on this evening flight. On coming into land one of the cabin crew noticed a passenger in the window seat was experiencing a lot of ear trouble and went out of her way to give advise and what the cabin crew do when they have same trouble.

### "staff were nice and friendly"
New York JFK to Perth via Los Angeles and Sydney and it was pretty good. The seat was amazing the legroom was the same. The IFE was nice but needed more movies, and staff were nice and friendly. The food was pretty good there was not one meal besides breakfast that I did not like or enjoy. There was a delay between Los Angeles and Sydney  but luckily Qantas gave us another flight free because it was not our fault.

### "flight was fantastic"
Johannesburg to Gold Coast via Sydney. The flight was fantastic. The friendly staff and the dinner was enjoyable. However the hot breakfast needs to be revamped. Fresh fruit, muesli, yogurt and a muffin or croissant would be a big improvement. The chicken and grain salad offered on the second leg was also very enjoyable.

### "The leg room was roomy"
Perth to Singapore is a very popular route with multiple airlines both premium and budget. The aircraft was new, not refurbished, the entertainment system was upgraded with plenty to keep my 3 kids busy. Best of all I picked everything from my food, seating online. It was exactly what was ordered amazing right, you get what you asked for a concept that is missing to other airlines these days. The leg room was roomy, amenities great and my kids loved the food that was served. It was not normal meal served on a kids tray, they loved the food. My wife and I had our food which was pre selected and it was delicious. F&B was done quickly and cleaned up and just rested all the way. Well done QF and thanks for the experience, we will be back.

### "crew was very friendly"
Perth to Singapore. Qantas Airways is one of the best airlines, the crew was very friendly helped me with me with my hand luggage since I had a shoulder injury and service one of the best I have experienced. I would recommend Qantas. Unfortunately, I Cannot remember any names in the crew but hey did an outstanding job.

### "crew was very friendly"
Qantas Airways is one of my favourite airlines. The crew was very friendly on my flight from Perth to Singapore and helped me with me with my hand luggage since I had a shoulder injury. The service is some of the best I have experienced. I would definitely recommend Qantas to anyone who is flying in and out of Australia.

### "it was a great experience"
Flew from San Francisco to Sydney leaving 24/6/2017 on QF74. The crew could not have been more friendly or helpful. Service was outstanding. Meals tasty and snacks and water brought around at regular intervals. I don't usually bother to do reviews, but it was a great experience, and just wanted to commend Qantas on the crew on this flight.

### "Overall, a nice experience."
Sydney to Melbourne, seated in seat 3A. This was a redemption ticket booked on the Cathay Pacific website. I was not given a boarding pass when checked in online but told to go to the check in kiosk. In any case, the flight was uneventful. FA's were great, unobtrusive but efficient. Served a full meal with wine and coffee by a very genial male attendant. Boarding was a little fretful as it was a full flight and many passengers were business passengers travelling at the end of the day and everyone had a piece of hand luggage. Baggage was delivered on time. Overall, a nice experience.

### "Staff member friendly and informative"
QF971, Townsville to Brisbane 28 June. Online check-in and mobile phone boarding pass. No bag drop off at Townsville so had to go to Qantas counter. Staff member friendly and informative when I was discussing recent report on Qantas possibilities of pulling out of Townsville. Flight was due to take off 11.35 am but running a little late but kept informed by pilot and said we would make up time. Aisle seat requested, snack and hot/cold drinks provided. Only negative for me was that somewhere in the system my Gluten free meal request was not offered when other gluten free requests were given out. On being offered a hot sausage roll which I declined and explained that I requested Gluten free, the cabin crew brought a gluten free biscuit. Not a problem for a short flight and the cabin crew kept busy. Arrived safely.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Melbourne to Sydney. There were some problems with checking in via the computer but the staff were helpful. The staff were very friendly and efficient, and served a very tasty meal as well as beer. There was no IFE on the seat but there were plenty of stations to choose on the from and there was the opportunity to watch overhead cabin TV. Overall a very pleasant flight.

### "also served good coffee"
Sydney to Melbourne. Check in was easy and the plane left on time. A delicious meal was served and the white wine offered was excellent. They also served good coffee. Seat back IFE with a very good choice of music and videos.

### "plane was very comfortable"
Dubai to Melbourne. Boarding was well organised. The staff were very friendly and efficient and cheerful and couldn't do enough. The meal was very tasty, I was disappointed they only served one meal on a 13 hour flight .After that they only served two snacks (a pizza and calzone). They did offer water, drinks and snacks which was much appreciated. But similar airlines on similar or shorter flights offered 2 main meals. IFE was very good and the plane was very comfortable .

### "great job Qantas."
Sydney to Auckland. Originally my flight was meant to be a Codeshare QF321 operated by Latam Airlines, but on the previous night I received a call from Qantas saying the flight from Santiago to Sydney via Auckland was delayed which mean my flight was to depart Sydney for Auckland at 14:00 instead of 11:10. Qantas made the situation very easy by putting my reservation to their 11:15 departure for Auckland. The Business Lounge was very busy, though being a 11:15 departure that was inevitable. Still, the Lounge had great food and beverages including very attentive staff members. The flight at times was quite turbulent, it affected the timing of meals being served and the overall schedule of the Cabin Crew. The service was definitely quick pace, but I felt the Crew did it with great professionalism and poise without making everything a rush. The food this time around was very delicious, I had a prawn cocktail for my starter, and my main was a Turkish mince lamb pizza. Overall, great job Qantas.

### "food and beverages were fine"
A380 service from Dallas to Sydney. This was my 11 sector on the QFA380 service this year and like all the others was fine. On time departure and arrival, plenty of sleep and the food and beverages were fine. The loading was light and so plenty of fee seats around. Dallas Fort Worth is one of the easiest airports to navigate in the US. If only all trips were this painless.

### "all in all very satisfying"
Sydney to New York via Los Angeles. Qantas has now got its service right. Usual smooth flight on the A380 and nothing to speak of that was unexpected or a downside. The only problem, please change the menu! Tortellini with a tomato sauce is getting a little boring. Now as for LAX. It remains a complete maze and a zoo. Clearing customs took a long time as there were a fair few flights in at the same time. Then the trek to the departures for the onward flight to NY. Fortunately or otherwise, there was a two hour delay so plenty of time to freshen up at the lounge at TIBIT which was great. QF11 to NYC was on the Boeing 747 and its now showing its age. Would be nice for the A380 to continue over. All in all, very satisfying.

### "excellent on both legs"
London to Melbourne via Dubai. A kiwi giving qudos to the Aussies, excellent on QF10 both legs. The staff and service were great, the same on QF9 going the other way. Maybe review the stop in Dubai, because this experience both ways detracted from from great Qantas flights. I was really happy otherwise

### "acceptable but not much more"
I recently travelled Auckland to New York JFK via Sydney and Los Angeles on Qantas. Overall I would give Qantas a grade of acceptable but not much more. The positives: the food on the long-haul flights was plentiful and my special meals were catered for well; the cabin crew were friendly and helpful; the airfare was cheap. The negatives; they left my bag behind in SYD on the way up to the US (they did forward it on to me in New York, arriving about 30 hours later but it was still inconvenient); the LAX-SYD flight was downgraded to a B744-400 which is a significant downgrade from an A380 (tighter legroom; more crowded; less fresh air); legroom on the B738s is really tight.

### "review to say thank you"
Gold Coast to Sydney. I am writing to say a big thank you for Qantas team. Especially the girl who did our check in in Gold Coast airport. She was very professional and friendly at the same time. We went to Gold Coast terminal to travel on 28/05/2017 to international flight to Brazil. She understood our consern being simpatetic. We felt very welcome and relaxed when she heped us in the best way we could expect. We had 4 big lugagges and we were consern about the weight. After a long holiday in Australia choosing Qantas as we could take back home all our shopping from down under. We felt the need of a review to say thank you. We will recomend to all friends as the best way of travelling from Australia to Brasil.

### "I will use another airline"
Dubai to London. Having flown on an Emirates A380 to Dubai the fit out of the Qantas A380 was very old and was not worth the very expensive fare we paid. I have flown with Qantas for more than 50 years and been a FF most of that time but in future, if I have a choice, I will use another airline - Emirates if available. To make things worse, QF discovered a fault with the plane so after more than 2 hours in a hot aircraft we were off-loaded. The plane was scheduled to leave Dubai at 9am. It is now 11:45am and we are awaiting another update at 12:15pm. QF seems to be having a few problems at present. Is it old aircraft or inadequate preventive maintenance or a bit of both. A lot of reasons right now to use airlines other than Qantas.

### "quite a disappointment"
Sydney to Auckland and it was quite a disappointment. It was very early in the morning, and when it came time to Check-In only one ground team member was available, so I was nice enough to let some of the economy passengers check-in first, as I was the only business class passenger at that point. Only when I decided to enter the line did another team member become available. The onboard service was very impersonal, everything from greeting to food was uneventful. The flight attendants need to be more lively, especially their interaction with Customers and not look like they don't even want to be there. IFE was slow and limited, other than that the flight was on time.

### "customer service is shocking"
Sydney to Dubai. I booked Qantas because I like the friendly staff, but as for the structure and customer service systems, its abysmal. I had some questions to try and change my flight, I went to the customer service desk and nobody could help me there, the staff told me to call, and the average wait time was 45 minutes to speak with someone. I tried the online chat and it cut out after 15 minutes before the service agent even responded, and then I got another person who could not help me to change my flight. Additionally, the computers in Dubai crashed during my trip which meant our flight was delayed an hour and I could not choose my seat, despite checking in at the earliest possible time. I will never fly Qantas again, the customer service is shocking!

### "a very satisfying trip"
New York to Sydney via Los Angeles. Getting out of Manhattan and to JFK is getting worse and worse. Made sure I was in a taxi in midtown by 2.20pm but did not get to JFK until 4pm. From now on it will be a case of flying into and out of La Guardia which is only 20 mins away. Check in was painless, TSA security fine and into the lounge within 15 mins of check in. It is the British Airways lounge and fine to while away a few hours. F & B was standard. The washroom amenities in that lounge are pitiful and in need of an upgrade. Regulation flight back to LAX due to late arrival of QF11 and later still due to congestion in the area. This meant an arrival at LAX at 9.35 pm and boarding for the return at 10pm. Unfortunately insufficient time to get up to the lounge which is one of the nicer lounges in the USA for Oneworld. The leg from LAX to Sydney was typical A380, smooth and unremarkable all the way. All in all a very satisfying trip on Qantas with the fervent hope that the B747 across the States will be replaced one day with a modern craft.

### "regulation flight on the A380"
Sydney to New York via Los Angeles, this is by the A380 service to LA and then onto a B747. These days Qantas on its mainline longhaul are consistently good. There will be the odd glitch but that's to be expected. For the first time on the Sydney to LA sector, the FA's acknowledged a QFF with gold status in economy, something that Emirates do all the time. A glass of champagne was brought down and most welcome. Nice touch. Otherwise it was a regulation flight on the A380, smooth and comfortable all the way. As always its a mad dash at LAX to get through immigration clearance, pick up bags and recheck and then head to the next departure gate. It's just not as simple as at Dallas FW which is my preferred route to get to NY. The B747 from LAX to JFK has seen better days. Still comfortable to ride in but very noisy in comparison and one that is overdue for retirement. It is nice to be in QF aircraft all the way but to be honest the American Airlines services I have taken from DFW on their newer aircraft are far better (save for the catering) in terms of new aircraft and comfort. Hopefully we will see the Boeing 787 on the cross US trek soon under Qantas colours.

### "the new entertainment system"
Melbourne to Sydney. I was very lucky to have my flight not delayed or cancelled due to bad weather, very heavy fog and low clouds have delayed many routes during my day of travel. Check-In was very efficient as I did it online, and printed my boarding pass via the kiosk with only one carry-on bag. From boarding to on board service, the crew were very smiley and made the morning flight go by fast. Again, meal service was just not great, as cookies are not appropriate. Lastly, the plane used for my flight has the new entertainment system, which has great content, with comfortable seats and open atmosphere.

### "A horrible experience"
Melbourne to San Francisco via Sydney. A horrible experience. When checking in, we were offered "better" seats. We said ok. We were moved from the middle of the plane (seats which we had chosen well in advance) to seats in the back of the plane which did not recline. We were stuck next to the bathroom, people exercising, and the fully reclined passengers in front of us. The best part was the guy in front of us throwing our carryon around in the bin so he could get his two very large suitcases in. The stewardesses never said a word. Next time we'll fly the other airline.

### "were just not lively at all"
Sydney to Melbourne. I notice this flight was very uneventful, the team members from the ground and cabin were just not lively at all. They were very robotic and moving through the motions. I know it's Economy Class, but I have high expectations from Qantas. The departure was at 2PM and I was pretty hungry by then, and instead of receiving a reasonable meal I was presented with some crackers and olives. It tasty good, but not well portioned at all. On the positive side, I appreciate the In-Flight Entertainment from the Ipad provided, loving the new movies. Overall, it was a good flight but the duration of a flight should not be a factor of how much service should be provided, standards should be consistent.

### "a surprisingly average experience"
In recent years I have flown business class with Emirates, Thai Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Etihad. I recently flew London to Sydney with Qantas (April 2017) on the A380. This was a surprisingly average experience compared with other airlines. The seating was generally not as comfortable, the food was only just okay (sorry Neil Perry), and the entertainment was the most limited of all the other airlines I have flown. Most disappointing of all was the cabin service. Specifically very slow to clear dishes on trays so passengers are left locked into their space by their trays. Food was slow to be delivered and at one point I did wonder if we were even going to get breakfast. All in all Qantas is now bottom of my list of preferred airlines for business or first class.

### "space for feet is minimum"
We travelled Qantas for a weekend away, MEL to SYD. Used points and pay. The new Qantas Domestic business class has a partition between seats / pods making most contact impossible, let alone handholding (see the photo). Domestically we have used Virgin, SYD to PER which May have fewer flights they just seem to try harder. The LCD screen can not be angled much. Food was fine. Crew very good. Nearby storage is inaccessible during take off and landing? Space for feet on level surface is minimum, then there is a little ramp (may be 7 cm) then an angled area.

### "no longer what it used to be"
Sydney to Gold Coast. So this was my first experience of the much publicized Qantas In-flight WiFi, I was so excited to try it, on the ground it was pretty decent, 10mbps but as soon as we went down the runway it cut-off, then even at cruising altitude it was so slow and constantly dropped out, there was no use trying to use it, absolutely pathetic. In-flight service was also pretty poor, cabin crew handed out pies which were stone cold, after people started complaining we were given a couple of crackers and a slab of cheese, very poor. Landing at the Gold Coast the disembarking was very slow and the wait for bags was over 30min, Qantas is no longer what it used to be.

### "long overdue for new aircraft"
Sydney to Singapore on an A330-200 one of the refurbished aircraft. Nice seats, IFE was a touchscreen and one that I have flown in many times across to Perth. The FA's were very distracted and had to cope with a large number of passengers with special meals. Result was a meal service that was pretty shambolic. Also having been on 12 sectors alone this year on a Qantas A380, A330, fine craft that it is, just simply felt very crowded and a step down from the A380. The return from Singapore was on QF6 and was one of the unrefurbished ones. My tablet has a screen bigger than the IFE, seats had been well used and pretty lumpy. Being a red-eye I imagine Qantas have taken the view that it is no point putting on the new ones as most people will be sleeping rather than watching a screen. Not sure if its the case but the FA's on the A380 service have been consistently better than on the non A380 craft whether to Singapore or domestically. I'm a great fan of Qantas but now long overdue for new aircraft to fly the medium haul routes. The Boeing 787 cannot come soon enough.

### "offer no assistance at all"
Tokyo Narita to Adelaide via Melbourne. We arrived at the airport late due to issues with the train breaking down. They refused to board us. They then refused to assist us in any way just providing a phone contact number for Japan. The phone number did not work at all. They then told us to call the international number. Tried using the pay phone but all my coins were exhausted after over a 20 min wait. Eventually got skype working on the wifi and was told I would need to pay over twice the price I paid to fly. Ended up just purchasing tickets with jetstar. At least you know what you are paying for there. For a full service airline to offer no assistance at all with anything you might as well just fly the budget option.

### "crew happy to be there"
Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles. Brilliant flight from Melbourne. The A380 was spotless, quiet and smooth. Recently had to travel on a 777-300ER and was shocked by how loud and unpleasant they are to fly in by comparison to the A380. Food was great, crew happy to be there and looked after the passengers during the flight. Amazing the difference having PJs to change into make. The Los Angeles to New York JFK leg was on an older 747-400. Still nice to fly, but showing their age (gracefully). Well done Qantas, I continue to trust your consistent service.

### "lounge is always clean"
I am a Qantas Gold class member and typically travel economy class for business between Melbourne and Sydney. Great online check in, and paperless boarding system as boarding pass is sent to phone and you can use your Frequent flyer card to check in which I regularly do too. Lounge is always clean and lounge staff are extremely helpful. Lounge food is basic but fresh and the drinks are always served with a smile. Seats could be a bit more roomy but they are very reliable with I would say better on time departure KPIs generally in comparison to the alternatives, much more reliable as I have often been delayed when I have been forced to use the alternatives. I once needed to modify my flight to get home urgently to a sick child and although my ticket was not a flexible one they accommodated me at no change cost, upgraded me to business and made sure I was first off the plane. That in my humble opinion generates customer loyalty and is the reason I recommend them and would no longer fly any other airline in Australia.

### "service was exceptional"
We flew Qantas as a British Airways codeshare from London to Australia return. My girlfriend and I were really impressed with Qantas, especially after flying British Airways. Service was exceptional, snacks provided by cabin crew during the flight (something BA cannot afford to provide even on a 13 hour flight) and food was tasty. Plane was in excellent condition. TV's were large and choice of entertainment was plentiful. I would have no hesitation flying Qantas again.

### "lunch service was delicious"
Melbourne to Sydney. I got to the airport 2.5 hours before my 12PM departure to try out the Melbourne Domestic Business Lounge. A fairly quiet day for travel so getting through Check-In and Security was a breeze. Upon boarding, I noticed the process was slightly not organised as no announcement was made and customers were mixing between Business and Economy lines. Onboard, FAs were welcoming and incredibly attentive. The lunch service was delicious with very good entertainment provided.

### "won't bother paying for Premium Economy"
Overnight flight 20 April Tokyo Haneda to Sydney in Premium Economy. Priority boarding, drink on reaching seat, offered a tasty looking menu. 1 hour into flight smelt the Business class food and watched the trolleys whiz by. 90 mins in, all of us in Premium were served drinks as usual and sat with trays down waiting for dinner. No meal arrived! 2+ hours into the flight suddenly the lights dimmed to sleep mode and a steward came by 30 mins later and offered me something on a tray - either an apple or a chocolate. I said I'd have both since dinner wasn't served. He said no one wanted dinner this was a sleeping flight. When I said I had been given the dinner menu he muttered something and said "did I want the whole tray of snacks then?". I put my call light on later to ask for some water and a female flight attendant asked me if I knew I had the call light on and what did I want. I'll fly JAL next time this was a waste of money. Finally got breakfast before landing which was woeful both in selection and quality with the worst coffee I've had on a plane and that's saying something. The seat was fine (more comfortable than Business class seat) but that was about it. I won't bother paying for Premium Economy with Qantas again.

### "probably the worst flight"
I have had great service from Qantas but feel obliged to submit this review having experienced probably the worst flight in my travel history. Travelled from Tokyo to Singapore on JAL in comfort and style (economy). Roomy seats, attentive service and all in all a satisfactory flight. Qantas from Singapore to Perth on a Boeing 737 that seriously must be configured the same as Jetstar or Tiger. Tight is the word. No leg-room at all. I was mortified to find myself in such an uncomfortable situation. And economy passengers share one toilet for the 5hr 40 minute flight. Food ok, entertainment system fine but comfort level in the minus. If I have wanted Jetstar I would have chosen Jetstar and paid the Jetstar price! Hats off however for being on the ball to get us to our connecting flight when the JAL landed late. Excellent ground staff organization, although maybe on reflection missing the flight may have been a blessing!

### "meal service efficient and delicious"
It's been 10 months since I last flew this route and I love that Qantas uses a wide body jet to cater for the many customers that fly between Sydney and Melbourne. Check-In and security was a breeze, and boarding was 10 minutes early. The entertainment offered was on an iPad and the meal service was efficient and delicious. The FA were very attentive on a very short flight and Arrival into Melbourne was on time. I definitely would recommend Qantas for everyone.

### "was a great experience"
Sydney to Melbourne. It's been 10 months since I last flew this route, and I love that Qantas uses wide body jets at certain times for this route to cater for the many people that fly between Sydney and Melbourne. Boarding was 10 mins early and we arrived on time. The entertainment of movies and TV shows provided on IPad was great. For meal service I had an amazing salad with choices of soft drinks and water, including some chocolates for dessert. I also had a great seat with extra leg room right behind Business Class. Once again flying with Qantas was a great experience and looking forward to my flight back to Sydney.

### "surprisingly comfortable on this night flight"
Tokyo to Sydney in premium economy with Qantas. I was surprisingly comfortable on this night flight. I found seat pitch to be good and width adequate. Recline and comfort were not bad but it was a little difficult getting in and out of your seat when everyone's reclined for sleep. Food was decent as was service and in-flight entertainment—in fact it was better than some business offerings, e.g BA. Importantly for me cabin temperature was cool but not cold and the supplied blankets and pillows were excellent. You felt fresh with good air circulation throughout. Personally I'm a fan of the refitted 747s, which while not "modern" are large, fast and comfortable. Everything was clean and in working order so no issues with the older aircraft. While Qantas PE wasn't particularly well priced you could see where the money went. It is a viable alternative to business for shorter sectors in my opinion.

### "totally avoid from now on"
Disgraceful for what used to be the Spirit of Australia. I flew to and from Japan on Thai Airways, Japan Airlines then finally Singapore to Perth with Qantas for the last 5 hr 31 min. Of these 25 hours travel, Qantas was shamefully the worst. Sadly, I have always told people how proud I was of the flying Kangaroo. Well, never again! Here is my list of why I will never choose them again. Aircraft stinks - bad odour. Staff make sure to let you know that they are only doing a job, not providing a service: e.g. JAL staff attending a massive Boeing 777 so graceful and polite. 1hr 30 min into Qantas flight : not even a drop of water offered. Later found that they had small water bottle in pouch. 1hr 30 min into Thai Airways I have had snacks / drinks and main is being served. Entertainment system : Qantas, you have no excuse for this! System froze intermittently, no remote so you are at the mercy of the dirty touchscreen working which it didn't for about 30% of time. This is beyond embarrassing: 1 toilet for 180 people in Economy and they even broadcast this. The queue for the toilet stretched along the length of the economy class. Qantas, are you serious? Sadly after 4 years of being my go-to airline, Qantas, you are now on my list of totally avoid from now on. I see no way in which you could compete with the culture of leading budget airlines.

### "impressed by the flight"
Melbourne to Adelaide. I was impressed by the flight. It left on time. The meal (chicken and rice) was very tasty and I appreciated the free drink. It was nice of them to order give out some Lindt Chocolates as well. The service was very friendly and professional as well

### "very friendly and efficient"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Early morning flight (6.40am). Easy check in. Punctual departure. The staff were very friendly and efficient. A small but pleasant breakfast was served with fruit juice. There was reasonable IFE with a good choice of current affairs and music. Overall a very good flight. Perhaps a slightly bigger breakfast could be served.

### "cabin crew helpful and cheerful"
QF 548, Sydney to Brisbane, April 17th, departure 1900 hours. Check in by mobile phone and boarding by mobile. Allocated aisle seat as requested and was again fortunate to have empty middle seat. Dinner served on this short flight and cold drink service. Declined meal as no gluten free meal as I request each flight. Cabin staff member brought me 2 gluten free biscuits and said she would get me some tea as well as cold drink. As we changed our day of flight I think I must have forgotten to request g/f meal so not Qantas fault. Easter lindt chocolate rabbits given to passengers who wanted one. Cabin crew helpful and cheerful. Good flight.

### "angled flat bed most uncomfortable"
Hong Kong to Sydney. I booked this flight because the scheduled aircraft was an A330-300. it was only when we boarded that I discovered that the aircraft had been substituted. The seating configuration and the angled flat bed were most uncomfortable A330. The crew were very good and did their best to make up for our disappointment. I know the T&Cs allow airlines to do this sort of thing but I think its most unfair to charge for one product and then provide an inferior service.

### "cabin crew very busy and helpful"
QF519 Brisbane to Sydney on 13 April. Check-in and boarding pass by mobile phone. Aisle seat as selected and fortunate to have empty middle seat with empty row in front so comfortable space. Was reading and as cabin staff moved through cabin they were kind enough to put my light on without me asking. Light snack, I declined the snack bar as it was not Gluten Free. Cabin crew member said she would find an apple and also brought some Rice crackers but due to wheat added was unable to have. Cabin staff apologised and found a gluten free biscuit. All cabin crew on this flight very busy and helpful.

### "amenities provided are very basic"
Travelled from Manila to Sydney in business class with Qantas. Cabin configuration was 1-2-1 and I was seated in 2F. Cabin is well appointed but amenities provided are very basic, appeared to be like any normal economy class except for the pyjamas. Food and beverage selection and service was mostly average. But the seating comfort and full flat bed comfort was fine. One major issue of this travel was the toilet availability. The business class has only one toilet which kept occupied throughout the flight with a long queue before it! The toilet accessibility was also quite difficult as it was merged with the pantry area.

### "staff at Qantas Club were helpful"
Brisbane to Christchurch return. Return leg via Sydney. Used the recently refurbished Qantas Business Lounge at Brisbane Airport. A real sanctuary compared with its former self. The attendants on the mezzanine level were friendly, offering hot breakfast options, to make coffee, and assist in any way. Qantas have done well in improving service here. Boarding was quick enough and hassle free. Landed in Christchurch on time and bags on the belt within 10 minutes. My bag was premium tagged and was fourth bag on the belt. Christchurch to Brisbane via Sydney on return was a day of flying I'd rather forget. Our flight to Sydney was delayed by over four hours due to fog at Christchurch and the aircraft being diverted to Auckland for fuel and waiting for fog to lift. As I had an onward connection in Sydney, I inquired at the gate desk with a well rehearsed reply from the gate agent, "when you get to Sydney, it will be all sorted, someone will be waiting for you at the gate. Of course, this was not the case, but I did learn that Qantas at Christchurch is contracted and apart from getting passengers on planes, they cannot do much more for you. It was interesting to note that Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 suffered the same fate. Over the PA was announced, "Singapore Airlines apologises for the delay due to fog etc, we have $20 vouchers for food and beverages. Qantas passengers were not afforded any such appreciation, and who I might add, had been waiting far longer than Singapore Airlines passengers. Once the Qantas aircraft arrived from Auckland, things seemed to move quicker and soon enough boarding and on the plane. Once departed from Christchurch, the service on board was excellent. The food was good and there were a couple of water runs on this three hour flight. This flight, albeit late was one of the better ones I have had with Qantas. Once in Sydney, I had a Qantas agent phone me, while still taxiing to the international terminal advising my original flight had been cancelled and I was rebooked onto a 7pm flight to Brisbane. This was so much later than my original 11.30am arrival into Brisbane. As I had a bag checked, I had to take the flight as it was the only one available. The Qantas agent appeared to want to help but could not give me an earlier flight due to unavailability. So, after rechecking my bag through to Brisbane on this later flight, I proceeded to Sydney Domestic and waited in the Qantas Club for the hours to pass by. Thankfully a PA announcement requesting passengers from later flights to go on a 4.30pm flight was announced. I took this up. The Qantas staff at the Qantas Club were helpful but I feared that by changing my flight, my bag would not change with it. Sure enough, after arriving Brisbane, my bag was still in Sydney. Bag was delivered a day later. It was just a day of mishaps, but I was happy with each of the Qantas staff I dealt with.

### "cabin staff were attentive"
London to Melbourne return via Dubai. Aircraft was comfortable and modern. Seat configuration not ideal as passengers with windows have to climb over passengers in aisles. Best seats are in the middle section so no acrobatics. Overall seats are comfortable however and it may be me when fully reclined I found the seams dig in to my hips making sleep a challenge. They need a bit more padding. Service in both directions was excellent. Cabin staff were attentive. On return journey from Dubai to LHR I received probably the best in-flight service of the past 5 years flying. I am Emerald OneWorld and a frequent flyer. The food on both journeys was very good, and plenty of choice. Would have preferred more choice of fruit and this seemed limited on the aircraft travelling out of Dubai. Drink selection in particular wine was excellent. Only gripe was the switch at Dubai and getting on and off the aircraft, clearing security again is a hassle. Also the timing of the flight is not ideal from a sleep and managing jet lag. Definitely would take route again. Previously I have flown Singapore Airlines via Singapore and this was my preferred route. So a nice choice to have.

### "Qantas is very efficient"
Good experience flying from Adelaide to Sydney. Qantas is very efficient. Only self-check-in including baggage drop for Economy customers and Boarding started shortly after the airplane has arrived at the gate. Spotless cabin. In seat entertainment and the existence of a real business class are astonishing for European customers. Nice cheese snack with a high quality local Relish. Baggage in SYD very fast. Friendly staff. Anytime again Qantas.

### "Terrible for long haul"
Singapore to Melbourne. Terrible for long haul! Very poor leg room on this flight, similar to that which you would expect on a short haul A320. The food was, characteristically of Qantas, average and minimal. Definitely felt like a budget airline. Well below the standard of any other airline I have flown London-Aus/NZ with. Won't be going again, particularly as Emirates is generally the same price.

### "could not fault this flight"
We flew business class on the A380 on Qantas QF1 Dubai to London on March 5. Let me tell you, I was highly impressed with the entire travel experience. The seats were fabulous and the inflight service incredible. We were watered and fed so to speak within the first hour of the flight and I was actually able to get a solid 4 hours sleep. The inflight entertainment was great and boarding and disembarking were a breeze at both ends. I could not fault this flight. Well done Qantas crew, I know it's a fairly thankless job.

### "such a delay in the service"
Having experienced an incredible flight with QF1 four weeks earlier, we were very excited to be on QF2 from London to Dubai. Well that's where the excitement stopped. Almost two hours into the flight we were finally served one meal and drinks. The flight was 6 hours 20 minutes and a night flight. When do you want us to sleep? And why on earth was there such a delay in the service? Then to be woken up 90 minutes before we land for just a coffee? Are you serious. Then to be told by the CSM that our luggage was still in London. Seriously? Well we know the luggage issue wasn't Qantas. Why do you feel the need to wake people for a coffee. On all other flights you fill out a card so as to not disturb the passengers who want to sleep. So glad I paid for a business class flight - not! Perhaps I should have gone economy.

### "a great seat overall"
Flew from Melbourne to Shanghai via Sydney with Qantas. The A330 has a great seat overall, and with the lap sash belt you are able to have the seat slightly reclined for take off and landing. The inflight entertainment was fantastic and provided a wide variety of entertainment. A great menu was available up to a week before the flight to pre-order my meal. All seats have direct aisle access and private overhead storage.

### "professional, courteous and great"
Dallas to Sydney and the final leg with Qantas of a round the world trip. Dallas Airport, Terminal D, is great. Very clean, new, plenty of food options, seating, shopping. The only disappointment is the Admirals Lounge where it is comfortable but the food choices are very limited. No issue as there is plenty available in the terminal. The flight itself is typical these days of Qantas long haul ie professional, courteous and great. On time departure and arrival around 8 minutes after scheduled time. I go out of my way to fly long haul on the QF A380 and save for the odd glitch have yet to be disappointed. The F and B can vary a little. Outbound from Australia is usually always better than inbound but this is due to local (US) catering so understandable.

### "ground staff were great"
Sydney to London via Melbourne. A typical uneventful ride on Qantas QF9 from Melbourne until we reached Dubai. In the economy cabin but had a whole row to myself so could stretch out. Delayed arrival due to ATC in Dubai and this seems to be getting worse. Upon landing we were advised that there was an engineering issue. The onward departure would be delayed by an hour which is what happened. Boarded, left the gate and whilst heading on the taxi way to the runway the problem clearly had not been fixed so we returned to the gate. A delay of around 6 more hours and eventual arrival into London some 7-8 hours late. As the captain said: Safety before schedule. These things do happen and I like my engine issues to take place on the ground and not in the air. Having lounge access helped but the Qantas ground staff were also great in providing refreshment for those who could not use the lounge.

### "at the bottom of the list"
Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane. We did encounter one leg with average service; my husband’s morning coffee was served spilt, a few napkins shoved underneath to absorb the mess, basically half a cup of coffee, and no sugar (as requested) – a quick apology was given, but it really shouldn’t have been served this way and accompanied by a cold serve of scrambled eggs. Not a bad run, considering we flew four legs in total. Overall, the meals were pretty good. Of all the Business Class experiences we have had (Etihad, Emirates, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines), our Qantas experience has landed at the bottom of the list. On our return leg, we had booked row 3 seats in the nose of the plane (747), weeks in advance. A last minute aircraft change saw us separated, so a customer service rep via social media offered us two back row business class seats – the last remaining together apparently – we reluctantly accepted. The very next morning I logged in to check seating again and noticed the aircraft had reverted back to the original. I messaged our social media friend to obtain our existing seats, only to be told ‘bad luck’. Our seats were gone, and we weren’t getting them back. I protested a number of times only to be hit with ‘cut and paste’ replies on operational aircraft change jargon. Eventually, they just ignored me. I also sent a complaint via Qantas online and recently received the same ‘cut and paste’ response about aircraft change. In all honestly, they could have just given our original seats back and kept us happy, considering the above was all within a 24-hour window. The reason we wanted row 3, was that those Business Class seats (FYI) are in the nose of the plane and more spaced / private. We flew over in row 2 and enjoyed the experience. The second part of the 747 is where the seats are 2-3-2. Basically, a very ‘Premium Economy’ experience albeit your bed lies flat. You don’t have a feeling of personal space and can easily bump your neighbour getting in and out of your seating. Two of our legs, we’re flown in an A330; this is a much better aircraft for Business Class, with seating 1-2-1 for personal space, and a nice big entertainment screen on the front seat, as opposed to the small pull out ones on the 747. Unfortunately though, the A330 aircraft cannot be used for long haul flights. Based on the above experience, and at a cost of $20,000 for the return trip, we will not be flying Qantas again for our next journey in June. We have already sourced an alternate airline. I believe our seating error could have been handled better. Unfortunately, we are not Platinum members, so I feel we were overlooked and brushed aside. Had our original seating, which was booked weeks in advance been honoured, we would have rebooked with Qantas in June. Do not change your seats with aircraft changes until check in. And, do not rely on Qantas social media customer service. I hope the above assists with your travels plans.

### "Qantas were outstanding"
Flew economy class from Los Angeles to Melbourne return. Qantas were outstanding and earned my vote as one of the best airlines. Service on both sectors was excellent. The entertainment options were varied and extensive enough to occupy 15 hours of flying. The seat was far more comfortable than other long haul airlines I've flown and the food above the standard economy fare. The A380 is also an amazing aircraft to fly on.

### "one of the best on-board service"
Tokyo Narita to Brisbane. It was the end of my two week holiday in Japan, and was looking forward very much to the flight home. We happened to arrive at the airport the moment check-in was opened, good timing really. After, we decided to go straight to the Qantas Lounge which was conveniently located right next to our gate. The flight was handled by Japan Airlines ground team and they are very smooth with boarding procedures. Qantas flight attendants gave one of the best on-board service on my journey home as they were welcoming and made sure the business class cabin was well taken care of including the customer service manager making his way around and welcoming each passenger. Dinner was delicious, and a small breakfast was much appreciated. Definitely looking forward to flying with Qantas very soon.

### "service not great this flight"
Sydney to Perth. Qantas usually not bad, but the service in Economy was a little strange. The main steward didnt seem to know what the meal was (curry or stir fry) and it wasn't clear whether he was trying to be funny or whether he really didnt know. Then another female cabin staff refused to take my unfinished ice-cream (enclosed in its unsoiled package and wrapped nicely in a napkin!). She took the empty bottle of glass saying "I'll just take this one" and then never came back. Leg room in exit row 13 was good but the service not great this flight.

### "an undisturbed flight"
Perth to Brisbane. Great service with an undisturbed flight so I could get some sleep before going to work the next morning. The seat is fantastic for a domestic business class, fully flat with plenty of space for storage (much better than the international QF Business class seat). You can use the semi-reclined take-off and landing positions on this seat also. Even seats are closer to the winder (storage on the aisle side) and odd numbers have the storage on the window side.

### "Wasn't super impressed"
Dallas to Sydney. They damaged my luggage and stroller. The stroller they said they have no control over insurance wise because it's technically carry-on even though I wasn't allowed to take it onto the plane and had one of their staff put in the luggage hold. My luggage only gets insurance if I can go to a Qantas desk, which there isn't in the city that I live in. I was pretty unimpressed by how difficult they tried to make it for me to claim even though they were in the wrong. I ordered vegan meals, which were average at best and beside the fact that I had a 9 month old on my lap the entire flight and couldn't really eat them (of course they charge you extra for the child who isn't even occupying a seat) but they brought the baby meals containing meat and didn't give the option to choose something else. I didn't feel like they wanted to help me much either. The staff seemed put out by even getting me hot water for my son's formula so dare not ask them to mind him while I went to the bathroom! Wasn't super impressed with my Qantas experience, especially when it's double the price of Virgin Atlantic.

### "Stay clear of this mob"
Queenstown to Sydney. Cancelled flight two weeks before and offered a flight via Auckland as compensation. Food on plane woeful. Icecream had all melted. Bags tool an hour to come off while a later arriving Jetstar flight was serviced immediately. Business class tags are as useful as a Christmas bauble. Among last bags off plane. Service staff all stand around passing the buck. Taking direction from their leader I guess. Five out of five for arrogance and incompetence. Zero for service. Stay clear of this mob.

### "seat padding was so inadequate"
Melbourne to Auckland return. First flight was in aisle seat, seat pitch not great but breakfast amazing. IFE on B737 is ancient compared to other airlines, touchscreen response slow. Second flight got put onto an exit row seat. Amazing legroom. However the seat padding was so inadequate I had to use pillow for lower back support. Dinner wasn't great although the ice cream/chocolate was. Service from crew with smiles, courtesy and care.

### "Crew were friendly and worked hard"
❎ Unverified |  Our recent trip was from Sydney to New York and return. The A380 on the SYD-LAX-SYD route made a long-haul flight very pleasant. Meals were of good frequency, size, and quality. The self-serve drink and snack bar at the rear of the aircraft is a good idea and was well-stocked. Crew were friendly and worked hard. The LAX-JFK-LAX sectors were operated by refurbished 747-400ER aircraft, and although the flights and service were fine, the 747 is starting to show its age. Noise levels and (dry) air quality are noticeably different to the A380. Our return flight out of JFK was delayed due to the crew being caught in a traffic jam en route to the airport. Apart from that delay the flights were very good. The mix of good service, value-for-money, and what I consider to be a more-than-adequate economy class product means that Qantas remains my preferred carrier.

### "the service was friendly"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. The flight left right on time, the service was friendly and jovial - nothing was too much trouble. I had the salmon that I pre-ordered and it was delicious! Great entertainment options and I love the self service snacks and drinks at the back of the plane.

### "service on board was excellent as always"
Brisbane to Tokyo Narita. I took this route as it offered use of my Qantas Frequent Flyer Points. Flight departed early and arrived early which made the trip into the heart of Tokyo efficient and fast, considering the car transfer took an hour. The service on board was excellent as always, the Customer Service Manager was welcoming and made sure everyone was looked after, the rest of the team displayed great hospitality and service also. I think the food portions could be greater in amount and some better options with deserts. I'm very proud to fly with Qantas as it's a representation of Australia and I'm looking forward to the next flight on our way home.

### "we were really impressed "
Adelaide to Melbourne. We were really impressed with the Qantas short haul product. The business class seats were wide and with good legroom. British Airways should provide something similar in Europe! Even though the flight was only one hour a hot breakfast was serviced, which was very tasty. Cabin Crew were very good and happy to chat. Ground crew were also good, my One World membership number had been incorrectly entered by the travel agent and at check-in they were unable to resolve this. The lady at check in promised to speak to someone and sort it out and by the time we had cleared security and reached the Qantas Lounge it had been resolved and new boarding cards printed for us. Good job Qantas

### "Another good flight"
Melbourne to Hamilton Island. Another good flight with Qantas. Check In was quick and easy. Lounge at Melbourne comfortable and not too busy. Flight on time. Service in business class was very good and hot breakfast served. Seat very comfortable and spacious. Used the Qantas ILink to my Ipad, which worked well.

### "Qantas did not help me"
Brisbane to Singapore. It was a codeshare flight for Jet Airways, maybe that's why Qantas did not help me. I wasn't allowed to web check in stating the reason that I'm on a codeshare partner flight but to my surprise if I paid AUD30pp roughly ($25pp) they were ready to check me in and all this was happening 10 hours prior to my flight time when usually the seats become free to choose. I was on my honeymoon and they assigned me seats on the 4 seat configuration inspite of me requesting them to shift my seats to the row with 2 seat options. They refused to help me for the same, stating that the flight is full but in reality on the website they had more than 45 seats easily available. When I told them about the availability on the website they said, "that's not the real time availability sir, even if you try booking it will not accept your seat selection" which was completely false as I just had to pay AUD60 and the seats were mine. They basically lied and were really unhelpful and non-accommodating, not the behaviour you expect from the national carrier of Australia. All they wanted me was to pay them AUD60 for those 2 seats just 10 hours before my departure time. Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific would be a much better option than choosing the Jet and Qantas combination from India to Australia and back.

### "never book with them again"
Melbourne to Los Angeles. The airline and their customer support is a joke. Booking process was easy but when I had to cancel my flight due to personal circumstances that's when problems begin. I received no confirmation email acknowledging that this cancellation occured. According to their website they need 12 business days to process my refund - is there someone walking with cash from Sydney to Melbourne? After not receiving my refund, I called them and after waiting on hold for more than an hour, I was told that I should have sent them details of my PoLi payment so that they can process the refund. I would have done if I knew about it but there was no information about it. Now they say I need to wait another 6-8 weeks to get my money back. Qantas is a joke, will never book any flight with them again.

### "flight attendants saved the day as always"
Perth back to Sydney with Qantas Airways. I'll begin with a short vent, ground team members helping with Check-In, please remember that most people who fly know which lines they can queue in, we're not dumb so don't ask pathetic questions. Secondly, team members at the Business Lounge, doesn't matter what I wear, never question people as you don't know them, without us, you will have no job. As for the flight, brilliant is all I can say, the flight attendants saved the day as always. Food was delicious, constant drink refills and always present. Overall, pretty smooth.

### "everything was very smooth"
Flew Sydney to Perth, it was also my first time to this city. From Check-In to security, everything was very smooth. Qantas has their own Terminal at Sydney Airport which made it very easy to navigate. I decided to fly economy and it was well worth the money, as Qantas used a wide body jet for the route. The flight itself was just over 4 hours in duration, Flight Attendants were very attentive from meals to snacks and drinks.

### "packed like sardines"
Noumea to Sydney. Passengers packed like sardines; extremely poor quality food and poor service. Flying for more than 30 years and this is the worst experience I have ever had. Thank God it was only a 3-hour flight. I can't believe they are allowed to pack so many seats in this airplane.

### "food quality was poor"
Sydney to Dubai. Business class product is substandard; food quality was poor on both inbound and outbound, separated by 3 weeks, The entertainment has limited options and screen quality is poor. In-flight service seemed chaotic and unorganized. The starter lamb stew was twice the size of the main meal and was inedible. On the plus side I liked the pajamas they gave. Also, I have good perception of the quality of Qantas pilots and maintenance staff.

### "lower the uptight attitude"
Singapore to Sydney, late evening flight. Qantas has a reputation for its de-personalised service, giving a feeling of "rush", "here-you-go", "it's-the-rules", uptight services. It really does reflect "Australian hospitality" to certain extent. Products were lacklustre, boring interior, uncomfortable economy seat (cabin crews would give you a snare, "you get what you paid") and mention not, their boring meals. The passenger seating next to me was asking if he could have something extra as he was feeling hungry, classic answer, "Sorry sir, I can't help you much. You should have brought your own food". In your face service is not hospitality by any stretch. I suggest Cabin Crew lower the uptight attitude, just a teeny tiny bit, and consider that the passengers are actually paying for service

### "staff were polite and lovely"
Flew Qantas from Heathrow to Sydney via Dubai. I was apprehensive as I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the staff. In my experience the staff were very polite and lovely on both legs. Plenty of food and snacks being served throughout the flight. Breakfast was ok, but I have never enjoyed breakfast on flights. Entertainment has a good selection with plenty to keep you entertained. Managed to get quite a bit of sleep and the crew even made sure I received my lunch after I woke up. Toilets kept clean and the seat was decent.

### "long haul economy dated and dirty"
Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane / Sydney. Just a warning for WA based travellers considering flying to the USA using Qantas. I have used Qantas twice since November to get to LA. Each time coming home we have been unable to make the connecting flight and for some reason Qantas don't put you on the next direct flight to Perth but they reroute you adding signifiant delays to arrival and more flying time. The long haul economy esp on 747 has become quite dated and dirty in parts. In the future I will be flying Asian airlines to the USA and Canada who guarantee one stop to USA at a much cheaper price and who's airports have access to showers in case of a delay. In Sydney, I sat on the floor for four hours waiting for a flight to Melbourne before arriving in Perth 6 hours late (from LAX). I have contacted Qantas in writing about some of these delays and was promised a response within 16 days and more than 9 weeks later still no response.

### "barely better than economy"
Sydney to Johannesburg. In the past seven years I have flown business class with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar. Qatar Airways is far and away the best, and I would love to try Singapore Airlines again. Unfortunately I was flying to South Africa and so had little choice - Qantas or Qantas. Not only did I have to pay a ridiculous $5,000 one way for each of my wife and I, the aircraft was an old Boeing 747-400 and the cabin service was barely better than economy on other airlines. There was no 'experience' to this flight, and certainly no feeling of being 'treated' as a premium customer. It was slap-dash, here-you-go service. The food was very ordinary. There was not even a pre-dinner drink with canapes, and no after meal offer of cheese, chocolate or liquer. No, it was whip the tray away, lights out and crew disappeared. The second leg down to Cape Town from Johannesburg was a codeshare domestic business class operated by South African Airways and what a contrast it was - premium service from beginning to end, and SAA was absolutely professional, and enjoyable. I recommend checking the operator if you are flying Sydney to Johannesburg and picking the day when South African Airways  are taking you - that way you might get value for money.

### "the FA's were excellent"
Sydney to Dallas and on to NYC and then returning from Los Angeles to Sydney. Being a QFF I am biased. The flight to Dallas was fine and had a full row to myself. The return flight back from LAX was fine albeit the aircraft was packed. Food and beverages typical of most airlines these days - edible but that's all. The FA's on both legs were excellent. Stepping onto a Qantas aircraft is a bit like stepping home for me.

### "we were most pleasantly surprised"
Sydney to Hong Kong. As this was our return trip from Sydney we were most pleasantly surprised at the standard of service and comfort compared to the other flights we had with British Airways for the rest of our trip. The staff were courteous and polite from check in to disembarking and the service on board was infinitely better. The food and beverages were excellent and our comfort was great. The entertainment system was again superior to British Airways with more choice available. I would not hesitate to recommend Qantas premium economy.

### "service is unfriendly and rude"
I have been a loyal Qantas customer for a long time but I am done with flying long haul economy flights with Qantas. This leg (Dubai to Melbourne) I have done 3 times in the last year with an infant and it is terrible. Emirates and BA are 1000 times better. They actually make an effort to welcome you, chat with you, make sure your children are settled before you take off. Firstly, they have cost cut to the point of it being ridiculous. No basic amenities such as a toothbrush and a few pencils for my daughter to play with (unless asked). Service is unfriendly and rude. The amount of packaging for their food is huge - rubbish everywhere. They don't use a tray to serve you so you need to juggle individual bits of food on your little table. The food quality is poor - my salad was gritty and the greens were slimy. No walking through the cabin offering water in the middle of the night - you have to track it down. We have been fortunate to have bulkhead seats on 2/3 trips however the seat room is shocking - you would need to be under 160cm to fit. It should be a given that airlines offer wifi - even if you pay - these days.

### "good service ... enjoyable flights"
Brisbane to Sydney, same day return. Boarded and departed on time. Arriving early on both legs. Both flights about 90% full. Small jam slice provided to Sydney and Carrots, crackers and dip provided to Brisbane. Not the best offering, but it was something and not bad. Beverages offered. Flight attendants cheerful and helpful. They appeared to be happy to be there. 737 to Sydney ws older type with no IFE. 737 to Brisbane had seat back entertainment. Aircraft clean. Good service and enjoyable flights.

### "not international business class"
❎ Unverified |  Sydney to Auckland. The same old story for Qantas on this route, 37 inches of space in an old fashioned reclining seat on a narrow body aircraft is not international business class. Unless your schedule demands it I strongly recommend airlines that fly fully flat beds on wide bodied aircraft on this route. That said the service and food offering were impeccable and the flight departed and arrived on time.

### "friendly, smiling cabin crew"
Melbourne to Adelaide in economy class. Great service, friendly, smiling cabin crew. Great inflight entertainment. My only negative comment is that this was the dinner flight and it was a disappointment. Food served in a box, no tray and no extra condiments such as bread roll, butter, cheese, crackers etc. It felt as if I had just been given a quick takeaway. Come on Qantas if you are paying premium economy fares I expect a premium quality meal. Upon saying this, Qantas is still my preferred carrier for domestic or international.

### "Qantas fell woefully short"
Christchurch to Sydney. What started promisingly turned into a nightmare. Left hotel at 4.30am for 7am flight to Sydney from Christchurch on 2 February. Check in fine though check in girl didn't smile and seemed unhappy to be there. Boarded plane on time and pushed back early.Then nothing - after what seemed an age the captain said that one of the engines seemed to be leaking fuel. They were going to run one of the engines and see if it stopped. After 1.5 hours on the plane we were told we would have to deplane We were given a 20 dollar voucher but only one cafe to spend it in, so the queue was enormous. The business lounge was reopened but very little food was available until lunchtime. No information was forthcoming, eventually our brother in law in Sydney told us that it was showing on the computer that the flight was leaving at 1540 but we had not been told this. Eventually it got round that it would now be 1640 but still nothing official to business class passengers - if announcements were made outside they were not conveyed to us. Eventually a woman told us at 3.00 pm that the flight was cancelled - no empathy, no real apology just that we had to reclaim our baggage and recheck in. No announcement was made where our baggage would be and no sign appeared on the belt, and eventually it appeared on a domestic carousel. Eventually we were called out of the queue and told we would be put on Emirates flight. For the first time the attitude was more appropriate. When we went back to the lounge as Emirates passengers, the same woman who had told us an hour previously our flight was cancelled appeared to have no recollection of that event. An airline needs to be judged how they manage things when they go wrong, and Qantas fell woefully short.

### "fantastic flight with Qantas"
❎ Unverified |  Adelaide to Melbourne and a fantastic flight with Qantas. Smooth flight, friendly crew and great service. The only negative comment is that this was a breakfast flight and it is lacking in the amount of food. Gone are the days when you got served on a tray with all the trimmings, it was a choice of yogurt or a toasted egg and bacon sandwich. All served in a box. One could think they were on a budget carrier. Come on Qantas lift your game.

### "poor, really poor"
Paid a lot of money to travel business class from Joburg to Sydney 2 Feb 2017. Looked forward to relaxing into comfy chairs and enjoying some great food, drinks and amenities in the business class lounge for a few hours while we waited for our connecting flight back home to Sydney. What a shock. 2 refrigerated rows of old pre-packed sandwiches, a Bain Marie of over-salted rissoles (inedible), 2 really overcooked, mashed pasta dishes and 1 other meaty looking mess we weren't game to try and some over-cooked rice. Opted for a bag of crisps and parked ourselves in a couple of hugely high-backed, hard and uncomfortable chairs. Disgusted. We have patronised business class lounges for Emirates, British Airways and other Qantas lounges and never experienced the likes of this. Not sure whether QANTAS or OR Tambo Airport are responsible but definitely the Shongololo Lounge is the absolute worst. I actually asked the lady at the front desk for clarification that we were actually in the business class lounge and was advised that the only other one was even smaller. Poor, really poor.

### "make this flight a breeze"
Qantas make this 22 hour flight from London Heathrow to Melbourne via Dubai a breeze. Cocooned in the pod, infinitely variable seat positions provide comfort - reading, using IFE, listening to music or sleeping - and you get pyjamas and a mattress. London Heathrow Check in quick and easy but the promised FastTrack security proved anything but (not the airline's fault). Cathay Pacific Lounge provided nice coffee, a good selection of food and a nice view of the airport. Boarding was ideal with no queuing. IFE provides a wide selection of films and tv, music and radio too. Dubai stopover short and sweet, good lounge with direct access to gate. What a good idea. Melbourne immigration now completely automated so more passport stamps. But the customs declaration form is still as formidable (and necessary) as ever which will create a long queue (and to give the customs people credit, they got the queues moving) and we were out 45mins after leaving the plane.

### "sub-standard when it comes to passenger comfort"
I am a Qantas Frequent Flyer, and generally enjoy flying Qantas. I travel at least once per year to Indonesia, and usually opt to fly with Garuda Indonesia, but this time opted to use some of my Qantas points for a cheaper ticket. Compared with Garuda Indonesia on this same route, Qantas is sub-standard when it comes to passenger comfort. Both Qantas and Garuda Indonesia use an A330-200 on this route, however it seems that Qantas has opted to squeeze more seats into the economy cabin than Garuda Indonesia, as the amount of personal space, or lack-there-of on Qantas, is more than noticeable. I'll be sure to fly Qantas again, but certainly not on the Sydney - Jakarta Route, unless they change the aircraft type to the A330-300, the same which they use on their other Asian routes.

### "generally friendly and efficient"
Perth to Melbourne. Smooth comfortable flight, IFE using iPad Mini was a nice touch. The seat width was cramped due to a large but friendly lady sitting next to me. The food was included but not so tasty. Staff was generally friendly and efficient on the service. Good variety of shows to watch on IFE.

### "very smooth and pleasant flights"
Flights from Melbourne to Brisbane and return with Qantas Airways. The on-line check-in and automatic bag drop at both airports worked perfectly. Very smooth and pleasant flights, with friendly crews, decent seats and on-time performance. On the outward flight my vegetarian lunch was a kind of fried polenta vegetable sandwich - quite tasty. On the return flight there was a choice of light snacks. All in all a good experience.

### "menu options are disappointing"
Melbourne to Dubai with Qantas and Dubai to Paris on Emirates, both on A380. Emirates though not at the level it once was, but is still superior to Qantas. Qantas seat is comfortable if a liitle narrow for me. Food was ordinary, as I have found in the past best sticking to the snack menu for food. The other menu options are disappointing and a bit odd to me. Breakfast was dreadful - cold tea, lukewarm and tired food. It was a mess, all plonked down together on a tray in darkness. Crew were not the happiest bunch resulting in some rather brusque service. Emirates was a happier experience, they do the small touches better - hot towels, usb ports, wifi, bar area etc and with better humour. Food and IFE screen much better. There is very little diffecnce in seat comfort between the two. Qantas lounge cannot compare with Dubai unsurprisingly. I wouldn't recommend Qantas as first choice for Business considering you can get better experiences on other airlines for same price. An all-Emirates code share woud be a better option if youre mindful of your Qantas frequent flyer status.

### "my knees were jam packed against the seat in front"
Flying Qantas was quite a disappointment this January. Flew from Auckland to Melbourne. Not only problems to check in online due to a Qantas error in my name in the frequent flyer programme, but unable to change this myself. I have to call Qantas Australia to enable the change to my correct name. This was the first. Qantas also have a seat allocation problem unlike many other reputable airlines. As a frequent flyer with over 300,000 air-miles to date I am unable to choose a seat online. Even when checking in at the counter was told the flight was full. When on board there were whole rows unfilled and many rows with completely full. So a number of people moved around on the plane once airborne. Some bad planning here with little customer consideration. The seats in Qantas economy are so close that my knees were jam packed against the seat in front. The person in front of me reclined their seat as soon as airborne and I had a screen no more that 20cm from my face, making me have to recline my seat straight away, which in turn would have affected the person behind. On the return trip the meal served was a single small container of something barely edible, although there was a type of ice cream/popsicle that came out after.

### "service seems to be getting worse"
Perth to Melbourne. I am a frequent flyer with Qantas and the service seems to be getting worse. I fly 5 to 6 times a year with my family domestic and international. Ever since Virgin has introduced what it calls a full service from Perth to the East Coast, Qantas is cutting corner to match the prices. The food is turned from a tray service to a wrap in your hand with some wipes on my most recent flight. Cleanliness on my most recent flight a pillow was given to me that had food stains on it. The magazine pocket was full of the previous customer rubbish. The entertainment system both ways were not working between the four of us, only one IPad was working. The staff were running up and down as almost 30 to 40 people had the same issue and they finally announced over the PA that they can't help any more as they have run out of the spare systems. I requested  some cards or colouring books etc for the kids, only for the hostess to come back 30mins later and say sorry we haven't got any of those either.

### "whole experience was rather dire"
Auckland to Brisbane. The best thing about this flight was the staff. Courteous, smiling and accommodating. Thumbs up to them. In my opinion a Boeing 737 has a shelf life of about an hour and a half in economy. Possibly two hours max. Cramped in like sardines for three and a half hours is just too much. What are Qantas doing? Either you fly Jetstar for the supposed budget end, or Qantas for full service. Food was chronic. People lined up like sheep at the toilet at the rear, whilst they were not allowed to use the business class toilet, as that was for the six or seven pax in business. That was understandable, as they had paid the princely sum of around $1700 return for a seat little better than those horrible European business class offers. Surely the amount of traffic at Christmas time could warrant an A330 or something similar. The whole experience was rather dire. Never again. 1 star, just for the staff

### "old-fashioned cabin product"
Sydney to Santiago de Chile return. The Boeing 747 used on this route is extremely dated with a very old-fashioned cabin product, ancient IFE and no power or USB sockets. Staff seemed a bit unorganised and the food was pretty mediocre. Outbound Flight: Online check-in failed, but check-in at airport was very efficient. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed and the baggage did not make it to the connecting flight to Buenos Aires (operated by KLM but booked via Qantas). As a result, about two dozen Qantas passengers arrived in Buenos Aires without baggage and had to go back to the Airport the next day to pick it up which took half a day of my vacation. Return Flight: Online check-in failed again and check-in at airport took almost an hour because only three counters were open. Flight was delayed again by about an hour and IFE did not work at all the first few hours of the flight.

### "ditching Qantas for good"
Bangkok to Brisbane via Sydney. After being ripped off and treated with contempt by management, My wife and I decided to use up our accrued frequent flyer points before ditching Qantas for good. The outward flight was via Singapore was very acceptable. Naturally, we wanted to return the same way, but had to fly via Bangkok and Sydney. If we'd had sufficient points for all flights, we would have had to fly Jetstar via Melbourne. How stupid and inconvenient is that? Previously, we had to cancel a flight from Tokyo to Brisbane and could not do so online. The so called customer help line is a joke with minimum waiting times of at least one hour and I wasted 18 calls totalling 150 mins. before I could speak to someone (at 1.20 in the morning). The automated call back service seems to be non existent as not once were any of those calls answered. Qantas simply refuses to employ sufficient staff. My numerous emails were also ignored. The $60 we paid for advance seat allocation was non refundable. Regarding food, on two occasions between Brisbane and Singapore, the meal we wanted had run out. It seems that the caterers assume that most passengers will be Asian, therefore two of the three choices are spicy Asian dishes. I would like to point out that we have never had a complaint with staff either on the ground or in the air. This airline has lost two loyal frequent flyers due to the arrogance of management which is motivated by greed.

### "very disappointed with my Qantas flight"
I was very disappointed with my Qantas flight from Sydney to London in August 2016. At check-in I was given seat 51J and my son was given 74C. The staff at the boarding counter asked if I want to change the seat in order to sit together so I said okay. However, he changed our seats to 87D and 87E without my consent. I went back to him when I found out that the changed seats were worse than before. I told him I wanted our original seats of 51J and 74C back. He said he could give back seat 74C to my son but there was no way to give me back seat 51J. I was very unhappy sitting in a worse seat for more than 22 hours from London to Sydney. I was not happy with the cheap meals provided for long haul flights.

### "friendly crew members"
Sydney to San Francisco. It was a 14h 30' flight in the B747-400 and I really liked it. All the flights were on time, crew members were nice enough even to prepare me a toastie a couple of hours before landing, with an apple as I was very hungry. There is an open bar for Australian wines, so there is really nothing you can complain about. Yes, the planes are relatively old but as long as they are well maintained it is a pleasure to be onboard. On the short flight from AKL to SYD we got a warm meal, a rarity for many airlines nowadays. I was even greeted by the crew members as a Oneworld Emerald and they said it was a pleasure for having me onboard. Although some Australians in the plane were saying they prefer other airlines for the trip over the Pacific I would recommend Qantas and its friendly crew members.

### "something akin to a liveable environment"
Flew from Melbourne to Sydney. Goodbye coffins, hello ergonomic business class seats. If, like me, you hated the Qantas plastic coffins we have had to endure since their overhyped introduction in 2002 then you can now rest in peace. They're not gone but it seems that someone in Qantas customer service has taken on board the feedback and the new fleet is being rolled out with something akin to a liveable environment. They are not revolutionary, they are pretty much the same as Emirates and Etihad, but they work, they are comfy and if you select your flights correctly (they are currently only available in the new Airbus fleet) they are even available on short haul interstate flights (Syd-Mel). Better late than never.

### "everything matched my expectations"
I flew from Brisbane to Hong Kong with Qantas in December. It was good actually. I got upgraded to Business Class, so I felt excited when I was waiting for boarding at the airport. Everything matched my expectations, but some improvements possible. The Business Class product was superb and appealing; the seat can be adjusted to a fully flat-bed mode, and the built-in massage feature was great. Furthermore, the were a number of choices for the meal. Once I had got my meal, it was fabulous. Conversely, the cabin crew seemed to be impolite and unfriendly to me. Some of them did not want to serve me or the other passengers. (Fake smile or never smile) Moreover, the cabin looked a bit dull. The mood lighting was not effective or I think it was unavailable in that flight. Comparing this to Cathay Pacific or the other airlines, they have mood lighting, and this feature makes me feel comfortable all the time. Overall, it is not a bad airline.

### "very happy with the service"
Melbourne to London via Dubai. My Wife and I were very happy with the service from Qantas staff on the flight. We flew on frequent flyer points and travelled in the upper deck section at the rear in economy. The service was good both ways. We were impressed with the overall cleanliness in the cabin and toilet. The snack bar on the lower level at the base of the spiral stair case was also popular. Alcoholic drinks were readily available. One of the best flights we have had going to the UK after many times with numerous airlines.

### "welcoming and willing to assist"
Brisbane to Christchurch. Aircraft departed on time from Brisbane. 8 out of 12 seats occupied in business class. About 80% occupancy throughout aircraft. Aircraft clean, and blankets and pillows offered in every seat. Noise cancelling headphones not bad, but prefer to use my own. Television/movie selection okay for this 3.5 hour sector. Drinks served up prior to departure. Food selection not bad. Flight attendants welcoming and willing to assist. Toilet kept clean. First to deplane with bags already on belt at Christchurch airport. This aircraft was operated exclusively by Qantas' New Zealand Jetconnect and is showing some age. A fair bit of scuff markings throughout the cabin. I find the Jetconnect crews are always polite and helpful on New Zealand sectors. A great flight!

### "surprised at how ordinary it was"
Melbourne to London via Dubai. We've booked seats with AA advantage mile members program 11 months in advance, and were very much looking forward to it. The pickup Mercedes van was comfortable, as well as the special check-in counter. We were escorted through tax refund and custom and had a lovely hand and foot massage. As it was a midnight flight, we had plenty of time to sample the highly anticipated Niel Perry menu. I was surprised at how ordinary it was, as I was expecting a restaurant quality I could only rate it only as that of a good cafe quality. We had the much talked about Salt and Pepper squids, Braised beef in red wine, and the deconstructed Pavlova, and by the end of the meal, I was really hoping that the quality will improve once we embarked. The seat was spacious, but showing the signs of age. The staff are fairly attentive and well groomed. The bed was made for us and was very comfortable. The Mezze entree plate was tasty, but the lamb Koftas were quite undercooked, and looked raw inside! My main couse of Patagonia tooth fish was nothing special. I found the fish to be quite strong in flavour. As it was quite late, I don't remember being offered any dessert. Breakfast was served a few hours before London arrival, and it was one of the worst breakfast I've had flying! The meal was delivered lukewarm, with 2 grey tasteless sausages, tepid scrambled eggs and a slop of mushed cold baked beans. Needless to say, I hardly touched the breakfast. My husband also had a glass of champagne knocked over him by the Service Manager! He offered the customary laundry receipt claim etc, which we declined as it would have been too much of a hassle. My husband was disappointed also to find that his clothes was being treated without care, by being hung carelessly on a hanger. This overall experience, made us realised that First Class is not worth the money, especially on Qantas. We've flown CX, Qatar, Etihad, Alitalia, all in Business and I have to say that they are far superior to Qantas first class. I'll stick with superior Asian and Middle Eastern airlines in the future.

### "the seat was fabulous"
Perth to Melbourne was an absolute delight. The ground crew dealt with two misunderstandings on my part with professionalism. The lounge was very spacious and appropriately serviced for the time of day. A cappuccino coffee was exceptional. The seat was fabulous for this flight duration - fullyflat (if needed) and a design that promoted privacy. A blanket and size pillow were provided but not used. Large IFE screen. A three course meal was served and the food was very good, with 5 choices for main course. Wine choices were limited but the quality was more than acceptable. Four crew members ensured a constant presence in the cabin and were delightful. Arrival was on time.

### "no recognition, no welcome"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. As a Qantas platinum frequent fllier and one who has been at this status for a few years, from time to time I do fly economy. You would think that qantas would take care of their Platinum FF even when in economy. No such luck. No recognition, no welcome, no attention to detail in terms of service. Very disappointing. Etihad and Emirates economy makes Qantas look dated and with the choice of entertainment and food and service on those carriers, it's no wonder I now share my business

### "great attention to detail"
Melbourne to Santiago via Sydney with Qantas. A fantastic flight with great attention to detail and a welcoming presence from the cabin crew. The premium economy product is impressive: a larger seat, lots of leg room (for someone 6'2" like myself, essential) and better quality food and drinks than economy. Our sales fares meant the cost was only slightly more than economy and therefore well worth the expense. Everything is improved a notch enough to make the flight a pleasant experience and not the rage-inducer that economy can be. Highly recommended.

### "warm, friendly service"
Tuesday November 29, I flew Qantas back home again after a holiday in Tasmania and Sydney, leaving Sydney a little after 6pm (QF743). The wonderful experience commenced at check-in, where I was treated to the warm, friendly service Qantas is famous for. The check-in lady didn't hesitate to change my seat when I requested another one. Just like on the flight to Melbourne a fortnight prior, the aircraft was fitted with the new economy seats, however, this time, had no seatback entertainment, with only the drop-down mainscreen entertainment available alongside in-seat audio entertainment. Dinner this evening was a choice of Thai Chicken Noodle Salad with coconut dressing, or a Tomato and Capsicum Pasta. I opted for the Salad, and was amazed at just how filling and delicious it was. Once again, the crew were an absolute pleasure, and it's experiences like these that make me want to return to our national carrier time and time again.

### "the crew were an absolute pleasure"
Wednesday November 16th, I flew Qantas on the 06.05 to Melbourne (QF670). I was pleasantly surprised at just how memorable a short one hour flight to Melbourne could become. On this aircraft, the refurbished economy seats all featured seatback entertainment, and despite being a little on the slow side, I managed to keep myself entertained. Breakfast (now served in boxes instead of trays) was a choice of Bacon Frittata or Yoghurt Granola. I opted for the Frittata and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty and flavoursome it was. To top it off, the crew were an absolute pleasure, and were all incredibly attentive and caring.

### "the crew did a great job"
My first experience on Qantas A380 was a pleasant one flying from Sydney to London via Dubai. The ground staff were friendly and helpful. The A380 looks a bit old inside, the colours (green and orange) are not particularly attractive and even the seat belts seemed to have had a rough time. However, the crew did a great job, they worked hard throughout the flight, and always with a smile on their face. The food was nice. It's served on a plastic platter and consists of a main meal and a dessert with a small piece of bread. The pilot who landed the plane in London was very good. I rate Qantas very high and will definitely be flying with them again.

### "very poor food and service"
Dubai to Londong Heathrow with Qantas. Flight delayed several hours, very little information, delay announced in several stages, no complimentary refreshment, no Quantas desk in departure lounge or representative available and no information available from Emirates. Very poor food and service onboard.

### "should match the expectation"
Sydney to London via Dubai in Premium Economy. I’ve traveled in PE before on Qantas and it’s been underwhelming. On the last occasion and this time, I used QFF points to upgrade from Economy, but no matter how you get there PE is an expensive jump in cost and in the past, it’s not lived up to the hype. This time was different and service was impeccable. There were frequent drinks top ups and constant attention to detail. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and drink for the most part. Wine was served from full size bottles of decent brands and the dinner out of Sydney was excellent. I’ve heard people say that Premium Economy food is the same as Economy but in this instance the dishes on Q-Eat were I think different between the two classes – I had ordered on both – before and after the upgrade. Anyway, it was a very nice dinner service with all the trimmings served on white linen and felt like a premium service. The seat is not too bad, it’s wide with lots of leg room and I managed a few hours of sleep up to Dubai. For solo travelers 24A and 24K are the best seats, window seats on the exit row. The blankets, pillows and headphones are the same as Business Class and you share the rear Business Class bathrooms. The only disappointment was the strange supper dish served before landing in Dubai, it was an egg roll with an accompanying chicken sausage. It was really not at all nice but I ate it as I was hungry by now. Then to the second leg out of Dubai and it soon became evident that this leg would be back to the Premium Economy that I remembered from the past, so Y Class with a tablecloth. The cabin crew were nice enough but it was not the same level of service. After what seemed like quite a time after take-off they came around with a supper service of hot sandwiches which were OK, but it seemed like only coffee or tea or juice was loaded on the trolley. This was in the middle of the night out of Dubai at the start of a night leg into London, who wants coffee at that time? Me and many of the people around me asked for a glass of wine or similar. That was met with a call back to the galley and a small bottle of economy wine was given to each. When the trays were cleared no more drinks were offered, though I guess you could request them. That was pretty much it for that crew until two hours before landing when they served a substantial hot and cold breakfast and then they were done. So hot towels like the first leg, either on decent or after take-off, really just Y service with a tablecloth. The crew were nice enough but some of them need to be reminded that PE is an expensive seat and the service level should match the expectation of a ticket costing two or three times the cost of Economy.

### "crew were cheerful, efficient"
Auckland to Perth with Qantas. The flight was smooth and on time. Plane was about two thirds full. The crew were cheerful, efficient, very pleasant and most helpful. The cabin was comfortable. Particular kudos also to the Qantas service desk people at Auckland airport who arranged for our early check in.

### "the crews were fine"
My wife and I flew Qantas from Sydney to Alice Springs on a B737-800 and on to Ayres Rock on a B717 of QantasLink. We were served a pie and numerous drinks on the first leg and a bottle of water on the 40 minute connection to Ayres Rock. Both flights left and arrived on time and the crews were fine.

### "an airline that has lost its way"
San Francisco to Sydney. Just confirmed my thoughts, Qantas is an airline that has lost its way. The lounge was far too busy and offerings were very average. The new layout in the reconfigured Boeing 747 is very tight up front and there is little room to navigate your way to washrooms when people are sleeping. The staff were less than impressive in my cabin they seemed more interested in some friends or family than the paying clients. Qantas does this thing where its late at night after the poor lounge experience all you would like is a snack before you sleep, 2.5 hours after take off they begrudgingly offer you something to eat. I always thought American Airlines was terrible, but my last several flights on them have far exceeded my Qantas experience. I have held platinum for more than 15 years in a row and really would not care if never flew Qantas again - the staff are an embarrassment to a great Australian brand.

### "inflight entertainment system was a little surprising"
Flew Qantas from Sydney to Melbourne The inflight entertainment system was a little surprising with iPads (iPad mini with Retina display) and Q Streaming, but it's far better than traditional screens in my opionion. It was far more responsive and finally, supports scrolling. The flight got a bit delayed because of a non co-operative passenger, but the captain was nice enough to give us multiple streams of information and kept us updated. Would consider flying with Qantas again. I rated two stars for connectivity because you could connect your own device to q streaming and transfer into your own in-flight enternment system if you don't like the provided iPads.

### "both legs were upgraded"
Cairns to Melbourne via Sydney, Cairns-Sydney on a Boing 737-800 Seat 1F, Sydney-Melbourne the A330-200 Business Suite 1K, and both legs of the journey were successfully upgraded 24 hours before departure. I feel pretty lucky considering I’m only holding Bronze FFlyer status. Ground staff efficient and polite. Cairns domestic terminal is relatively compact and its Qantas Club lounge not too big but clean, comfortable and an adequate selection of food and beverage. After boarding welcome drinks were offered along with verbal menus. The food served was delicious lemon chicken with rice followed by ice-cream. The cabin crew offered passengers more drinks throughout the flight. Seat configuration 2x2 with standard leg room, IFE is of decent size with enough contents to keep passengers entertained on domestic routes. I had nearly 4 hours transit time at Sydney Airport, during which I ate dinner and a  shower. Onboard the one hour hop from Sydney to Melbourne, I was allocated a seat in the first row. Configuration is 1x2x1 with extra wide seat, soft cushion, IFE screen etc. I cannot fault Qantas on these flights.

### "really very pleasant"
Qantas again prove how well they do domestic. It's just a short hop Melbourne to Canberra but it was really very pleasant. Clean plane, personable pilot who pointed out what could be seen by passengers as we approached Canberra. If you knew (we didn't) we could have downloaded the Qantas entertainment app to see a show. Were given a choice of hot drink / juice / water and a muffin plus a small extra water. Arrival and landing uneventful. The cabin crew were indifferent (unsmiling) but for a short trip it didn't really matter.

### "breakfast sounded good but tasted awful"
Flew Auckland to Melbourne with Qantas. Friendly, efficient ground staff made the early morning check in a breeze. The warm service continued on the flight. The breakfast sounded good but tasted awful due to the soggy hash brown and the baked beans that are too messy to have on a flight. Something a little more elegant would be preferred. The inflight entertainment was also quite limited.

### "whole experience with Qantas these days is very good"
A regulation trip on QF up to Singapore on QF5. The whole experience with Qantas these days is very good. Although biased as QFF, there is now a buzz about flying with them. Changes that could eb made? The Sydney business lounge is solid but compared to the Singapore or HK lounges, is now in need of a renovation. The aircraft itself was also one of the older models with a tiny seat back VOD screens. The 787 cannot come soon enough or indeed to put one of the newer refurbished A330 on the route.

### "what an improvement in their product"
We travel annually to Europe. Have not flown Qantas for some years. What an improvement in their product. The flight QF009 (Melbourne to London via Dubai) is well timed and direct. Staff on both sectors were helpful and professional. Seats were comfortable and you are given a semi mattress and a quilt. We slept well. Food has greatly improved. All in all a very professional product.

### "the service was fantastic"
Melbourne to Los Angeles. The service on this 15+ hour flight was fantastic! Friendly cabin crew made the flight a pleasure. Really good food, and more than adequate entertainment. My only complaint is other passengers: Just how much cabin luggage does one person need? Can't fit it in the locker above your seat? Then put it under the seat, not in the overhead space used by other passengers! Ideally, the airlines would enforce this for more comfortable travel, but they want to get their aircraft into the air on schedule. Airfares are now cheaper than they have ever been, and people are still complaining. One last request: Please try and consider the passenger in front of you. Banging and kicking your seat is very annoying. And you can actually stand up and sit down without using the headrest of the sleeping passenger if front of you!

### "it really does feel like home when stepping on"
QF2 back to Sydney from London being the last leg of a Sydney-Singapore-London trip. It is hard to find something to say which means it was a pretty uneventful and steady run with Qantas again. On time departures and arrivals at all ports. F & B was fine, the FA's were great and always nice to hear a reassuring Australian voice at the controls. Two things. One was the flight being completely full. Really packed. Is it time for Qantas to have two London flights from Sydney or possibly to add a Perth flight? Last few times on QF1 & 2 there have been no empty seats. All well and good outsourcing some of the flights to Emirates but will always choose Qantas where possible. Second, Qantas should fit WiFi into the A380 service. EK has it and was good value. Being out of touch for 20 hours whilst flying is not really acceptable these days. These days getting on a Qantas long haul jet means it really does feel like home when stepping on. Check out the safety briefing. Quirky, typically Australian and great sights and sounds of our wide brown, beautiful sun kissed land.

### "staff professional and friendly"
My partner and I flew Qantas from Singapore to Sydney, on a refurbished A330-300. The aircraft cabin was clean and modern, IFE was quick and screen large with great content. The moving map was not operational on this flight. I especially liked the 2-4-2 seat layout. Seats are comfortable with good recline and good leg room. The flight departed Singapore 30 minutes late but arrived on time in Sydney. The meal service was OK. The welcome drink was cordial which I feel is a bit tacky. The main meal was very flavoursome and a good size, dessert a dry cake. We were only offered drinks once with dinner which was disappointing. Most airlines do a drinks round pre dinner, with dinner and after dinner. Not Qantas. Breakfast a pastry with a chocolate filling. It wasn't very tasty. I would have liked a choice of a hot meal. Staff were professional and friendly. Communication was great. Would I fly Qantas again? Possibly, but would more likely go with an Asian carrier.

### "rude and condescending"
Sydney to Bangkok with Qantas. The people at the check-in counter in Sydney were very rude and condescending. One of the staff was the least helpful person I have ever encountered in an airport. I was flying with a large group and we were forced to be separated, which further complicated everything. Our director was not informed that we all needed a copy of our flight itinerary. I will not be flying them again based on this customer service.

### "never flying them again"
Sydney to Melbourne, the seats small and compact no leg room and I'm tiny. Food and beverage small and unsatisfying. Return was a nightmare with horrible customer service. Go here. Go there. Check in here. Oh you've been in line for 30 minutes, too bad we're no longer accepting your boarding flight by 1 minute. Ridiculous transfer fees for their crippling slow process. Never flying with them again. A lady next to me asked if there were any other options available - the rude cabin staff replied: Like What?

### "should have flown Jetstar"
Singapore to Melbourne with Qantas (QF36). Firstly late departure, no inflight entertainment as it was broken since flying from Brisbane earlier that day and not fixed - we can give you a magazine to read, never got one. The dinner was average and later the fresh fruit was a choice of banana or banana, the complimentary greeting drink was a bottle of water and the breakfast a dried shrivelled burnt danish with no filling - inedible in a cardboard box not fit to give to a dog. Qantas need to lift their game other Asian airlines win hands down for service and food. When I complained about the danish the flight attendant said we could get you another. What another burnt one? Don't bother I said. Paying a premium to travel Qantas when I could have flown Emirates for same price, better food and service or should have flown Jetstar as a budget - would still have been better than Qantas

### "IFE was amongst the best I've seen"
Flew Sydney to Singapore. A frustrating start to my journey as confusing signage at SYD led me to the wrong check-in area, before a staff member rather rudely redirected me to a desk for online checked-in passengers - even though the desks in the area I was queueing for said the same thing. The flight got off to a shaky start too, as boarding was delayed for more than half an hour with no explanation from gate staff other than two vague and non-reassuring references to a "technical issue". I was certain we'd be very late, however to Qantas' credit they made up time with the quickest boarding I've ever seen and we departed less than 5 minutes behind schedule. On board, the A330 was comfortable and modern and the IFE was amongst the best I've seen - certainly on par with Emirates in terms of quality, although perhaps not quite so much choice (but certainly more offerings to my taste). The 2-4-2 seating layout makes the A330 the ideal aircraft for travelling in a couple. Some crew were friendlier than others but overall I felt looked after. The meal choices were rather limited although the food was of a good quality. I would have preferred more frequent snacks. Service was excellent for the first part of the flight but all but disappeared around half way - disappointing as I would have preferred further drink and snack runs and was left hungry. To be fair, some turbulence late in the flight precluded the crew from offering a full service. Arrival in Singapore was smooth, with efficient deplaning and quick baggage offload. Overall a very comfortable and satisfying flight, Qantas could be excellent if a couple of customer service issues could be ironed out.

### "very good value for money"
Flew from Brisbane to Christchurch. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. The aircraft was around 70% full. Meal service included a hot or continental breakfast option. I chose continental and it was plentiful and filling. Coffee and tea offered along with soft drinks and water. Seperate water runs conducted before and after meal service. Inflight entertainment was well stocked with latest media content. Aircraft clean. Bags out quickly in Christchurch. The price I purchased these flights at makes it very good value for money. Very happy with Qantas.

### "difference was the superb service"
Sydney to Johannesburg with Qantas in Premium Economy. Boarding was quick and efficient with sparkling wine or fruit juice offered prior to take off. The Senior Cabin Attendant came round to introduce herself and advised who would be providing service during the flight. This is the first time we have experienced this personal touch, and throughout the flight the service was excellent, including the cabin attendant coming round to say goodbye and wish well on arrival. The premium economy seat is very comfortable and has plenty of space, although the leg / footrest could be improved. This was a 14 hour daylight flight. Bar service after takeoff included an excellent choice of wines. Food was very good. Slow roasted lamb shank - newly introduced Neil Perry meal featured in Qantas magazine - was superb. Second full meal, also very good, was served about 6 hours later. A snack was then offered about an hour before arrival. Throughout the flight the crew were available, and came round on a regular basis. The entertainment on offer is extensive, and whilst nothing appealed in the wide choice of films, none of which seemed very recent releases, there was an extensive range of CDs from which a playlist could be compiled, and enjoyed through good noise reducing earphones. Overall this was an excellent flight despite its length, and whilst the aircraft was very good, the difference was the superb service.

### "couldn't fault Qantas on this trip"
Melbourne to Sydney with Qantas. Aircraft was a B737-800. Check-in at Melbourne was a breeze; all self-service where you print your own luggage tags and boarding passes. Many would call it impersonal but there were plenty of friendly Qantas staff around to answer questions. We were through security within 10 minutes of arrival. Boarding was efficient and on-time, with the crew courteous and professional right from the start. Nice to see an airline which sometimes get bad press for cost-cutting still try and put itself apart from the budget carriers with small touches like attitude. No seat back IFE in the aircraft we got but live streaming Sky News as well as streaming video via the Qantas app would have provided ample entertainment even on a longer flight. Soft drinks and a snack (bag of cookies) were provided - very basic but then again the flight was only an hour long. On-time arrival in Sydney together with efficient deplaning and swift arrival of baggage. Couldn't fault Qantas on this trip.

### "like travelling back in time"
Dubai to Melbourne. Having flown into Dubai with Emirates, The transfer to Qantas was like travelling back in time to the 1990s. Oppressive dark cabin with dark grey pods six abreast in groups of two. The seats are just satisfactory but the small touch screens deliver only the most basic information about the flight. Departure and arrival were on time and the meals were good, particularly the dinner before landing. But instead of lighting up the cabin, we ate in semi-darkness that just added to the depressive environment. Staff worked hard especially before landing. What is particularly annoying, given the cost of flying with Qantas, is that the airline has a three section cabin upstairs. At the rear is Premium Economy, in the middle Business, and in front of the service section is a sort of small Elite Business for those with high Frequent Flyer points, which unlike the main cabin, was only about half full. Never again with Qantas.

### "crew were extremely friendly"
Sydney to Singapore. Flying on an A330 with Qantas I was expecting to be on a new plane, unfortunately we weren't. This was about the tenth time I have flown with Qantas on an international flight, normally Qantas food is exceptional though on this route I was slightly dissapointed as the dessert was nothing special - however my main meal and garlic bread were served warm and tasted great, and the panini I had towards landing was excellent. The entertainment on Qantas is great especially the travel and lifestyle section. The crew were extremely friendly and I had a great chat with them. The flight from Sydney to Singapore was about $360 AUD one way which is pretty good for value, Singapore Airlines that route would of cost about $520 one way.

### "put some thought back into QF airline meals"
I have just completed a Brisbane - Hong Kong return flight on QF97/98. I am a regular Qantas customer. The inflight food service/choice offered on both of these flights was atrocious. The food portions are now very small, with just a main meal and dessert on a very small plastic tray. On the return flight last night, the dinner choices were 1) Cold Duck salad 2) Fish and 3) Chicken. I chose the chicken meal which consisted of three small grey pieces of boiled chicken. This was accompanied by some green spinach and white rice. It was absolutely shocking. I know I do not fly for the food, but please put some thought back into QF airline meals. It is such a decline in dining standards. I just laughed today when I saw a TV ad for the new QF Dreamliner and the wow factor. I hope they spruce up the food by 2017.

### "the worst experience ever"
Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles. This was my first time to fly with Qantas. I purchased a Premium economy seat with my husband and got upgraded to Business for part. Our trip back from Melbourne to USA got changed because there was something wrong with the plane. We had to take 10+ hour delay and nobody ever apologized! Because of the changes, they put us on economy from Los Angeles to New York. Now, it's been more than a month that I am trying to get back our refund and Qantas is not cooperating. It is the worst experience ever! Do not believe in Qantas as soon as you have issue with them, you won't be able to get a decent customer service representative and even if you get someone on the phone, they will just direct you into circles, which are obviously created so you give up!

### "impressed with staff"
Flew Brisbane to Sydney return with Qantas Airways. Flight delayed out from Brisbane due to cargo loader blowing a hydraulic hose causing oil to spray over aircraft. Updates provided while waiting for oil cleanup. No water runs though while waiting for an extra 40 minutes. Breakfast served once flying. Time made up in flight. Impressed with staff ensuring connections maintained while inflight. Apparently liaising with ground staff while inflight. Return flight on full B737. The afternoon snack is left to be desired. Crackers and cheese is cheap and hardly worth the effort to hand out. Drinks plentiful. Flight was on time departing and arriving. Bags were sporadic on the baggage belt and mixed with a flight from Adelaide. Half an hour waiting for bags in Brisbane. Both aircraft clean, staff friendly and professional. Overall happy with service on these flights.

### "thoroughly enjoyed my experience"
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Qantas Airways on this flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne. Shortly after settling into my spacious seat, I was offered a glass of champagne and warm mixed nuts. The flight attendants were very polite and professional, addressing me by name at all times. The food selection was pretty good and snacks such as fruit bowls, chocolates or muesli bars were available on request throughout the flight. IFE was top notch, especially when coupled with the comfy noise-cancelling headphones.

### "Qantas doesn't come close"
Due to my schedule I flew to London with Emirates and back to Melbourne with Qantas. I thought that being a code share the airlines would offer more or less the same First Class product. I was wrong. Qantas doesn't come close. Instead of the private "suite" you get a strange angled seat with no privacy and plenty of noise/disturbance from other pax. The toilet is more like a small cupboard with absolutely no amenities in stark contrast to the roomy Emirates bathroom complete with shower. Considering we are asked to pay the same price for both products, Qantas really does come a poor second and having learned from the experience I will do everything I can to avoid making the same mistake again.

### "service of Qantas was very satisfactory"
Having booked my ticket 10 months ahead, not only did I get a very good price, I was able to choose my seat at row 4, which is the first row of economy just behind business. Considering the business class seat is only slightly wider, with almost the same sized TV, I think I had made a very wise decision. As business class would have cost me 5 times more. Had I paid for that, and knowing what I got, I would have kicked myself. Being a One world emerald member with Sri Lankan airlines, I was greeted by the purser warmly, with immigration card, fast track card and business class headphone offered. Not only that, I find with both my flights, the seat in the middle was simply left empty between me and my neighbour, which kind of turned into a European style business class. Meals and drinks are of course from economy class, which was no problem and delicious. Being emerald member allowed me extra 20kg luggage and priority baggage handling, it really made no difference to flying in business class actually, except I was paying very cheap economy price, but still with all the perks. The service of Qantas was very satisfactory and the journey had been very enjoyable, and best of all, on time.

### "value is simply not there"
Sydney to Auckland with Qantas. Left on time, arrived on time and the inflight service was impeccable and the breakfast provided excellent. I would really like to give a higher mark but when you pay the same dollars for 38 inches and a standard reclining seat on a 737 in Business Class across the Tasman as you do for a fully flat bed on Emirates the value is simply not there. I believe that Qantas should call this product Premium Economy and price it accordingly.

### "really great flight"
436112Canberra to Adelaide. Lucky enough to enjoy an upgrade on the flight home which was great. Seated in 3F, the leather seat was comfortable and the flight got off to a great start with a glass of chilled spring water. Staff were great and the dinner service was seamless - could not fault it. The food was excellent as was the wine. A really great flight.

### "let down by disgusting food "
London to Sydney via Dubai. Seat and leg room great (I'm 6'3 and didn't feel cramped). Yes it's a bit tight when the seat in front reclines but not a huge deal. Service was friendly, attentive and faultless. Food was absolutely woeful on all legs. Ordered on Q Eat prior to check in but still got asked what I wanted to eat - not sure what the whole point in ordering ahead of time is as the cabin crew seemed oblivious to any pre-ordered meals. Small portions, terrible choice of meals and the food itself was pretty sub par; probably on a level with some of the worst economy food I've ever tasted. Toilets could have done with an occasional clean. Choice of inflight entertainment was great - enough to keep me entertained for both legs. Overall a great Premium Economy product, absolutely let down by the disgusting food for every meal.

### "a pretty consistent product"
Another domestic sector from Adelaide to Canberra with Qantas to Canberra, all in all, QF Domestic Economy is a pretty consistent product. Departure was on time which is great for a weeknight business flight. Cabin service was executed well with the food drop and beverage service completed quickly. Had the Beef and Mushroom Pie (which I have had before) which was OK. The boxed food can be variable in quality. Flight was slightly early and baggage was much quicker than last time. Great flight.

### "narrow seats and tight spacing"
Flew Qantas Airways from Brisbane to Christchurch. Frustrating 40 minute delay after boarding, as it was discovered that oxygen bottles used the previous delay had not been refilled. Very cramped with narrow seats and tight spacing. Aircraft was very new and seating seemed much more cramped than we are used to on 737's. Overall very uncomfortable for a flight of this length. Very good quality breakfast served, but this was spoilt by very long delay in clearing away. Only 4 crew, 2 serving 162 economy passengers. Long queues for toilets, pity the poor passengers in the last few rows. Touch screen very insensitive and frustrating to use.

### "crew were unimpressive"
Los Angeles to Melbourne with Qantas. The food choices on this 10:00 PM flight consisted of supper only and were disappointing. Qantas seemed to be skimping because the flight is a night flight. The IFE options remain poor with few current movies. The all female FA crew were unimpressive with little interaction. Passengers were never addressed by name and any request outside the usual was not dealt with. Breakfast was small and a second coffee was not offered. The Sky Bed is a generation behind the benchmark and storage is lacking.

### "meal choices surprisingly limited"
Melbourne to Los Angeles with Qantas. I flew business class after previously flying Virgin Australia on the same route. The meal choices were surprisingly limited. The wine was reasonable for business but nothing outstanding. IFE movie choice was very poor with only 1 movie that looked current. The all male crew of FAs were good. The Sky Bed is showing it's age and is at least a generation behind the benchmark on other airlines. Qantas currently has an advantage of direct flights but will need to improve once Virgin starts direct flights again.

### "Very smooth flight"
Our return flight QF634 1 October Melbourne to Brisbane checked in using mobile phone - saves time and avoids paper boarding pass. Aisle seats of choice for two of us. Appeared to be a fairly full flight and dinner served. Gluten Free meal option for coeliac was potatoes meat with green beans that was good. Husband had choice of chicken salad or chicken noodles. Cabin crew offered soft drinks and hot drinks followed by a small chocolate. Very smooth flight and arrived on time.

### "expectations were exceeded"
London to Townsville via Perth & Brisbane with Qantas. When it comes to legacy airlines, especially those that have only just come back into black from near financial ruin, one doesn't expect much when travelling down the back in economy. In these circumstances it would be easy to say that my expectations were exceeded because I wasn't really expecting much. However, the overall quality of product and service goes far beyond this. I was booked on QF10 from LHR-DXB. It's a relatively short 7 hour flight and having travelled this route with both British Airways and Emirates I thought I knew what to expect. It was therefore a real pleasure to find a large, comfy pillow and lovely wide seat to relax in. The non-alcoholic welcome cocktail was a nice touch and there was a good selection of other drinks to choose from. I had been super intrigued to find out how the Qantas 'no tray' meal service works. In effect you do get one small tray on which sits the hot part of the meal. A pre-buttered hot roll is rested on top and the dessert comes in a separate disposable pot. It's an original and quirky idea which does work. However, I couldn't help but think that this deliberately allows Qantas to cut back on meal add ons like cheese and biscuits. Luckily the lamb curry and crumble dessert were of a decent size and tasty. The wine was of good quality and the post lunch hot drink offering was good. I wish I had gone for the hot chocolate and marshmallow option when I saw it was available but opted for the healthier peppermint tea. Throughout the rest of the flight the crew remained in the cabin offering water, juices and fresh fruit. The second snack meal was a tasty, heated pastry. One could help themselves to sweet granola bars from the galley during the flight. Cabin crew were professional and generally hospitable. The flight took off just a few minutes late despite a technical hitch in London and landed on time in Dubai. Luggage quickly arrived onto the carousel and I was out of the airport in next to no time. My second flight to Australia was with Emirates before rejoining Qantas in Perth to fly onto Brisbane and then a second flight up to Townsville. Check in at both PER and BNE was fully automated from seat selection to luggage tag printing and bag drop. Although this was efficient it did rather take away the human touch. The first flight to BNE was on an old 737 with little in the way of leg room and generally old, tired seats. Although there was no seatback IFE the plane was fitted with an audio/visual streaming service which was complimentary. There was a good choice of movies, TV shows and music. The second flight was just a short 2 hour hop. However, it was operated by a 737 with the new Boeing Sky interior, with seatback IFE. A dinner service was operated on this flight along with a chocolate Lindor to finish (a great touch). On both flights the crew were natural, warm and friendly. The new uniforms really stood out and showed off the crew in a good way. All in all a great experience with Qantas. I would highly recommend them after these flights.

### "we were sadly disappointed"
Having flown from Venice to Dubai on Emirates where we experienced good food and good all round service we expected nothing less from Qantas on our journey to Melbourne. We were sadly disappointed. A 14hr flight and only one meal. A couple of small snacks and drinks but only one meal. By the time the meal service reached us there was no choice. There was only Thai fish curry left - not a meal that appealed to either my husband or myself. The senior cabin steward did go to the business class and found a couple of pot pies which were very nice. Qantas seems to have dispensed with some of the nicer service touches such as wet wipes on the meal tray or warm towels for refreshing yourself after a meal. Compared to Emirates the entertainment system is very limited in content. We had attempted to obtain a business class upgrade on our flights to Europe using freqent flyer points. Qantas staff had been less than helpful - asking for $800+ before processing our request, with no guarantee of the upgrade and no refund if we were not able to get it. Having traveled to Europe less than 2 years ago on Emirates I found that Qantas was inferior in all areas.

### "cabin crew cheerful and busy"
Brisbane to Melbourne with Qantas (QF617). Mobile phone check-in and boarding pass. Seats of choice 26C and 26D aisle for the two of us. Slight delay but kept informed. The cabin was a little cold but told it should heat up soon which it did. Gluten Free toasted sandwich which was tasty. Cabin crew cheerful and busy. Appeared to be full flight. Landed safely. Good flight.

### "could not alter the seating"
Dubai to Wellington via Sydney. My elderly parents - my father is 88 years old with visual impairment and deaf, his wife is 75 with limited mobility due to arthritis and a recent hip replacement. They tried for an upgrade but this was unavailable. They next tried to pre select the seats but that was also unsuccessful. Instead they were given pre allocated seats that were 8 rows apart. There was no way we could alter this online so headed to the airport early. Sadly because this was a codeshare with Emirates (flying from Glasgow to Dubai with EK) we were told there add nothing we could do in Glasgow but I could phone Qantas ourselves. This we did and after a 20 minutes on the phone to a very helpful woman we were informed that the Qantas staff were in a break but when they were available she would sorry out the seating and get back to me. 45 minutes later and less than an hours before the parents had to go through security I called Qantas again. The person answering the phone could find no record of my previous call and more annoyingly could not alter the seating allocation for the parents but did say some one would get back to me in 48hours. So I left my elderly vulnerable parents at Glasgow worrying about how they will manage on the long leg of their journey with Qantas flying from Dubai to Sydney where they will not even have each other for support. Well done Qantas - how to make vulnerable people feel even more vulnerable.

### "quality of service"
Tokyo to Brisbane. Qantas demonstrated poor quality of service straight from check in. Compulsory check in via kiosk and lack of check-in counters created a huge queue. Flights were also delayed once for 2 hours and another time for 40 minutes. Food and service is a step up from JetStar, which in turn offer no food and little service. Drinks are limited to whisky, wine and beer. Food is a junk food range. Attention for customers flying overseas! If you will have a problem you won't be able to contact Qantas customer service as Qantas has no 24/7 support and no phone number for contact from overseas. You will be dealing with local staff who is not employed by Qantas and cannot make any decisions, provide accommodation, food or even an advice. Movies are 20 years old. Service is minimal and I had to repeat 4 times what drink I want and when I got it it was not what I asked for.

### "called by my name, attentive service"
Short flight to Sydney in seat 3A (last row of 3) at lunchtime Sunday. My baggage receipt did not print out at Bag Drop. Had to go looking for someone to help to see if this was an issue or not. Qantas ground staff suggested that I needed the receipt "especially as I was using QTag". That was a bit disconcerting. Anyway, I used QFF points but wouldn't pay money for business class on such a short flight. Leather seat had crumbs and the footrest was extended and no matter how much I pressed the button and pushed it with my legs, it would not budge. Flight attendant managed to get it stowed away for landing. Water or juice offered. Called by my name, attentive service. Plenty of room compared to economy but definitely not A380 Business Class. I opted for the ham and cheese open toasted sandwich. A bit oily, but tasty nonetheless. I didn't use the wifi or entertainment system. Priority boarding and disembarkation, bag first out on the baggage carousel. The flight left a few minutes late but arrived slightly early. Smooth flight.

### "avoid Qantas in the future"
Singapore to Sydney. Having seen the quality and quantity of food take a steep nose dive and a reduction in service in Qantas economy class over the last few years, we were hopeful of a better experience in business class from Singapore to Sydney. Unfortunately we were disappointed. The flat bed is great, very comfortable. But with only two flight attendants the service was just basic, they had no time for niceties. The food was disgraceful for a flight departing at 2000 hrs local time. A 'supper plate' was a small plate of uninteresting and bland food, served with one slice of bread. Not even any salt and pepper. That was it, one small plate. We were both still hungry so asked for the cheese platter, which consisted of two small pieces of cheese, two dried apricots and two crackers. Breakfast was equally skimpy. Instead of making rubbish such as cookies, ice creams and chocolate available during the flight (not that we saw them), the airline should concentrate on giving passengers proper meals. We had just flown Air France business class from Paris to Singapore with double the number of flight attendants, warm, attentive service and superb food, so the low standards on Qantas were very noticeable. We will avoid Qantas in any class in the future, there is no value for money.

### "seats were really uncomfortable"
Sydney to Singapore outbound on A330-300, refurbished with touchscreen IFE. Great seats and service. Sunday flight so a relaxed cabin. The return was on an A330-200, although refurbished was an earlier version. Have been on this plane on its Sydney to Perth service. For some reason the seats were really uncomfortable. Plane load of kids, nobody settling down and a restless night. The quality of the food was not so good. I am a biased Qantas frequent flyer so always happy with the airline.

### "the crew was attentive"
Jakarta to Melbourne via Sydney. I am surprised to see their new seat cover from dull and dark purple with black strips to maroon color although it still looks rather dark but the color gives me better mood. The screen looks bigger although some sectors still use portable ipad (I dislike it especially when it was dead on Melbourne Sydney sector) but the crew was attentive and replace it with the new one. The screen is good and wide. The check in counter made me a little bit uneasy when I was checking in from Sydney to Jakarta. I asked whether I need to produce my mother's hard copy OZ visa when passing through the immigration. She said no need in the beginning but later she added to take it with me just after luggages were being loaded to be weight and said "if you are worried since it does not worry me". Other than that she was fine. She even tried to help me in finding wheelchair for my mom. In terms of menu, they are mostly are great but I would suggest that Qantas better remove "fresh fruit and hot chocolate drink" as we did not get them.

### "Good service and nice food"
Sydney to Shanghai, returning Hong Kong to Brisbane. The new international A330 set up is really good for economy. I am 186cm (6ft1) tall and always have legroom problems - usually jamming my shins into the hinge of the seat in front of me. The new seats are terrific - somehow the new design means I can stretch my legs out under the seat in front of me and even go to sleep! Good service and nice food for lunch and a second service for dinner. I pre-ordered using the on-Q service - excellent - and they were always generous with the wine. Friendly staff and great entertainment system.

### "crew going through the motions"
Honolulu to Sydney. The flight started off well. Champagne was served prior to take-off and the flight left five minutes early. In the air however it soon became apparent, with one exception, that the senior flight crew were only going through the motions. And they did. I'm usually a fan of Neil Perry's food but the main courses chosen for lunch by my partner and myself were bland and tasteless. And the dinner (Moussaka) served before arriving was almost inedible (as well as being served lukewarm). On top of that, we were told by the disinterested crew, Qantas only load a couple of bottles of each type of white wine. Consequently the Chardonnay ran out first, then the Sauvignon Blanc and then the Riesling. And that was during lunch. We were on the same sector last October and they ran of Business Class white altogether. But the crew did offer to get some white wine from "down the back".

### "flight got away on time"
Took the direct service from Canberra to Adelaide tonight with Qantas. Flight got away on time and boarding was fast which is always a good start to a flight when you have been away. Dinner was served with free wine and beer in the Economy Cabin. Downside to the flight was the entertainment system freezing several times in my seat (13A). Also the bags took a long time to come out - more than 15 minutes after arriving at the carousel.

### "a good flight"
Travelled from Adelaide to Canberra on business on the evening service direct to Canberra with Qantas. I was seated in 19H which was comfortable. Dinner was served on the flight and I opted for the Beef and Mushroom pie which was OK. The flight left on time and got imto Canberra early which was great. All in all, a good flight.

### "seats spacious with good recline"
Johannesburg to Sydney. 2 hour delay and somewhat disorganised boarding, with totally ineffective manual carry on bag search just prior to boarding. Qantas allow priority boarding for  Premium economy along with business class, and the location of the cabin ensures quick disembarkation. On board pre take off drinks were served promptly. Premium economy seats spacious with good recline and footrest, and comfortable for sitting and sleeping. We both slept from for 7 hours. The small cabin, only 4 rows, is very nice, and service was good. Food mediocre, but nicely presented. Wide choice of entertainment with easy to use touch screen. Premium economy is a good offering on long haul which gives a lot of benefits for the extra cost.

### Qantas Airways customer review
This was a dinner-time flight with Qantas, and a pleasant one from Brisbane to Melbourne. The plane operated on time, the seating was comfortable enough, and the crew were friendly and efficient. My vegetarian meal (a vegetable curry) came as ordered and was tasty - though some people might have found it too spicy for their taste, perhaps my order had been mixed up with Indian vegetarian. Anyway it was fine with me. Wine (in small bottles) and beer were offered with the drinks service, and refills were available. Not sure what more you could expect from a flight on this sector.

### "service was below what I expected"
Dubai to Melbourne. I found the quality and service was below what I expected from Qantas. The awkward design of seats leads to minimal storage and areas to place personal items and refreshment items. I found the sleeping position claustrophobic with my head stuck in a cocoon shell like arrangement. The handset control was buried in an awkward position and they warn you about it, and the hazards of not returning it correctly. The overhead reading light required you to stand and switch on at the bulkhead due to a faulty handset. The news section of the entertainment system did not operate. The flight attendant was unaware of my preordered meal. Responses to attendant calls took ages. The width of the seat/flatbed is less than other airlines. My foldout table was awkward to work (and if you are overweight forget it) it was broken and was told they would report it. The attendants must have all attended different days at the table laying lessons. My wife ordered a cheese platter and received a full set of cutlery, 6 pieces, (wrapped in the serviette) as well as a cheese knife. A complaint to the airline received a direct phone response indicating they appreciated my comments and would take my views into consideration in the future.

### "a few areas that need polish"
Melbourne to Jakarta via Sydney. Check in Melbourne took a while. Business Lounge in MEL quite nice serving good coffee. MEL-SYD operated by a Boeing 737-800 departed and arrived on time. Good morning tea was served by a nice crew. Quick and seamless transfer in SYD which is unusual. SYD business class Lounge the usual. But as always the staff in this lounge set a landmark for being rude. Sydney to Jakarta operated by a refitted A330-200. Quite trendy and sleek. Good lunch and snack served. Excellent crew. Baggage delivery a bit slow in CGK. Again this is due to issues with CGK airport rather than fault of QF. Return sector, CGK check in fast. The contract lounge used by Qantas in Jakarta is appalling. Flight from Jakarta left late due to late arrival of incoming aircraft. Jakarta to Sydney operated by another refitted A330-200. Nice crew. Qantas is pretty stingy with dinner supper service in business class. A proper meal is needed when poor lounges are used. Baggage retrieval in SYD was slow nearly leading to missed domestic connection. Good domestic leg from Sydney to Melbourne with an excellent Mexican egg breakfast. Qantas continues to climb but has a few areas that need polish.

### "ground staff nice and helpful"
Sydney to Melbourne - I have wanted to try Qantas for a long time and it was a nice flight. The seat was comfortable and the food was good. They offered a pizza. Mostly I don't like airplane food but the pizza was delicious. The cabin staff were nice with a lot of smiles and the ground staff also nice and helpful.

### "cabin crew kind and helpful"
Hong Kong to Cairns via Brisbane with Qantas. The catering service for both flights was suitable, cabin crew were kind and helpful. The entertainment system for the International flight could add more Cantonese film, musci and TV programmes. Overall, both flight were great.

### "good customer service"
London heathrow to Dubai return with Qantas. The flight from Heathrow was really nice, good customer service, good food and nice seats. However, the return flight wasn't a good experience - the plane was freezing and I had to put on a jacket. I asked for a cup of coffee the taste was disgusting, food options weren't so good, however the first flight was wonderful.

### "service was fabulous"
Canberra to Perth with Qantas. The service was fabulous and nothing was too much trouble. Best I have ever had in economy. The staff had a lot of teenagers from a WA sporting club and they handled all this and looked after the rest of us perfectly. The food and service was great. My only complaint is on such a long trip each passenger should have their own TV. Other than that I have no complaints.

### "good flight with friendly crew "
Brisbane to Hong Kong. A good flight with friendly crew and decent offering of food and entertainment. Fortunately the flight was not completely full, so enjoyed a couple of seats to myself. Crew were attentive throughout the flight and the food on offer was of good quality and variety. The entertainment options on the A330 are decent with more than enough to keep you entertained for the duration of the flight. Overall, very pleased.

### "overall, was a good flight"
Took a late afternoon departure from Melbourne back to Adelaide after a weekend away. The flight was close to full but with exit row seats, it felt pretty comfortable. Flight left slightly late but arrived on time. Crew were courteous and efficient. Food was a choice of a hot and cold selection - went for the Chicken with soba noodles which was ok. Entertainment was through the wifi system which works well, plenty of choices - the cabin announcements do interupt the viewing a tad. Overall, was a good flight, consistent with the domestic economy product that Qantas offer.

### "service was prompt"
Used points to upgrade to Business Class on the long-haul from Santiago to Sydney with Qantas Airways and it was well worth it. Allocated seat 5F with the bulkhead in front. Offered champagne after boarding and shown how to use the seat settings. Lunch served after take-off with an excellent selection. Service was prompt and crew chatty while going about their work. Excellent selection of new release movies on the Q system. Slept for a few hours and then offered supper prior to landing in Sydney. Flight on time and could find little to detract from a great flight.

### "excellent food for economy"
Melbourne to Brisbane. There was a delay on departure, but they provided drinks until we took off after 30 minutes delay. Excellent food for economy passengers as well as drinks. The seat pitch was tight. There is entertainment if you had the Qantas App. Overall, it was a good flight with excellent service and I would recommend this airline.

### "inquired twice about upgrading"
Los Angeles to Sydney. The overall service was okay. However, the bathrooms were hideous and smelled of urine from the beginning to the end on both flights. I inquired twice about upgrading to premium or business class and was informed that the minimum was twice to nine times the original ticket price, outrageously ridiculous. Why even offer the service if there is little to no possibility of usability? On the return flight the galley equipment failed. There's was no meal for the 2nd half of an 16 hour flight. Qantas promised a "food voucher" to compensate for the technical failure, but the voucher was not provided upon disembarking the plane. The failure of Qantas to provide the voucher was the last straw for me on the customer service meter.

### "really surprised by the seat"
Sydney-Santiago in Premium economy. First time on the refurbished 747-400 and was really surprised by the seat comfort and amenities provided. Glass of sparkling offered prior to take off and addressed by name on boarding. Front row seat with plenty of leg-room and blanket and pillow on the seat when arriving at the designated seat. Crew very professional and orders taken for lunch and drinks after take-off. Food was excellent with Australian wines offered along with tea or coffee. Entertainment via screen built into the seat was very good with a great range of movies and TV shows. Overall a most pleasant experience on a 12 hour flight and a much better product than Singapore airlines Premium economy which I had experienced a few months prior to this flight.

### "left and arrived on time"
Flew Qantas from Sydney to Melbourne, QF425, seat 5F on a 737-800. Its was a short domestic flight and despite being a Sunday was 95% full. Boarding was really efficient and we left and arrived on time. What I was really impressed with was the care that was shown to an elderly passenger who needed some extra help. Really simple things like opening her sugar and snack packets for her and taking that moment to see if she needed anything else. Inflight entertainment was via BYOD and pleased I had my ipad handy on me. Very simple to down load and use. Movie / TV choices were different to the return flight that was back of the seat system too.

### "staff almost invisible"
Very good flight with Qantas Airways from Los Angeles to Melbourne. 2 hot meals served plus a sandwich, all very tasty. Very comfortable seats with ample leg room. Flight departed and arrived on time. Service onboard was better on the Melbourne to LA route. I was traveling solo on the way back to Australia and found the staff couldn't be bothered to make up a bottle of formula for my baby. Really felt like they were annoyed. Staff almost invisible throughout the entire 15 hour flight. Aircraft and toilets were kept tidy and clean. Flight was 40 percent empty so a lot of room to stretch out. Highlight of the service was the wonderful entertainment system with tons of quality movies and tv shows and a very large screen.

### "dramatically changed in quality"
Sydney to Perth on 8th July, what has happened to the service, it has dramatically changed in quality. The aircraft was on time departure and plane was nice and clean. But the crew were very boring. The Food was a nightmare it was disgusting, and there was not enough selection onboard. The flight attendant  serving the food, didn't know what it was - he just said its a beef meal, I said what is in it and he said Beef with vegetables, so they were not properly briefed prior to flying on what food is available?

### "regional business class wasn't bad"
It was our first experience flying Qantas in Business Class from Sydney to Christchurch, on a Boeing 737 for this 3 hour flight. The check in was quite friendly. Only eight passengers in business class, but the other two were the family members of the other passengers who initially sat in economy class. They were allowed to sit in business class by the FA but only after the dinner service. The seats in the B737 are not as comfortable as those in Silk Air. The pitch also is not generous enough with limited recline. Despite only one FA served in J class and she was quite friendly and competent while serving six of us. Qantas regional business class wasn't bad at all.

### "once great airline so ordinary"
Travelled in premium economy from Dallas to Sydney with Qantas. This is a 16 hour 30 min flight. The onboard service has changed dramatically from when I took this flight a few years ago. Even though I was traveling in premium economy, we got one drink service. One. In almost 17 hours. The other times I needed a drink, I had to ask for it. No big deal, but really? In desperation, I wandered back to economy in search of food. The 'buffet' that had been previously available in regular economy was no longer. There wasn't one in premium either. I had ordered a veggie meal and it was literally some vegetables and boiled rice, a small salad and some dried fruit that looked disgusting. I had a baby who cried for 16 hours seated in front of me. Not the airlines fault, but it just added to the bad experience. On the plus side, the seat was bigger than economy. The flight attendant who worked our cabin was very nice. The flight was on time and relatively uneventful, but for $3200 round trip, this trip was definitely not worth the extra money for premium. It's sad to see a once great airline become so ordinary, even 'low cost'. I have flown other airlines in premium and even BA offers a better product.

### "where the good service ended"
The Singapore to Melbourne flight was slightly delayed due to a family being late, not the airline's fault and the captain kept us regularly updated. Unfortunately this is where the good service ended. Although this was an overnight flight, one would still expect a degree of service throughout the flight. The supper was small, took forever to serve and there was only one drink service offered. After supper it was near impossible to get the attention of a staff member. They seemed more interested in getting sleeping positions at the back of the plane. At times on Qantas the attendant's attitude can be tiresome and you felt after the meal service you were really putting them out by asking for a coffee or coke. Breakfast was actually ok considering that scrambled eggs can always be hit and miss on a plane. Once again there was a limited drink service and the last straw for me was when I asked for a water and it never came. Qantas is not a cheap airline and is trying to compete against Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. Good luck, you're going to need it! I've already booked my next flight and it wasn't on Qantas.

### "service was superb"
What an excellent flight from Bangkok to Sydney with Qantas. I had a great seat that had a huge arm rest next to the aisle, so I was all cocooned. On board welcome was very warm and genuine and this set the mood for the rest of the flight. Amenity kit and duvet/pillow were already at the seat, as was a bottle of water. Pre-departure beverage was offered, and my champagne was topped up once more. Before take off, pyjama's were offered, and the mattress was attached to the seat. This would allow one to go to sleep quickly. Service was superb. I was addressed by several staff always by name (and they did not refer to the manifest). There was a drinks service with nuts. My glass was topped up 3 times, without having to ask, let alone think about it. Dinner service was over 2 hours into the flight, and food was excellent, but service even better. I had a great 6.5 hours sleep, having asked not to be woken for breakfast. When I did wake up, I was promptly asked what I wanted, and just settled for a coffee. I went to change, and my bedding had all been cleared. I cannot stress how impressed I was with the service, and also the hard product. Well done Qantas.

### "like flying no-frills"
Melbourne to Hong Kong in Economy with Qantas. It turns out Economy with Qantas is just slightly better than being put in the hold with the baggage. For an airline that charges hefty prices this was like flying no-frills, or maybe worse because their tickets are super expensive. The economy seats were the narrowest seats I have ever seen in a plane certainly for a 10 hour flight. The seats were much narrower than the seats on any of the other airlines that we took on our trip to Europe. It was extremely uncomfortable. Qantas seems to keep to the minimum number of staff possible. As a result, the service was as minimal as the seats. It took them ages to provide drinks and meals. The staff were nice enough but Economy passengers barely saw much of them. Given the high cost of our economy tickets, it was insulting to be treated like some sort of after thought. The worst food ever in so many different ways. Usually on an airline we get a tray of food containing a hot meal, a salad, perhaps some cheese and crackers, maybe another snack and a dessert. On Qantas they gave us a hot meal and a dessert. There was no tray and there was no other food. Just a small sized hot meal and a dessert. That was it. As it happened the hot meal was just awful so we only had the dessert. Even the kids received a hot meal and an apple. In contrast, when our kids flew with Cathay they received a tray of food including a hot meal, juice, fruit, cupcake, snack, cheese. Our kids didn't like the hot meal and when we asked if they had something else, after ages waiting, a staff member brought some dry biscuits and another apple. There were a lot of apples on this Qantas flight but much not of anything else. We got off our Qantas flight absolutely starving hungry. I don't mind flying no-frills but if Qantas wants to provide a no frills flight on Economy then the price should be no frills as well. Except it isn't. Qantas is usually more expensive than other airlines flying to and from Australia. Very disappointing

### "food was good, staff friendly"
Brisbane to Ho Chi Minh via Singapore - I still call Australia home, and I still call Qantas my airline. A smooth flight despite a little turbulence, soft landings, great service, excellent in-flight duty free, and great satisfaction and comfort. Even the Jetstar flight from Singapore to Vietnam was great, and the customer service excellent. The food was good, the staff friendly and I would happily fly them again.

### "space could be better distributed"
Flew Perth to Brisbane with Qantas. Seat looks like a cocoon. They do not look nice, and it seems the space could be better distributed. If you are tall, I'd rather say they can be claustrophobic. Considering you are flying business in Australia, I'd say they could serve much better wines. Only one toilet for more than 20 pax in business does not sound reasonable. I was expecting more courtesy interacting w/ flight attendants. Small details that made the difference aboard: blanket - nice size and comfortable Meal on board - good options, good flavour Safety video - amazing way to call out for pax attention. A must-see video.

### "crew seemed disinterested"
A quick and friendly checkin at Perth's domestic airport and through security the flight departed on time however arrived a little later than expected (by about 20 mins due to poor weather conditions). Qantas never usually provide outstanding service in economy and this service was no different. Very average. Crew seemed disinterested and a senior cabin member seemed like she hadn't a care in the world. The food served was tasty but again average. Considering you are paying more than the low cost services the food and service isn't much different. Inflight entertainment is good.

### "left to our own devices"
All airlines experience problems from time to time. Ours was a delay in departure due to 'technical' problems. Ok - I accept this happens. However - customer relations becomes vital at this time. Information about transfers - new arrival times so you can re-book accommodation car hire etc.. it all becomes important. None of this happened. We were basically left to our own devices with a £10 voucher at Heathrow and then a cheap hotel in Dubai whilst awaiting a re-booked flight via Sydney - which we had no choice in or discussion about. When boarding the re-routed flight we were treated as if it was our fault - sat separately and I wont bore you with the details about the service. On our return I wrote to Qantas and simply asked for acknowledgement of my letter addressing my concerns. This was not forthcoming. Eventually - 4 months latter I get a very limp email. Poor. So - I have since found an interesting piece of EU legislation C(2016) 3502. Basically any flight leaving from an EU airport is covered by this. I advise any Qantas passenger to be aware of their rights for compensation. Especially those caught up in the delay in February this year.

### "no longer a premium airline"
Qantas has deteriorated significantly in recent times, it is no longer a premium airline. Qantas now has an ageing fleet, fewer crafts, and serious staffing issues. This essentially means more cancellations, technical issues, delays, and a deteriorating service. We booked our tickets to Rome with Qantas as the flights selected had a convenient midday departure with a two-hour stopover in Sydney, and three hours in Dubai. However, problems started before we left home. 1) Qantas cancelled our first flight and rescheduled a departure time three hours earlier. The new 9.00am departure created a five-hour first stopover in Sydney 2) Qantas then delayed the Sydney departure due to 'engineering requirements' by four hours. They kept extending the delay every 30 minutes, making it impossible to modify onward journey arrangements. The stopover had extended to nine hours from two. 3) This resulted in missing our connecting flight in Dubai. We were rebooked into a flight scheduled to depart more than five hours later. 4) My wife and I were assigned separated seats, as the flight was full. Further to this, the Qantas flight service was extremely tardy. They kept forgetting to bring my wife’s meal, which she received two hours after others had finished eating. The cabin was a constant mess as the cabin staff was extremely slow in removing trays, etc. 5) We arrived eight hours late in Rome and missed our connecting Alitalia flight. The result, Alitalia forfeited our return tickets that cost $1540 to replace. If you elect or need to travel Qantas, be prepared by lowering past expectations and factor in more delays.

### "nice ambience, sufficient leg room"
Perth to Broome with Qantas. Short two hour domestic flights. The flight attendant that scans our boarding pass greeted each passenger warmly by addressing us personally. The fact that I have being addressed as "Good morning Mr Ha welcome abroad" creates a really warm and welcoming feeling. I am amazed at how fast they work and pick up each passengers last name. Enjoyable flight on the new Boeing 737-800 fleet. Nice ambience, sufficient leg room and seat space is comfortable. The downsides are that the touchscreen PTV is not that sensitive. The inflight meals served was a really tiny portion. Given lots of fluids to hydrate ourselves throughout the flight.

### "crew don't disappoint"
Used airpoints for a return trip to London. Cabin staff very friendly and helpful. On the leg from Dubai to London, the cabin crew provided good humour and engaged well with the passengers. I remarked upon this when departing the aircraft. I had seat 88G which is in the last row near a door and subsequently, I found it quite cold. Avoid, if possible. After many passengers departed in Dubai, I moved to 85A and had the row to myself - much more comfortable. The Captain walked through the cabin and stopped and chatted to me and then cleared the residue of my lunch away. Never seen that before. He also asked if I was being well looked after by the crew, which was a nice touch. Very pleasurable flights and Qantas crew don't disappoint.

### "a job well done"
I would like to thank the cabin crew on QF571 on 15/6/16, for the care and help they gave me when I collapsed on the flight. People are very ready to be critical, but forget to say thank you for a job well done. They made an effort to make sure I was okay, even escorting me off the plane and getting my luggage, and waiting with me until my husband picked me up.

### "tired ambience of the aircraft"
Qantas from Sydney to Manila, and Bangkok to Sydney both on an A330, one refurbished and one not. The difference is stark and it is hard to reconcile paying the same money for such a different offering. As usual with Qantas on time and uneventful flights with great cabin crew and satisfactory service offerings. The bottom line is that 31 inches in international economy is simply not competitive for a full service carrier. Coming from a Singapore Airlines regional 777 in BKK to an unrefurbished Qantas A330 is a rude shock. 1 inch does not sound like much but over 9 hours it does matter, as does the whole tired ambience of the aircraft.

### "food was very poor"
Flew Los Angeles to Melbourne. Cabin crew good, we paid extra for our seats as we are tall but noise level high and uncomfortable. Children complained of being cold. Food was very poor especially the food presented in boxes. None or poor choices for non beef eaters, the tea and coffee was very poor quality. If possible can guests seated in 79 back get served in varying rotation as it seemed always some of the last to receive food. Only one offer of drinks/beverages at flight commencement as it is a 15 plus hour flight so a second drink would be very appreciated. The toilets were clean which is a plus as again long flight with poor sanitation is difficult to tolerate. My children said movies were older but I didn't mind that as I cannot look at small screen. Compared to British Airways, Qantas is just behind but superior to all American Airlines.

### "very professional and attentive"
Melbourne - Hong Kong - Melbourne, 1st time flying Qantas on a long journey, flew the same route before with CX so it was interesting to see how QF stands. Same equipment use (A330-300) though when I check 2 months before thought they would deploy a 747-400, welcome drinks of Bickford is offered together with a bottle of water which is perfect, seats not much difference, IFE pretty much the same and would say both 5/5. Inflight meals I would give CX the upperhand here as I prefer the traditional where you have a salad and fruit serve in all together, with QF you don't have this, the claim that food serving is 50% more is for me not noticeable, though am impress with the infused bread, Lindor chocolates given on both journey after meals, Apples and Wies ice cream distributed on the onward journey which I really liked. Crew on both flights very professional and attentive. Overall great product and value, would definitely recommend and fly them again.

### "service rating adequate"
Flew Qantas from Sydney to Tokyo. Pleasant flight but annoying features were: Not allowed to pre book your seats until 24 hrs prior to departure - no charge. If you want to book your seats prior to 24 hour period a charge needs to be paid for. Old planes and therefore amenities were poor. Seating in economy was cramped. Flight attendants very smiley but not very friendly. Meals: awful airline food that can be avoided if you buy at airport lounge before boarding. Service rating adequate.

### "QF in the air is excellent"
Johannesburg to Melbourne via Sydney with Qantas. QF customer service regarding a ticket issue was poor - hold times are ridiculous and the agents I spoke to could not careless. Check in at JNB was swift and fast. Enjoyed the British Airways lounge at JNB. Food, drinks, staff and WiFi all excellent. JNB-SYD operated by a B747-400. Boarded on time but pushed back 50 minutes late due to tech issues. Crew on the flight was excellent. Polite, professional and friendly. Excellent choice of IFE. Comfy seat. Tasty food. Short flight time with strong tail wind meant flight arrived on time into SYD despite delay on departure. Arrival time into SYD is a quiet time at airport. Cleared immigration fast and checked on to domestic flight. Domestic Flight right on time. Good snack and drink. Cabin crew on the domestic sector too were fantastic. Barring the appalling call centre. QF in the air is excellent.

### "really made me welcome"
On Wednesday, 6th June, a group of 4 of us, flew to Sydney, on QF 863, to Sydney and returned on Sunday, 12th June 2016, on Flight QF 862. I have difficulty, negotiating stairs and escalators, due to the effects of having 2 strokes, in the past 7 years. Firstly, our trip from Coolangatta, on Wednesday 6th June, was memorable, because of the compassion and understanding, of the cabin crew, and the fact, that they understood, my predicament. Not to be outdone, our cabin crew and Captain, on our return flight, were equal to the task. As a nervous fly, compounded by mobility issues, they really made me welcome, as a guest, rather than a hindrance, to their work. My wife and I, have limited experience, in flying, but, if this is the quality and standard, set by Qantas, other Airlines, would be "Hard-Pressed" to equal it.

### "extremely uncomfortable cramped"
Disappointing. Not even the good crew and inflight meal were enough to make this a pleasant flight from Singapore to Perth. Qantas use an older Boeing 737 on this Perth-Singapore-Perth run. Old Business Class and an extremely uncomfortable cramped economy cabin. I checked online when I returned to Australia the seat pitch is 30", refer to the photo, I am 174cm tall and my knees touched the seat in front. The only good thing about the flight was that the gentleman sitting in front did not recline his seat. The inflight entertainment was ok. This was worse than any low cost airline.

### "fails miserably in customer service"
Qantas fails miserably in customer service. I booked a ticket from Denpasar home to Honolulu with a long layover in Sydney (16 hours). I was never told that a long layover would require a visa since I could not stay in the airport for more than a 12 hour layover. It would have been easy for me (US Passport) to get one electronically in Denpasar, but my wife has a Cambodian passport, so it would have required us missing our flight and getting one the next day at the Australian embassy. JetStar (Qantas' discount partner) said no problem and moved our flight out 2 days at no charge. But they said we also had to arrange that with Qantas, our carrier from Sydney to Honolulu. Qantas wanted about $600 per passenger for a change fee and difference in airfare for each of us. On three separate calls to customer service (the line kept dropping as I was left on hold for interminable periods) they say they would not waive the fee. I had the ticket refunded by my credit card company but will never fly Qantas after being treated so rudely and unfairly.

### "found staff very efficient"
Sydney to Johannesburg with Qantas. For this year's holiday we flew economy. I found staff very efficient, friendly and caring. The food was good, loved that there was a South African traditional dish on the menu (bobotie). As happens some menu choices ran out but it was handled well by the staff. Some airport delays when we departed Johannesburg but well managed to ensure we made our connecting flights.

### "cabin looks clean and newish"
Singapore to Perth with Qantas. A quick 5 hour flight. Crew were friendly, cabin looks clean and newish. The entertainment was ok considering it is only a 5 hour flight. This plane is actually similar to a domestic flight I took a few months back. The food, I personally feel that it is better after they switched the way the serve their meals. Check in was swift. The crew and pilot gave regular updates on the flight path and times. I will fly them again on this route.

### "smooth, quiet and uneventful flight"
QF11, Economy flight from Sydney to Calgary via LA. Lower deck exit row seats. Overall good flight experience on the long journey to LA. A380 provided a very smooth, quiet and uneventful flight. Good on board communication and also good level of service. Exit row seat at extra cost - provided increased leg room but minor inconvenience with fold out tray/screen and location near galley and area used by other passengers. Quality of food was very ordinary, some of the food was atrocious (Chicken Panini), would say on this flight with new format of food service - quality was below other carriers - big negative against Qantas. Still a good level of satisfaction with the overall experience. (not up to Cathay standard).

### "dependable, quality carrier"
QF74, economy from San Francisco to Sydney. Seats 70A/70B. Late departure from SF with additional delay due to anticipated tail winds with same eta. Newer updated 747 configuration. Again good levels of service both on ground and during flight from this carrier. More experienced flight crew and generally improved level of service than previous outbound trip. Given night flight - limited service requirements. Inflight food was also better than previous flight. On time arrival with some turbulence due to weather conditions but generally very smooth, efficient flight. Recommend for two up travelling seating from row 69 - 73 on either side of aircraft, two only seats with extra storage space on side. Also believe this new fit-out provides increased legroom in economy than A380 - seat base still not comfortable for long flights. Overall Qantas again has proven to be a dependable, quality carrier.

### "service was slow and poor"
It's my third time flying with Qantas Airways. I first flew with Qantas over 10 years ago and the service was great, however this trip from Singapore to Melbourne was very disappointing. The aircraft interior was refurbished and the in-flight entertainment was good and the seats were comfortable with decent leg room for an economy seat, but the service was slow and poor. The flight took off at 8pm but dinner was served very slowly. The left aisle was served about 20 min after the right aisle and the food serving was pathetic. There was no salad and no fruits, just a main course with a cold and hard brownie. Compared to other airlines (e.g. Singapore airlines and Emirates), the food didn't taste as good. A man sitting beside me was not full from the small serving and wanted more buns but the flight attendants ignored him. A flight attendant asked for my drink preference but never came back to serve me any drinks. Very disappointed with Qantas. I feel that their domestic flights were better than this international flight that I took.

### "service crew was friendly"
Flew Melbourne to Hobart with Qantas. The plane was quite old and my seat was stained with food from the previous flight. Furthermore, the iPad provided for in-flight entertainment was not working, which I guess is because it ran out of battery. Luckily, it was a short 1hr flight so the iPad wasn't really necessary. Despite these shortfalls, the service crew was friendly and they served breakfast quickly. Although it was a cold breakfast with yogurt, fruit bars and dried cranberries, it tasted good. Overall, the flight is not fantastic, but the good service crew managed to make the short flight better.

### "Business Class experience? No"
Brisbane to Singapore and return with Qantas. We are regular Business Class flyers, but have avoided Qantas for years after a series of unsatisfactory experiences. This time we were going to Europe via Istanbul and decided that we would go with Turkish Airlines. This meant the Brisbane to Singapore leg was with their code share partner, Qantas. The Qantas experience on the way over seemed fine. The beds were good, service solid and the plane was on time. On the way back however, the old experience came back to us. The new Qantas promotion and safety video is embarrassing and even the staff cringed and smiled in sympathy. It is really bad and not sure what they were thinking. The service was basic compared to Turkish and Singapore Airlines and extra coffee was not even offered at meals. We were subjected to the constant banter by one of the cabin crew to his colleague which went on and on while he sat down when he should have been serving the paying customers. He treated us with indifference throughout the flight. Business Class experience? No.

### "food was good"
Flew Singapore to Melbourne with Qantas. Flights on both leg were good with a slight delay on return leg. The ground staff were very helpful and assigned seats of our choice. On SIN-MEL route, there were no IFE screens but every passenger was provided with an ipad with streaming video connected via wifi. The food was good with plenty of options. Even in economy class, passengers were provided with menu cards with 3 to 4 choices for full course meal with plenty of options in drinks. The attendants were courteous and very helpful. The seating was 2-4-2 configuration with decent legroom.

### "an uneventful flight"
QF 604, Melbourne to Brisbane (B737-800) with Qantas Airways. This was an uneventful flight at the early hours of the morning. Boarding was earlier than schedule and FA’s seemed to be very efficient with the process of ensuring smaller items being stored under the seat and larger items in the cabin storage above. This helped ensure people we not left scrambling for places to place their cabin luggage and the flight was not delayed in the process. The breakfast offering was either cereal or a warmed frittata. I went for the latter and thought it was better than average for an flight albeit I was not very hungry to start with. IFE was in the form of Q Streaming which is a wifi setup whereby you can watch and listen to a range of things from your smartphone or laptop. Overall – good flight.

### "cattle class at its finest"
Flew Qantas from Sydney to Dubai. Seats hard, staff smiled whilst throwing boxed food on the table that was mostly inedible. Drinks served in paper cups, no hot towels on descent and no onboard reading matter. Main meal was pre-ordered so no problem so main meal okay, but rest was mostly inedible, who wants yoghurt and grains for breakfast with a feta and spinach bun - not me. Cattle class at its finest.

### "we were pleasantly surprised"
We flew with Qantas as we had missed our flight with Emirates from Heathrow to Dubai. At first we were disappointed to hear that we had no choice other than to fly with Qantas but quite honestly we were pleasantly surprised. The plane was fairly empty, which was handy as it was a night flight. But what made it for me were the Cabin Crew - lovely, friendly, polite and very professional. The plane was not as glamorous as some others, nor the inflight entertainment as vast, but to be fair the service we received was second to none and made the long flight with our 3 children - 7 month old baby boy, 4 year old little girl and 8 year old boy a pleasant one.

### "Cabin crew were always smiling"
Flew New York to Melbourne via Los Angles. On both legs the seats were comfortable, IFE was of a very high quality. Cabin crew were always smiling, provided friendly service and responded to the call button promptly. The food was great, at least three choices for dinner (the pasta was especially delicious) and two for breakfast, plus regular snack and drink runs throughout the flight. Even the cabin announcements were provided in a very pleasant manner. I highly recommend Qantas on the transpacific routes.

### "Business Class cabin - impressive"
This was the first time I have flown in the recently upgraded domestic Business Class cabin - impressive. Firstly, the flight was delayed due to a flat tyre on the plane and they kept us informed. Myself and about 10 others on the plane were connecting on to QF9 to London - and the delay made the timing very tight indeed. Qantas handled it very well with staff getting us off the plane first and then rushing us through immigration to QF9 which had been held for us. The trip itself to Melbourne was very good and the food was the best I have had on a plane for sometime - a substantial piece of pork that was quite delicious. I flew on to London in a combination of Premium Economy and Business - and the food was better on this domestic flight without a doubt. I have also just flown two internal European flights in Business Class (Iberian and BA) and both were nothing near the standard of Qantas. It's when you experience the competition you are reminded just how good Qantas really is.

### "positives for me were the food"
Melbourne to Tokyo via Sydney with Qantas. Melbourne to Sydney leg on old Boeing 737 with no IFE which is poor for 2016. Flight was late arriving into Sydney so connection was tight which wasn't helped by the fact that with children you can't use the machines to go through customs and there was only one customs officer working, who decided in his wisdom to process a whole heap of crew members before us - until another staff member told the crew they could use the machines - that part is not the fault of Qantas. Flight on refurbished Boeing 747 was overall good, staff were efficient if not overly engaging. The positives for me were the food (best in a long time on a plane) the snack bar and the IFE had a good range, although still not to Emirates standards. Overall a satisfying experience.

### "overall a good experience"
Melbourne to Johannesburg via Sydney. Check in fast and friendly. MEL domestic lounge quiet and comfy on a Sunday morning. MEL-SYD operated by a A330-200 in domestic configuration. Excellent crew on this flight, I didn't use IFE or eat. Arrived on time into Sydney. Sydney domestic to international transfer a mess. Sydney international immigration out was a bigger mess. Very long express queue. Wonder how long normal queue was. Sydney international business lounge good was usual. A bit crowded with a stream of morning departure. Sydney to Johannesburg operated by a B747-400 (VH-OEB) unfortunately this one of the only 2 B747-400 that does not have updated IFE or interior. Felt like flying back in 1990s/2000s. Departure delayed out of SYD, this is more and more common and something has to be done about it. Crew on this flight was professional and approachable. Excellent food and drink. IFE was passable. Managed to arrive close to on time in JNB despite delay. JNB immigration a mess and took 90 mins to clear. Overall a good experience.

### "professional and attentive"
Our overnight flight from Tokyo Haneda to Sydney on QF26 lived up to the expectation of Qantas business class. We were seated in seats 3A and 3B in a roomy section of the cabin. Service was professional and attentive without being overly invasive. The cabin was prepared for the night flight and supper was served promptly after this. Food was excellent. A selection of Japanese food was offered and was very tasty. Seat is comfortable with plenty of room. Onboard entertainment worked well although I do not watch much of this. The Japan Airlines lounge at Haneda was very good and a shower prior to boarding was vey well received.

### "impressive dinner service"
Impressive dinner service in economy. Flew short trip Adelaide to Melbourne in the evening. The cabin crew were more mature then a lot of other airlines and while they did not look like supermodels they exuded experienced and confidence that made an impact. They must enjoy their job otherwise why were they doing it for so long. The experience made a big difference compared to the younger crew we often get on airlines. I was expecting a bag of peanuts on such a short hop (as we had on another airline coming over) but instead they rolled out dinner. The Qantas bigger economy meals were noticeably large and I was hungry and as I was not getting home until 10.30pm I was very happy to actually have a satisfying meal - plus red wine and just when i was wishing for something sweet along came a chocolate. The Flight attendant later came and gave me a handful of extra chocolates as a sudden surprise gift. They are a little more expensive than a budget airline but there is a big difference and I would pay an extra few dollars for this kind of service. They are obviously trying hard to give a great service and I was surprised and impressed.

### "seat was great"
Flew Qantas from Auckland to Sydney. I don't usually travel business class, but can understand the extra costs. Qantas lounge in Auckland was good, early morning flight had enough options. Boarding was quick and easy, seat was great. I did not try the lie flat position (many did) but was provided with large pillow and blanket. Breakfast was good and staff were excellent. Not a vast amount of movies, but I did find a few to watch. Overall very pleasant.

### "dinner was fine albeit very late"
Melbourne to Dubai. In the Premium economy cabin and pretty uneventful. Service professional and friendly and unobtrusive. The flight left late but was on time into Dubai. The dinner service was fine albeit very late - probably around 1am local time. Really nothing to gripe about. Onwards from Dubai on Emirates to London. Same aircraft but a different look naturally and feel. It was a 3.45 pm departure from Dubai and the clientele on this leg were very different. A large element of holiday makers. Nothing wrong with that but a fair few were continuously ordering drinks. Good natured bunch but one can understand why LCC have a problem when they continue to serve. I really want to love EK but the inconsistent nature of the FA's makes it hard. Every time in economy one can see where EK fall down.

### "usual level of service"
London to Sydney via Dubai. Tuesdays on QF2 are usually quiet and the Premium Economy cabin was less than half full. Nothing to report save the usual level of service and courtesy that one expects. I may be biased towards Qantas being a gold FF but they have upped thier game. One gripe and it's nothing that can be done on this flight. It lands at around 5 am. So breakfast is served around 3.15am local time. Personally speaking the thought of eggs and sausage do not appeal but breakfast has to be served so there it is. Coffee and fruit was enough for me. Suggestions to Qantas? How about a daytime flight back to Sydney like the old QF 32. That way one can enjoy it. At the moment one travels through a short night leaving London and a second night through to Sydney.

### "absolute refreshing change"
Brisbane to Melbourne. An absolute refreshing change to fly full service after so many legs on discount airlines. Qantas definitely stands out compared to it's budget carrier, Jetstar. A great flight with professional and friendly crew. Slight delay leaving Brisbane but landed exactly on time in Melbourne. Choice of two options for lunch (sandwich or pie) and managed to sneak in a movie.

### "very good and consistent"
Return flight to Singapore from Melbourne with Qantas. Check in at both airports very good, lounge in Melbourne is looking tired, but the staff, food and drinks excellent. Singapore lounge very busy - our only problem was we did not want a meal and there was really no other option, say a sandwich or some nibbles. Both flights very good with pleasant crew, spotless cabin, inflight entertainment very good. Main meals excellent for economy class and we pre ordered at the time of booking. Overall we find Qantas very good and consistent these days, certainly cabin crews are much more customer focused.

### "overuse of the word mate "
Travelled with my husband and three children from Oslo to Melbourne on Emirates tickets, with the Dubai to Melbourne leg operated by Qantas. Stark contrast in quality of service, food and cabin fitout between Emirates and Qantas. Qantas staff seemed preoccupied with getting passengers to sleep as quickly as possible above all else, including requests for a bottle to get my tollder settled (grumpy, exhausted 3 year olds aren't conducive to getting a cabin full of people to sleep!). Kids weren't allowed to change seats before take off despite ample unoccupied seats after boarding was complete. Staff did however allow an adult male to change to an empty row of 4 seats before take off. On previous Emirates flights the kids seemed to be given at least a fair chance of occupying spare seats therefore increasing the possibility that they would sleep (which benefits the entire cabin). Kids meal on Qantas was a bread-like tube filled with veges and tomato sauce and a packet of Smarties. Contrast this with Emirates: hot bowl of macaroni cheese, rolls, a dessert, a drink, and a box full of snacks like small chocolate bars, crackers, crisps, and a small toothbrush kit. Entertainment system on Qantas was measly compared to Emirates with very few family movies and a smaller screen. Noticeably less leg room (my husband is 6 foot 4). In terms of service quality - only one staff member in our section seemed happy to be on the flight and conversed with our kids beyond 'Hi mate'. Qantas should be aware that (over)use of the word 'mate' doesn't make up for a lack of genuine care in making a kid's 13 hours in a confined space surrounded by snoring adults as comfortable as possible. On Emirates I felt totally comfortable asking for extra drinks, crisps etc for the kids (to reduce their loud 'I'm hungry' complaints). On Qantas I soon realised that these requests were treated as big extra workloads by the staff. On the plus side, my husband enjoyed the snack bar at the back of the plane.

### "gone downhill big time"
Just got off a Singapore to Perth flight with Qantas and am very disappointed. Years ago was great but now gone downhill big time. I asked the hostess if my bag will fit in the overhead locked as there are fragile items in it and her reply was very snappy - yes it will fit and its not our fault if something is broken. I understand it isn't their problem if something breaks is there a need to be nasty. The food was horrible, they ran out of the choices and was told I could either have curry or nothing. The seats were so uncomfortable with no leg room. I am 5"11 and was cramped the entire time! Not impressed with the flight and service at all. Only good thing was the in flight entertainment.

### "seats were comfy"
Adelaide to Hong Kong via Melbourne. Qantas Club at Adelaide airport at 5am was not crowded. The lounge did not offer any hot western breakfast, but some light snacks and toast. I was onboard a reconfigured Boeing 737 to Melbourne. Qantas removed personal TVs but they added WiFi onboard. However, the WiFi can only be used for the Qantas entertainment app for movies and flight status. Moreover, it worker slow. It was not a big deal as the flight was just 50 minute. Breakfast was yoghurt. At Melbourne, I headed to T2 for QF29 to Hong Kong. I did not manage to enter the lounge as I was running out of time! The queue at gate 11 in T2 was disaster. Passengers were required to take to escalator down for boarding and boarding pass scanning. Business class and Oneworld Emerald / Sapphire passengers were offered priority queue there! Onboard, a fresh new cabin, seats were comfy, all seats have a footrest and a shelf under the TV (except for front rows). The screen was responsive. Fortunately, the flight was only 70% full and no one sat next to me. There were four options for lunch with one only eligible for pre-booking online. I chose that, chicken with roast potato and vegetables which delicious. Prior landing, hot dog was offered and it was good. Overall, the journey was smooth and comfortable. However, the WiFi should have access to the internet and Qantas must improve the queue at gate 11 in Melbourne. The journey (return flights) cost AUD700 / HKD3780. Very reasonable and attractive. I highly recommend Qantas and their new A330s.

### "food was pathetic"
Manila to Melbourne via Sydney with Qantas. Check in was swift and polite request to change was done with any issue at all. Lounge in MNL was basic but good. Boarding a bit late but priorities respected. The first flight was an A330-300. Crew on this flight were like chalk and cheese. Some were extra charming and professional but others were extremely rude. Flight departed 30 minutes late. Had issues with IFE that took nearly an hour to fix. Food on Qantas was pathetic and stingy. So called supper served on a 8pm flight assuming passengers do not need to be fed. Dessert had a cheese plate which actually had one piece of cheese. During dinner service one of the male crew was so rude to a kid that his father had to speak to the purser. It was disappointing to witness this. Seats on the newly refurbished A330-300 are comfy and fantastic for a good night rest. Short flight time meant arrived in Sydney before time. Being one of the first flights of the day immigration and baggage claim was very fast. Second leg to MEL was a Domestic Configured A330-200. Usual run of the mill flight. No complaints. Good flights but behaviour of some cabin crew is not acceptable.

### "was a cramped flight"
Perth to Singapore on a Qantas Boeing 737-800 was a cramped flight. I'm only 5'10", in a small plane with only 6 seats across and there was no room to recline so cannot sleep. I will return to using Scoot in their Boeing 787 or Singapore Air. Sadly the food was not very good either compared to my next flight with Royal Brunei.

### "managed 6 hours sleep"
Sydney to New York JFK via Los Angeles. Good flight packed aircraft on QF11, I quite liked it, was comfortable and managed to get 6 hours sleep which wasn't bad for a approximately 15 hour flight, 9 hours of watching movies. Took off at 10:05 am and arrived in Los Angeles at around 6:00 am the next morning, 3 hours in Los Angeles airport and then on the 747-400 (Qantas) to New York.

### "removed comment on facebook"
Booked QF118 (direct flight from Hong Kong to Sydney departing at 9:45pm on 11/03/2016) for 6 passengers. On 10 March tried to do online check-in but their website did not have the button for checking in. It only showed check-in was complete at the airport. I changed the website to English version and it allowed me to check-in as normal. First attempt their website said I took too long entering details. It is reasonable to take 15 mins entering six people's details! Second attempt their website showed an error: We are unable to process your check-in request at this time. Try again later or check-in at the airport. [ER100]. I have no idea what was going on so all I could do is do wait till the other day. 11 March In the morning, I received an email "We're sorry, your flight details for travel starting on 11 March 2016 have changed. This is totally unacceptable. Was it that difficult for them to give me a call or sms? What if I didn't check my email? The notice was given in less than 24 hours. Then I called as per instructions and they didn't have enough staffs speaking Cantonese. My calls were simply hung up twice. Then I tried the English one and my call was finally picked up. What if I don't speak English? The call centre officer advised the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. They could only offer me earlier indirect flights via Brisbane (7:15pm!) to Sydney. Firstly, indirect flights are much cheaper than direct flights. Secondly, it was very inconvenient for us to transfer at Brisbane. All of us had to take half day annual leave because they could only provide earlier flights. I lodged a formal complaint. 10 April 2016  and no response. I sent another email requesting a response. 12 April 2016 I posted on their facebook. 14 April 2016 I received a response stating their disclaimers etc. In conclusion, they feel that they are justified not compensating anything as little as a voucher or miles. If the flight was delayed I am okay, but that was not the case particularly it was due to mechanical issues. 19 April 2016 I realized they removed my comment on facebook as well.

### "kept informed at all times"
QF9 Melbourne to London. Departed on time, all good. After dinner, settled down for sleep (14 hour flight). Landed Sydney (one hour's flying time north of Melbourne) eight hours later. Diversion to Sydney because Qantas/Rolls Royce unhappy with possible vibration in one engine, and took the view that safety comes first. Arrived LHR over 11 hours late. We are delighted with the way Qantas handled this situation. We were kept informed at all times, and kept receiving apologies from pilots and cabin crew (not that any were needed - better safe than sorry). All passengers were given letter explaining what was happening, and expected arrival times. Letter also served as proof of situation for travel insurance claims if necessary. Many Qantas staff on hand at LHR to escort passengers who had missed connections to awaiting buses for overnight hotel accommodation. For those with out-of-pocket expenses, re-imbursment promised. We already have confirmation email that our taxi fare will be in bank within days. 10/10 for the calm and professional manner in which Qantas as an organisation handled this, and the same rating to all Qantas staff concerned.

### "crew were good and friendly"
Melbourne to Manila via Sydney in business Class. Check in fast, lounge at Melbourne basic but good. Departure out of MEL on time on a Boeing 737-800 with sky interior with a friendly and efficient crew. Quick transfer in SYD, and the lounge at SYD has a good selection of food and drink. Priority boarding worked well and flight to Manila on a refurbished A333, with a great, private seat. IFE with an extensive choice. Crew were good and friendly. Food is the only negative and I am puzzled how the business class food is Neil Perry endorsed. I find Qantas economy class food much better. Had good 3 hours of sleep. Bags out fast in Manila.

### "unhappy is an understatement."
Sydney to Singapore. The plane was delayed because of catering issues almost 2 hours. The cabin crew was surly at best. Qantas lost my luggage. We came in from Dallas to Sydney on Qantas and was scheduled for a 4 hour wait to go to Singapore. The wait ended up longer because of the catering problems. When we got to Singapore my bag was no where to be found. When I questioned the Qantas agent, she already new that my bag had been left behind and was coming in on a later flight. So here I am waiting for my bag to be delivered after leaving on Sunday to get here. To say that I'm unhappy is an understatement. They Qantas had plenty of time to get my bag on the plane. My husband's bag made it. Both bags had propriety tags on.

### "continue to avoid flying Qantas"
I booked my Dubai to Melbourne flight through Emirates, but was surprised that it was a codeshare operated by Qantas. In the past I have had rude treatment from Qantas staff and flown long haul in planes with an old tricolor projector,  so I generally avoid flying with them. In this case the plane actually had a LCD screenbut a very poor entertainment system with few movies to see. However I ordered vegan food. They brought me a very large roll of bread with something that smelled bad inside called ratatouille. I said no thanks, during the flight the same nasty sandwich was offered to me a further two times. The seats armrests could not be lifted up so it was impossible for my 4 year old to lie on my lap and get a rest. Obviously they purposely decided to not offer comfort to their passengers. I will continue to avoid flying with Qantas.

### "very easy pleasant flight"
Wellington to Sydney with Qantas. Good flight, excellent entertainment choices and friendly crew. Seated in 4F so had the extra space of the bulkhead and an empty seat in the middle. Very easy pleasant flight. Crew were attentive and friendly without feeling rushed considering it is a relatively short flight and the flight was 95% full.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Canberra to Brisbane was a domestic flight with luggage being booked through to Singapore. The first flight was on time and cabin staff were quietly efficient, the second flight was late leaving Brisbane but landed on time in Singapore. The food was good - I had pre-ordered my lunch on the second flight and it met my expectations. The wine was also good. Cabin crew were efficient and not obtrusive. Inflight entertainment was good and I was pleasantly surprised to have a comfortable flat bed for the Brisbane - Singapore sector. Luggage came off the Singapore flight quickly. Overall the flight exceeded my expectations.

### "my carrier of choice"
Melbourne to Los Angeles return with Qantas, and both flights were great. The A380 is so quiet, and a wonderful aircraft to fly. The seats might not be the latest, but they are comfortable for this long haul sector. The crew were efficient and friendly. The CSD on the return flight was outstanding and chatted to guests. Food and wine selection was fine and the IFE had enough for me to stay entertained. The only downside (a minor issue) are the noise cancelling headphones. They have gone down hill in quality - thankfully I had my own. This remains my carrier of choice.

### "impressed by the product"
Johannesburg to Sydney with Qantas and excellent service. Our cabin attendant was attentive and generous with drinks and food. Very comfortable seat, a thick warm blanket and I slept for quite a few hours. Entertainment excellent with a huge variety of current movies and TV. We departed and arrived on time and the price for this trip was excellent. I haven't travelled Qantas internationally for at least a decade and I was impressed by the product. The only quibble would be that boarding in Johannesburg was a little erratic. My bags did not arrive in Sydney but that may not have been Qantas' problem as I originated my journey in Luanda with TAAG. However, Qantas dealt with the problem generously in Sydney and I have no complaints.

### "very attentive and friendly"
Flew Qantas from Sydney to Perth on a new A330 with Ipads. Easy to use, but slow to view - ie. kept on buffering at start of flight. Crew very attentive and friendly. Meal was delicious. The fish curry was piping hot and tasty. Haven't flown with Qantas for some time and very impressed. As well as the meal, you get cheese and crackers, free drinks (as many as you like), plus an icecream later in the flight and a chocolate while landing. Flight was bumpy for an Australian flight, however this was due to a strong jetstream across the country and could not be avoided. The pilot farewelled us at end of flight. Will fly with Qantas again in the future.

### "staff were very relaxed"
Dubai to Melbourne with Qantas. After spending so long overseas, it was a welcome hearing the aussie accent and relaxed attitude again. The staff were very relaxed and down to earth, very attentive. My flight was about 12 hours, the seat was ok, I could have been better with a little more legroom and a slightly larger width, especially seeing that it was an A380. I wasn't the biggest fan of their food though. As they only give you one dish without any trays and without any sides. I was looking forward to getting some salad or desert or bread on the side, as they normally do with the tray service. However there was plenty to snack on in between meals. They had granola bars, cheese, crackers, chocolate, etc that was available as a "grab and go" from the back of the plane.

### "meal was really good"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Already checked in online but due to my request to link it to another booking passenger had to go to checkin for boarding pass. Very quiet no queues. Seat 26C aisle as selected online. Gluten Free meal was really good. Pilot kept us informed in flight and bonus on this flight was individual screens.

### "seats were comfortable"
I travelled premium economy for the first time with Qantas from London to Sydney return via Dubai. I was very impressed with both legs of the journey. The crew were attentive, helpful and cheerful. My seats were comfortable and for my 5' 5" height I had ample leg room - but I can see that tall people might find it a bit tight, but definitely better than economy. The food was better than average and the choice of drinks excellent. I was able to sleep well and also enjoyed the varied inflight entertainment.

### "onboard catering was poor"
Had paid for this Qantas Darwin to Melbourne flight quite some time before on sale for $189. Older plane which had been fitted with new seats, though still had the overhead cabin screens. While service was good and flight was on time, catering was poor, and I have no idea why Qantas thinks it's food service is acceptable. Since introducing their meal boxes, standard has become poor - serving a tasteless pasta in a small damp box is terrible. The cold option was the tuna and bean salad which seems to be the standard meal which I have had countless times before. Thankfully there was plenty of options in the Darwin Qantas Club before boarding. Hopefully those in charge of Qantas catering will review their current offerings and take note of the many bad reviews and think of better options.

### "catering was poor"
Had paid for this quite some time before on sale for $189. Older plane which had been fitted with new seats, but still had the screens coming down from above. While service was good and flight was on time from Darwin to Melbourne, catering was poor, and I have no idea why Qantas thinks it's food service is acceptable. Since introducing their meal boxes, standard has become poor - serving a tasteless pasta in a small damp box is terrible.

Hopefully those in charge of Qantas catering will review their current offerings and take note of the many bad reviews and think of better options.

### "fell short of my expectations"
Good experience but unfortunately, mediocre seats. It was an afternoon flight from Sydney to Singapore - on one of Qantas's old A330s. The seats were recliners, which in itself was not an issue for a daytime flight. However, even with the extra seat cover, the cushion was still inadequate. The cabin is old and tired, and the IFE unresponsive at the best of times, with a tiny selection of movie, and appalling resolution. It ought to have been banished to the last decade. The food was overcooked and over-salted, but the selection of Australian and international wine remained excellent. The saving grace of the flight was crew, who were warm, friendly, and used my name. I was looked after very well. I should point out that when booking on the Qantas page, there is no way of telling whether the A330 is refurbished or not - yet, the prices are the same. When there is such a massive difference in quality between the old and refurbished cabin, it is indeed very disappointing to leave this crucial piece of information. After all, we pay a premium in hope of a much improved service and make the decisions comparing other competitors (Such as BA, CX or SQ). And in this instance, Qantas fell well short of my expectations.

### "overall a pleasant experience"
Flew Qantas to Sydney for a 4 day trip, got the airfare on sale for $99. The aircraft was a modern A330 and was very clean and comfortable. Staff were excellent from boarding , in flight service and saying goodby'. They did run out of meals for all passengers, and y offered customers who did not receive a meal a $20 food voucher to be used in the terminal. The meal that passengers received on the flight was hardly worth $20 (cheese and crackers) so that was a good compromise. No alcohol was served on this PM flight, which I found out is only served on flights after 4pm. Alcohol could be purchased. I did not use IFE on this aircraft. Overall a pleasant experience and much better value than competitors when I booked.

### "very clear last in standard"
Flew Qantas from Singapore to Melbourne after three weeks flying Thai, Austrian and Lufthansa. Unfortunately in terms of space, food and particularly presentation and the poor IFE, Qantas was a very clear last in standard. The only thing I could give them first place for was boarding. For their so called quality airline position and pricing Qantas can never be depended. Standard varies every time.

### "awful experience"
Canberra to Singapore via Sydney return with Qantas. Awful experience. Four hours delay from Sydney to Singapore. On return, after 50 min waiting in front of the baggage pick-up, domestic flight to Canberra delayed again due to operational problem. Actually this is not the first time I experienced this kind of things. Always long queue in transit etc. Lost baggage is quite common. Services onboard are generally slow.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Melbourne to Devonport and return four days later. Both flights left on time and arrived early. Hassle-free boarding, comfortable seats, clean aircraft, snack with tea/coffee, juice and water. Professional and friendly cabin crew. No IFE, but for such a short flight, not needed.

### "really great experience"
We flew from Perth to Sydney return with Qantas. The meals on the plane were in the little boxes I'm so surprised they tasted wonderful. The flight attendant in economy on the trip over should be congratulated for his service to the elderly lady sitting across from us. The crew on both flights were really good at their jobs. A really great experience.

### "what a disappointment"
What a disappointment to travel economy with Qantas. The plane was old and that may be because the plane could not be filled so it required a smaller plane. Entertainment was on a small screen one or two rows ahead. Could hardly see anything. Food was served in a cardboard box and was mediocre. Alcohol was non existent and this was a midday flight. The cost to fly within Australia is expensive and after forking out $1400 return Perth to Adelaide return for the two of us, what a rip off.

### "customer service is poor"
24 hours before my flight from Sydney to Hong Kong departed, Qantas informed me that is cancelled. The next departure was 24 hours after it was cancelled, so I'm looking for another flight, but it was full. I have no idea what to do since I have an important things to do in Hong Kong, I better give up later on and fly Cathay Pacific instead. Worst experience ever, customer service is poor and the average service is getting worse.

### "awful customer support"
Singapore to Sydney. Awful customer support. We've spent over 15 hours on the phone attempting to do a simple change of flight date. Their support either hangs up (after about an hour) or that they eventually tell us that we have to call someone else. In the latest development, they are trying to charge a no-show flight (for missing a flight), when in fact, the flight was cancelled and an alternative arranged by the airline. Ridiculous.

### "felt discriminated against"
As Americans now living in Australia who also travel for work, we use air travel a great deal. My wife has maintained Platinum status with Qantas. I choose another airline, and after this latest Qantas experience, she is switching. We both wrote letters to Qantas about the terrible experience, the poor service of crew in business class, yet they were unconcerned. Despite using 170,000 points to upgrade, their only offer, after repeated hounding them that they needed to do something to right the wrong, they were only willing to offer 10,000 points back! The experience? On the long flight from Los Angeles to Brisbane in Business Class, we were amazed to find a family with young children seated in the rows next to and behind us. The family proceeded to conduct themselves as though they were the only people aboard the plane, making an incessant racket the entire 15 or so hours, always needing flight crew to deal with their non-stop issues. Never once did crew ask them to respect the other passengers who were trying to sleep through the night, nor did they apologise to any passengers for the constant disruptions and noise, even after it was pointed out. When we realised we would not be getting any sleep to prepare for work as soon as we landed, we tried inflight entertainment. It didn't work. Took over an hour, and even then was a dodgy work-around where you could join a handful of programs already in progress. We felt discriminated against and find their unwillingness to make an effort to keep a loyal customer who has spent a small fortune with their airline absolutely appalling. Pathetic company with no regard for their customers whatsoever. Never again, Qantas!

### "seating cramped and claustrophobic"
Singapore to Perth in a Qantas 737 aircraft better suited for shorter flights not a 5 over hours flight. Seating was cramped and felt claustrophobic after a few hours. Service was slow took them 2 hours before dinner was served. The crew seemed to take their time and worked slowly. Not much engagement with the passengers. Small main meal then a cheese cracker service then a kit kat chocolate service (they seem to have split up the usual meal tray items and served them separately to give the impression you are getting 'a lot' to eat I suppose). Inflight entertainment limited to only some current movies option. Everthing feels limited and restricted. Overall a very domestic feel product and service. Not at all comparable with other carriers on this route.

### "avoid Qantas if possible"
QF5 from Sydney to Singapore. On boarding I saw such an old tired run down product for this international route. Even on domestic flights on the A330 was better and more modern. The cabin had an old musky odour and the seats lost the firmness and worn out. Video screen tiny and with scratches on them poor images and sound quality. Service from the crew was plastic at best. Spent more time chatting and laughing in the galleys and when you go there to ask for water you get an annoyed look from them. Flight was barely full and yet they ran out of meal choices and bottled water so those at back of plane would get nothing. Qantas has cut corners on the meals with small servings. Midway in flight was handed a small ice cream bar. No fruits although it was stated on the menu. Would avoid Qantas if possible.

### "crew could not do enough"
First time having flown Qantas, in First Class, on the Sydney-Dubai (then, onwards to London Heathrow) route. Upon entering the cabin, I was warmly greeted and walked to my suite. Almonds, olives and a beverage were quickly presented, as well as all the wonderful amenities, to enhance the flight experience - pajamas, slippers, and an amenity kit with many items. The overhead bin had more than enough space for my luggage and backpack, and the area, to the side of the seat had so much storage, with two drawers, as well as ample room, on top. The service during the flight was amazing, and the food was delicious. I felt like the crew could not do enough - rare feeling, while flying. The bed is very comfortable - a Flight Attendant placed the sheepskin mattress cover, sheets, duvet and pillows, and I slept so well. When I awoke, it was noticed (again, rare), and asked if I would like anything to eat or drink. The in-flight entertainment seemed, endless-movies, television, CD's, and more. I honestly did not want to get off the plane, when landing at Dubai, and shared this with the Customer Service manager when she inquired how my flight had been. Extremely glad that I had the opportunity to experience this journey.

### "very friendly crew"
Sydney to Singapore. Check-in at Sydney Airport with helpful staff. Plane had a modern cabin and economy seats with plenty of leg room. We were served drinks and dinner. The food was enjoyable (Moroccan Lamb + Rice) plus an excellent chocolate dessert. The in-flight entertainment system had plenty of content, with new release movies and  classics. However the screen size was small (approx. 8 inches). I was travelling with a group of 24 people on route to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj Pilgrimage. I had asked the crew if I and some of the members of the group could offer a quick prayer, and they provided some quiet space where we were able to pray, individually. Very grateful to the crew for this. Overall excellent flight, and very friendly crew.

### "disappointed with the food"
Have been flying Qantas for many years, but really disappointed with the food and the lack of inflight movies or choices. Sydney to Tokyo return and the meals were uninteresting, in particular, breakfast was served in a cardboard box. Surely you can do better than this. What happened to the good food and decent breakfasts from the past. Unimpressed.

### "why I gave up flying Qantas"
Sydney to Bangkok with Qantas. The lavatory I used was dirty. Food choices had run out by the time the trolley reached me, also the starters and deserts had run out. The meal later in the flight consisted of a box containing a tiny sausage roll and tiny hamburger - I couldn’t eat them.I asked for two small bottles of wine with the food and was refused. I find it patronising to automatically assumed to be a problem drinker.The flight was late pushing back and we were assured many times that we would arrive into Bangkok early. We landed late into Bangkok because of congestion. There was one announcement that those of us with connections should be at the gate at least 1 hour before our departing flight and apart from that we were on our own. The plane was an elderly A330. The entertainment screens were tiny and controls fiddly. I bought this flight from Emirates as part of a return journey. The Emirates leg was excellent. The Qantas leg reminds me of why I gave up flying Qantas years ago.

### "not sure of value for money"
PER-SYD in January on a new Boeing 737-800 NG with Sky interior in Business – nice, evening flight with no problems and on-time departure. Premium Check in at PER with short lines and fairly fast. However I noticed that Y check-in was full self-service including tagging and dropping off luggage and I didn’t really see any QF staff to offer any assistance at the kiosks. Used the QF domestic lounge, which was spacious and comfortable; various cold food choices and fresh pizza. Alcohol and espressos served at a manned bar with nice drink choices. Boarding was uneventful. On board actual business class seats were comfortable and much better than what European airlines offer on short European flights. FA’s professional and attentive but not particularly friendly. Choice of 2 starters, 5 mains and 3 desserts were offered and I found the Chinese style steamed white fish to be quite good. Australian wines very nice with regular top ups. In-seat on-demand IFE offered with a limited but good enough choices of movies. Impressive product for a domestic flight. As for value for money, I am not so sure. I burned some miles for this flight, so value was actually good. However I also checked the prices for QF on this route and the prices that came up for both C and Y were substantially higher than what I would consider an acceptable price for a four hour flight for both classes, even if considering the good experience QF offered on this flight.

### "extremely run down"
I decided to try Qantas business class on the extra long Melbourne to LAX service so I'd be rested and ready to go as soon as I landed in Los Angeles. unfortunately the business class cabin on the Qantas A380 is extremely run down, beds are hard as a rock even with the extra 'mattress' pad. The so called sky bed is narrow which doesn't allow for sleeping on ones side, rather only on the back with an uncomfortable set up with arms across the stomach. Cabin crew on the MEL-LAX were quite elderly and surly, the obvious allocation of this route to crew with seniority does little to improve the brand. No wifi on board.

### "far from a first class service"
We had a good trip until the last leg. At Sydney we had to argue with the first class lounge. The first two legs of the trip were First Class as we had booked a first Class round world ticket. The plane on the leg from Sydney to Auckland had no first Class so we had Business boarding passes. The lounge got very funny with us. This should not have been the case. Once we arrived in Auckland our Luggage which had been checked right through was not there. We spent ages waiting then reporting and recording the fact it had not arrived. There was no apology and although we were First Class passengers we were not kept advised of when it may arrive. They asked for our email address but we got nothing. The cases arrived just inside the 24 hour cut off. Very convenient. Not a word of apology or explanation. This is far from a first class service. We will not fly Qantas again unless we have to.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Los Angeles to Brisbane with Qantas, seat 3A/B. Extremely poor service. Waited 1.5 hours before any food. No towels to cleans hands No decaffeinated coffee. No amenities bag and needed to ask. Passed tray over seat B when plenty of room to serve properly. Night snack, I could not find any and no staff around to ask. Not attentive and not at all gracious.

### "upgraded to Premium economy"
A discount economy fare with Qantas from Melbourne to LAX return and managed to secure seats 32J/K on each leg in the small economy section at the rear of the top deck. When we approached the boarding gate at Melbourne, were delighted to see we had been upgraded to Premium economy. The seats in PE are definitely a step up from economy - although as noted previously when the passenger in front reclines, your space is definitely reduced! Very prompt and friendly service. On the way home (29 Jan) no upgrade, but the service was outstanding. Seats were comfortable and entertainment system had enough to keep us busy. Cabin crew visible on both legs with snacks and water on hand.

### "pleasantly surprised"
It has been a considerable time since I flew Qantas and I was pleasantly surprised. Self check-in completed in a very short time. The flight was very enjoyable, being the last flight on a Thursday night. There were few empty seats and happy with comfort on this A330-200, seat 31A. Cabin crew were very pleasant and served a superior snack with  beverages or wine. The service was efficient and pleasant. Qantas are far superior to the low cost carriers.

### "a fantastic flight"
1st January from Melbourne to Darwin, and it was a fantastic flight. No drama, everything was on time. Ground staff with friendly smile. Staff on the plane were great and treated everyone with a smile. Landed on tine in Darwin. Thank you Qantas, you all made a perfect start to new year.

### "ground services be improved"
As much as I appreciate Qantas inflight service, I believe that their operations / ground services can be improved. Flying to AKL from HKG in business, I won the bid for upgrade from economy. When arrived at the check it I was informed my flight was delayed 12 hours! I didn't receive any notification before (like most airlines do) that would have avoided me to go all the way to the check in. In that moment I have been told that they did not know when I was gonna get my connection to AKL. Went back home, they after I learnt that I would have needed to spend one night in Sydney as there was no connecting flight the same day. That meant that I would arrive 20 hours after the planned time, losing one full day of travel. And I could not check in until AKL directly, meaning that I would need to take my luggage in Sydney, and check in again the morning after (with a 5 hours sleep maximum). In Sydney the hotel provided was very convenient (right in the airport) but no breakfast was provided. I wrote to Qantas to complain about these issues, but after 10 days I did not hear back anything from them. It's a shame that an airline with good inflight service is not able to manage these situations in a better way. At the end a travel experience includes all way from the departure airport to the destination.

### "crew were very attentive"
Los Angeles to Perth via Melbourne. We paid extra $180 for exit row in the small economy section at the very rear of the upper deck. Unlimited leg room although no storage options here and is quite cold next to the door. Food was good, with dinner and breakfast served and any snacks we wanted in between. The cabin crew were very attentive and helpful. We did miss our connection in Melbourne due to the large queue in Customs but we were moved straight on to the next flight with no issue. My only criticism would be that the exit row seating width is a little constrained due to containing the to the TV in the armrest but this is standard on all carriers so there is not much that can be done about this.

### "a perfect flight"
A perfect flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Perth. Flight was on time. A very good service, food was healthy and great taste. Drinks were superb. The crew were very friendly. It was a real pleasure to flight with. Seats were good. Just the free WIFI was very slow.

### "back to good old days"
Honolulu to Sydney with Qantas recently updated A330-300 aircraft. The new economy seats were like those on A380 and entertainment system was first rate, with significant improvements on the old interior A330 we had on outward journey. Meals were lunch and dinner, a choice of three options. Meal size and quality was good. It was a bit like a step back to the good old days of the 80s in this regard. Crew friendly and came around with extras like ice cream, mid flight tea and coffee service etc. The best economy long haul flight I had had in years.

### "great customer service"
Qantas Airways flight from Dubai to London Heathrow. From check-in till check out, provided with fantastic service. Boarding was very relaxed and welcome onboard delivered very professionally. During flight onboard team was very discreet and approachable delivering great customer service. Drinks and food provided with high quality.

### "staff were amazing"
I would like to commend the Qantas Airways staff on our flight from Sydney to Singapore on the 17th January 2016, flight QF 005. I travelled with my Daughter and Grandson. My Daughter has an intense fear of flying. The staff were amazing in taking the time to attend, talk and try and allay her fear. They were exceptionally attentive and I was so impressed with the genuine concern and care for her during the flight. I certainly have had my grievances with Qantas in the past, but this service has certainly impressed me.

### "felt that we were a nuisance"
Overall a satisfactory experience again with Qantas Airways from Sydney to London via Dubai, (this being the return part of a family visit "Down Under"). Efficient check in at Sydney with desk open 4 hours prior to flight allowing plenty of time in the Business Lounge - (not work the time). Flight departed slightly late but arrived early in Dubai. Our FA on this first leg was very surly, didn't introduce herself, drinks and snacks slapped down on the seat surrounds and generally we felt that we were a nuisance. This contrasted with our FA on the Dubai to London leg who introduced herself, was smiling and helpful throughout. Again arrived slightly earlier than planned into Heathrow. Food was OK but Qantas' general "business offering" falls below it's MIddle Eastern colleagues/competitors, particularly with the cocoon seating and no direct aisle access for the window passenger. The Entertainment system is easy to operate but the monitor and privacy screen controls were tempremental.

### "I had a great flight"
Flew QF 23 from Sydney to Bangkok on 21st January in Qantas Business Class in the new seating set up which is just great. Comfortable and easy to operate. The staff were brilliant, food delicious and very presentable. Staff communicated with passengers. In all I had a great flight.

### "domestic ahead of International"
Melbourne to Santiago de Chile via Sydney return, in business class. Check in at Melbourne was polite and good. Even managed to get me on the earlier flight giving me a better connection time in Sydney. Melbourne Qantas business lounge so so. Service on board QF416 was fantastic. Excellent professional and approachable crew. Sydney International Business Staff rude and could not care less. QF27 departure was delayed by 2 hours, this flight operated by one of the oldest and dirtiest Boeing 747s in the QF fleet. Food not bad, onboard service was not the best but passable. Flight arrived into SCL 1.5hrs late. Thankfully I had a good connection window. Return flight operated by a refurbished Boeing 747-400 that looked newer. However delayed due to refuelling problems. Left over an hour late. Flight had better IFE. Crew was not the best. The food was terrible. Arrived into SYD late and bags took a long time to appear. Missed connection to MEL. Was on QF487 and had to be put QF 491. Crew and meal on QF491 was fantastic. Overall QF domestic is light years ahead of International.

### "flight was uneventful"
Singapore to Perth with Qantas, and the flight was uneventful and arrived on time. The crew were most efficient, professional and friendly. How sad however that QF71 and QF72 are the only Qantas flights operating out of Perth to Singapore, using a single aisle, aged Boeing 737-800. Given that Perth has arguably the closest overall association with our Asian neighbours, Qantas at least could put on a larger more modern aircraft which West Australians would no doubt support. Qantas has also been relegated to T1 at Changi, the budget terminal. An alternative - Jetstar? Simply read the litany of complaints and forget it.

### "seats reclined too far"
Sydney to Singapore return with Qantas. SYD-SIN on a newly-refurbished A330, returning on one of the old A330s. The old A330 was the same as the one I've regularly taken from Sydney to Shanghai. It's OK, but the seat-back TV screen is extremely small. That's the only problem on that plane. It was an overnight flight, and service was OK. The other problem with the flight was that Qantas ground staff in Sydney were not prepared for our arrival. We had to park in the cargo area, and wait for a stairway truck to come to us. After about 15-20 minutes, a stairway truck arrived, but without the member of staff needed to open the door. So we had to wait another 20 minutes while they found someone who knew how to open the door. It appears that the daily arrival of QF6 still comes as a surprise to Qantas' Sydney ground staff. The newly-refurbished A330 had better-padded seats and much, much bigger TV screens. It was a daytime flight, and service was OK. However, on the newly-refurbished A330, the seats reclined too far. There was a good 3-4 inches more recline than I've seen in economy on any other plane. The person in front of me decided to recline as soon as the seat-belt light was switched off. This spilled the drink on my table, and left me with the back of her seat less than five inches from my nose. Viewing the big, new TV screen was now impossible. Accessing the seat pockets was impossible. Eating and drinking was impossible, and even moving was difficult. The woman next to me had the same problem with the person in front of her. We both had to move: it was impossible to stay in those seats for a daytime flight. Even getting out of our seats to move elsewhere was extremely difficult. Very few people had chosen to use the full recline, so this wasn't a problem for most of the other passengers, although this was pure luck. Fortunately, we did manage to find alternative seats. However, having paid an extra A$30 to select my seat (a window seat near the front), I wasn't thrilled to end up in a centre-aisle seat in the very back row. Other than this, the flight was OK. But Qantas really needs to look at a way of restricting recline to normal levels. If this can't be resolved, I'll be avoiding Qantas flights on refurbished A330s: the seats are completely unusable if the person in front uses the full recline.

### "flight attendants were a mixed bag"
Mediocre service from start to finish and quite disappointing with Qantas Airways. Check in at Sydney for the Los Angeles and New York JFK sectors very quick and efficient. First leg, QF11 to LAX, departed a full hour late, due to late boarding, with no announcement. Boarding was chaotic and not streamlined by cabin and deck level. A380 interior looks tired. Sat on the upper deck bulk head just behind Premium Economy. Flight attendants were a mixed bag. Some were very nice, others would not make eye contact, and were just a slight cut above what you would find on a US domestic flight. Toilets kept clean and tidy throughout the flight and the entertainment system was good. Catering not bad for Economy and plenty of snack options for the 14 hour journey. One flight attendant got us snacks from Business Class at one point. Transit at LAX to the JFK flight (on the BNE-LAX aircraft) is a mess. Long lines and poor signage. Never clear where you are to leave your luggage and you have to go back through security even though you are staying within the TBIT. No wonder the QF11 LAX-JFK flight is always late. Our flight departed a full 90 minutes behind schedule and arrived an hour late. The plane, a 747-400, was ancient and falling apart inside and out. Worn out seats, broken IFE, filthy lavatories, and dirty seat cushions. Cabin crew only interested in chit chatting with their friends and family and moving some to business class as a courtesy. Only plus of this flight is not having to change terminals. Long wait for baggage at JFK. Overall, a mediocre experience with an airline that I had high hopes for, but featured a tired product. Can't believe it, but my UA flight from LAX to Australia on the way out was the better one. Also, no WIFI on the A380 or the 747.

### "cabin interior fantastic"
Brisbane to Melbourne, the cabin interior was fantastic, complete with Sky interior and in seat TV's. Crew welcomed me onboard using my name and were very friendly. It was a breakfast flight and two options. I selected the bacon and egg muffin which was hot and tasty. A huge choice of entertainment, the flight arrived on time. Fantastic flight and crew.

### "helpful and pretty calm"
Flew Premium Economy on Qantas to London from Sydney on Christmas Day and returned QF2, on  22nd Jan. Transit in Dubai both ways. Cannot really find anything to complain about. The crew I came in contact with were friendly, helpful and pretty calm - especially since the cabin was packed on the Sydney to Dubai leg over, and both legs on the way home. I took advantage of the food offerings in the Qantas business lounge in Sydney and Emirates lounge in Dubai, which is pretty good, so did not eat masses on the flights. What food I did eat on the was fine though. I still think Premium Economy is pretty expensive but the extra room and better food does make it worth considering particularly for long haul flights.

### "an excellent experience"
My teenage son and I flew Qantas from Sydney to Los Angeles then onto New York on the 1st January. As a special treat, I used my points for an upgrade to Business Class. The experience was very good. In the past I have flown Business with Emirates and Qantas and this flight lived up to their reputation. Business Class in the A380 has lots of room and many comforts. The service was friendly and attentive, the food excellent and the flat bed very comfortable. This was an overnight flight and we slept well. We appreciated the Qantas comfortable pyjamas but I thought it a little odd that both the men's and women's amenities bags had exactly the same contents, only the exterior of the bag was different. In the past my husband had shaving items in his, whilst I had moisturiser and hand cream. Overall, this was an excellent experience and definitely one I would recommend.

### "flight was very enjoyable"
We recently flew Qantas Business Class from Los Angeles to New York. The service was very attentive and friendly, food was good and seats were comfortable. Being a daytime flight we were not given amenities or pyjamas as we had for our overnight flight Sydney to LAX. Although I understand that this is not a sleeping flight, it would have been nice to be given a little refresher something such as face spritzer, packet of handwipes etc. The flight was very enjoyable.

### "whole aircraft looked new"
This was my first time travelling with Qantas Airways from London Heathrow to Sydney via Dubai. We arrived at Heathrow, where the staff were extremely helpful and were soon through to duty free. I was slightly nervous considering this was my first 21 hour flight. Upon boarding, we received menu's. At my seat was a pillow and also headphones. The In-flight entertainment system kept me occupied with all the latest films. The toilets were very clean and the whole aircraft looked new even though it was 6 years old. Upon cruising we had a meal. I opted for the meat option. The unique feature about the aircraft was the Sky-cam. This is a camera mounted on the tail of the aircraft. If you walk to the back of the aircraft, there was a selection of cans, cartons, cakes and fruit you could have. Upon landing at Dubai there was a crew change. One of the best flights I have been on. Will definitely choose Qantas again.

### "plane itself was dirty"
Auckland to Melbourne with Qantas Airways. After diligently saving points we finally got a reward flight and business too through a partner airline LAN. Up at 4am to wait for an hour only to be told our flight was cancelled and to see the Qantas sales staff. Well you'd swear they were volunteers, one hour to process each person, fortunately we were next in line but waited the full hour. They got us on a direct flight but economy Qantas that afternoon at 3pm. I had a broken wrist (3 weeks prior) and said they put us in a window seat (wrong side - wrist-wise) for my husband and aisle for me in different rows. Turned out I had a middle seat and had to twist my body for all the flight to stop any contact with my wrist. Anyway they said at the sales desk that we could check in our bags at 9.30am. We waited and did that only to be told that our bags could be lost by checking them in so early. We took the risk as I couldn't help my husband with the bags at all. The plane itself was dirty, the above air vents/lights were caked in dust/dirt/grime - not cleaned in a very long time. There were plenty of shows to watch but the screen was very slow to respond, but it did work. The meal in a box was edible (just) but bland (cold chicken slices on cold pasta). The FA's were nice though, they came through with offers of refreshments and were quite cheery. Our bags did make it in the end but it was a nervous wait. Altogether I was saddened at seeing the way Qantas is these days compared to how it used to be.

### "seat was reasonably spacious"
VH-QPA. Flew Qantas Airways from Sydney to Hong Kong. Recently updated entertainment console was excellent in terms of lots of the latest movies and 80s-90s hits and DJ music which included a unique section for Australian artists. TV screen took up the whole headrest and is a big improvement. Was also really good to access the entertainment prior to take off. Seat was reasonably spacious being a window seat however the aisle passenger next to me hogged the armrest and protruded themselves about 4 inches into my 'airspace' fairly often. Check-in was quite efficient. Departure gate was central to the main food court and shops. Was a little disappointed with the fabric upholstered seats which already showed signs of fraying together with torn pockets and the responsiveness of the touch screen. The cabin windows also had hair grease on them from a previous flight. Hotdog snack was soggy and too hot for about 15 minutes.

### "a great flight"
Perth to Brisbane and a great flight with Qantas, was a bit concerned with Boeing 737 IFE but was on a reconfigured plane which was great. Boxed meals, cabin crew and ground staff were all good.

### "a good flight"
Afternoon Qantas flight from Darwin to Perth the week of Christmas. A good flight, nice food, snacks plus ice cream. Service good on this flight, and I was interested to see what the catering would be like after the introduction of the boxed meals. Sure enough, the boxed meal came - hot choice was pork pasta, cold option was a tuna salad. I opted for the salad as I don't eat pork. The size of these meals are generally good, and certainly tasty. Cheese and crackers were also provided, with Lindt chocolates and ice cream to follow. On top of this, complimentary wine and beer is served, and on a flight of nearly four hours, a couple of wines is nice. Plane seemed fairly new, good crew, and flight on time.

### "worst airline experience"
Qantas flight QF17 on 2nd January from Sydney to Los Angeles was the worst airline experience of my life. My wife and I were literally imprisoned by the gate representative and the airlines "medical representative. My wife is in a wheelchair so we require special assistance to board. When we arrived at the airport, both of us were sick from catching bad colds in Tasmania on a rainy day from a cruise excursion. We had coughed and sneezed quite a bit and smelled of cough medicine. They dragged us off to a private lounge and insisted that my wife take a shower. The place was like a sauna and her cold got even worse, as did mine. They insisted that she put on some "mickey mouse" outfit that was so tight that it was described as a major scrape to her body by nurses who later examined her. When we returned to the gate they informed us that they had changed our seats to all the way in the back, which would make it very difficult for us to board and disembark since she really can't walk. It took forever for us to do both, which prolonged my wife's misery. Due to the shower, she coughed the entire flight back to Los Angeles. The medical staff woman ensured us that the seat change was for our benefit since I would be closer to the bathroom at the back of the plane. Hopefully she will be re-assigned to sweeping the floors. The flight itself was highlighted by the refusal of the Captain to turn on the seat belt sign in midflight until the plane was practically being violently tossed. The flight crew also needs a refresher course in disbursing and retrieving food. It was very disorderly. I had to tell the flight attendant 3 times that I didn't want to eat Barramundi, which as she explained was a fish, in case I didn't know. Disembarkation was fun with the crew making snide remarks about my wife's inability to walk and exit the plane.

### "very happy with Qantas"
We were very happy with Qantas on this journey from Perth via Sydney to San Francisco. Our original connection to Miami through Dallas was delayed but we were contacted by Qantas the day before and advised they could change us to the San Francisco flight and we would lose no time. This call was made from their Priority service for Silver and above FF status. We were disappointed a little that we had to fly on the Boeing 747 as we were looking forward to the A380 but the interiors of the 747 have now been upgraded so they are very similar. The flight was delayed slightly in Sydney but the pilot advised the delay could be made up in flight and it was. Most of the crew were very helpful and friendly and inflight service was very good. On both legs we asked if there was any spare meals we were still hungry and crew were happy to assist. On the flight to San Francisco we were served lunch, snacks and breakfast prior to arrival. This was in addition to the self service snack bar at the rear of the economy cabin which also included amenity kits.

### "engine noise was so bad"
Four of us flew Qantas from Hobart to Brisbane We had to change our flight date and were charged $952. So the cost to go from to Brisbane to Hobart and back was almost $3000. Then we were given a seat at the back of the Boeing 717 with no window. The engine noise was so bad - nobody should be given those seats. To top it up three out of four entertainment devices we were given didn't work and we were told there is no spare device available. Try any of the budget airlines first.

### "old style seats"
Qantas A330-200 business class service from Auckland to Perth. I also flew the reverse leg from Perth to Auckland prior. The quality of the meals was noticeably improved compared to the atrocity of the prior flight, and more food and drinks were served. The meal service was extremely slow however - at least a 1 hour gap between the entree and the main course. Disappointment remains with the old style business class seats, they are equivalent to premium economy on most airlines. I would have expected Qantas to use the newer style lie-flat seats for a 7 hour flight. Luckily the business cabin was hardly full and I had 2 seats by the window to myself for the entire flight. I would not recommend directly paying business class on this flight, however can recommend a points upgrade.

### "impressed by new cabin interior"
Brisbane to Tokyo Narita with Qantas. Check in all automated and therefore no bag drop queues. I was impressed by the new cabin interior in the economy section of A330. Modern interior, large IFE screen, great selection of movies, and positive flight attendants. A pre-flight drink supplied and great meals served. Captain/First Officer provided updates of our location, pointing out Mount Fuji upon our arrival into Tokyo.

### "a sub-par experience"
Jakarta to Melbourne via Sydney return with Qantas. Jakarta to Sydney flight used a refitted A330-200 with new interior and personal iPads on every seat. IFE was faulty for the first hour of the trip and had to be reset a few times before it finally worked. FAs were quiet and a little grumpy - I asked for a pair of socks, and the FA said they only had eye patches; he then proceeded to throw me an extra blanket from a few rows away, found this rude and unnecessary. Meal service was rushed due to light turbulence. Breakfast was nice and relaxed, and the coffee served onboard was delicious. Sydney to0 Melbourne flight used a worn-out Boeing 737-800 with the old interior, no IFE. FA service was marginally better. Both flights departed and landed on time. A sub-par experience in general.

### "lacking the warmth"
Melbourne to Jakarta via Sydney on Qantas. MEL-SYD flight departed late but arrived on time. The terminal transfer process was smooth and easy, which was quite impressive. Sydney to Jakarta flight was full, and I struggled to find space for my bag in the overhead cabins. FAs were courteous and helpful, but their service rarely went off-script and their replies to requests sounded stiff and a little "textbook". I requested a special online-only meal upon checking in, but my meal went to another passenger by mistake. When I raised this with the on-board Customer Service Manager, she scouted around and found a spare meal pack for me that matched my original request - lovely gesture. No in-flight shopping was offered which was a letdown for me. All in all a standard experience with Qantas - I feel their service is lacking the warmth and professionalism of some of their Asian competitors, such as Garuda Indonesia and Singapore Airlines.

### "great ambassadors for Qantas"
My adult special needs son travelled Sydney to Wellington and back in early January 2016 to stay with my family. We requested assisted travel as he is illiterate, gets confused and is unable to find seat on aircraft. From our first contact with Qantas staff we were personally accompanied to the correct counter, and from there he was treated with the utmost respect and consideration and informed personally of flight delay etc, was assisted to his aircraft seat and greet and meet at Wellington. On his return the assisting hostess spoke to me personally before leaving him, and he was made to feel comfortable and at ease without feeling a nuisance or burden to anyone. As his Mother and carer it gave me great relief to see how at ease he was, this is a very hard thing for a parent of a intellectually disabled person to let go. I would like Qantas staff to know how special and confident they made my son and myself feel and were great ambassadors for Qantas.

### "service was more than bad"
Qantas from Sydney to Dubai, and the service for a 15 hour Flight was more than bad. No hot meal was served - only one cold meal at the beginning of the flight and one Toast at the end. Between them only some fruits and M&Ms. In the menu it was published that we get some burgers and Hotdogs between the two meals but nothing server. No hot towels and nothing else provided like Toothbrush etc that we get in most airlines as standard. Additionally the cabin was very cold!

### "excellent customer service "
Melbourne to London via Dubai. On the 6th January 2016 we missed our flight from Melbourne to London. We were served by a very helpful lady at the Qantas sales desk in Melbourne, who after a period of time was able to get us on another flight to London. We are very thankful to this lady, as without her excellent customer service we would not have been able to return to the UK. Thank you very much.

### "be careful of codeshare flights"
I bought a ticket from Qantas to fly from Singapore to Auckland, transiting in Melbourne. Qantas flew us from Singapore to Melbourne and at Melbourne, it was a code share flight with Emirates from Melbourne to Auckland. When we arrived in Auckland at 1338, one of our bags did not arrive. I proceeded to the Qantas luggage counter (which was empty) and they directed me to the General luggage counter (which had a very long queue). After about half an hour, the ground staff said our luggage was left in Melbourne and it would be forwarded on the next Qantas flight in 2 hours. The luggage could be sent to us if we provided a hotel name and address. Unfortunately, we were on a camper van holiday! So we waited at the airport for 3 hours, but the bags were not sent on the next Qantas flight. We were told to wait another 3 hours. We highlighted that our camper van shop was about to close. We were then given a telephone number to call. After collecting our camper van we called and the ground staff told us the bags would arrive at 9pm. At 9pm, they told us the bags did not arrive and it would be sent the next morning. Finally, at 2pm the next day, the bags were sent by Emirates. We went back to the airport to collect our bag, the ground staff handed us our bag, my friend signed on a form and that was it. We were not given a copy. No one from Qantas or Emirates apologized! When I returned to Singapore, I e-mailed Qantas. Qantas responded that I had flew Emirates and I should claim from Emirates! I wrote to Emirates and Emirates called back, the call basically went, "I am calling from Emirates, I am so sorry to hear about your baggage delay. Your ticket was bought from Qantas so you should seek recourse with Qantas. Thank you. Before I could respond, the call ended! Without a letter from either Emirates or Qantas, I cannot even claim baggage delay from my insurance. Please be careful of codeshare flights.

### "not possible to check in online"
Melbourne to Sydney with Qantas, and this was an Emirates reward flight. Despite the supposedly seamless integration of the Emirates and Qantas systems, it was not possible to check in online on either airline's website. Otherwise the flight was flawless: on-time operation, friendly onboard service and a comfortable seat. I had a guest pass to the Qantas lounge in Melbourne, which was very comfortable but the food options in the late morning were disappointing - just breakfast food.

### "aircraft showing it's age "
Quick trip on Qantas Airways from Sydney to Singapore back. Whilst comfortable, the aircraft is now showing it's age a bit. This was one of the unrefurbished ones with the small AVOD screens. Seats comfort was okay but it felt like an old craft. Given that the Singapore run was once served by an A380, this is a major come down. Being a regular on the A380, the levels of comfort are not as high and with noise being a real issue on the A330. This is an important destination so Qantas come on, get the B787 onto it. No other gripes and service up to the usual standard that we now expect from QF. One odd thing. It was freezing cold to start with on both legs. Not sure if it is an A330 thing, that particular craft or me. Bit of a shock to the system to go from Sydney or Singapore heat into deep freeze.

### "has improved dramatically"
Qantas flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne, and the A330 was new. Great IFE with touch screen and usb ports. Service was superb. I had not travelled Qantas international routes for more than 10 years, and I have to say it has improved dramatically. Food was nice - a hot entree (2 choices), or cold salad, plus a hot bun and dessert. Mid-flight snack, then breakfast.

### "customer service very poor"
Singapore to Brisbane and Qantas customer service is very poor. The food is dreadful, most of what we ate should not be served to customers. The cabin staff mocked us when we brought this to their attention. Having taken five flights with Emirates in December 2015, we had become accustomed to their excellent service, food and cabin comfort. Flying with Qantas from Singapore to Brisbane was one of the longest seven or so hours of my life. The cabin staff were arrogant, disinterested and in denial regarding the food quality. When I called Qantas the next day to complain they could not care less, a real waste of time. I always think a good test of the quality of any company is how they deal with customer issues, Qantas were very poor in this area.

### "an unpleasant experience"
Singapore to Sydney was an unpleasant experience from the time of entry into the aircraft. This Qantas A330-200 had a domestic configuration rather than international. Meaning there was one bathroom shared between all business class, crew and pilots, and the occasional desperate economy customer. It was occupied throughout the flight, possibly because pyjamas were issued and many took the opportunity to change before sleeping. It was usual to find up to 6 people queuing to get in, which is not what you expect for the extra price paid. The crew were also frazzled trying to prepare snacks in such a small galley. There was also something wrong with the new beds which kept eating the seat belts and had to be dismantled. Can usually recommend this airline but not this time on this particular sector.

### "good flight all round"
Brisbane to Hong Kong on Qantas A330. Good flight all round. New bed was comfortable and more spacious than other airlines I've recently flown. Food was good but ran out of my choice. There was an option to prebook the meal but I did not take it up. Service good. On time departure and early arrival.

### "friendly crew"
A textbook flight with Qantas Airways from Sydney to Auckland. Lounge was good for a decent breakfast and very comfortable. Plane took off a little late but friendly crew and great service made it feel like a seperate cabin - not just a curtain dividing Business from the rest of the plane. Decent wines and food and the flight was quite seemless - a rare chance for some peace and quiet and time to myself. Bags were first off and started coming out of the carousel when I walked up to it. Good to see that Qantas does a relatively short flight as well as it does the long ones.

### "great flight and recommend"
Flew Qantas business class on the seasonal supplementary direct flights between Brisbane and Christchurch. Qantas lounge at Christchurch is quite nice. I think it's one of the better ones in the Qantas Australasia network. The flights were on time. Business cabin half full on each flight. Flight attendants attentive. Food was okay. Had fish option both flights and was okay. Drinks plentiful. Business bags were last off the belt at Christchurch. Brisbane not much better. However, a great flight and recommend. I only wish this route was flown year round with Qantas as it is so much better than transiting Sydney.

### "very professional service"
Heathrow to Sydney via Dubai with Qantas. What a pleasant surprise. A very professional service throughout from the on time chauffeur service through to an arrival in Sydney some 30 mins early, (this despite a delayed departure from Heathrow due to 2 non shows). The two service teams were excellent although my preference was for the slightly more restrained team down to Sydney. Entertainment system worked, seats worked but needed the extra mattress for comfort. Food acceptable particularly the Q select special. Wine delicious.

### "worst travelling experience"
Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles in Qantas Business class. This would have to rate as one of the worst travelling experiences we have had. It began at check-in to find our seat had been changed and while travelling as a couple we had been split up. When we pointed this out we were seated together but with bad grace. This was followed by disorganisation at the boarding gate in Melbourne where everyone was herded together with no attempt to have controlled lines. Having boarded we were advised of a delay with the reason given as refuelling being late. An attempt at humour was offered that perhaps the re-fuelers had overindulged at Christmas. Total inefficiency would have been a more accurate explanation. We arrived in LA late so transfer to New York flight was chaotic and delayed. Qantas staff at LAX gave the impression they had no idea as to how to handle the situation. To top this experience our luggage was lost and two days later has not been located. We were directed to British Airways luggage service at JFK and they have been hopeless. Luggage was not forwarded as promised that night and next morning as we were departing for Canada we went to the office again and they could not tell us where it was. The 1800 telephone number does not respond and we still do not have our luggage. We have tried to contact Qantas in Australia to be told via automated response there is a 63 minute hold time. This service from Qantas is disgraceful. An email sent to Qantas customer feedback resulted in an automated response indicated a 15 day wait. The seat in business class is fine but would be very hard without the addition of a quilt like mattress provided. The food certainly does not live up to the hype of a Neil Perry menu. The attitude of staff is perfunctory at best and the luggage staff at JFK were a disgrace. Unfortunately we are returning with Qantas as we would not choose to fly with them again but having incurred the enormous expense of new clothes suitable for the snow in Canada we are not wishing to add to the expense created by this poor service.

### "seat was comfortable"
Flight from ADL-MEL is only a short flight but flying with a premium airline like Qantas Airways is the way to do it before christmas to make sure you get to your destination. Check in was easy, with the new procedure of enter details in via the accessible computers available to customers. Printed out boarding passes and baggage tags and took bag to bag drop counter. Very easy. Airline boarded fast, row 26D, good seat. The new addition of the in-seat tv's are great. Select anything you wish for, and used the in-seat messaging service which was great with a friend sitting 4 rows away. Was a lunchtime flight, shame no wines only softdrink and juice or tea/coffee but meal was good. No complaints as seat was comfortable and well padded given I have soft tissue injuries.

### "food was good"
Melbourne to London via Dubai. The crew on the Dubai to London leg were incredible in contrast to the Australian based crew from Melbourne. I had more engagement on the seven hour flight Dubai - London (of which three hours were spent sleeping) than on the 14hr Melbourne to Dubai sector. Food was good - on the Dubai to London flight where the Chinese noodle style cardboard box is served before landing, this is the snack meal. There is still a full lunch served at the start of the flight with linen and crockery. Seats are full flat though not ideal for solo travellers, with a 2x2x2 configuration meaning you have little privacy from your neighbour. As a BA Gold card holder I would still prefer to fly Qantas on Dubai to London route than BA and I still collect my BA Avios and tier points.

### "frankly disappointing"
A mediocre flight, and frankly disappointing. Living in Sydney, I fly Qantas regularly. On this occasion the crew was a let-down. The Qantas lounge in Hong Kong was superb - great ambience and had waiter-served 3-course Christmas menu. It was particularly appreciated, since I have a view of the chaos that was the boarding process at the gate downstairs. The boarding could be described, generously, as absolute shambles - disorderly and disorganised. It took at least 40 minutes for most passengers to board and 20 minutes after the gates supposed to be closed. On the flight, the service was incredibly slow, and the presence of the crew was sparse. I was seated at upper deck economy cabin, which was supposed to be quiet with ample attention from the cabin crew given the few seats. The opposite was the case on this flight. The economy cabin shares the galley with the Premium Economy cabin that is immediately in front. All trolley traffic, therefore, must first go past the economy. This proved to be very bothersome. The upper economy cabin is served by one trolley only; meal and drinks is served on one aisle, then the second aisle. If you have the misfortune of sitting on the left rear part of the cabin, too bad, you will have to wait a long time for your food even though there are only about 30 passengers in it! By the time the fellow at the left end of my row received his meal I had almost finished mine. To make matters worse, the crew was not particularly professional. It was made quite obvious to me and the rest of the passengers that the crew knew two of the passengers. One was possibly former cabin crew, and the other, possibly a very frequent flyer, whose name most of the cabin crew knew. These two passengers received extra drinks from the Premium Economy trolley, blankets and attention during the flight. These were all little gestures, and fair enough that airlines should show gratitude for loyalty. Yet, I daresay most passengers who managed to secure an upper deck seat are frequent flyers of some manner (the lady next to me was Qantas Platinum, and I had seen a few of the faces in the Qantas lounge). To have low presence and under-service the cabin while blatantly giving special treatment to passengers they knew was quite unprofessional - we also paid similar amounts for the same seats! To add insult to injury, while I was lining up at the Duty-Free at Sydney Airport I got shoulder-charged by one of the cabin crew as she left the counter, still in her uniform. No apology given. Not a good look!

### "crew were marvellous"
Sydney to New York via Los Angeles with Qantas in Business. A great flight. Qantas service is really top class. A380 is a mighty craft but the 747 from LAX to JFK was equally as good. The bed was lay flat and comfortable. The food and alcohol was excellent. The crew were marvellous.

### "disappointed with Qantas"
London to Christchurch via Dubai and Melbourne. Good on board service level but a poor choice of flight partners (Jetstar). Poor compensation in case of delayed luggage. My flight experience was good until I was put on a Jetstar flight from Melbourne to Christchurch. One would expect that independent of the flight partner you'd be boarding with, the quality would be the same. It couldn't be less true. Poor seat comfort on this Jetstar flight (which causes the 4/5 points on seating comfort, as Qantas has 5/5). Worse was my experience after delayed luggage, which came 50hrs late, compromising my travel plans. Until 36hrs after landing I had still no clue whether I would ever see my stuff again, which was essential for my hiking trip. Qantas has so far been unwilling to provide any significant compensation for losing 2 days of my holidays (Jetstar has offered to pay for my spare tooth brush). I'm disappointed with Qantas.

### "not worth paying business class"
Flew Qantas business class by points upgrade from Perth to Auckland. The first disappointment was that Qantas used an A330 with the old style business class seats which was a questionable decision since you would think for passenger comfort on an overnight 6 hour flight they would use the newer style lie flat seats. The old style seats were just bigger and had more recline. Qantas really needs to improve on the standard of the their food especially in business. I had a crumbed snapper fillet which was barely better than the supermarket crumbed fish. The salads on the side were almost inedible. The breakfast service was canceled before the captain kept on saying more turbulence is expected, although there were only a few minutes of moderate to heavy turbulence. although I guess this isn't the pilot's fault as safety was still the first priority. Overall I would recommend that it was not worth paying for business class in cash, but if it's a point upgrades I may still be worth it for you.

### "has picked up its game"
I am a longtime flyer of Qantas and have to say that Qantas has picked up its game on the Domestic side of things. Boarding our flight out of Perth, we were greeting by enthusiastic, accommodating staff. The meal service was prompt and the salad was better than one I could prepare myself. It's also pleasing to have lighter options on offer instead of the usual stodge. During the meal service, my husband and I overheard an exchange between a dissatisfied customer and staff - all handled promptly and with professionalism in our opinion. The flight to Tokyo was a little bit different. Having high expectations after excellent domestic service, I was dismayed to see a dated aircraft that unfortunately was not properly cleaned from the flight before. The crew were more subdued and lacking enthusiasm and it was back to the usual stodge for the meals. Unfortunately as well, I am a bit of a nervous flyer, and I find the announcements from the pilot helpful when there is going to be turbulence. After four hours of bouncing around, the pilot finally addressed the cabin. While I know they are busy and focused, a little reassurance makes a lot of difference and looking around - I know I am not the only one. That being said - of course will fly again.

### "food was below average"
My wife and I flew Qantas Airways from Mel to Singapore on the way to New Delhi. It has been 10 years since I last flew with QF. Cabin crew seem much more polite and attentive than a decade ago. However, much needs to be done to improve the quality of service. Food was below average, very limited drinks are offered, and no proper tray given with the meal. Seats were very uncomfortable and aircraft needs a wipe over. I will not describe the status of toilets, they definitely need to pay attention to cleanliness. Good selection of IFE.

### "cardboard box served meal!"
Melbourne to London via Dubai. We bought our ticket with points so won't be too critical. We were picked up on time and dropped off. No problems getting through customs and went to the lounge as we arrived early (as we usually do) enjoying the food and wine. Seated (13A/B) in the first section of business where we were last year. Handed our menus for late supper took off on time. The flight was uneventful as one would hope, however when our supper arrived it was sent back - something like a cold hamburger was served and there was really nothing else on the menu that I preferred so I settled for a salad and roll. I must admit the crew were apologetic but that's about all - my expectations about Qantas started to dive. We were served breakfast which was much better. The Dubai to London leg started to restore my faith in Qantas only to be let down (not by the crew who were first class) but by a Neil Perry cardboard box served meal, I don't know of any airline that serves business class passengers a cardboard box. Come on Qantas I know you can do better than that, the meal was tasty. Arrived London on time and taken by the chauffeur to our hotel all with very seamless. Again Qantas, think about the box.

### "mediocre cabin/seating layout"
QF2 scheduled to depart LHR at 2035 on 13 December left the gate at 0030. The management of the delay was an embarrassment. No announcement was made in the First Class Lounge (Orwellian term that one), so the innocents all filed down to the gate as per the TV screen, only to find an Emirates flight. Unlike the Qantas staff, the Emirates team were well aware that the flight wasn't going anywhere. Back in the lounge, the departure time kept getting put back in hourly increments. To add insult to injury, not even a glass of champagne on boarding the J Class cabin. Finally Dubai, where despite the disaster of connecting flights, only one security screening land for 200 people. What is really irritating is that you are paying top dollar for a mediocre cabin/seating layout, less than average IFE, and staff who behave as if it is all to be expected.

### "crew are always excellent"
QF 171 service from MEL to WEL. Fast check in. QANTAS international Lounge in MEL good. Tasty and fresh breakfast offering. Welcomed on board by friendly and professional Purser who always knew what to do. Departed on time. Delicious lunch, ice cream, chocolates and drinks. Good IFE. QF JetConnect crew are always excellent and there was no exception on this flights. Flight arrived on time to WEL and bags out fast. Very good operation.

### "premium product is rubbish"
Qantas A380 must be one of the only mainstream carriers to not have horizontal lay flat beds these days. The seats on the Qantas A380 seats have not been upgraded since introduction in 2008. I had the misfortune to be routed on a Qantas A380 via a Finnair ticket. As reward for "being one of Qantas "most valued customers" I had the misfortune of sitting next to a mother and irritable infant. Initially the CSM advised that he would move me to an alternative seat for which I was understandably grateful, only to be informed later that "I was not going to be happy" when he told me the passenger he thought was on a staff ticket was also a Qantas Platinum  PAX. An understatement. Just what any business traveller needs after paying for a premium ticket. It would appear that the Qantas system is so unintelligent that it is unable to recognise when its "most valuable customers" are seated next to mothers and infants. The premium product is rubbish in so many regards. Most Asian carriers Particularly CX and SQ are in a completely different league to QF - sad but true. Forgot to mention also that the flight was late and as a consequence, I only just made a connection to NZ. Use our 1st class lounge and enjoy an relaxing shower in Sydney" is Qantas code for race through the SYD terminal when our flights are late and you've had no sleep on premium ticket from Europe and arrive at the gate with a heart rate of 180 feeling clammy and hungry!

### "nothing could be done"
Most recent experience on Qantas Airways, QF15, Brisbane to LAX, Business Class on 2 Dec 2015. I made reservations for 2 business class tickets some 11 months ago and selected seats 3D and3E on what was sold to me as their new "A380 business class product" on a brand new configured 747-400. 3 days before departure I went online and found that we had been reseated in aisle seats in 2 different rows. I called Qantas and was told that we were reallocated with no plausible explanation. I was told that this would be their new A380 product. When we got to the airport and checked in I asked the check-in agent about the aircraft, she told me the flight was being operated by an old 747 that was not refurbished. We proceeded thru customs and security and went to the Qantas Lounge to find that it was completely packed with not one single seat available for use. We were told 3 separate times that our flight was boarding, the original time of boarding at 10.15 came and went then we were told 10.45 and then 11.00, the actual time was after 11.30. Onboard the seat controls worked sporadically, the stained and worn seat had little if any padding, when I brought this to the attention of the flight crew they offered to put on a pad (they call it a mattress) on it. This did little to alleviate this discomfort. The meal was a pork chop consisting of a piece of meat that could not be cut and wen I asked for a salad they told me they had run out. The breakfast offered some 10 hours later was even worse with stale breads and hard. The crew told me that the IVOD system was broken and that nothing could be done. After I sent the breakfast tray away I asked if I could simply have a cup of tea with milk, some 20 minutes later they brought the same coffee I had already sent back.

### "recommend Business Class"
I booked Economy Brisbane to Sydney and then Premium Economy from Sydney to Hong Kong on 10 December to try Premium Economy and fly the A380 for the first time but I had also registered for an upgrade to Business (at the cost of 25,000 QFF points) and I was granted this. You made a 20-year QFF veteran very happy. I don't think I will ever be able to go back to Economy for a long haul flight ever again. So much space, I didn't know what to do with it! Being called by my name by pleasant flight attendants, a table cloth, nice tasty food, non-stop drinks, proper head phones, amenities kit with socks and toiletries, back massaging options, the list goes on. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft, really quiet and there was hardly any turbulence. I thought the selection of movies was disappointing - there was a lot to select from, but I had either seen them or wasn't interested in the rest. I should have also caught an earlier Brisbane to Sydney flight (minimum 2 hours not 1 hour 25 minutes). I walked straight onto the connecting bus to the International terminal and it was quick getting through immigration but security was very congested with long lines, so there was no time for any duty free shopping or dawdling to the gate (also don't forget about daylight saving if you are from Queensland). I had to walk quickly and boarding was already occurring when I got to the gate but the Business Class line for the upper level of the aircraft had hardly anyone in it. Once on board, there was a delay in pushing back and the Captain kept everyone informed of what was exactly was going on (this is welcomed instead of being vague). Being one of the first off the plane in Hong Kong was great, but there was a lengthy wait for my bag (probably not the fault of Qantas), where you start to fear that your bag never made the flight, but it eventually appeared on the baggage carousel. I would recommend Business Class on the A380, if you ever get the opportunity or want to pay for it.

### "massively improved"
Having been on the SYD-LHR via DXB run five times this year on mostly Qantas metal I am a bit biased, as a QFF, but feel able to comment. Have sat in all cabins save first. What is noticeable is the soft skills in Qantas compared to EK. Meals are also a common criticism made of Qantas. Frankly I do not want a full meal at 2.25am when QF1 leaves DXB for LHR. A snack will suffice. This last trip which involved QF 1&2 over a 5 day trip was pretty much spot on with where Qantas is now. Massively improved from a few years ago. Cabin service was friendly and helpful. To those who keep grumbling about FA's, well smile at them and say please and thank you. Much to complain about on this last trip? Not really. In the economy cabin from London to Dubai on QF 2. The pax nearby was moaning about breakfast being a date muffin. Well we had been served dinner around four hours earlier after leaving London so not sure scrambled eggs would have been the go. Horses for courses. Being a QFF I am biased but these days a very satisfying airline to fly with.

### "antiquated entertainment"
Hong Kong to Sydney with Qantas. I transferred from a new Cathay Pacific Boeing 777 to an old, non-refurbished Qantas A330 and the difference was horrid. The A330 smelled, stained seats, very cramped and an antiquated entertainment system. On the positive side the crew were great and the enhanced meal portions in economy gratefully received. Please Qantas, remove these ancient beasts from the longer haul international flights.

### "extra room was great"
Flew Auckland to Washington, the first two legs from Auckland to Sydney and Sydney to Dallas/Ft Worth with Qantas. I booked extra legroom seats in the small economy cabin on the top deck for my flight to Dallas from Sydney. This was a really good value purchase and the extra room was great. Managed to get a decent amount of sleep, crew were great, offering water, prompt service and really friendly. The return flight Dallas to Sydney was up against headwinds so took over 17 hours, my longest ever flight. A great selection of movies and TV options as well, once again, as great service made this flight not seem so long. Neither of the long haul flights were full which probably helped, but I was impressed with comfort, service and entertainment. The shorter flights with Qantas and their US partner American Airlines could best be described as functional. They got me from A-B not much more.

### "the service was perfunctory"
We travelled from Sydney to New York and return in business with Qantas. On all legs one could only say the service was perfunctory. The cabin staff were either almost mute or in the case of one individual excessively talkative. There is no charm or sense of energy in what seems to be a deliberate attempt to make the staff as colourless as possible. At the beginning of the flight the flight service director comes to each passenger to introduce themselves and to engage in robotic conversation. I am generally a good sleeper however I found the beds to be uncomfortable despite the overlay which made the 14 hour legs a lengthy experience. One positive was the food and beverages where the selection was attractive and the quality high. In our view Qantas is not in the same league as its Asian and Middle Eastern competitors and the lack of profitability of its international services is easily explained by the quality of its not inexpensive product.

### "very well looked after"
Qantas from London to Sydney via Dubai and Singapore. Check in, IFE, meals and service left a lasting impression and I was very well looked after. I was grateful to Qantas crew for upgrading me on the Dubai to London sector. By far the best flights I have ever experienced. Qantas lounges in Singapore /Sydney and Emirates lounge in Dubai made for a relaxing start before each flight. Qantas take pride in displaying Australia's finest wines. I can't recommend them more highly.

### "really gone downhill"
Qantas from Brisbane to Los Angeles. It was apparent prior to boarding at BNE that this was a very full flight. Upon boarding the cooling system wasn't working and we sat in the plane, melting, for about 20-30 minutes until we were given clearance for take off. Even after take off, it took a while cool down. It was a very long 13 hours to LAX. The IFE had to be re-booted 3 times and the USB ports didn't work. The food was below average even for economy and the seats were terribly uncomfortable. One of the older FA's almost dropped food all over my partner and at one stage he didn't even stop to listen to a simple request. Qantas has really gone downhill.

### "don't use non refurbished aircraft"
Jakarta to Sydney with Qantas. Last minute aircraft change to a non refurbished A330 with angled Skybeds. Not happy, as there is no room to put anything and the most uncomfortable business class seat/bed around. We went to Jakarta 3 days earlier and were impressed with the business class suites and then on the way home this happened. Also the AVOD was pretty ordinary - had some issues with the controls not functioning. Luckily it was a quick flight. Service and food was fine, but please Qantas don't use these non refurbished aircraft on long haul routes!

### "I think we'll just give up on Qantas"
Flew Qantas Airways from Melbourne to Hong Kong, we never expect that much with Qantas but this was flight was an all time low. When we travel economy we choose to sit at the back of the plane as we prefer the two by two configuration. The downside to this is your are served your meal last. This was not an issue, what was an issue was having the option of cold chicken salad, or cold chicken salad, as the other two options had run out. The improvements to Qantas's food was evident through the new menu options and size of everyone's meals, yet this was somewhat irrelevant to us as we ate nothing as we were unable to order what we wanted from the menu nor have any choice whatsoever (not wanting a 'cold' chicken salad). I realize this all sounds petty, but when you are traveling eight hours or so, you expect a 'hot' meal and a 'choice' of which hot meal, especially considering these meals cost the airline $2-$4 per passenger. Compare this to our Emirates flight from HK to Dubai where breakfast was fresh fruit, danish, tea/coffee, and warm croissants that we're offered throughout the meal time. In addition, the airplane interior was terribly dated, terribly dirty with the entertainment system at least 10 years old and 1/2 the size of Emirates entertainment systems. We really try to support our national carrier choosing this flight above other 'cheaper' flights (Royal Brunei, Malaysian, Air India) but they do make it hard to do. As Qantas have and continue to 'outsource' many jobs overseas I think we'll just give up on Qantas from now on as they have given up on so many of their loyal workforce.

### "new business class seats"
Sydney to Jakarta with Qantas. Refurbished A330 featuring the new business class seats and brings Qantas into line with other carriers. Not a big fan of the Skybeds even on the A380, but these new seats are excellent. Qantas needs to consider upgrading the A380 and B747. Service was excellent as was the food. The only issue albeit small are: need salt and pepper shakers, and nibbles with the drinks should be in a bowl not a packet.

### "has got more to learn"
Overnight Qantas flight from HKG to SYD with new refurbished A330. Cabin was clean, the seat pitch was pretty awful that when the person in front of me reclined, I can barely move. They got some sort of net footrest which I found to be useless. Powerpoint and USB charger available. Welcome drink served after take off, however no hot towel provided. IFE was good, unlike my previous experience with Qantas. The screen was pretty large and also touchscreen. Plenty of films available. I ordered Lacto-ovo vegetarian diet and the food served was quite good: vegetable pasta for dinner and scrambled egg + baked beans for breakfast. The concept of providing meal in plastic bag is very efficient, I can just chuck everything in the bag when I finished my meal and fold my tray table immediately. Qantas also provided 3 choice of meal for those who would like to pick from the standard meal choice. Except one Asian lady, all other FAs was disinterested, never smile and seems like they are being forced to do their job. M&M chocolate, pretzels and apples were offered to passenger who were awake during the night. No hot towels were distributed throughout the flight, No wi-fi availble. Overall, I can see some improvement from Qantas, however comparing Qantas to Asian or Middle Eastern airlines, Qantas still has got more to learn. The only reason I flew with them is because Emirates doesn't operate HKG-SYD route, otherwise I'd rather go with Emirates. Same price with a better service.

### "worth every extra $"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. Exit row window seat with extra storage bin was a fabulous seat. Premium economy worth every extra $. Flight attendants were friendly, attentive and helpful on this overnight flight. Got 6 hours of sleep. Entertainment system worked and easy to navigate. Connecting Qantas 747 flight from JFK was running late - they made up time and it was a seamless transfer to the A380 to Melbourne.

### "service was impeccable"
Flew Sydney to Wellington return. As a regular Trans-Tasman traveller, Qantas has never ceased to disappoint. I chose the seats beforehand (front aisle, using One World Sapphire status) and took advantage of Q-Eats, which allowed me to choose meals before the flight. I opted for a Beef salsa in smoky-BBQ sauce and assorted vegetables. Check-in was available online. Inexplicably (and somewhat irritatingly) this is only available on a desktop and not on the app or on any mobile devices. If you try to check-in on a mobile devise, it will instruct you to check-in at the airport (which closes 90 minutes before the flight!). Because I didn't have to line up, owing to British Airways Silver (equivalent to Qantas Gold), I can't comment on the efficiency of service - there is rarely anybody in those lines. But there wasn't a lot of people queueing in the Economy lines. The service on the way there and back was impeccable,  food was generous and tasty. On the return leg Q-Eats was not available; but I chose a warm dish of Hoki on a bed of couscous. The only criticism is the seats, which, at 17.2" wide, is on the stingy side. On the last returning flight I sat next to a solidly build rugby player, and it was truly a struggle to sit comfortably without simultaneously being squeezed towards the aisle and bumped by the trolley as it goes past.

### "would fly Qantas any time"
Sydney to Singapore and return to Santiago de Chile via Sydney. Both legs in Business on an A330 and also in the flight to Santiago on a Boeing 747. Overall, a nice, but dated, hard product, compared to the one offered by LAN on their new Boeing 787. Flight attendants were attentive and the food was tasty. Good wines and beers, but the IFE needs to be modernized. I haven't flown their A380, but I suposse is much better. All flights were on time and the Business lounge in Sydney is comfortable and allowed me to take a shower, which is highly appreciated. I would fly Qantas any time.

### "scored an exit row seat"
A good Qantas flight. Short 2.5 hour flight from Cairns to Darwin, managed to do it in 2 hours. Had the option of pasta or tuna salad, opted for the tuna and was very nice. Lindt chocolates afterwards and a couple of wines. Good crew, some nice food in the Cairns Qantas Club beforehand. Don't mind the Boeing 717's, scored an exit row seat, but ok in ordinary seats too.

### "the boxed meal service"
My first hot meal with the boxed service. I'm not sure what the point of this new catering is, except Qantas cost cutting. The meal itself was nice, lamb curry with rice and roti. The only other choice was potato salad with ham. Usual chocolate and ice-cream served later. Snacks also given when ordering wine. Good service with Qantas. While Qantas claim they will clear your tray quicker, this didn't happen. They also claim meals are bigger, but it seemed the same size as their previous offerings. Serving a soggy box is not the standard I expect with this airline. If you cannot manage proper full service on a four hour flight, there is no real point in flying them.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew Qantas from Sydney to Los Angeles for holiday. Although the I prepurchased extra leg room, in this aircraft I'm not sure that I needed to. The seats were comfortable. Meals were lovely and served by smiling friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble. I'm looking forward to my next long haul flight with them.

### "gluten free ... flavour free"
London Heathrow to Dubai with Qantas, and booked exit row for more leg room and very glad for the 7 hour flight. Seat good and some cabin crew very friendly. The guy in our area did not crack a smile the whole time and did not engage with the passengers, unlike others we observed. Food was terrible. I could not cut the dried up chicken in my plate. Runny mashed potatoes. Breakfast was a muffin. My partner had ordered a gluten free meal and that was gluten free as well as flavour free. Why do airlines serve margarine not butter in gluten free meals? There was no gluten free muffin or anything for breakfast. Why do airlines provide gluten free passengers with a sealed water drink but no gluten free people get orange juice? Oranges and butter do not contain gluten. I have been a Qantas frequent flyer for more than 20 years and this was the worst Qantas flight I've ever been on.

### "2x4x2 seat configuration great"
The direct flight and schedule times were very good, but I didn't enjoy the food and glad I took some healthy snacks onboard. The entertainment that was listed for the flight on the Qantas website was different onboard the plane and they didn't have a few of the movies that were listed as going to be played. The cabin crew were okay, but nothing outstanding about the on board service. I thought the 2x4x2 seat configuration on the plane was great as my husband and I had two seats together - without a third person you can relax a bit more. The seat comfort was average but you can't really expect too much in economy. No amenities provided apart from a pillow and blanket. I have flown with Qantas six times this year, the main reason I select this airline is because the flight times and connections are usually very good. They are not a bad airline to fly with, the onboard service and food lets them down a bit compared to other airlines.

### "wouldn't choose premium economy"
Qantas premium economy seats. We sat in a twin cabin configuration and there were only 4 passengers in the cabin. Service was great and seats comfortable. Return leg was in single configuration cabin with a full load. Service was lazy on the return leg and and the staff seemed totally disinterested. Have flown this return trip twice this year and wouldn't recommend it as the staff couldn't care less. Zero vote for Qantas staff service. The food and wine was very acceptable for what is really just an economy class cabin with slightly larger seats. Overall after two trips in the cabin, I wouldn't choose to fly in Qantas premium economy again.

### "overall a pleasant experience"
Melbourne to Cairns via Brisbane. A smooth and easy journey, with both legs on Qantas Boeing 737-800 aircraft with newish interiors, including seatback IFE. The legroom was a bit tight for me (188 cm tall), but otherwise the seats were comfortable. Online check-in and the automated bag-drop at Melbourne airport were quick and easy. Some issues beyond Qantas' control resulted in the second flight operating 25 mins late, and me being bumped from my booked seat. On both legs a small but tasty snack was served -- but on both legs by the time the trolley got to about Row 24 there was only one choice available. However, overall a pleasant experience.

### "please improve food and aircraft"
Singapore to Sydney flight with Qantas was delayed 45 minutes. Was quite surprised dinner wasn't served. A very dry chicken puff pastry and a kit Kat was served as a snack on a 8 hour overnight flight. No welcome drinks served. Very old aircraft, the IFE was bad with a tiny screen, the most uncomfortable seat I've been on. Breakfast was served with just one main option (scrambled eggs, tomato and baked beans) or a fruit salad with a cherry muffin and juice, tea/ coffee. I'd never fly with Qantas again. Qantas please improve your food service and aircraft.

### "best airline we've flown"
Los Angeles to Cairns via Sydney. During a 3 week trip to Australia and New Zealand we took at least 9 trips on different Qantas aircraft. We always had wonderful service, friendly staff, good food including yummy ice cream and chocolates, clean bathrooms, and modern aircraft including the A380 and Boeing 737. We especially loved the A380 which was roomy and did not feel crowded even with 482 souls onboard. Boarding and deplaning was seamless. Puts American legacy airlines to shame. Best airline we've flown!

### "left feeling disappointed"
I flew Qantas from Melbourne to London via Dubai return. Having not flown Business on a Qantas long-haul flight for some time, I have been left feeling disappointed. Of all the things that stick out in my mind, it is the poor service of the Business class crew. Maybe my expectations were off but at no point was I made to feel special. Examples include only 75% of the cabin being offered the bed turn-down service - I'm not sure why I and a few others were excluded from this. Being handed a bottle of water while the crew was looking and talking to someone else (I found this particularly rude). It was just about shoved in my face. Not having my meal order being taken while the person directly beside me did, and then being told by the crew "oh your order isn't on the list I assumed you weren't eating, let me see what I can do" as if she was doing me a favour! These are all small insignificant things, but when you drop $7K+ on a flight you expect better. The seat is comfortable enough, although I note Qantas has a 2-2-2 config versus Emirates 1-2-1. The interior of drab cabin colours aren't particularly appealing either for a 22 hours of flying. No WiFI (which I can live without, yet other airlines have it). Inflight entertainment was satisfactory, but Qantas policy doesn't allow you to bring out the screen until you are in the air. Based on my experience I will certainly not be choosing Qantas again for long haul flights. If you can get an Emirates flight for the same or similar price then you'd be mad not to go with Emirates.

### "quiet trip back to Brisbane"
QF7973, 1 November, Townsville-Brisbane. Mobile check in. As always Qantas staff at Townsville check in very helpful put it down to tropical life style. Aisle seat near rear of plane, middle seat empty. Quiet trip back to Brisbane arriving about 20 minutes early. Offered a wrap to eat but declined saying was Gluten-Free. The cabin staff member immediately said she had GlutenFree biscuits at the back of plane and went and got me 2.

### "Short quiet flight"
Brisbane to Townsville with Qantas. Mobile check-in and aisle seat near back as requested. Short quiet flight, when breakfast was served the male cabin crew offered me special meal. At the time I thought it was strange as usually say you ordered GlutenFree meal being coeliac. My instinct made me check ingredients, and wheat in cereal. On return trolley run said to cabin crew I might have someone else's meal but will just eat apple. Not a problem for only short flight. About 15 mins later, without requesting, cabin crew brought me a good size fruit platter.

### "biggest issue is the food"
Qantas from Melbourne to London via Dubai is a nice service. The crew are efficient and friendly. The upper deck on the 380 is excellent and seat is private - as a flat bed it works well, though there still is a slight angle to it and you feel like you can never quite get totally comfortable. The entertainment system is fine. The biggest issue with this flight for me is the food, or the lack of it. As has been mentioned before, it's 1.5-2 hours into the flight before supper is served. That's too long. To add to this, breakfast is not served until 11-12 am Melbourne time the next day. I went to the galley to ask for a snack and while I got what I was after (a tub of yoghurt) the staff looked at me like it was a strange request. On the whole, the food itself and the service of it is disappointing. For a paying business class passenger, it isn't up to standard compared to other airlines. If the food service could be upgraded, I'd recommend this flight.

### "breakfast in a soggy cardboard box"
Perth to Sydney on an early morning flight in Economy class. The breakfast was delivered in a soggy cardboard box. I really thought Qantas was better than that. Requested a blanket - and still waiting for it! Qantas is going downhill.

### "seat was comfortable"
Good flight. Aircraft was old, but Qantas maintain their fleet well. I unfortunately flew on the non-refurbished A330 from Qantas. Seat was comfortable and leg room was quite good as well. Food was great. The flight was around 8pm and we were given dinner and breakfast before landing in Sydney. The staff were friendly.

### "FA's were smiley and courteous"
Quick check in with a pleasant and helpful agent. Onboard, the aircraft was bright and well appointed. Seat was reasonably comfortable for economy but the AVOD controls embedded in the armrest was a nuisance. IFE had a good choice of latest movies and TV shows and the screen was a decent size. What amazed me the most was the inflight service with 3 choices for lunch served with complementary beer and wine. Food was tasty and portions were good. It was followed by coffee and chocolates. This is something North American carriers have abandoned in their domestic service and they sure can learn a thing or two from Qantas. FA's smiley and courteous. Overall a terrific experience in economy class with Qantas Airways.

### "incapable of handling a crisis"
Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles. First leg on an A380-800. Check in good and smooth, the Qantas lounge in Melbourne reasonable but nothing exceptional. An hour before departure flight was announced as delayed by 3 hrs. However this was just the start, and delay was prolonged to 10 hrs. Lounge staff were rude and incompetent in handling delay. Just shrug their shoulders with answer we don't know. Customer Service Manager on board no better. Upon arrival on to LAX, had been booked on a Delta flight that was supposed to leave 24 hrs later. Point blank refused to accept this and kicked up a fuss to be put on a red eye. Food onboard not bad. Good IFE. When it goes wrong with Qantas it really goes wrong. Staff completely incapable of handling a crisis.

### "good cabin crew"
Qantas from New York to Melbourne via Los Angeles operated by a B747-400. Checkin at JFK was swift fast and polite. Boarding process good. Good cabin crew. Excellent meals with tasty pork dish on JFK-LAX sector. Boeing 747s had updated A380 interior. Flights on time. Good IFE. Had a spare seat next to me which made trip more comfortable. If it goes well it clicks well with Qantas, but if not it is a disaster.

### "update with entertainment"
I didn't realise a Qantas domestic flight would be so different to international. I had a 4.5 hour flight with no entertainment system to speak of unless you had very good long distance vision. I thought the days of a monitor for all to watch was long gone in the distant past. My headphones were useless as they wouldn't connect in the seat socket. I was given another set but same problem. I couldn't lip read as monitor was to far to see well enough. The breakfast was a congealed hard fried egg on bacon, maybe an omelette would of at least looked better. Nothing was good about the experience. I think Qantas needs to get up to date with entertainment systems, people have much higher expectations now days.

### "crew happy and professional"
Qantas Crew were happy and professional on this flight from Sydney to New York JFK. Meals served in china dishes like Premium Economy on other airlines, and the bar service offered top end spirits. Snacks were available through the flight. I had Seat 24A on the upper deck, and it has the best legroom. On the way back I was 25B and noticed the only fault when the person infront reclines it makes it very tight. On both trips the head flight attendant came through the premium cabin and introduced themselves after take off, and before landing seeking feedback and thanking passengers. They need to get wifi.

### "a great experience"
Premium Economy on Qantas from Hong Kong to Sydney. The extra leg room makes the world of difference. Comfortable seats with great recline. The seats in front in recline do come a long way back - but I didn't see it as a big issue. Nice pillow and blanket. Food was good - they'd run out of salads for my partner, so they fetched one from business class. Service was good, although our FA lacked a little warmth, didn't see her smile at all. Priority check-in and boarding appreciated. The Hong Kong lounge is one of the best and just fantastic. All in all, a great experience. Would happily fly Premium Economy again for the right price.

### "poor slow cabin service"
Flew with Qantas from Singapore to Brisbane. Poor slow cabin service, waited over an hour for a drink not even any water. After receiving food there then was a never ending wait for tray to be cleared. Crew seemed to be like headless chickens. On an 8 hour over night flight most people I think need to be fed and watered and then sleep. What made it worse was the fact we couldn't book seats 24 hours before which we were informed we could. Also really old plane.

### "flight was uneventful"
The first leg of the journey was great, as the JFK-LAX flight was only half full and I got to switch to an empty middle row to sleep for a bit. The cabin crew were very relaxed and friendly - most likely due to the lack of passengers. I don't remember if a meal was served, but most likely a snack was given. The second leg, LAX-SYD, wasn't quite as great - the plane was really full, the cabin crew weren't as friendly or approachable. Usually when I step onto a Qantas flight, I already feel like I'm back home in Aus but it wasn't the case here. I had also asked about an upgrade to premium economy at the desk for this part of the journey but was told it'd cost me around 4 or 5 thousand dollars, even though that's almost the same price as a return prem-econ flight from SYD-LHR. I wasn't happy to be tersely turned away, considering I was willing to pay for an upgrade. The flight was uneventful, and it's the first time I've been let down by Qantas, so I'm still going to recommend the airline, especially as it's one of the safest. As much patriotic pride as I have for Qantas, I won't be flying with them for my next international flight. I've heard other airlines have far better services for a lower or equal price, so a bit of shopping around won't do me much harm for my next few flights.

### "packed in like sardines"
What is the point of a big spacious plane if you are just packed in like sardines? The seat is ok but there is just too little space between rows? That flight requires 24 hours in the care of QF. Two meals of incredible tasteless stodge and 3 "wraps" which are mysteries wrapped in cardboard. One nibble then binned. I got by on muesli bars which I always take and cups of tea and water. Ground service was fine except for an interesting security search at Dubai, not the fault of Qantas. My RTW fare with one world was $1000 cheaper than the same thing with the other mob. I have tried Premium economy and Business and for the money you may as well go steerage class,even if it is a bit challenging.

### "seat very comfortable"
Managed to get an earlier flight on standby from SIN to SYD and with it a chance to sample the recently refurbished business class. 1-2-1 layout the best with aisle access for all. Seat very comfortable with cloth upholstery which is a warmer finish than leather. Upholstery was a bit dirty on my seat though. Could've done with a wipe down. Footspace feels limited in the footwell when in the lie flat position. Seat width good though. IFE seemed excellent although I didn't search through a lot of it as I found something to watch quite quickly. The screen had crisp resolution and touch/swipe facility. Qantas crew service mature but professional, polite, humorous and efficient. Food not bad but if I was being picky the chicken schnitzel sandwich should use breast and not leg/thigh meat. Considering the Neil Perry name drop I'd expect more. On the whole a pleasant flight. I got a sale fare but would not normally find QF to be value for money. Flight arrived 10 mins late so pretty punctual.

### "professional, polite and efficient"
Older aeroplane even though meant to be relatively recently updated. Qantas Crew were 'mature' but professional, polite and efficient. IFE was old with not a whole lot of variety. I kept getting woken up from people walking by. The floor upstairs in the jumbo flexed a bit as people walked on it. Service to Haneda much handier than Narita. Lie flat seat in 2x2 layout. Flight arrived half hour early. I got a sale fare for business so not bad value for money however Qantas are the only carrier on the route.

### "cannot fault Qantas at all"
We were in Premium Economy both to and from London (QF9 and QF10) and cannot fault Qantas at all. Fantastic service, seat was excellent, quiet cabin and very private. Managed a fair bit of good sleep and plenty of good entertainment. Food was also very good and served on proper china with cutlery. Will never fly Economy again.

### "allocated 6 separate seats"
We purchased seats for our flight QF130 from Shanghai to Sydney in March 2015 receiving a confirmation sent by Qantas on 2/3/15. When we checked in at Shanghai Pudong Airport Monday 28/9/15, we were allocated 6 separate seats and only two seats were together There was no explanation given to us as to why we were not allocated seats which we booked and paid for well in advanced. Fortunately, the supervisor at Shanghai Check-in was helpful and reallocated new seats so we would not be separated from our children. It took over 45 minutes for the supervisor to fix the unnecessary mistake made by Qantas. This experience caused distress for our children who did not want to sit with strangers for the 10 hour journey home. One child was ill and needed help to administer medication when required and being separated from our children would’ve been inconvenient and cause undue stress for everyone. It is not acceptable for Qantas to charge us extra to book our seats ahead of the flight then not have those seats available when checking in. We requested an immediate refund for the seats that we paid for and were not allocated. Our request would be answered in 15 working days (3 Weeks) and it has been more than 5 weeks and no reply from Qantas.

### "looks a little average"
Managed to get a points upgrade to business class, which was appreciated. The A380 looks a little average compared to the 1-2-1 configurations on major rivals but the seat does become fully flat and with the mattress provided it is quite comfortable and not too hard. However, I was very disappointed with the meal service. A 9.30pm departure is hardly 'late night' but the obvious objective was to cut down dinner to 'supper' and leave everyone to sleep and/or starve until breakfast. This is the longest commercial flight in the world and at 16 hours I need some proper meals! Supper was a cut down meal with a starter of nothing but lettuce, a basic main (e.g. toasted sandwich, paella bowl) and one choice of dessert. If you are hungry after that they only have chips and biscuits - no hot snacks like many other airlines in business. Having to pre-order breakfast may save cabin crew time but it comes across as working for their convenience, not yours. The presentation, offering and options were very poor for business class. Service was OK but went missing overnight. The armrest based TV is much smaller and poorer in quality than (say) SQ and CX and just gets in the way. The flat bed was the redeeming feature, there is no way I would pay the price Qantas want for this flight for what is above average but not exactly amazing quality.

### "best domestic product in Australia"
Melbourne to Sydney on Qantas. Love the self service check in. No queues. Aircraft new with seat back entertainment. As this was an evening departure beer and wine complimentary. The meal service was dinner I had the fish curry which was nice. Arrived in Sydney on time. Really for a 1 hour flight can not complain one bit. By far best domestic product in Australia especially when you strike a new plane with seat back entertainment.

### "ipads were a stupid idea"
Sydney to Melbourne on A330-200. Check in a breeze. Aircraft was a refurbished Jetstar plane with Ipads as entertainment. Left late due to weather in Melbourne (only using one runway) and delayed in flight with hold patterns. Meal was nice lamb curry. Cabin crew were on their final leg and could tell. I think the ipads were a stupid idea. A lot were playing up and the crew were sick of the problems they kept getting with them. Should have put seat back screens in these planes.

### "quite comfy seat"
We got emergency exit seats near the back of lower deck. Excellent leg room and quite comfy seat. We had outstanding service from the flight attendant who was attentive and good humoured. The A380 is a quiet plane to fly. Qantas entertainment is good, though the touch screen a bit slow. Food was pretty good, with a choice of three main dishes. It helped that the flight was far from full. We liked the Qantas bag check-in system. Quick amd efficient. The onward Emirates flight in a Boeing 777 to Manchester was more cramped in seats with a 3-4-3 configuration, but service fine. Seems odd that at Dubai the other night there was a ten minute bus drive to the plane before take-off.

### "unimpressed by Qantas"
Qantas flight from Sydney to London via Dubai was scheduled to leave 5pm 21st October: numerous problems including temperature in cabin 38 so couldn't board, followed by failed air conditioner on ground, then when all onboard, broken water pipe. Kept on plane for 3.5 hours and then told crew could not work beyond 9.30 pm. All put off flight at 10 pm and told we'd be found hotels and taken back to airport for flight following day except there were not enough hotel beds in Sydney. Taxi vouchers and had to wake up friends close to midnight for a bed until 4.30 am when had to return to airport. No Qantas ground staff until 5.45 am and then only 2 to re check all passengers. No apology, no refreshment vouchers provided. Boarded for 8 am departure that eventually left 9.30 am after a crew member finally arrived late for work. Ground staff very rude and unhelpful. Follow up complaint to Qantas resulted in rude reply and offer of 5000 FF points! Further correspondence with airline and no response. Very unimpressed by Qantas and would from choice, not fly with them again. Customer care appears non existent and attitude was one of they just could not care less about the extreme inconvenience and disruption to essential appointments I had to cancel in London.

### "the cabin was clean"
Took Qantas QF17 Sydney to Los Angeles which leaves early evening and arrives early afternoon. Better times than the traditional earlier dep/arr for both quietness at each airport and my body clock. The aircraft was no spring chicken but the cabin was clean and in good shape. Excellent in flight entertainment, food, drinks and service. I was almost sorry when it was all over.

### "Qantas product failed"
Qantas from Singapore to Sydney in Business class. Apart from the clean shower at Singapore lounge, overly spiced food in lounge (usually good). Declined dinner onboard but couldn't sleep on uncomfortable seat/bed. Business Seat that slopes and has no room. Mediocre food. Cabin crew, friendly, attentive and the only plus. Breakfast was mediocre. When paying yourself for business, comfort counts. Qantas product failed in comparison to Swiss.

### "refuse to amend bookings "
Qantas cancel our flight and 2 months before flight refuse to amend our bookings and transfers. We access "manage your booking" to be told 2 months is too late to re-arrange our included transfer. We contact Qantas UK who say we changed our flight so we are no longer eligible for transfers. Our agent contacts them to be told our booking cannot be changed. Qantas UK Customer Service reps then say only our agents can change the booking. Reps spend 60 mins on phone to Qantas UK to be told only Qantas can make the changes. Meantime our booking shows we will be picked up at 09.00hrs for a flight departing at 07.30hrs. Qantas UK Customer Service are a nightmare and in serious need of customer care training: do not fly with Qantas- they are a nightmare!

### "Impressed with Qantas"
Impressed with Qantas on this flight from Sydney to Singapore. Refurbished plane with nice comfortable (for economy) seats. New entertainment system with large screen and plenty of content. Mature, but friendly and helpful crew. They didn't stop working the whole flight with a welcome (soft) drink, good size and quality main course, then fresh fruit, ice cream, more drinks. Before landing a choice of light meal and more drinks. Could not fault them and I feel that Qantas is making a much better effort than some years ago.

### "comfortable seats, good legroom"
Singapore to Sydney with Qantas, friendly cabin crew provided excellent service. Comfortable seats with good legroom and excellent entertainment system. A relatively new aircraft so it was clean and comfortable. The food was fresh, tasty and well presented with 3 dinner options provided. During the night they offered drinks and snacks to those not sleeping and provided a bottle of water before lights out.

### "flights were very pleasant"
Melbourne to Singapore return in economy class. Check in quick and friendly, the Qantas lounge at Melbourne airport is always a pleasant experience, we enjoyed a late breakfast and glass of sparkling wine. Also lounge in Singapore is good, excellent food but is busy and can be quite noisy. Our flights were very pleasant, spotless aircraft, pleasant crew and very good catering, for economy class it doesn't get much better. The trip however got off to a bad start . A Qantas reservations agent who we spoke to on the phone prior to the trip was arrogant and unhelpful giving us wrong information which caused us some concern before we could check in. Needless to say the check in agent put our minds at rest and apologised for the wrong and misleading information we had been given. I would rate the airport and flight experience at 9, excellent, however the appalling reservation agent, not only rude but incompetent spoiled our dealings with Qantas on this occasion.

### "flight staff friendly"
Flight departed 5 minutes early. No IFE on this aircraft. Used own iPad for entertainment. I noted many others doing the same. As flight departed mid-morning, banana cake and drinks offered. Flight staff friendly. Seat comfortable on this 1.5 hour flight. Arrived five minutes early. Bags however did not come onto belt until 20 minutes later.

### "expect business class to be consistent"
Disappointing flight I expected Qantas to do much better, given their pricing is close to much better Asian and Middle Eastern competitors. The plane was old and tired, and the IFE was poorly-responsive, resolution poorer than most good economy classes and seats were worn and uncomfortable. A seat cover mitigated some of the hardness but it was mediocre at best. Dining was also disappointing - snapper was overcooked and over salted; potatoes were dry and bland. The wine list and desserts however, were of quite a high standard. Perhaps the only saving grace was its staff - who were attentive and friendly, with just the right amount of cabin presence. Overall, if I am paying a premium to fly Qantas, I expect their business class to be of consistent standard.

### "the armrest just disappeared"
My wife and I recently returned from a two month trip to Australia and looked forward to a relaxing journey back home on Qantas. My seat was in the centre, my wife taking the window seat, and just prior to departure a late comer arrived to take his outside seat - he was absolutely huge. How he got into the seat was a guess - the result was my trip home some three hours spent with this enormous passenger legs spread out covering most of his seat and half mine - the armrest just disappeared! To say this trip was uncomfortable was an understatement - how is it the cabin staff don't see this? I'm sure this happens on other airlines, but this should not occur when passengers pay big money and expect a comfortable trip.

### "has gone downhill"
The flight was delayed 1.5 hours due to a late arrival of the aircraft and a missing passenger. Seat was comfortable with enough leg space. Service started soon after take off, everyone received a bottle water and a tasteless bickfords lemon cordial was offered. No hot towels was a bit of let down. I ordered my meal online using select on q eat ( blackmores waghu beef with mushroom sauce and polenta) but the crew forgot about it so I took the beef cheeks with bbq sauce. Bitter infused garlic bread roll looked very tacky. The food wasn't too bad loved the salted caremel chocolate mousse. Crew was very attentive. Ice cream and beef sliders with hot dog offered soon before landing. Overall Qantas has gone downhill over the years with the food compared to other carriers.

### "not be flying Qantas again"
We flew from Glasgow to Sydney via Singapore with Emirates, and on the Singapore to Sydney leg we had the misfortune to fly Qantas which turned out to be the worst flight we have been on! For a long haul flight, it was worse than a budget airline. Cramped and uncomfortable seats, fast food chucked down in a bag with plastic cutlery. Unprofessional and sloppy cabin crew, not doing cross checks when told, allowing passengers to wander about when seat belt sign on and serving breakfast far too late. Emirates were totally professional and a comfortable flight and food service. Suffice to say we will not be flying Qantas again - not a good impression of Australia!

### "unethical and unprofessional"
An overbooking policy is commonplace enough, but do not assure a full-rate paying Qantas passenger 2 days prior to her flight that you will not put her at a later flight nor downgrade her to economy due to overbooking business class, and confirmed that everything is ok the day before the flight-  only for her to rock up on check in and be told that you can offer her a later flight or a downgrade. The very thing the Qantas rep promised will not happen. What is more, a Qantas staff slipped up. After first telling me it's because I was last to check in, after several question let slip that I was earmarked to be bumped. It is unethical and unprofessional.

### "Seat was comfortable"
Flew Qantas QF28 from Santiago to Sydney in Business Class. I selected a seat upstairs on the B747. Flight was relatively empty with only half the seats occupied. Flight crew were attentive and friendly. Meal options varied and well prepared. Slight delay on departing and offered extra drinks prior to departure. PJ's provided upon boarding. Seat was comfortable offering a pleasant sleep. Many options on IFE. Great time to arrive in Sydney as immigration is empty and out of airport in 25 minutes.

### "dated and dirty first class seat"
Sydney to Hong Kong with Qantas. Friendly, experienced cabin crew even if a little unsure of whether they had aperitifs on board (they did). Old plane, with old first class still in place and I chose seat 1A, a dated and dirty first class seat from last century. Proved perfect as I have a few broken ribs but crew were excellent and the seat is better than the other Skybeds in Business Class. Food was mediocre. Veal and potato pie, heavy entree. Fish main was overcooked and rubbery with horrible potatoes, didn't finish it or have desert. Pre landing snack of noodle was pleasant. Really limited IFE. Excellent landing in typhoon affected weather. Captain kept us informed of AFL score, nice touch.

### "customer service is shocking"
I just tried to book with Qantas online, one way from Hong Kong to Melbourne. The card payment screen was not accepting Mastercard or Visa showing an error "We are having difficulty accepting the form of payment type provided". After calling the bank they said there is no error and to speak with Qantas. I called Qantas who said it's probably an error and they could book over the phone, but it will cost £110 more. When asking why I should pay more for their website error when they are the same company, I was told more people book over the phone so that's why it costs more. Customer service is shocking especially when it's their error.

### "wonderful travel experience"
A wonderful travel experience with Qantas from boarding the plane to arrival in Singapore. Although we had a slight delay when departing Melbourne, we were well informed. All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Qantas business class seats comfortable with plenty of space. Best of all, was the food, with amazing flavours and selections.

### "really tried to like Qantas"
I've really tried to like Qantas, but they really try to make that difficult. We applied for an upgrade but never heard back, despite the website promise. They had no rep at Vienna where the trip started, and Emirates (their alliance partner) couldn't access their system. We are a couple, booked together, so just for good measure they put us in different rows. Singapore Airlines welcome you with a hot towel and keeps the service coming. Qantas offers you warm cordial out of a jug Aeroflot-1970s style. This is a 12.26 hour service. The food consisted of a small chicken wrap (in a no-name box), a small packet of potato crisps and an indiscriminate assortment of edible things from different manufacturers, called dinner. It's the first international flight I've ever got off feeling hungry. The seat was broken. The flight attendant wouldn't take his hands out of his pockets as he strolled up and down the isle - never, of course, actually carrying anything. But the worst of all was that this was Grand Final day in Melbourne, and they didn't even know who had won, for heavens sake. Oh, and finally, Melbourne went onto daylight saving three hours after we arrived. They didn't bother telling us, so we've been in clock confusion again.

### "disappointed with the trip"
We flew with Qantas and usually a great experience. Not this time though from Perth to Melbourne. The plane was changed from a A330 to a smaller one. The staff were good at what they had to do on both legs of the trip. The flight back left from a different gate and we were not notified of this change. The flight was delayed before take off and once we were on the plane another 50 minutes wait. Very disappointed with the whole trip.

### "staff were pleasant enough"
Tokyo Haneda to Sydney on Boeing 747-400, and a reasonably pleasant flight. Although the cabin was refurbished and okay, the cleanliness of some areas not so good. Staff were pleasant enough, though for a night time departure they appeared to not really be with it. Took breakfast service which was good, and good portion sizes versus my last trip. Nice amenities, doona etc supplied and seat comfortable enough for 6 hour sleep.

### "crew attentive, friendly and hospitable"
I flew Qantas from Brisbane to Los Angeles and onto New York JFK, and both flights excellent. I was lucky to have an adjacent vacant seat on both flights, with no crying babies in the immediate vicinity. The cabin crew was attentive, friendly and hospitable. I did not expect to be addressed by name in an Economy cabin. IFE offers a great selection, and the food was a lot better than expected. A truly genuine Australian hospitality, and an improvement from my previous experience with Qantas a few years ago on transpacific flights.

### "Seat was average comfort and leg room"
We flew Qantas from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai (QF1) in Economy. Had flown from Brisbane to catch this flight and arrival and transit were perfect. Boarded in Sydney easily and left on time. We had window and middle seats, and aisle seat was occupied. Seat was average economy in regards to comfort and leg room - didn't expect anything different. Was able to sleep on and off the whole way to Dubai. The A380 is such a quiet and smooth plane. Have done several flights to LAX on the Boeing 747, and this is so much quieter. (Do prefer the 747 though for seat comfort and legroom though). The crew to Dubai were excellent - service was efficient, cheerful and nothing seemed to hard. Our meals were all quite tasty and we weren't left feeling hungry. Drinks were offered regularly, and wines, coffees, soft drinks were all available. Empty trays were quickly removed. Definately give that sector 5 stars. Dubai to Heathrow sector was different. The crew were welcoming and happy, but the service once in the air was not as good as previous flight. Meals were still good, but slow in coming and not quite hot enough. No wine was offered at all on this flight (which would have made the remaining 7 hours flying time more relaxing and helped sleep a bit more). Breakfast was brought around when we started descending which we thought was not well planned. Felt like we had to rush so trays could be removed before landing. No second coffees were offered - after nearly 27 hours in the air, another beverage would have been appreciated. This crew just didn't seem to be as efficient as previous crew. Would still fly Qantas when possible as we have found that the majority of flights and crew are efficient, professional and cheerful.

### "food is average, seats uncomfortable"
I regularly fly from Sydney to JFK for work and  wish I could support Qantas but their service and flight delays made me switch to the competition. I've never had a Qantas flight leave on time - this might be just bad luck on my part but delays mean that I've missed connecting flights and work delays. They cancel flights on this leg or change planes at the last minute meaning pre-reserved seats are not honoured or even worse being bumped off the flight. The worst delay I had was for 22 hours on my return leg which was frustrating. Qantas never apologise for these delays. The food is average, the seats are uncomfortable and the service is not good.

### "worst international flight I've experienced"
An archaic Qantas Boeing 747-400 on my flight from Sydney to Santiago. I had purchased exit row seating for the long haul flight, which helped. Food was appalling. Seats were not at all comfortable. Flight attendants seemed pre-occupied. As much as I would like to support Qantas, this was the worst international flight I've experienced.

### "a first for bad service on Qantas"
The Qantas staff were all smiles on boarding, we had seat 1D/F and were offered water, juice or champagne. Nice start to the journey, hot towel. Perfect, dinner selection was a lovely soup followed by a choice of 3 mains. Can't fault on the food. After dinner we had to wait some time till our tray was taken away and while we waited we were not offered a second drink with dinner or tea or coffee after dinner. Qantas went from fab to bad. The flight attendant spent most of her time hidden away in the front galley. This was a first for bad service on a Qantas flight Every time we have flown QF across the ditch the service and food has been the best we just love it.

### "old plane and really cramped seats"
Staff excellent, from check in to Qantas club where the assistant tried to locate my sun glasses from a previous flight, to serving attendants in the Club Lounge. It was my birthday and my husband mentioned this at check-in and it was excellent treatment after that. My disappointment was the old plane and really cramped seats which were the worst I have travelled in. I thought that with Qantas only recently recommencing this route after several years in abeyance, that they would have gone all out to impress and promote the service with the best planes, but this was not to be sadly.

### Qantas Airways customer review
A superb Jetconnect flight (a subsidiary of Qantas) from Melbourne to Wellington. The flight was almost full but a very personalised, friendly, efficient crew. Drinks flowed, meal service prompt, tasty and well presented. Overall a great flight. The return Wellington to Sydney flight also provided impeccable service, staff friendly and personal.

### "cabin crew was attentive and efficient"
Not a fan of the A330-200 cabin layout, with the middle seat of 3 blocked off with wasted space. Deliberately seated close to front due to previous experience seated towards back of cabin proved a wise choice. Reason for this is the drinks and meal service first. Seated at back of cabin (containing 36 seats) were being served their lunch 30 minutes before landing, I had already finished and on the second round of drinks. Cabin crew was attentive and efficient, perhaps robotic and a lot to do with 36 guests in just over an hour. Enjoyable flight

### "lucky to fly update Qantas A330"
We flew Brisbane to Perth on September 1st to connect with our flight through to Rome with Qatar Airways. We were lucky to fly on one of the updated Qantas A330s, with the new business class modules. I sat in 5A and was impressed with the quality of the new layout which has lie flat beds and a 1x2x1 layout with plenty of room, and standards practically the same as international. The service by flight attendants was first class and very attentive. The food was a selection of Neil Perry dishes with some very fine Australian wines to choose from. It seems Qantas is working hard to improve its domestic business class. I will not hesitate to fly Qantas again.

### "would definitely fly with QANTAS again"
I flew Qantas Airways from SYD-ADL with my father who needed wheelchair assistance and my mother who could not walk very fast because of medical condition. The wheelchair assistance in Sydney were great and the airline personnel was very considerate. Once on board, it was obvious that the senior crew member were very dedicated in her job. She provided pillow, blankets and a very "personal touch" to ensure one's comfort. Food was very tasty and more than 2 drink rounds were offered through out the flight. Inflight entertainment were shown over a public screen in this older aircraft. In newer aircraft, individual screens will be available. Upon arrival, the ground crew only provide wheelchair assistance up the ramp of the aerobridge and once inside the airport, it is expected that the travelling companion rendered the assistance. I would definitely fly with QANTAS again.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Qantas has varying standards of product offered on the same domestic route. Qantas currently service the east/west route with Boeing 737-800s, A330s fitted with older seats, and A330s fitted with the newest business suite. Passengers booking a business class ticket don't quite know which experience they'll get. To make it worse, while Qantas has a number of newer and updated Boeing 737s in its fleet, it regularly rosters older Boeing 737s on the east/west route. These aircraft lack video on demand and current-gen seating. As a result, the level of comfort between the Boeing 737 and A330 aircraft is further widened.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Whilst many reviews are negative, my whole experience was great. (Compared to a previous flight 5 years ago which made me hesitant). Check in and departure faultless. Plane not too full on way to LAX so could lie down. Service was very good, and amusing. Had ordered Vegetarian Meal, but on reflection would opt for regular meal next time. No amenities kit offered, but then I always take my own items so no problems. Arrival a little late into LAX but priority bag tags on luggage so transfers easy. Return to Australia however had a bit of drama, due to fog in Sydney, flight from LAX to NYC delayed, which meant about a 10 hour wait in the very boring JFK. Qantas were great and handed out food vouchers, we were informed of delay, but I was already en route to JFK. Flight change over quick when it did arrive, only to find power outage at LAX meant that pax had to be checked in manually on a list. After about 2.5 hours wait we were on our way, but again due to missed connections we flew in to Sydney instead of Melbourne and there was a super effort to get everyone home on earliest flights they could. As this whole thing was due to weather it was not Qantas fault and I thought they did a great job in the circumstances. Staff were great and service very good. Would not hesitate to fly Qantas again.

### Qantas Airways customer review
The offering in Premium Economy is quite good. Seats are comfortable and cabin service is friendly. The inflight entertainment is very good. The choice of drinks is also very favourable.

### Qantas Airways customer review
I may be biased as a Qantas FF but once again a very good level of service on QF2. Flew in the Premium Economy cabin and top rate service. It is business lite. Small touches as addressing by name..Mr X. Downsides, I was in seat 24J which is right next to the washroom so plenty of traffic coming past even though being an exit row there was nothing in front. Personal downside is that the IFE is stowed in the armrest and on the A380 service it is always nice to see take off and landing on the skycam which is not possible in PE or business. First world problems. All in all a very satisfying experience again from our national carrier.

### Qantas Airways customer review
MEL-DXB-CAI QF9, EK927 on Qantas ticket. Plane was 1 hour late leaving Melbourne, but due to passenger not boarding plane, then medical issue which weren't really in Qantas' control. It made our 2 hour connection in Dubai very tight but we and our luggage made it. QF9 had good facilities and good service. Seats were good, staff attentive, excellent range of IFE, good value for money ticket. Food was fine and staff kept bringing around drinks and snacks between meals. They just let themselves down with the little things: - only giving an amenities kit on request and not having enough (my family of 4 was only given 2 between us for a 13hr flight) - we requested on my FF profile and via the travel agent for seats in the forward section, only to be given the very back row (88) initially. When I checked in online 24 hrs before, I could only change this to row 82. EK leg to Cairo was fine, although IFE not as good as QF.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Immaculate Service all round. Although we boarded from the (noticeably) older part of T1 Tullamarine which also housed no check-in desks for economy passengers, the rest of the process was a dream. A newly refurbished cabin, fantastic service from the predominantly male crew, audio video on demand, and a choice of hot or cold dinner. The (hot) Shepherds Pie I opted for was delicious.

### Qantas Airways customer review
No wait at check in, simple bag drop. Aicraft was a refreshed A330-200 with seat back IFE. Watched the IFE then served a beef and onion pie which was quite tasty. Pretty good for a 1 hour flight. Crew were polite and could even joke and laugh with passengers. The best domestic product in Australia.

### Qantas Airways customer review
My first time flying with Qantas, I usually use BA. Due to a late booking found Qantas to be considerably cheaper. Service impecable, maybe slightly ahead of BA. Seat very comfortable, food good and IFE easy to use. Will be using on my bi-monthly trips to DXB in future. A bonus is this lands at the much nicer T3 in Dubai.

### Qantas Airways customer review
The Red Eye from Perth to Sydney on Qantas is one of the worst experiences you can imagine unless you travel with Qantas offshoot Jetstar. The seats are so narrow that even a moderate height person will have trouble getting comfortable. The cabin service, such as it that there was, was budget style at best. I found the food particularly distasteful and ordering a drink was like being treat like a pariah. Only a lack of alternative flights compelled me to fly with the company. I last flew with them about two years ago and my misgivings from that experience continue to be confirmed.

### Qantas Airways customer review
I was very disappointed with the substandard Qantas service recently. After paying $US1200 for a one way Economy ticket and a further $25 for an aisle seat, I was most irritated by lack of attention to both passenger safety and comfort]. Only two of the 4 toilets were operating (the other two became unserviceable soon after the flight departed) to cater for probably at least 80 passengers. As a diabetic, it was a pathetic attempt by Qantas to not only understand the dietary needs of diabetics but to also provide a suitable meal. At one point soon after takeoff, the Flight Attendant brought round sweetened water. I questioned him as to whether there was any sugar in it and if so how much. He was unable to tell me as he admitted he didn't know. About an hour before the main cabin's dinner was served, the Flight Attendant brought an aluminium foil covered dish and plonked it down on my tray table. No water was offered nor served at that time. That was the meal, nothing else, not even a bread roll or a fruit dessert. My fellow non-diabetic passengers had what looked like a wonderful food fare. Then when a snack came for me, it was a huge banana and a sweet roll both not suitable for non-Insulin dependent diabetics. Breakfast was barely edible but by that stage I was so irritated and tired that I had lost my appetite. One positive point I will make was that the Economy male cabin staff on that flight were attentive to me and my diabetic needs throughout the flight but they are not the ones who create the diabetic meals.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Have flown this route a few times now and always good flight. Flight is 2.5 hours, and a hot dinner is served. Beef with pasta and roast pumpkin was very nice with a bread roll followed by cheese/crackers. Scored exit row seats on this flight, plenty of room. Crew were great, very efficient and friendly, getting meals and drinks to passengers without a fuss. Flight was on time, always enjoy these night flights across the top of Australia.

### Qantas Airways customer review
I got bumped onto this from an oversold BA flight - was a blessing in disguise. The First Class product is of a very high standard - food was very good, wines excellent and the crew really are the best in the air. The cabin may not be as glitzy as some of the Middle Eastern airlines but the crew really make the difference here - a true First Class experience.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Qantas at its best in all aspects from check in onwards. A full business class cabin but the service was personable and excellent. Passengers addressed by name. A highlight is the menu on the daytime flights to Asia, a serious contrast to the awful café style menu when returning.

### Qantas Airways customer review
After getting a points upgrade to business to HKG the return in Premium was a disappointment in seat comfort only. The personable service was the same and dare I say it the Premium Economy menu (dinner and breakfast) was superior to the café style menu in Business. Agree with previous comments that space in Premium is extremely tight when the seat in front is fully reclined. Cathay have the edge in this personal space area but Qantas are in front for service and food/drink.

### Qantas Airways customer review
I was impressed with the quality of this flight. The food was excellent, better than I'm used to on airplanes, and the extremely wide selection of movies and music was enough to keep me entertained for what would normally be a grueling 16-hour flight, both there and back.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Even though the flight was only a short 35 minutes, the crew and service was great. We got Ipads to watch shows which was a nice touch, I wish they had these on all flights without an IFE onboard. I would Fly Qantas again and will continue to as I have for years.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Brisbane to Auckland on Boeing 737-800. Seated in 4F, bulkhead seat. Service onboard was a water run completed with guava juice, followed by offer of pillows and blankets. Arrival cards and newspapers offered. 3 choices of main meal, followed by ice cream and Lindt chocolate towards arrival. Flight attendants attentive throughout the flight. The New Zealand flights are operated by New Zealand flight staff and they do their job well. Bags out quickly at Auckland.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Disappointing. Check-in was slow. Old seats were hard and uncomfortable. Food was so so. Supposedly a premium airline, I don't think so.

### Qantas Airways customer review
I flew Emirates Business over to Frankfurt and I actually enjoyed this leg better. Excellent legroom, great value for money. I would fly Qantas again.

### Qantas Airways customer review
We (group of 7) were on the flight QF82 on the 19th June 2015 departing Singapore for Christchurch transit via Sydney. The ventilation on board this flight was unbearable, service was a tad below that expected of an airline like Qantas. One of our entertainment screens refuse to start, an alternative was given but wasn't useful as that would upset the seating arrangement of our friend who was already seating with her partner. Meals were not served to three of us despite everyone else getting their meals already. We had to rush through our meals as a result.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Although no direct flights from Alice Springs to Brisbane on a Friday, the overall experience went smooth for this Qantas leg. Check in at Alice Springs was quite a disaster. There were two check in staff for regular check in and two staff for priority check in. Leaving no one managing the Bag Drop Off Line. We waited for 40 mins and it was only once our flight started boarded they prioritised us to the front of the queue, thank goodness. Once on the plane it was impressive with a modern cabin and personal IFE screens. Plane arrived on time to Sydney which turned out to be peak hour. Somehow though boarding started early for the flight to Brisbane. Again modern interior and personal IFE was a great touch. A very full flight with somehow took off on time. Meal options on both legs were great and tasty. Delay coming into Brisbane but this was Air Traffic reasons therefore no indication on Qantas' performance. Another great experience.

### Qantas Airways customer review
The interior and entertainment system of the Qantas A380 are comparable with the best of other carriers and far superior to a 777 and seemingly more spacious than the old 747. There are certainly more toilets available than on Emirates for example. The first thing you notice at check in is the increase in self service kiosks previously the domain of domestic services, however ground support is swift and friendly, though it is no longer easy to get the plastic luggage bags at SYD airport. These should be readily available as in times past. Unfortunately only one main meal was served on this leg, plus what could only be described as a snack. This is really very poor meal timing which is better aligned with a shorter route of under 6 hours to expect passengers to pay a premium and then not serve two sizeable meals is really poor form.

### Qantas Airways customer review
My first time on Qantas, quite a pleasant flight, flight attendants were professional, comfort of the seat is fine with flat bed. Good entertainment program. Amenities offered are a bit simple but overall the experience was good. The only bad point is that the seat is very narrow seat for tall guys.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Primarily fly with Air NZ but based on price factor decided to take a trip this time with Qantas as also status matched my Star Alliance Gold. Perhaps I have been spoiled with Air NZ over time as a frequent flier with additional legroom in Space+ seats, but it was unbelievably cramped in economy. The food served was also average which there was no option not to pay for as with other airlines, something I like being a lower base fare. Movie and entertainment selection was good, but didn't change the comfort levels much during flight. Overall, average flight, nothing fantastic, and wouldn't change my loyalty to Air NZ anytime soon, who I feel overall have a better product on the Tasman.

### Qantas Airways customer review
My husband and I just returned from Munich to Melbourne via Dubai. We flew in Business class from Dubai and we were disappointed in all respects with the flight. The seats are not very conformtable, the television screen had to be stored away when preparing for landing, and don't mention the food, so much about Neil Perry's menu! Very poor in all respects. We haven't flown with Qantas for some time, as we frequently travel to Europe and want the most direct route. Now that Qantas fles to Dubai we thought we would try - but never again. Poor services, poor seating, poor food. Not worth the money

### Qantas Airways customer review
After flying all night from HKG to PER via SIN with a budget carrier, it was such a relief to fall asleep in a Qantas A330. Seat comfort was fantastic, food was good quality and an all around enjoyable experience

### Qantas Airways customer review
I had a faultless fight going over to LA very impressed with the 747. Going home arrive at LAX to check in to be told my wife is seated on the other side of the plane (we booked and paid for flight two months ago and seats) they found 2 seats together, got to gate I was refused 3 times to board the plane, the seat wasn't working wouldn't lay flat yet someone was in the seat the whole flight. Cabin service was the worst I have had. For $8500 a ticket it did not reflect at all what they say on there web site. It's been six years since I have flown with Qantas after another issue coming back from LA.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.

After putting up with disgraceful Emirates sub-standard service from London to Dubai, then from Dubai to Narita, we were never so happy to board our Qantas flight from Narita to Sydney. My family and I just sat back and relaxed on Qantas, following a multitude extremely rude bumbling incompetence by Emirates that saw us stranded in Dubai for almost a day. Once again the helpful, friendly and professional Qantas staff in Australia went above and beyond to resolve the Emirates problems we had encountered. Qantas staff were both on the ground and in the air very friendly and professional. Food, drinks and service excellent during the flights, the Business Class flatbeds allowed for comfortable sleep for the 9.5 hour journey. A little bit more variety with the onboard movies I think would help particularly when travelling with children, however not a bad selection overall. We have generally always flown Qantas, however with the code-sharing between Qantas and Emirates these days, sometimes you end up actually on an Emirates flight.

Sydney to Vancouver. Great legroom but if person in front reclines you also must recline, no drama but just be aware. I would like the crew to explain the features of premium economy. On our flight out we did not know that the metal footrest once fully extended then ratchets back up which allows you to have your feet and legs elevated, a great plus. Thankfully we knew this in our way home, but it wouldn't be very hard to inform passengers. Meals, crew all good. It's nice to have a direct flight to Vancouver, but sadly there are only two one month windows per year!

QF18 7July New York - LAX,  arrived to check in at airport early, approached by staff member to ask if we needed help and informed us check in open at 2.15pm. Ground staff checking in passengers  very professional. Boarding went okay and found we had seats with extra legroom. Gluten free meal and snacks given as requested, which I find good. Cabin crew seemed friendly and asked me to complete a survey. Los Angeles to Brisbane flight took off late due to being informed by pilot that passenger didn't turn up, so had to offload bags. My husband had to ask for power outlet for Cpap which had been arranged by special handling Sydney end - cabin crew thought he said extra safety belt, and she brought him that. Gluten free meal for me given and snack in a bag. Husband missed out on first drink run - didn't get asked. Just an observation of this flight as a passenger of other Qantas flights, that I noticed a big difference in customer service with American and Australian cabin crew - the teamwork appeared segregated.

QF 23, 28 June. Flight was slightly delayed as departure was from a stand away from the terminal. The transfer didn't take too long and was reasonably efficient. The A330 was pretty comfortable even in economy. The service provided by the cabin crew was excellent. Drinks and food plentiful and a welcome drink and a bottle of water was welcome! The aircraft hadn't been updated and the inflight entertainment was showing its age in terms of screen size, choices and navigation.

Flew into Sydney on June 14, 2015 on QF42 and departed Sydney to Christchurch on June 24, 2015 on QF139. Flew back to Jakarta via Sydney on QF138 and QF41 on June 29, 2015. The flights were all smooth. Crews on Jakarta - Sydney sector VV were senior but they were very nice and courteous. My family and I flew QF 41 and 42 last year and we felt the same aircraft was used (A330). What we disliked most was the TV monitor which looks decent and small and AVOD selection (no asian songs). I guess we do not get any amenities like used to. Toilets only provide liquid soap. As for food and beverages, I can not complain. On Sydney - Christchurch sector VV, there were only three cabin crews serving more than one hundred passengers. The crews looked young. They tried their best to serve, 10 minutes before landing ice cream was still being distributed. Customer Service Manager informed me that they were short of crews and apologized if they could not give me water. On Sydney - Jakarta leg, all cabin crews worked extremely hard to please us.

At Melbourne used the Business Lounge. Pre-departure drinks after boarding, and after departure a refreshment was served of turkey sandwich, rice salad with salmon and soup. Our aircraft had IFE and BSI, which made the experience even better.

DXB-MEL, 12.5 hrs, second leg of CAI-MEL on Qantas ticket but first leg operated by Emirates. Qantas web site wouldn't do online check-in since first leg with Emirates so had to do it on Emirates web site, which wouldn't let me alter DXB-MEL seats. Aircraft new and well kept with comfortable seating. Boarding was fine and departure on-time. Although seats quite close together for such a long flight the leg room was good due to IFE being kept out of the way. Meals were pretty good and staff came around offering snacks and drinks regularly. IFE excellent - I found a good range of films and my kids were kept happy for the whole flight as well. They did most things well, but a few little things let them down: - Not enough immigration forms for all passengers. (Honestly, they know the number of pax on a flight, it can't be that hard) - When I asked for an amenities kit about 1.5 hrs before landing, they told me they had run out. - Flight path maps weren't working so it was hard to tell where we were. (Data like eta, altitude, were working) If they could fix these simple things, it would be a great flight experience for a price below Qatar, Emirates and Etihad.

Flew from MEL to Cairns on QF702 and returned 2 weeks later on QF703, both flights on B737-800's with the entertainment screens on the seat backs. Qantas gets its fair share of criticism but these two flights were absolutely faultless, leaving on time and arriving a few minutes early. The cabin crews were cheerful and provided good service. Inflight meals and snacks were fine (as good as you can expect in these times of cost pressure) and the entertainment system on these newer planes is as good as any. Compliments to Qantas on the product which should get praise.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Flew on a new Qantas 737-800 with a very nice "retro" livery. The staff were very helpful, the plane had a very modern interior with LED lights and larger windows. The food was impressive and tasty, the seat wasn't too comfy but it had an excellent inflight entertainment system and a very generous sized tray table.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Flew on the newer Qantas A330 buisness suite and I must say, I am extremely impressed. Seat had a generous sized tray table, lots of inflight entertainment and was really comfortable, didnt have as much legroom as I thought but you could hardly notice it, the takeoff recline was a nice touch, the food was standard and the staff were extremely helpful. Very impressed Qantas, certainly better than the old buisness class.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Qantas have 29 rows of seats in economy along with 3 rows of business class onboard their new Boeing 737's. The seats are extremely narrow. Whilst the flight was only 2hr 25min, I was so uncomfortable. Cabin crew were quite surly and unfriendly. I always thought you pay a premium to fly Qantas for the comfort and service, but their new aircraft have the most uncomfortable seats.

### Qantas Airways customer review
Check in was smooth with the option of mobile check in available. After recently flying in the newly refurbished 737 fleet I was disappointed to step into a cabin that was outdated by some 10 years. Uncomfortable seats, no personal IFE and in general a cabin that was well due for a makeover. In flight meals were quite good for a one hour flight and an alcoholic beverage and chocolate made a pleasant surprise as well. Arrived early to Sydney and baggage was awaiting pickup.

### Qantas Airways customer review
QF 703 - return flight from last review (one week later). Typically excellent Qantas product. Aircraft very clean, cabin crew very good at making you feel welcome. Food was terrific (quinois salad that would do a restaurant proud). Individual IFE, with a very good selection of films/TV/documentary/etc.
