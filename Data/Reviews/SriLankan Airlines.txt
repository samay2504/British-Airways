### "an absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  Colombo to Sydney was an absolute nightmare. I was ignored when querying the time the flight would be leaving from Colombo, they stated it would be 1 hour late. It was supposed to leave at 12:20 am then changed to 3 hours late. At that stage we were given a so called meal which I wouldn’t give to my dog, then they announced the plane would be 20 hours late. Then we had to stand on a very long agonising queue to receive a hotel voucher. By this stage it was already 5 o’clock Friday morning by the time all passengers were transported to a hotel an hour away from the airport and we had to be picked up by 12:30 pm the following day from the hotel to catch the rescheduled flight at 3:30pm which again was AN HOUR late. The hotel provided breakfast and lunch, but unfortunately we were not able to avail any of these services as we were late for breakfast due to tiredness and exhaustion from the previous day. Lunch was also under time constraints as the hotel did not open for lunch until 12noon and our pick up time from the hotel was 12:30. We will never travel with Sri Lankan Airlines again, and why Trip a Deal consorts with these incompetent lot defies logic.

### “Terrible customer service”
Terrible customer service, they told me that the counter closes 60 minutes before the flight. When I arrived at the check-in, the counter was closed and I was denied check-in. I tried to contact staff but to no avail. I raised a complaint but they insist that the counter was open, while their team in DXB is saying it closes 80 minutes before. Their team in DXB is not willing to give written confirmation of that, so I am stuck in a limbo of lack of responsibility by Sri Lankan airlines. Also, they are not refunding anything. I believe this tells a lot about the quality of the airline, if they cannot even be honest when making a mistake. I informed their management but they are not interested. I worked in the management of an airline, so I am really worried about this behavior. I will avoid this airline now and fly Emirates instead.

### "Zero hospitality"
I have travelled many times with srilankan Airlines. I am really disappointed with the staff of flight UL405 BKK-CMB on date 12-02-25. Zero hospitality and poor service.

### “One of the worst airlines”
One of the worst airlines I have ever encountered. The unprofessional staff do not know how to speak in a respectful manner and have no manners at all. They suddenly changed my reserved seat to give it to someone else without even asking in a professional manner (they had done the same on a few previous occasions as well). Also, some passengers (not all) who travel are third-class and do not know how to act in a decent manner toward other people. If you want a good, calm travel experience, never use this airline.

### "I had a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience traveling with my 9-month-old baby. After checking in and dropping off my luggage, I waited at the airport for over 2.5 hours. Just 10 minutes before the flight’s departure, I was informed that I couldn’t board due to a border control issue. This should have been communicated much earlier, rather than at the last minute. When I contacted border control myself, they resolved the issue in just 2 minutes. However, due to the airline’s inefficiency, we missed the flight. To make matters worse, we weren’t offered a free ticket change and had to pay additional fees to rebook. Thankfully, we live near the airport, but I can’t imagine the inconvenience this would cause for someone traveling from far away or a foreigner unfamiliar with the area. I will never use their services again.

### "utterly shocked and disgusted"
Booked tickets via a travel agent. Bom to Mel and took a stopover in Srilanka. Travelling with my family (husband and daughter) Our flight from Bom to CmB was okay with less than average service, but when we tried to check-in at the very chaotic counter at the colombo airport to go home, we were told by a very uninterested check-in lady that our ticket has been cancelled. She spoke to a few people on the phone and said the same thing and to contact the agent. I told her it's midnight in Australia and she seemed least interested. Basically said that contact the travel agent tomorrow. Totally shocked we had no idea what happened and where to go as nobody was helping and everyone absolutely didn't care. No help, no customer service, no support, just left us on our own to sort out stuff, not even slight bit of help I finally got hold of the travel agent number. I think their srilanka office picked up. We had to switch on international roaming and the travel agent asked to speak to the duty officer. Spoke to him in Tamil for an hour and asked us to wait while he reissued the tickets. We waited and waited and the flight left without us and the nightmare began. No accommodation, no help, we were calling the agent all night and were asked to wait 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs etc. The duty officer was polite but couldn't help. The airline knew that it was a human error by the agent while putting in the seat preference, but didn't bother helping. The agent finally reissued new tickets at 11pm today after our nightmarish experience. We are still waiting at the airport exhausted and tired. Have checked in for tonight's flight, but utterly shocked and disgusted by the treatment. This is not how airlines work. It's a disgrace and the worst, most nightmarish and terrible flying experience of our life.

### "left the airport disappointed"
When I reached CMB I was informed my baggage was left back in Dubai. No sleep in the flight due to discomfort, meals were over, the flight I booked is not what I flew it was a smaller flight packed with passengers. And then I had to spend around 4 hours standing trying to make the complaint on my missing luggage. I left the airport disappointed. And still have not received the baggage after 36 hours. I would never fly with SriLankan airlines again and will never recommend this airlines to my worst enemy.

### "I would highly recommend them"
I was pleasantly surprised by my flight with Sri Lankan airlines from Delhi to Sydney via Colombo. All the flights were within 15 minutes of on time and the staff I dealt with were very helpful and courteous. The lounges in Delhi and Columbo were very good, with a range of food and comfortable seating. The lounge staff in Colombo were particularly friendly. Boarding was done in an orderly fashion with business class and elites boarding first. On arrival at Colombo, a remote stand was used and business class was taken in a separate bus from economy passengers0. There is no additional security at Colombo, so you walk into the terminal, and transfers can be very quick. The seat on the A320 was a recliner seat, which was surprisingly confortable with a pillow and blanket and I fell asleep for an hour or so of the 3.5 hour flight. The staff on this flight were exceptional, quickly dealing with refilling glasses and removing completed food courses. The food was excellent and the servings were quite large. The A330 seats are fairly standard business class with a small cubby hole for your feet. They are not that new but they are confortable enough. There is no mattress topper or pyjamas provided but the pillow is quite comfortable and the blanket is very warm. Usual amenities are provided, toothpaste and brush, eye mask, socks, moisturisers and lip balm. In flight entertainment has a large range of TV and movies to watch. Obviously many South Asian content but also lots of Western content. The hard product does need an update but it still works quite well. Staff vary flight to flight, but from this flight I would highly recommend them. I have also travelled from Melbourne to Delhi with Sri Lankan and the service was just as good on that occassion.

### “I was pleasantly surprised”
I recently flew UL with family from MEL-CMB-MEL return. Given the many negative reviews seen here, I was expecting a very poor product. But to be honest I was pleasantly surprised. Of course there is certainly room for improvement - the seats could be more comfortable, upholstery needs to be changed, arms loose or broken, needs an overall clean. At times, the quality of annoucements were not the best. Boarding in CMB was a bit disorganised considering the flights were very full on both sectors. But, the IFE system for me and everyone around me was working in both sectors (many reviewers here are complaining about it not working). A decent selection of movies, TV and music. Good head sets. Food was average airline food, can't complain. Cabin service was very professional, helpful, efficient and attentive. Bagage was delivered to belt on time. Check-in at both ends was OK. Will definitely consider again. I got what I paid for. For those complaining - please pay more and choose another airline.

### "service was professional"
I've seen many negative reviews about Sri Lankan airlines. However, my trip was so good. Even though it was a 1-hour flight, they provided drinks and a snack which doesn't happen in North America. The service was professional too. I hope they will grow!

### "direct flight was canceled
Not Verified |   We booked our return flight as a direct flight, which was canceled and then simply staying in Paris. We started more than 3 hours later, missed our connecting train, were poorly provided with drinks, unfortunately not a great experience. Our direct flight to Colombo from Frankfurt was great: very nice staff, super on time!

### "I was late by 5 mins to check-i"
The worst ground staff there is in any airline or airport in the world. I was late by 5 mins to check-in my bag to go to Bangalore and they refused to take my bag even when I was pleading with them. What's sad to see was the ones who checked in there bags 5 mins before me they were the casually walking towards the gates and if they had allowed me to go through I would have reached the gate before the ones who checked in. Further more they lie to you as well ones they denied me they told me to go outside and go to a counter where I will be able to refund a part of the payment I made for the flight which was a lie they just did that to get rid of me from there counters. I was so lost and helpless at that point, there were no direct flight for me to catch nor any transit flights to Bangalore that day. Somehow I managed to fly to Chennai that same night and then to Bangalore on two flight. My seat had leftover food from the previous flight and the flight delay almost made my lay over impossible to do, but thanks to the staff at the Chennai air pot who gave me a cabby to go from checkout to check-in and helped me through out the process of the airport I was able to get to Bangalore and make my trip work.

### “customer service was extremely poor”
Not Verified | Our flight UL166 from Kochi, scheduled to depart at 10:20 AM, was delayed until 12 PM. Consequently, we missed our connecting flight from Colombo to London. The staff later mentioned that the flight did not wait for us as other passengers on the flight would miss their connections. Does that mean our time and money are of no value? Are we traveling for free? The customer service at Colombo airport was extremely poor. We were not informed that we had missed our flight. A staff member just asked us to follow him, and we thought he was trying to expedite our transfer to the London flight. He told us we missed the flight only when I specifically asked him. The staff then nonchalantly suggested we wait until the next day's afternoon flight, offering free accommodation and travel as if this was a satisfactory solution. Don’t assume everyone will be happy to accept anything given for free. Our trip was not a leisure visit to Sri Lanka, and this unexpected delay caused us to lose over 12 hours. I was scheduled to return to work on Monday, the 15th, after a three-week holiday due to a family emergency. This disruption made it very difficult at work, as I had to negotiate additional leave. Furthermore, I was traveling with my four-year-old daughter and my elderly parents with health issues, which made the situation even more challenging. After an hour of conversation with the staff, they suggested a flight from Colombo to London via Riyadh. We had to agree to this as it was the only option available. Another solution suggested by the staff was that I could take a night flight if I had to return to work, while the rest of my family stayed until the next day due to insufficient seats. This was an unreasonable and impractical suggestion. The entire journey was made hectic due to this delay. Additionally, the food served on the Colombo to Riyadh flight was substandard, and the flight from Kochi was untidy. This was my first and last travel experience with your airline.

### "Avoid Srilankan Airlines"
Not Verified |   Avoid Srilankan Airlines at all cost. We faced a worst experience on 26th of June when we had to travel from Srilankan to India. On 26th we had a flight (UL 139) at 1.35pm but our seats were given to someone else and they told us that the flight was overbooked and also they forced us to take another flight the following day. After some time we got a connecting flight (Srilankan to Trivandrum via Bangalore - UL 171) at 6.45pm, which was again cancelled few minutes before boarding. Regarding this no any proper response was given from the staffs for our questions and their behaviour was very rude and ignorant. We were told that if we question them (transit staff), they won't let us fly the following day. Many people faced trouble without food and accomodations for days due to continuous flight cancellation. On 27th we had a flight at 8.20am (UL 161) and that was delayed for 5 hrs. Never fly in Srilankan Airlines.

### “Very bad service”
Very bad service. People are waiting for more than 10 hours in the Airport and they are not giving any food or accommodation. Never ever fly with this airline.

### "I will avoid at all costs"
Things started off badly pre-flight - the lounge you get to access with One World status is without shadow of a doubt the poorest excuse for a lounge I have ever experienced. Tiny (no seats), no facilities and just warm bottled water. And it was dirty. The same way the kept the plane it turned out. The seats were cramped - it was the first time my 14 year old complained about not having enough space. The cabin was old and tired. The food was edible, but not great. The IFE did not work at all for any of the four seats we were in for the entire 12 hour trip. IFE is pretty fundamental when you are traveling long haul and with a family. The crew reset it 6 times and said I would be contacted post flight about compensation. I was not and, upon complaining, I found that the customer service is beyond poor. They did not dispute the lack of IFE or that its existence was pretty fundamental (who would choose to fly an airline without it). After much delay and effort chasing them, I was eventually offered the grand prize of the ability of getting a $20 discount the next time I choose to spend thousands with them. Needless to say - traveling with them again is something that will never happen. I will avoid at all costs.

### “lack of appropriate response to enquiries”
Merely contributing to the scores of bad reviews for reason of: Horrible customer service, lost time and funds in attempts to right any wrongs, website functionality, missing flight rewards, failures to honour travel vouchers, but primarily: lack of appropriate (or any) response to legitimate enquiries/concerns. Despite the multiple attempts and length of time, lessons have finally been learned. This was the last occasion on which I, or any of my staff in Maldives will fly Sri Lankan. Conversely, in-person service on actual flights has always been commendable.

### "Do not use this airline"
Do not use this airline even if the price is right. Totally unreliable, no communication skills and they just send holding e mails when you contact them. My flight was cancelled late at night until the following day. I missed one day of my trip and was legally entitled to compensation. They refuse to pay and it is now 3 months. I am taking legal action for myself and two friends but it is time consuming. Flight UL 504 27 February 2024 London to Columbo. No UK representative & no UK number to call.

### "Avoid SriLankan Airlines at all costs"
My recent flight with SriLankan Airlines was an absolute nightmare. As a Sri Lankan citizen and a student in Malaysia, I thought supporting our national carrier was the right move. I show up at the airport ready to go, only to be told my seat was given away because the flight was full. Ended up taking a detour through Chennai with a three-hour layover before finally reaching Malaysia. Not cool, especially when I had booked a direct flight. To make matters worse, the person at the boarding pass desk was so rude and ignorant! Tried to sort things out at the boarding desk, but they couldn't care less. Forced me onto a transit flight without a second thought. To top it off, my baggage decided to take a detour of its own to Chennai! So there I was, stranded in Malaysia without my stuff. Avoid SriLankan Airlines at all costs if you want an easier trip. Save yourself the headache and go with a different airline.

### "seats were very uncomfortable"
The Jakarta to Colombo leg of the flight was delayed by an hour but otherwise great with comfortable seats, good food and a nice personal entertainment device but content library is quite limited. The check-in experience was also quite pleasant and the on-board crew was very good as well. However, the boarding process was a bit of a mess and quite disorganised. However, the Colombo to Mumbai leg was not as comfortable, the aircraft was a leased aircraft and the seats were very uncomfortable - extremely upright with no lower back support and no place to keep your knick knacks like water bottle. The crew and the food was quite good though. It was just about bearable because the Colombo - Mumbai leg is a short 2.5 hour hop but any longer and you would end up with a back-ache for sure.

### "overall quite happy"
I got an amazing deal on Sri Lankan between Mumbai and Jakarta, and the flights were not bad at all. The crew is very friendly and responsive and the flights were on-time with good food and good leg-room. On the Mumbai to Colombo leg they did not have entertainment but since it is a short 2.5 hour hop, it did not matter so much but the Colombo - Jakarta leg had entertainment screens (though dated) but movie selection is quite limited. Overall the planes do show wear and tear but that did not take away from the experience. The bathrooms were also kept clean throughout the journey, so, overall quite happy with the experience. I did miss a small snack or even a tea/coffee service towards the end of the Colombo - Jakarta leg and they should upgrade their movie library and screens, which are quite dated. You may want to keep in mind that Colombo airport is pretty basic and not the best for a long layover without lounge access, there are very few comfortable seating and charging options, thankfully there was a Priority Pass Lounge which made it bearable since I had close to 7 hour layover.

### "missed check in 25 minutes prior"
My husband and I recently passed through Kuala Lumpur Airport on the last day of our honeymoon. Our flight was booked through SriLankan Airlines but the third and final flight was operated by Malaysia Airlines. We have experienced this many times previously, where we’ve booked through one airline and had multiple flights operated by more than one airline, and never had problems in the past. At the check in desk in Male the Sri Lanka Airlines representative gave us the boarding passes for our first two flights and informed us we needed to ‘pick up the boarding passes for our third flight at the transfer desk in Colombo or Kuala Lumpur’. The rep did not say we weren’t checked in for this third flight, and confirmed our luggage was also due to make the full journey across the three flights without the need for us to collect or recheck baggage. At Colombo Airport transfer desk the staff member told us we needed to collect our boarding passes in Kuala Lumpur, which was surprising as this information differed from what the first Sri Lanka Airlines rep told us in Male. Our flight from Colombo to KL landed around 25 minutes late and it then took around 15 minutes to disembark and reach the transfer desk at KLIA. We immediately went to the desk and got there around 7.40am. We spoke to someone on the right side of the desk (separate to the Malaysia Airlines section), and they asked to see our flight itinerary. At 7.47am I took a screenshot to show the rep. Given our flight was due to be operated by Malaysia Airlines and the staff member had started serving someone else, we then saw there was a separate transfer desk for Malaysia Airlines. We immediately headed to the long queue at around 7.50am. Although the line was long (our estimate is around 30 people waiting), we expected it would move at a reasonable pace. After taking turns in the line to use the restroom, when my husband and I were both in the line waiting together we soon realised it was not moving. There was one staff member serving the huge number of passengers and seemingly requiring 10 minutes or more per passenger. We heard others around us talk of their flight time with the two women in front of us saying their flight was prior to ours. Passengers were pushing in the line with disorder in the queue. Many people jumped the line saying they still needed to check in or had children. There was also a very large group being served in one line and they appeared to be at the front of the queue for almost the entire time we were waiting. By the time we finally reached the front of the line around 9am, the staff member rudely spoke to us and told us we missed check in 25 minutes prior. We told her we were waiting over an hour in the queue to which she unsympathetically said she called our names, and she accused us of not being in the queue the entire time. We corrected her to which she accusingly blamed us for not hearing our flight being called. Other passengers around us said they did not hear our flight / names called and half an hour later a man came up to us and said, ‘they did not call your flight’. Sri Lanka Airlines provided no support at all via phone and there was no one from the airline physically at the airport. They completely disregarded us and just took the money. We will never fly Sri Lanka Airlines or Malaysia Airlines again.

### "airline struggling to stay alive"
Free online seat selection. Online easy check in and automated efficient bag drop at LHR. Terminal 3 usual cramped and crowded atmosphere. On time boarding in an organised manner . Smiles from crew on boarding and verbal welcome in cabin. No longer offer an inflight magazine, hot towel or printed menu. Shame as these little touches raised the bar for economy. Drinks range also cut back, but food was good, although again no chocolate or cheese with crackers and no liquor. All cutbacks from an airline struggling to stay alive. Comfortable and clean. Warm 3 choice of breakfast. Crew efficient but I guess cut back on crew number. Given price of ticket I expected a bit more but still good.

### "What a terrible airline"
The worst experience with an airline company. We booked on their website a flight from Rome to Colombo, with a first connecting flight Roma - Abu Dhabi, operated by Etihad and the second one Abu Dhabi - Colombo operated directly by them. The problem is that their flight (the second one) has never departed. We received an email about the cancellation the same morning , while we were boarding on the first plane, and then no more info or details. Once arrived in Abu Dhabi we looked for an info point, where we have been waiting for more than one hour for, at the end, being informed that the plane had some technical issue and so they would have been able to make us fly 2/3 days later. So that, we've been obliged to book a last minute flight with Etihad at our expense. Now 4 months have already passed, we've been asking for the refund we deserve considering the flight cancellation, our extra money spent and all the troubles caused and ll their contacts tell us to reach their online refunds - no one has ever answered, it's like this team is unreal. What a terrible airline and terrible team that work there.

### "Very disappointed with ground staff"
Very disappointed with ground staff/crew members at check in counter. I was travelling with my 2 year son, i was carrying only 2 suitcases with on carry on bag, which was allowed to me, even i have one less hand bag, check in staff was asking 32000rs. After asking why i should pay i am not carrying anything over my weight limit, they behaved very rudely, with disrespectful behaviour. On flight i asked milk for my baby boy, they refused saying we cannot provide milk, it is for crew members only. I will never travel again with SriLankan Airlines.

### "Could not fault anything"
Could not fault anything on this flight. Cabin spotless seat comfortable food was sensational with a great variety cabin crew were friendly and constantly asked if anything was required. In-flight entertainment was loaded with everything you could want to watch.

### "friendly and quite efficient"
The departure area at Colombo Airport is not great and was fairly crowded, but check in itself was quite efficient. There is a separate line of immigration for Business Class passengers so we were quickly through into the departure area. SriLankan Airlines Serendib is not large but seems to cope OK with the number of business class passengers and had a view over the apron, which was nice. Flight boarded on time, although some delays boarding the last few passengers meant the flight departed around 20 minutes behind schedule. Dinner was served soon after take off and my wife and I both chose the Grilled Barramundi, tasty and a generous portion. Cabin crew were friendly and quite efficient, although there was an inconsistency between the service between the two aisles. Being a daytime flight the shortcomings in SriLankan Airlines IFE are quite apparent and I struggled to find enough to keep me entertained for the 11-hour flight. The flight itself was quite smooth with only occasional turbulence causing the seat belts signs to go on, thankfully unlike some airlines, this captain didn’t forget to turn them off! Pressing of the call button for drinks was responded to very quickly so credit to the cabin crew for this. The toilets were also kept clean. Flight landed some 35 minutes late into Heathrow, however our luggage was delivered very promptly and we were out of the airport with 25 minutes of the flight touching down, must be a record for Heathrow T3. Overall, a reasonable experience with SriLankan and would be happy to fly with them again, just need a better film selection!

### "experience was not bad"
We booked our flights from LHR to Colombo and return some 6 months before travel, but having read some of the negative publicity about the airline in recent months, we worried that we may regret the decision, however by and large we were happy. Check in at Heathrow was quick and efficient, Business Class passengers get to use the BA Galleries lounge at T3, this was not busy and there was plenty of seats available. The food didn’t look that special, so didn’t bother. Flight boarded on time and departed only a few minutes behind schedule. Business Class on the A330-300 was fairly standard 1-2-1 configuration, my wife and I had selected the middle two (seats 4D and 4G) in the middle of 7 rows inthe cabin. The plane was not that new, but the cabin was clean, comfortable and the seat/bed controls all worked fine. The cabin crew were very professional and friendly, so no complaints there. Dinner was served shortly after take-off, my wife chose the fillet steak which she said was very nice, I chose the Chicken Kalupol Curry, which was very tasty. Sri Lankan serve Joseph Perrier Champagne, which was pleasant. One aspect of the flight, which was disappointing was the IFE, the choice of films was very poor. They had a large number of Christmas films showing, I get this in December, but not in February! Passing on the films, we both managed to get some sleep, before breakfast was served a couple of hours before landing. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, but this is the case with most airlines! Flight landed on schedule into Colombo BIA and we were through immigration and out of the airport with luggage in 30 minutes. In summary the Sri Lankan Airlines experience was not bad and had the great advantage of being a direct flight. Hopefully the SriLankan Airlines privatisation will go ahead and the airline will get the investment it needs to continue.

### “Disgrace of a national carrier”
Disgrace of a national carrier. Malfunctioning seats, all 4 flights in my round trip were delayed, extremely unclean and unhygienic cabin. When customer care was emailed was sent a message they would look into it and they never got back to me.

### "Staff all a delight"
Check in at LHR was easy and efficient. We chose to use the Cathay Pacific lounge which was excellent. Boarding of this full flight was very quick and started early. It was well organised. On board prompt welcome from both cabin crew and service director. Invited to cockpit to meet flight crew who were an absolute delight. Pre departure drinks service was good. We were ready to go 15 minutes early and pushed back from stand on time. Once airborne drinks and nuts served followed by 4 course lunch. This was all fine. Not the best meal service ever but no major deficiencies. After lunch settled back and watched some films. Slept for a while over Middle East. Lie flat is not the most comfortable but was fine. Second meal service was dinner which was a good call as airlines do this better than breakfast. I enjoyed tea mid flight. Being a major tea producing nation , Sri Lankan take a real pride in their tea service. Not only is there an expansive collection but it’s brewed well and served with flair. On time arrival into Colombo. The Serendib lounge there was adequate. On time departure to Male with excellent meal service on such a short flight together with pre departure beverages. Far better than European short haul. Overall, a good flight. Staff all a delight. Product reasonable. The aircraft are starting to age a little and this will need attention over the next 18 months or so

### "cannot provide an invoice"
I have tried multiple times to get an invoice for my travel - multiple emails, phone calls etc yet to receive a response. I do not understand why a major international airline cannot provide an invoice for travel. I went on business class and whilst the cabin crew were friendly, there really was nothing else to comment on positively.

### “would not choose this airline again”
Via Silk Route for business, not that silky. Luggage screened, passports/tickets verified then 45 minutes wait for boarding pass. Why so long? Finally at gate, further screening then trapped in a room with inadequate seating. Many, like us, had to sit on the floor. No water, no toilets, no communication as to why we were late boarding. At 2am not fun. Then another 30 minutes waiting before take off. 100% full business class. On board, the crew were nice, the seats narrow and when reclined the joins stuck into my back. Also noticeably only superficially clean. Very cold cabin on this return journey. The entertainment selection was not as good as the flight to Colombo. The food was ok, breakfast better than dinner. No real storage around the seat. The headphones supplied were dreadful. The toilets were not kept clean, very disappointing. I would not choose this airline again.

### "quite a catastrophic experience"
Not Verified |  This journey turned out to be quite a catastrophic experience. Initially, SriLankan Airlines abruptly canceled our Seoul Incheon to Colombo flight just four days before departure. Attempts to reach them from Korea were futile, as they remained unresponsive to our emails sent through the website. The alternative they provided, a flight via Tokyo with a three-day delay, was impractical. Resorting to personal connections in France, I managed to secure another flight through Bangkok, but this came with no compensation, and we had to cover our hotel expenses in Bangkok ourselves. The return journey was even more distressing, with the plane experiencing significant delays and minimal information provided. At Colombo airport, the staff seemed uninformed about the situation, and they didn't offer water and food to children until we expressed our dissatisfaction assertively. If you want to safeguard your vacation, I strongly advise against choosing this airline unless you have ample time to spare in this remarkable country.

### "lateness is typical with this airline"
Not Verified | We flew Sri Lankan Airlines from Colombo to Frankfurt on January 5, 2024. The flight left Colombo Airport almost three hours late. Although it was an 11 hour flight, they made no attempt to make up for lost time. So we arrived in Frankfurt three hours late, and as a result we missed our connecting flight to the US. There was no one from the Sri Lankan Airlines at the Frankfurt Airport to help us rebook our flight. We were completely abandoned by the Sri Lankan Airlines. Finally a kind local travel agent helped us out. Later we read that this kind of lateness is typical with this airline. We will never fly with them again!

### "disgraceful lack of customer service"
Possibly the worst managed and most inefficient airline imaginable. I flew in a party of 5 from Sydney to Colombo on xmas eve - the A330 was ageing with broken seats, mono headsets and very poor selection of entertainment options though the service in the air pleasant and helpful. Trying to change seating configuration for our return flight whilst in Colombo (no online option) was woeful with entirely uninformed ground staff and no coherent system apparent. Our return flight to Sydney via Melbourne from Colombo on Jan 5 was just about the worst flying experience you could have - initially the flight was delayed from the scheduled departure time of 00:35 to 04:30 with the flight eventually leaving at 06:00. Once again the ground staff at Colombo appeared to have little to no knowledge of process by instructing passengers that baggage would be routed directly to the final destination in Australia. The Australian requirements are abundantly clear that passengers must collect bags at the first port of entry prior to proceeding to other domestic destinations within Australia. This misinformation by sri lankan airlines staff caused unnecessary confusion for passengers. When we did finally arrive in Melbourne we were advised that there was a “tactical error” with the baggage handling and there would be a further delay (approximately 40 mins). Once we had our baggage we had to find our way to the one Sri Lankan check in desk to queue again to receive a hotel voucher as most of the flight had missed onward connecting flights. We arrived after further queuing for a transfer vehicle at the hotel to be given a voucher for $25 for dinner. By this time it was midnight in Melbourne with no restaurant open in the hotel to get food. We then had to get up and check out of the hotel at 4am to get our flight to Sydney - this was too early to use the voucher for breakfast so the end result was no food was provided to passengers. We finally boarded our Qantas flight to Sydney at 6am on Saturday 6 January. Sri Lankan airlines should be ashamed of their disgraceful lack of customer service, the complete absence of any accurate information and the alarming level of obvious inefficiency and ineptitude in their operations management. Finally when I enquired about the airline’s performance noting that every Sri Lankan flight from Australia to Sri Lanka in the preceding week was delayed, I was informed that it was due to “procedural issues”. This airline has no capacity to operate on an international stage and should be avoided at all costs.

### "not fly Srilankan Airlines again"
Return flight is already 4 hrs late. Outward bound was 24 hrs late. Food voucher is for un edible curry with no choice. We will be claiming our alternative. We were put up in a hotel with fixed meals of really rubbish quality. No airline rep in sight and phone support finished at 5 - a disgrace with 300 passengers looking for alternative flights. Online the plane was very poorly maintained with many video systems broken. We will not fly Srilankan Airlines again.

### “no information on delays”
Most useless airline in the world, always delayed, no information on delays. Broken seats, bad smell in the flight, ground staff are horrible. It is a disaster, don’t travel on Sri Lankan Airlines.

### "The app does not accept my trips"
Not Verified |  Worst airline. The app does not accept my trips. Tried to check in for my flight back to Colombo. Not accepting seat reservations. When I contacted them by email they had the cheek to reply that it is a courtesy reminder from them and reminding me to check-in. I emailed again to say that it is not accepting my seat reservations and that I am a wheelchair passenger and need to sit next to my travelling companion. Still waiting to hear from them. I don't use SriLankan Airlines for long haul flights anymore as they one of the worst airline for efficiency.

### "Srilankan Airlines is very poorly run"
My Qantas code sharing flight 3422 operated by Srilankan Airline was scheduled to depart Colombo on the 25th Dec 12:15PM. We arrived at the airport at 9AM and flight was cancelled at 9:30AM - no advanced notification. Then they gave us a single option of travelling directly to Sydney in their carrier UL606 which we grudgingly accepted (Departure 12:10AM 26Dec). Then they kept us starving in an area with no shops to purchase food/water till 12:30pm. They transferred us all the way back to Colombo city centre and checked us in to a hotel at 2:30PM. Meal was delivered to the room at 3:30PM. We were asked to get ready and wait for the airport pickup by 8pm but the Srilankan airline driver turned up at 9pm! We had no chance of getting to the airport on time in the Christmas traffic in Colombo and we missed 12:10AM flight. Then they offered us another UL direct flight to Melbourne dep 1:20am and a Mel/Syd Qantas connecting flight. We had to rush to that flight too and we are not young any more to rush like that and I was fearful of my wife getting a heart attack. This is my hellish return flight to Australia from Colombo. Srilankan Airlines is very poorly run and this type of delays are reported all over the local newspapers. Bringing passengers back to Colombo on a Christmas Day is total madness!

### "absolute pleasure to fly with"
An absolute pleasure to fly with. Friendly crew and an experience to remember. Seat comfort is remarkable. Highly recommended to fly with SriLankan airlines

### "the airline is in a sad state"
On the day of departure I had a call then e mail saying it was two hours late. Was three hours late. The lounge allocated was a pay type lounge with poor offerings. On boarding economy boarded first. We were left as unwanted far from priority while we just watched everyone go before us. The crew on board however were outstanding- better than SQ even. So warm and engaging. Entertainment was good. The seat back I could feel metal it was so worn. Little storage, earphones rubbish. I used my own but dropped a piece and on trying to retrieve it saw how absolutely filthy it was down under and around the seat. The light blanket they provide was too light and no mattress topper. Leather needs it. The amenity kit was very basic. Food was okay. Large servings but quality lacking. Arrived at 2am along with lots of flights. No priority for the bus to terminal nor immigration. So the staff were nice but the airline is in a sad state.

### "worst flight ever taken"
Not Verified |  The worst flight ever taken. I had to catch the SriLankan Airlines flight at transit in Singapore and let me you tell you to never fly with this utmost terrible airline. Was so exhausted already after 7 hrs flight from Brisbane to Singapore and then the flight Sri Lankan Airlines flight got 2 hours delayed. It was a nightmare. The customer service was terrible and I had to ask for a blanket 3 times and then only got one. At one of the three times, they said they are out of blankets. It then took at least 45 mins to distribute the meals in the plane and the flight crew was running up and down like hundred times because they weren’t organized enough to use a trolley. They weren’t attentive to customers at all. Also they was a beep tone every 2-3minutes in the flight from start to the end which interrupted most of the sleeping time.

### “Cancellation four days before take-off”
Not Verified |  Really bad airline - they cancelled my flight (4 passengers) four days in advance without giving reason - Not offering any alternative but same flight one week later. Cancellation four days before take-off cost a lot of money if you have to find new tickets. Never again!

### "they can't give the boarding pass"
There were two incidents, one at Kochin Airport and other one in Colombo to Sydney Flight. On 2nd of Feb 2023, my wife, 1 baby, 2 kids and My mother were going to take flight from Kochin to Colombo and then Colombo to Sydney with Layover time 50minutes. During the check-in at Kochin, they only gave boarding pass from Cochin to Colombo and upon requesting for boarding pass from Colombo to Sydney they mentioned first "Seats are full" then my wife was confused as we have confirmed seats with seating numbers and bassinet in our tickets. Upon checking further with Check-in guy, he changes the story and said "Standby Mode" and suggested to get the boarding pass from Colombo, then my wife was not sure what it meant so she tried to explain that my husband who took flight with same route with layover over 12hours got the both boarding pass from Cochin and we took many flights before and we always gets the boarding pass from where we Check-in. Moreover, they need the boarding pass, as the Layover time is only 50min, and all our luggage's are marked as Hot and have 1 baby, 2 kids and my mother to handle, which will put her very difficult to get the boarding pass at Colombo, and very high chances that my family will miss the flight. The guy called other staff  to confirm the status of flight and she insisted that they can't give the boarding pass as the status of next flight was "Standby Mode". My wife keeps begging to sort out this with that lady, but they were no use. As she lost hope, she continued with one boarding pass reached the gate to board the flight. While waiting there was another family going to Sydney via Colombo, same flight and route, and they got there boarding pass for both flights. They got served at the same check-in time. Upon hearing this she got frustrated and wanted to check with the Sri Lankan staff again. But the security guys didn't let her go back to check-in area, so she informed the security guys that she want to speak to Sri Lankan staff immediately. One of the guys from Sri Lankan staff arrived at help desk at gate 1 and my wife explained the situation to him, and he was very surprised and shocked that this happened, and he issued boarding pass from the gate. Now my wife got both the boarding passes. My wife was curios and looking for explanation, so she saw the lady staff  at boarding gate and asked for explanation. Then she straight away said "Did I serve you? and responding in very rude way instead of giving explanation, my wife was only looking for explanation from the lady.

### "rude beyond what I can express"
Flight UL 178 Hyderabad to Colombo. The air hostess wasn’t giving us water though we asked several times whereas she was giving it to others. When called out on this difference in treatment, she misbehaved and said that she gave us tea/coffee and that should be enough. She was rude beyond what I can express. There were two of them and both treated us the same way but when we called out their behavior, one of them had the courtesy to apologize but the other remained arrogant and indifferent. Airlines are supposed to be a hospitable industry, ensuring that passengers are comfortable during the journey.

### "a dismissive I don't care attitude"
An unfortunate and disappointing experience I encountered during my recent travel on SriLankan Airlines flight UL605 from Colombo to Melbourne. The ground handling staff at the departure gate exhibited a level of rudeness and unprofessionalism that was disheartening. As a loyal customer of SriLankan Airlines, I have always expected and received a certain standard of service, but unfortunately, my recent encounter fell far short of those expectations. Moreover, I was witness to a blatant violation of the boarding procedure. It was disconcerting to observe that business class passengers, including myself, were held back while the family of a celebrity cricketer was allowed to board ahead of us. This not only created an atmosphere of inequity but also resulted in a delay in the boarding process for all passengers. Adding to the dismay was the apparent lack of concern displayed by the airport service manager when approached with these concerns. Several passengers, myself included, attempted to express our dissatisfaction and seek an explanation for the deviation from standard boarding procedures. However, the response we received was alarming. The airport manager of SriLankan Airlines responded with a dismissive I don't care attitude, undermining the valid concerns of paying passengers. Such a callous attitude from the airport manager is not only unprofessional but also tarnishes the reputation of SriLankan Airlines. Passengers, including myself, deserve to be treated with respect and courtesy, and the demonstrated behavior falls well short of these expectations.

### "such a negative experience"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline all costs. Regularly, cancellations of flights are not uncommon and lot of problems as results of overbooking strategy. The staff is undertrained, unprofessional and rude. They don’t show any empathy and wont listen to you. Never had such a negative experience an airline.

### "couldn’t even talk to a rep"
This airlines sucks. Air hostess are rude the customer service line does not care. I waited in line at the transfer services for 20 minutes while other people just cut in front of me and when I said something to the representatives they ignored me. I wanted to see if I can get an earlier flight or hotel since my layover was 12+ hours but I couldn’t even talk to a rep they just ignored me.

### "Its the worst airline"
I fly economy from Male to Colombo, i did online bidding at 6pm to upgrade my class. Until i arrive at Colombo i don't get email for it, so i asked at the ticket counter. They said its not successful, so i pay cash to upgrade my class. At 4am i got email, I read it when I arrive in Jakarta. i filed complaint since then and until now i got no refund for my money nor their response. Its the worst airline for all the services.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Incompetent ground crew in Colombo is the first thing I would say and I will never fly with them again. Going from Sydney to Colombo Friday 22 September-flight cancelled till Saturday. Seat is broken that it won’t stay in upright position. One flight attendant tells me “don’t worry” whilst another is telling me to put it upright, so I just lent forward for take-off. Arrive in Colombo and it takes ground crew 45 min to organise a hotel for overnight till connection to Male in the morning. Didn’t think much of it and just looking forward to the holiday (which was fantastic). Coming home, September 30th, the flight from Male to Colombo was delayed 3 hours so we missed the connecting flight to Sydney at midnight. I then had to queue for 4 hours to move 6 metres to get to front of the flexiglass to get a new flight via Singapore that was to leave at 7.20 but was delayed till 9.00am. So you can imagine how I was feeling having to be awake all night. The ground staff - of which there were 6 behind the flexiglass shield but only 2 assisting customers - worked at what I can only gauge as a snails pace. In no hurry to help. And the culture of men crowding in front of the flexiglass and not lining up was just rude. For our trouble, our food voucher was a stale bread sandwich 1/2 cheese, 1/2 tuna. A dry slice of cake and a soft drink. The journey was an extra 16 hours on top of what it should have been.

### "crew inexplicably altered our seating arrangements"
Disappointment regarding my recent experience on Sri Lankan Airlines Flight UL606 from Colombo to Sydney on September 22, 2023. This flight was, unfortunately, a source of considerable distress for me and my family. To begin, we were initially boarded on Flight UL606 according to our scheduled departure time, only to be left seated without any communication or updates for an extensive period of three hours. Despite having pre-booked seats due to the presence of an infant in our party, the crew inexplicably altered our seating arrangements, separating our family. Although a crew member eventually helped us regain our seats together with a bassinet, the initial confusion was entirely avoidable. The ordeal continued as we endured the delay without receiving any service or even water, despite requesting it in the sweltering conditions. After an extended wait, we were informed that the flight had to be canceled due to an unresolved technical issue. Subsequently, we were directed to the transfers and visa area to be accommodated in hotels. The process was marred by chaos and inefficiency, leaving passengers, including those with disabilities and families with young children like ours, standing in the same queue for hours without assistance. I must highlight that my family and I were traveling with three children, all under the age of 5, including an infant, and we were left to manage the situation entirely on our own. The lack of support and organisation from the airline and airport staff during this critical period was deeply disappointing. After a lengthy wait, we were finally allocated a hotel at 06.15, transported to it at 07.15, only to be returned to the airport a few hours later for our rescheduled flight. However, the transportation process itself was fraught with issues, including an hour-and-a-half journey and a delay in the departure of our next flight. The confusion persisted when we were issued new boarding passes with seat numbers that contradicted the information given to us earlier. Upon boarding, we discovered that our family, as well as others, had been separated, and the same seat numbers were assigned to multiple passengers, leading to considerable confusion and frustration. We experienced resistance and rudeness from one of the crew members named Jenaly when we sought assistance in regaining our originally booked seats. Ultimately, after a heated exchange and our firm refusal to accept the middle-row seats offered, we were able to reclaim our original seats, resulting in a further delay to the flight. I wish to formally register my complaint against the Sri Lankan Airlines crew members and airport staff involved in this incident. The lack of professionalism, coordination, and empathy exhibited during this journey was unacceptable and tarnished our perception of your airline. In conclusion, I express my strong dissatisfaction with this incident and convey my decision to avoid future travel with Sri Lankan Airlines. I hope that my concerns will be addressed promptly and that measures will be taken to prevent such distressing situations in the future.

### "Total delay was 18 hours"
One of the worst airlines up to date. 12 hours of delay without notice and booking hotels after 13 hours. Total delay of the flight was 18 hours and the customer service team were extremely poor and hopeless

### "Unable to sit with partner"
Not Verified |  Late leaving. Unable to sit with partner. Screen did not work. No sound. No music. Staff did not know how to fix it. Customers on the plane moving seats before pushing back as we’re unhappy with where they were sitting. Screaming children the whole way. Couldn’t upgrade as were on a tour. Uncomfortable seats.

### "Very nice experience"
Not Verified |  Very nice experience. Great hospitality, good food. The only thing was the chaos at Colombo airport. Several people outside who were not travelling. Something needs to be done about that. Some directions need to be put in place showing directions to airline counters. Hope some remedial measures will be taken soon.

### "Really bad experience"
Not Verified |  Really bad experience with this Srilankan Airlines & not recommend at all. When I'm waiting next flight to Jakarta from Colombo, they informed me through the email that the flight was delayed for 2 hours. No compensation at all, which is I have next flight after arriving in Jakarta. So automatically I need to cancel my domestic flight and reschedule for the next day.

### "don’t recommend to anyone"
Very disappointed, worst service. My wife and my two years old kid traveled alone first time, they are pushing to leave her hand bag in airport or put it in luggage and pay 18000 Indian rupees. Nobody gave guidance or help, They are just thinking how to get money. We won’t use that airline in future and don’t recommend to anyone.

### "I strongly recommend SriLankan"
I travelled as a family with my two toddlers and the Cabin staff's support is Excellent. They understood how difficult to travel 12+ hours flight with two little boys. They offered plenty of snacks, toys, drawing books to keep them active. When they offer food, they offered one meal at a time, So we didn't have to rush to finish the meals with the kids. and they collected all the left over food immediately. Even they offered extra meals when the kids are sleeping so i and my wife could go to empty seats and enjoy the meals. Seat comfort and and leg space was an OK. but i like if there were more leg space. if you travel with kids, i have never received such a support from cabin staff. I strongly recommend SriLankan for long journeys with kids.

### "delay my flight for 14.5 hours"
Enroute to Heathrow, Sri Lankan Airlines delay my flight for an extremely reasonable time of 14.5 hours -  couldn't reach them on the phone. Had connecting flights in Colombo to Male Maldives and Speedboat connections and a full day all inclusive at a resort essentially ruined if I stuck with Sri Lankan Airlines. Which I refused to do so had to buy a one way ticket to Mumbai - Colombo - Male to make the Holiday as planned. Absolute travesty I understand things happen and the world isn't perfect but this clearly happens all the time with them. They refused to answer the calls I made now saying I can't have a refund because I didn't declare I wasn't making the delayed flight. How am I supposed to call them if they shut their call centre and B in the Air flying with other airlines in 4 different countries and timezones to make it. Yeah letting them know I won't be on the flight was pretty low on my lists of things to do in that moment.

### "seat was switched with someone else"
Came to the airport for the morning flight, and was told I am not booked on that flight due to a screw-up. (I did not have a prior notification). My relatives were waiting at the Male airport. I spoke to my travel agent and they booked a flight in the afternoon. I could not take the boat (only two boats a day) Had to check in at a hotel in Male at a cost of $120. Went to the island the next day and only had two hours with my relatives. They had to return to their work. On the return flight  my seat was switched with someone else.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever, the long delays, to rude staff. The call centre not taking any calls after 5:00pm, although I was informed that they are open 24 hours. Giving vague justification, which was quiet hard to believe, and not letting us know why exactly the flight was cancelled, if this keeps happening the remaining passengers choosing will stop travelling by Srilankan Airlines. Food was good enough, but the staff members at Melbourne airport were on top of their attitude and arrogant.

### "be the last flight with SriLankan"
Flight is delayed for 2 hours (up & down both), seats are very bad, can feel the steel bars of the seat rather than the cushions. Also ground staff is not friendly they were rude on me. I arrived late since I received the message in advance that the flight is delayed. Then the first person I met from ground staff at Colombo asked me to change the ticket to next day since check-in counters are closed. Then after begging to him he direct me to his supervisor and since I have checked in online finally they accepted to put me in. This would be the last flight with SriLankan. Will never fly again.

### "Very disapointing"
Very disappointed in Sri Lankan airlines. Both ways has very long delays which caused me exhaustion. Food is not good, very spicy dis not eat anything on both flights. Very disapointing. I will never take this flight nor recommend.

### "Worst experience I’ve had with flying"
Worst experience I’ve had with flying. Firstly the airline lost my luggage when arrived in Paris, they didn’t give me a credit or anything and were like we call you. I was stressing as how you going to call me gave me a number to call if I need anything (the number didn’t work) I emailed saying I didn’t get treated well when entering a foreign country and I never heard back. I sent another email week half later (I moved on to other side of the country), to receive and rude email from them stating I need to change my luggage to found. Nothing about all what I emailed about the horrible customer service I received from them. I didn’t get any phone calls or emails stating my bag been found I called my first accommodation in Paris and they like we got it the other day. Travelling alone to and having to trek back to Paris was unsafe and stressful. By the time I travelled to get it I was deflated and so disappointed by how I got treated like nothing was important to them. Being left in the airport alone with nothing was already scary but to receive no emails, no help, no correct phone number and the horrible email stating it’s found. I would never fly with them again and I hope this helps people to not either.

### "turned out to be anything but pleasant"
I recently had the misfortune of traveling with SriLankan Airlines on flight UL217 from Colombo to Doha. Unfortunately, my journey turned out to be anything but pleasant, and I feel compelled to share my experience to warn other travelers. The entertainment system was completely non-functional. The touch display did not respond to any inputs, leaving me and many other passengers without any form of in-flight entertainment for the duration of the flight. When I alerted a male cabin crew member about the issue, he seemed dismissive and offered a quick fix that didn't work. This lack of concern for the passengers' comfort and entertainment was truly disappointing. Seeking a solution, I approached a female cabin crew member with the same problem. Much to my dismay, she was equally unhelpful, claiming that nothing could be done due to the flight being fully booked. While I understand that changing seats might not have been possible, it was concerning to realize that such a basic issue had not been addressed before the flight's departure. The situation worsened when I discovered that my seat's table was broken and hanging without proper support. This made it nearly impossible for me to enjoy the in-flight meals without risking spills and accidents. During meal service, the cabin crew's attempt to serve me food while trying to balance the tray with one hand was downright unsafe, especially during periods of turbulence. Despite my repeated requests to inform the cabin manager, no one attended to the matter, leaving me feeling disregarded and frustrated. Upon landing in Doha, I hoped to address these issues through the airline's customer service team. I promptly sent an email detailing my ordeal and expressing my dissatisfaction, but I received no response or acknowledgment for several days. The lack of any meaningful communication from the airline added to my disappointment. In conclusion, my flight experience with SriLankan Airlines on UL217 was far from satisfactory. The non-functional entertainment system and broken seat table significantly impacted my comfort and safety throughout the journey. The dismissive attitude of the cabin crew, coupled with the lack of any response to my complaint, only deepened my disappointment. As a paying passenger, I expected a certain level of service and comfort, which was clearly lacking on this flight. I hope this review serves as a warning to others considering traveling with SriLankan Airlines. I would advise potential passengers to weigh their options carefully and choose an airline that prioritizes customer satisfaction and promptly addresses passenger concerns.

### "never travel in this airline again"
We were scheduled to travel on UL553; on may 13 2022 due to a two-hour delay made in SriLankan Airlines, we missed the Air Canada connecting flight. It is worth noting that several other passengers also experienced this inconvenience. We discovered that there was no SriLankan Airlines help desk available in Germany, causing additional distress and confusion. After a twelve plus hour wait at the airport for new tickets were eventually issued to us for the following day. Unfortunately, we had to bear the additional cost of meals and endure an unexpected extra day due to SriLankan Airlines' delay. When I contacted my travel agent to make arrangements for our return, I was informed that the ticket could not be located. I am unable to afford purchasing new tickets for for the airlines system failure. Our stay has been extended while we await an explanation regarding the missing return ticket. But so many emails sent to airline by my son no reply by them at all if required I can submit the copy as well. I will never travel in this airline again.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Absolutely terrible experience. On the flight out, SriLankan Airlines did not acknowledge dietary requirements and lost our baggage for a week. When they eventually got it back to us, it was damaged. On the flight home our flight was delayed by 24 hours. They didn't communicate this to us until we were in the airport despite knowing about the delay all day and continuously sending emails trying to get us to buy upgrades. For every step of the way they were difficult to get information from and incredibly unhelpful.

### "Will never be flying with them again"
Lost bag and completely failed to take responsibility. Extremely slow and difficult to deal with, constantly refusing to help locate the baggage and insisting it was nothing to do with them. Will never be flying with them again.

### "The experience was good"
Not Verified |  Flown first time with SriLankan Airlines from Melbourne to Karachi. The experience was good. Very polite and friendly cabin crew. Seats were very comfortable. Loved the food. Tea, coffee and juices served frequently.

### "my flight has been changed"
I booked a ticket from CMB to BNE via SYD, to return to BNE on 8 July - after burying my mother on 6 July after she lost her battle with cancer. This was a very traumatic time for me & all I wanted to do was get home to my husband after the funeral to start the grieving process. I got to the airport only to find out flight scheduled at 0005 from CMB to SYD was delayed to 0110. I didn’t for a moment expect this to have a knock on effect on my connecting flight from SYD to BNE. As apart from the ticket bought online all through Sri Lankan airlines as a package deal, with the international sector being on Sri Lankan airlines  & the domestic sector on Jetstar (JQ), the arrival time in SYD (even with the delay) wasn’t impacting my flight departing SYD at 1740. I get to SYD & try to check in for my flight to BNE & get a convoluted auto response advising that my flight has been changed - like massively changed - to a completely different date, without verbal information given to me on check in at the Sri Lankan airport, or via telephone, or SMS, or email: Dep SYD 2150 on 8 July & Arr MEL 2320 on 8 July 2. Dep MEL 0705 on 9 July & Arr BNE 0915 on 9 July. Jetstar said there’s nothing they can do as the flight from SYD to BNE that I was originally booked on is now full (even though check in was still open). They asked me to call SriLankan airlines & request that I be put on the last remaining seat on Jetstar’s last flight bound to BNE for the day. I called Sri Lankan airlines and explained the situation to person on the other end of the phone. I got no apology,  understanding, empathy or action. I called my husband in Brisbane who was already on his way to pick me up from the BNE airport - to advise him that I would now only be arriving the following day, after being re-routed to BNE via MEL without advance notification. My husband then attempted to call Sri Lankan airlines yet again - still no explanation or action received! My husband jumped online & bought the last remaining seat on any airline for the day. We ended up paying top dollar to buy me a seat from SYD to BNE on 8 July on Virgin.

### "cancelled my trip with no explanation given"
Sri Lankan cancelled my trip with no explanation given, leaving me to scramble and try to rebook. I had planned and saved for years for a bucket list holiday and this airlines just pulled the carpet out without even giving a reason. Customer "service" won't respond and no other options or recommendations are given. Please re-consider and pay a bit more. Invest in your peace of mind, your time, and the little holiday that you planned. Do not book with Sri Lankan Airlines.

### "deserves an admirable reputation"
A few years ago, I had flown Sri Lankan's A330, which had a 2x2x2 Business Class cabin. And was now looking forward to the newer 1x2x1 reverse-herringbone configuration on the flight from Colombo to London. At Colombo airport, the check-in lane for business class passengers was drab looking with a well-worn red carpet. However, I was greeted with a smile and was given an invitation to their Serendib Lounge. The boarding was efficiently handled, and the 28-seat cabin was full. Welcomed with the traditional 'Ayubowan' greeting, I was pointed in the direction of my window seat. The seat itself looked attractive, in deep green-blue colours and shades of beige elsewhere. All the essential functions were within easy reach. The armrest could be lowered or raised and the IFE monitor had to be opened out for viewing. A large pillow and blanket were placed on the seat. The usual noise-cancelling headphones and Aigner amenity kit, slippers and socks were also placed in the seat compartments. The foldout table was sturdy, although it was not possible to move it towards you for a more comfortable position when dining. This was an all-daylight flight and no sooner had I settled down, than cold towels were handed out and pre-departure drinks were served, and I was wished an enjoyable flight. The printed menu had a choice of three main courses and a wide selection of drinks. I was a little disappointed that the whole meal was served on the single tray, and not the starter first, followed by the main course, to make it more of a 'dining experience'. However, both lunch and dinner meals were tasty, finishing off with coffee and liqueurs. A couple of hours or so after lunch, the window blinds were pulled down for a rest period, with mood lighting. Stretching my seat to a flat bed position, I was able to get a couple of hours sleep. The cabin crew passed by on several occasions, checking on passengers if they needed anything else. When I requested a coffee and cognac, it was served along with a full coffee pot, which was a nice touch. A most enjoyable aspect of my flight was the cabin crew, their attentive and friendly service and engaging in short bursts of conversation with passengers - some even posing with me for photos. The hard product may not be as luxurious as some other airlines, but on the service front, in my view, Sri Lankan Airlines deserves an admirable reputation.

### "the overall service was very good"
Not having flown SriLankan Airlines for a few years, I was not exactly looking forward to the 10-hour long flight in Economy Class. However, it began with easy check-in and boarding was smoothly handled inviting several rows at a time. The cabin layout is the standard 2x4x2 with a 32-inch pitch. The seat itself was comfortable, with a slight recline. The legroom was sufficient too, as I am not tall. And the footrest was certainly welcome. A small pillow and blanket were also provided, along with headphones. The IFE was fairly extensive with both classic and blockbuster movies, online magazines and games. Being a redeye flight, the service began almost immediately after the seatbelt sign was turned off. No hot towels, as it used to be years ago. Pre-dinner drinks were on offer, and when I asked for a whiskey on ice, I was served with two doubles! It was nice to see proper metal cutlery back again in economy. The main course of rice with chicken curry and aubergines was delicious, but all portions were sadly quite small, and squeezed into the tiny tray, just like those on European business class flights. After dinner, I requested coffee and cognac which was served promptly. Once the dinner service was over, the cabin lights were dimmed and mood lighting came on which meant bed time. I think I got about two hours of sleep. Breakfast was the standard Western menu which was pretty awful. However, the overall service was very good, and the cabin crew was very friendly and obliging, and engaging in small talk with passengers. Certainly one of the best economy class flights I have been on.

### "a very pleasant flight"
We had a very pleasant flight aboard Sri Lankan Airlines. From check-in right through to transit / hotel and the onward journey was great. We are glad we chose to fly Sri Lankan,

### "Terrible service"
I flew Sri Lankan to Sri Lanka from Melbourne via Sydney. When I came to collect my luggage, I was told that they are still in Sydney and the staff asked me to give them a call at 10 this morning. I am trying to call them since 10 (more than 13 times at the time this was written) and their baggage claim department doesn’t even pick up the phone. This just shows their interest in their “valued customers.” Terrible service.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight. Friendly staff, good food, drinks every 30min, good movies on the airplane system. I recommend.

### "a pleasing experience"
It’s been a year since I last flew Sri Lankan on this route and I have to say they have really lifted their game. A330 lie flat in herringbone configuration was comfortable and I managed sone good sleep. Staff were really friendly and attentive whilst the food was tasty and of good portion sizes. The toilets were also kept clean which was an improvement on my last journey. In flight entertainment was adequate although not the largest selection around. Price return from Sydney to London was very competitive and less than premium economy on some other carriers. One slight draw back is the long transit time in Colombo however the airline accommodates travellers in an off airport hotel so for me, an afternoon lazing by a pool in Colombo is well worth the savings in fares. Overall, a pleasing experience at a very competitive price which if maintained will have me fly with them anytime.

### "Pathetic service and nightmare"
Pathetic service and nightmare. They cancel flights just before 2 days of the journey and will put you through a long route. Even when you pay extra money for good seats, they won't give these seats. The aircraft is bad. Plus Colombo airport is a third grade airport. Never flying through them again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever, cancelled flights without any notification. Earlier layover supposed to be 1 hour, then they provided alternate connections flight with layover more than 15 hours. Pathetic customer service no contact number.

### "Overall service is great"
The flight departure and arrival to destination was acceptable. The food was great during the flight. Minus point is non availability of Sinhala music for IFE. Overall service is great

### "an absolute nightmare from start to finish"
Not Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Sri Lankan Airlines, and I must say it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. Not only did they notify me of a 2-hour flight delay via email, but their subsequent customer service interactions were nothing short of a disaster. Upon receiving the email about the delay, I decided to contact their customer care line in hopes of obtaining some clarification and potentially rearranging my plans. Little did I know that this would turn into a frustrating exercise in patience and disappointment. The first time I called, I patiently waited on hold for a staggering 30 minutes. Just as I thought I was about to speak with a representative, the call was abruptly disconnected, leaving me bewildered and frustrated. Determined to resolve the issue, I called again, only to be met with a similar experience. After waiting for 20 minutes, the call was forwarded to a voicemail, leaving me without any means of communication. Refusing to give up, I made one final attempt to reach their customer care line. After yet another excruciating 30-minute wait, I finally managed to connect with a representative. However, my hopes were quickly dashed as they pretended to be unable to hear my voice and disconnected the call. This level of incompetence and disregard for customer service is simply unacceptable. The experience left me deeply disappointed and has led me to the conclusion that I will never fly with Sri Lankan Airlines again. As a customer, I value transparency, reliability, and efficient communication, none of which were demonstrated by this airline. The lack of accountability and professionalism displayed by their customer care team only further solidified my decision. Air travel can be stressful enough, and it is crucial for airlines to provide reliable and timely information, as well as responsive customer service to address any concerns or issues that may arise. Unfortunately, Sri Lankan Airlines failed to meet even the most basic standards in these areas. I strongly advise anyone considering flying with Sri Lankan Airlines to think twice and explore other options. There are numerous reputable airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and provide a much better overall experience. Spare yourself the frustration and disappointment I endured and choose an airline that values its customers and their time. My experience with Sri Lankan Airlines was nothing short of a nightmare, and I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for others.

### "really need to pull their game up"
Not Verified |  Check in was smooth and efficient. Flight take off was delayed by 1hr. All passengers were sitting in the aircraft for 1 hr. Food was ok. Crew attentive and polite. Cleanliness of aircraft and toilets appalling.. this is a 10.5 hrs flight to Colombo from Melbourne so frequently toilets need to be freshened up. Not enough amenities in the toilets. Crew happy to chat but not focus on these issues. My seat cover zip was broken. Movies selection minimal. Connecting flight from Colombo to Mumbai was delayed. No announcement. Just had to figure it out. Was informed much later on some passengers enquiring about the flight delay. Colombo airport toilets are the worst. The ladies wash room had no tissues and just one handwash bottle. Cleaner not bothered to clean. It's like a public toilet. I would not travel with Srilankan airlines again. They really need to pull their game up in all aspects or else will stand to lose

### "Flight crew was attentive"
Food was good and served twice during the segment. Flight crew was attentive. Flight was 1.5 hrs late at departure but pilot was able to catch the delay and 40 minutes late at arrival. One minus point was non availability of any Sinhala songs in the entertainment system. There were very few Sinhala films available. It definitely needs improvement.

### "avoid Srilankan Airlines"
My Scheduled time was morning 7.20Am, they informed there is an issue in whether and flight will be delayed. After 5hrs announced flight has been cancelled. Only some passengers got seat to travel in next flight at 2.30pm. Their customer care was not best at all, didn't get a proper response from them when we ask the reason for delay. I kindly recommend as much as possible to avoid Srilankan Airlines.

### "rescheduled without notice"
The flight was rescheduled without notice. A journey which should have taken 12h became 24h and the passenger, my mother who is 77 years old reached home exhausted. She missed the train we had booked before the Airlines rescheduled the flight and finally missed the other train again as the flight landed late. It incurred additional cost as she could not benefit from early online bookings.

### "service and quality of food was good"
Overall the aircraft was clean, except the toilets did not appear to have been cleaned during the flight as there were tissue paper etc on the floor, and some items from previous flight such as headphones, cups etc were still left in the pocket. The service and quality of food was good. Unfortunately it appears that passengers are allowed to bring on board multiple items as hand luggage which does not help the passenger say in seat 19 able to use the overhead luggage compartment due to it been used by other passengers who are not in the vicinity of the seat. The ticket says 1 piece of hand luggage with measurements not weighing more than 7 kgs, (exceptions been handbags, computers) however it did not seem to bother the staff at check in or the crew on board. Passengers should only be allowed to store their hand luggage where their seats are allocated.

### "avoid Sri Lankan airlines"
My flight from Mumbai to Colombo was cancelled by the airlines and then we had to replan our itinerary for the travel in Sri Lanka. Again while return, the airlines was delayed by 6 hrs. If you can pls avoid Sri Lankan airlines as they will cancel or delay at their own convenience and not even take responsibility.

### "Beyond shocking service"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Sri Lanka (UL225) was on 7 April at 6:25pm. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before, only to be told that the flight was delayed to 8:10pm. We waited at the boarding gate until 9pm before being told it was delayed again until 10pm. At 10pm we were told it was delayed until 7am the following day. There was utter chaos and no one knew what was going on. Eventually we got told we would be put into a hotel for the night. We only arrived at the hotel at 1:30am. We were told we would be fetched at 4am for our 7am flight. We woke up at 4am, to find out we would now be fetched at 6am as our flight was delayed again until 9:15am. Eventually we got on the flight at 9:15am and took off. The TVs weren't working properly so we only had 1 movie option which wasn't in English and the seats were rock hard. After 35 minutes of flying the captain made an announcement that the planes windscreen had cracked and we needed to make an emergency landing back in Colombo. On arrival at the airport we were informed that the flight has been cancelled. They had no further information as to when we would be able to fly. Their next flight that night only had space for 30 people out of the hundreds on the flight. We were last on the list to fly as we were not a family with children and were not fasting, so we were told we would maybe fly on Monday (it was now Saturday midday and we had already been at the airport for nearly 24 hours). We asked if we could get a refund, they said they could not guarantee anything. We eventually had to book a one way flight to Dubai that afternoon with another airline in order to get home, which cost double what our return trip with Sri Lankan Airways cost. Whether or not we will get refunded I don't know, as they don't reply to your emails. And on top of that we lost over 1000usd booking a new flight home for the 2 of us. Beyond shocking service. Will never ever recommend them to anyone.

### "my ticket had been suspended"
On 28 March I went to catch the return leg of my flight from Colombo to Bangalore only to be told at checkin that my ticket had been suspended - I objected stating I’d had no communication about this from the airline & no refund of monies paid. After multiple interactions at the terminal the Airline told me the only way I could revive the ticket was to pay another $188. I noted I had already paid for the ticket. The ticket was a valid ticket notwithstanding the suspension placed on it. I noted they were holding me over a barrel snd demanding a duplicate payment for a ticket. I had to get back to Bangalore. There was no apology. No offer to correct. I have subsequently complained and sought a refund. I’ve received no refund although they have promised in very ambiguous language that I may get a refund in the future. They won’t commit to refunding the full amount of the additional monies they appropriated from me. I find this incredible and there is only only word I can think of to describe their behaviour.

### "airline staff was horrible"
Not Verified |  This airline staff was horrible. Airhostess is what it makes the worst, not serving food properly, I am a feeding mother and obviously need to drink water and have food on time. After lunch they didn't provide any drinks or snacks and we need to call them and ask for it. Even if we ask, the hostess was showing faces. I asked for a glass of water, she shouted and told wait. And never gave that, I felt so bad and she didn't even care about it.

### "A terrible airline"
Worst airline, please avoid. Our flight was cancelled where we had a 3 hour transit time in Colombo. This was changed so our transit time was 9 hours. We asked for lounge access and they made us wait for 3 hours then gave us a hotel to go to 45mins away from the airport. A terrible airline, please do not book.

### "Entertainment system is too old"
Food was terrible - fish and noodles. Toilets unclean with damaged seats. Entertainment system is too old that hardly works (keeps buffering). Seat recliner does not work with seats are visibly worn and torn towards its rest. Flight delays due to other connecting UL flights are delayed and the flight to Melbourne waits longer for connecting passengers Currently flights are full as aged parents and loyal locals flying direct flights but future competition will be challenging for this airline. To its merit, customer service in flight is great

### "an unadulterated disaster"
A very old and odd layout in business class and the food was terrible. About 2 hours into our flight, almost halfway through to Singapore, the flight had to turn around due to some technical issues. Worse, upon landing back in Colombo, the transfer desk was completely unprepared. You would imagine that as soon as the plane turned around the staff at the transfer desk would have been informed and prepared themselves. Not so at Sri Lankan. They had no idea and for the next 45 minutes nothing happened. There was no announcement or guidance provided to all passengers. The transfer desk staff hand wrote files for each passenger, again the thought of preparing a form even if done in Word and printing it 200 times didn’t occur to them. So about 2 hours later we were given a voucher and directed towards the arrival lobby. Unfortunately, the next snag awaited: immigration whose software did not permit anyone whether foreigner or local to re-enter the country within a certain time period presented the next challenge. After another 40 minutes trying to reset the system, we finally made it past immigration. The next stop was the arrival hall where we waited another 30 minutes for a transfer to the hotel. This transfer only actually took place after some fellow passengers started to lose their patience, as opposed to the Sri Lankan staff who were quite comfortable letting everyone wait for some unknown future trigger event to actually organise the transfer. The hotel was 4 star which I don’t think is commensurate with a business class ticket but I’m inclined to forgive that. We were told the transfer bus back to the airport would leave at 5am. Guess what, all passengers stood in attention at 5am but no bus showed up. Only after several calls by the hotel staff did a bus finally turn up at 5.40am. You would expect a Sri Lankan staff to welcome us and guide us, particularly since the promised e-ticket supposedly to be sent by email at night never reached, none of my fellow passengers I asked received their e-ticket. Well, no staff to guide us at the airport either and no instruction what’s to be done without a valid ticket. Onto the check in counter whose staff had no clue about our replacement flight at an unscheduled time and it took some time to explain the situation. At the time of writing this review I am still at Colombo airport and hopeful I will sometime today 24 hours later reach my destination, fingers crossed. So in short, Sri Lankan airlines is an unadulterated disaster. If you value your sanity, avoid it at all costs.

### "quality of the food is atrocious"
Staff are friendly and attentive bur let down by the quality of the service they deliver. It took ages for drinks and snacks to be offered. When they did come round it was time to close the doors and they were coming round to collect the drinks they had only just delivered. The quality of the food is atrocious, flying business class you expect better quality and for your options to be available, given this is most likely the smallest availability of business class seats available on a flight I have seen for such a long journey. The business class had 7 seats vacant so it’s not like they were at full capacity. Both dinner and breakfast meals were limited in their choice, with breakfast apparently only having 5 breakfast omelettes available for the whole of business class. The quality of the food is no different to that of economy. The fully horizontal seats are incredibly uncomfortable and tired, the blankets did not keep you warm at night, and a number of customers asked for more.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever! At the time of checkin they have charged me QAR 200 for extra 3kg of luggage and confirmed my seat number which I reserved online prior 48hrs. I brought some goods from Qatar Duty free, but they informed that they allowed only 3kg and informed to return to duty free or throw it. Again at the boarding gate without my approval they have changed my seat and the person informed that they have given the seat to someone else and issued a new boarding pass with a different seat. The way they communicate this was not hospitality way. I thing they need more training regarding customer service. This is my last trip with Sri Lankan airlines and never travel again with this and I will not recommend this to anyone.

### "The service is great"
The flight was full and cabin crew accommodated all carryon baggage of passengers utilizing first class overhead bins as well. IFE was good and there was lot to choose either music or films etc. Food was great. The washrooms were cleaned from time to time and condition was satisfactory. The service is great and highly recommended to fly with Srilankan Airlines

### "clearly they don't care"
My wife and I traveled to Malaysia and were scheduled to return on the 28th of November with the scheduled departure from KLIA @ 8.30pm. We checked in 24 hrs earlier on-line and there was no change to the departure. On the day of the flight as I had my flight details entered to my Google calendar, I received a message from Google that morning that the flight was delayed. Subsequently at about 11am another message from Google confirmed that the flight departure was delayed by about 6 hours! All morning and afternoon I was trying to verify this information with the airline with little success! Finally, after several hours I got through to flight info and was informed that it was indeed delayed by about 6 hrs! We NEVER got an email, call or any other form of official communication from the airline, leave alone an apology!! Since there was no communication by the airline, we had to play it safe and get to the airport unsure if the flight was to leave at the original time! After getting to KLIA we found the flight to he even further delayed by an hour making the total delay 7 hours!! Although we are Sri Lankans ourselves, we have avoided using Sri Lankan airlines because of nightmares such as this, unfortunately, because of the economic situation in SL and the difficulty our National airline was facing, we thought  we would be patriotic and support our national airline - a huge mistake which we will never make again!! We strongly advise anyone reading this review to reconsider flying Sri Lankan, clearly they don't care about rendering a decent service to those who patronize their services! !

### "Avoid if travelling with family"
Travelled with my 18month old. I had purchased an extra ticket considering it was a long haul flight. Trip back was hell. Her seat go taken away stating she is under 2 and does not require a seat. That got given to another family with a baby, who didn't pay for the seat. Then they decided to allocate seats for my wife and daughter away from me. I was seated 2 rows behind. I had already paid extra for seats together so how the hell can it be removed and given to someone else. Worst part was that for 11.5 hrs, there was no food provided for my daughter. I had to  go back to cabin assistance and ask for baby food. Considering that I had called 4 days in advance and advised that I will have a toddler so please allocate meals accordingly. Both legs of the long haul, we did not have food for our daughter. Avoid this airline at all cost if you travelling with family, even if you get a free ticket. Trust me, you'll be better off not travelling with them.

### "the cabin lights didn't dim"
Not Verified |  I was very tired and i was expecting to sleep during the flight, unfortunately i can't sleep because the cabin lights didn't dim throughout the flight and the cabin crew selling the alcohol in the middle of the flight which is very noisy. Also passengers keep gathering and talking in very loud voice. 1 hour before landing i was felt so thirsty and I contact the cabin crew from my seat more than 5 times, but no one approached me till we landing.

### "I am disappointed with service"
I am disappointed with service provided on flight UL503 from Colombo to London (LHR). Our family, myself, my wife, and two our kids have been seated on seats 21D, 21E, 21G, and 21F. Our kids has been seated on 21G, and 21F. When breakfast/lunch serving started, first has been served all kids except our ones. Our kids has been ignored by Cabin Crew, who was serving right hand aisle (i.e. seats 21G, and 21F). When I saw, that right hand aisle cabin crew started to serve adult, I drew the attention of the cabin crew serving the left hand side aisle, that my kids has been ignored. Left hand side aisle cabin crew served my kids immediately. When cabin crew started to serve beverages, my kids again has been ignored by Cabin Crew, who was serving right hand aisle. Then I stand and draw their attention, why they continue ignoring my kids, and serve only rows in front and behind us. They apologise and served my kids with a beverages. Such attitude is unacceptable. Staff on flight UL503 has been unpleased, unpolite, inattentive, careless. Another issue was with In-Flight Entertainment System. Seats 21D, 21E had non-functioning IFE system. I informed about that Cabin Crew several times, they only restarted screens, what doesn’t solve the problem. I said to the Cabin Crew that this action doesn’t help, as I did it many times, and monitors still do not functioning as it should be. They promise to restart IFE on whole 21 row from their side. However it never happened, as well as their promises to relocate us on the seats with working IFE system, as per cabin crew information, they had an empty seats available on that flight. I couldn’t expect such attitude from the cabin crew.

### "seats were comfortable"
Departure from LHR T3. Quick check in. Fast track a little slow. Sri Lankan use Cathy Pacific lounge which was excellent. Good fresh food, excellent showers and comfortable seating. Departure delayed by 45 minutes. This flight has a tight connection time so this was a concern. In flight all good, seats were comfortable and food good. Entertainment was sound. All FAs were very attentive. Flight made up much of delay en route. Connecting flight was held, all ok

### "Never travel with this untrustworthy airline"
Never travel with this untrustworthy airline. We have been lied to and deceived by this company. They owe us money and refuse to respond. Our flight times were changed and strangely the arrival time of our connection was 10 minutes later than the departure time of that connection (obviously we were worried). In a rushed phone call 2 days before they told us we had no option but to accept this change (and an extra stopover in India for fuel). We were promised that the plane would be waiting - it did not. In fact, we checked all the flight tracking websites. They only needed to wait 7 minutes to save us 10 more hours! Not only were we unbelievably late. We were stripped of our boarding passes, sent to a different destination with no explanation of what to do from there and given no food/ drink compensation. There were code shares they could have given us and chose to rerouted us instead. Honestly pathetic actions in the first place but more over just shameless to never respond.

### "the booking was deleted/cancelled"
My self and family came on holiday from Canada to Sri Lanka on 24th July 2022 and were scheduled to fly back on Sri Lankan to LHR on 19th August and via Air Canada AC0863 to Vancouver. I received below mail from Sri Lankan on August 10th “Dear Passenger, SriLankan Airlines regrets to inform the schedule change on UL505/19AUG. Your flight will depart CMB 0720Hrs/19AUG and arrive in LHR 1535Hrs/19AUG"  On receipt of the mail, I immediately spoke to my agent in Canada who issued the tickets and was advised that Sri Lankan needs to provide me an alternative solution since this was not factored in the ticket and delay is from the Sri Lanka sector. My wife and I visited the Sri Lankan office at the World Trade Centre at 9.30am on 12th August, to reschedule my flight since I do not have sufficient time for the connecting flight from LHR (0.35mnts). I was told by the agent the delay is due to re-fueling in COK. I was assisted by a trainee staff member who was not knowledgeable and understanding her position. She said cannot help me and since the ticket was issued in Canada and there are no seats in any of the SriLankan flights, it needs to be rescheduled in Canada. Subsequently I spoke to the Air Canada office in SL and they too advised that Sri Lankan needs to reschedule my flight. At this point of time another agent came to the rescue of the trainee agent and stated that I was supposed to come within 24hrs of receiving the mail. We stated that the mail does not specify this requirement. Moreover, the next day of receiving the mail was a holiday in Sri Lanka. She was so arrogant and argumentative the way she spoke to us. The agent said she will try to get four seats on the 18th flight however we need to get the tickets issued within one hour. I said it is around 2.00am in Canada. I need to speak to my agent in the morning. She was not willing to accommodate, with no choice I had to wake my agent and speak, he said that he needs to check with Air Canada office in the morning and agent spoke to the agent in our presence and requested to hold the booking for 24hrs which she did not agree and said the system will automatically cancel the booking after one hour. My agent spoke to the Air Canada 24hrs helpline and they also said the tickets can be issued only once the office is opened in the morning. I was left with no choice, no alternative given, they instructed me to call the SriLankan call centre on 1979 every hour and confirm the booking, which was not practical at all. I tried calling the given no and had to wait on hold for a minimum of 45minutes, spoke to an agent and then another 30 mins to get it confirmed. When I called the second hour at the same wait time and when I spoke to an agent the booking was deleted/cancelled and I was not able to use the ticket to fly back.

### "The worst nightmare ever"
Not Verified |  The worst nightmare ever. Flown many times before but this is the worst flight in my entire life. I have traveled from Muscat to Colombo and Colombo to Muscat and in both the times food was terrible and boarding place was an utter mess. Nobody was there to control the transit passengers. And airline officials didn’t help much controlling crowds. Inside the air plane no Air conditioning. Flight was horribly hot

### "What a joke of an airline"
What a joke of an airline. Avoid at all costs! I booked a flight from London to Melbourne via Colombo for November 2022. Before booking, I've noticed there is a 11hr 55minute transit in Colombo. I've called their call centre and they re-assured me that a transit hotel will be provided, and for me to make the booking on their website and call them back. I've made the booking and called them. After a very long wait, the agent bluntly said, since your transit was less than 12hrs, we won't be able to provide transit accommodation. He further said the policy was changed from 8hrs to 12hrs recently and I need to adhere to the new policy. I've tried to convince him that there are many good airlines that fly the route but I've booked this after confirming with his colleague. He just said it would have been a mistake and I will have to just wait 11hrs 55 minutes at the transit area of a 3rd world airport! I've asked whether I can cancel the booking as it was booked under false pretense, but he said it will incur a financial penalty, with absolutely no empathy or common sense towards a (very expensive) paying customer! I would stay away from this joke of an airline, as legendary hospitality seems to be the last in their agendas!

### "apathy and terrible customer service"
I booked a flight for November in July. Booked seats, meals, baggage insurance et all. There were non existent choices for food but a 16 hour flight required some nourishment so we made do. It’s a specific visit for a day - for a wedding. A very long distance and time required for such a short visit. But one that can’t be avoided. So I book the flight and book other requirements like taxis, hotels, meals etc. including hair dresser etc cause I have that little time. And they cancel the flight 2 plus weeks later. I was offered a flight the next day. The same time in the night. After the wedding is over. Makes no sense. I explained that and was told I will get a full refund. I scramble around and find another flight an hour later than this was to depart, pay more of it and ask for a refund for the one cancelled by the airline. 12 days now. Nothing. No refund. No response. I’m going bonkers calling a pathetic call centre. There is no customer service. There is zero empathy. Zero understanding of the situation and no refund for a flight that I didn’t cancel the airline did. And forced me to pay more to get another ticket for the same day. It’s a clear situation. They cancelled the flight. And we don’t have an option to go later. It’s not a leisure visit. It’s an event. Never ever going to use this airline ever again no matter the situation or what they offer. This is the first time I have ever come across such apathy and terrible customer service. Such a complete failure of a service provider.

### "Overall my worst experience"
Customer service representatives in call centers do not even know what customer service is, a horrible experience. It's a nightmare to deal with those representatives and their communication skills are very poor. Airport check-in service was slow as hell. It took more than 30 mins to checked-in the customer in front of me. Departure was delayed by more than 30 mins, with no explanation/ apology to customers (customer service at its best). Fuel stop in India hence delayed the flight duration by more than an hour. Dinner was served while the seat belt indication is ON and at the time flight was not stable (bumpy) at all. If the cabin crew had a little bit of common sense they could have delayed it and served it a bit later. Multimedia system only worked for 2 hours (out of 14 hours) of flight time. Overall my worst experience with a commercial airline so far & It was my first and last time with Sri Lankan Airlines, thank you for providing me worst possible experience!

### "they are just ignoring us"
Not Verified |  London to Colombo. We booked and paid, and then tried to find more information on whether we could fly with an infant. Customer service was 2h waiting time and they knew nothing at the end of the wait. So I cancelled within the 24h window of free cancellation. 6 months later I have not received my refund and every time I have contacted them, they tell me it will come soon, and then there is silence. I have sat on their calls time after time, they have 2K of our money, and they are just ignoring us.

### "the service provided by Sri Lankan Airlines was top-notch"
My mum's phone was stolen right before flying with Sri Lankan Airlines and the way they took care of her was absolutely phenomenal. For context, she had turned her back for a moment to throw away some trash and someone swiped it. She was due to fly from Colombo to Melbourne and then from there to Auckland. Her phone contained her electronic boarding pass, all her contacts, and essentially her only way of contacting me (a significant blow since I would be picking her up in Auckland). Naturally, she was beside herself. And due to several factors (that several airlines have to contend with these days) there was significant delay in the initial leg of the journey, meaning that she missed her flight from Melbourne and I had no way of knowing what her alternative flight would be. Sri Lankan Airlines was able to help in several ways. I am so grateful that the staff member in the Sri Lankan Office was able to liaise with the gate crew in Melbourne so that my mum would have my contact info and was reassured that I knew what was going on. I would like to thank the Sri Lankan Airlines staff member who conveyed that message and reassured my mum. They kept me apprised of all the updates including the alternative flight. My mum (and another passenger travelling to Auckland) were assigned an alternative flight. Because this alternative flight was departing late the next day, Sri Lankan Airlines arranged for them to have accommodation at the Holiday Inn in Melbourne. Throughout this entire ordeal, the service provided by Sri Lankan Airlines was top-notch and I can't thank the involved parties enough. I also want to thank the contact centres in Sri Lanka and Melbourne, eternally grateful.

### "a comfortable, cost effective journey"
Flew London to Sydney via Colombo. There is a long wait in Colombo however SriLankan put me up in a pretty decent hotel right on the beach to wait out my 12 hours. If you want a hotel, you have to book it through reservations and once it’s done it’s a pretty straight forward process when you arrive in Colombo. So far as the flights. A330-300 has the herringbone layout with lay flat beds which were quite comfortable and I managed a good sleep on both legs. Inflight service wasn’t outstanding, was a bit hit and miss but was ok. IFE wasn’t outstanding but had a reasonable selection of movies and tv shows sufficient for the journey. Overall, although not high frills, if you want a comfortable, cost effective journey in a pretty reasonable business class give Sri Lankan a go - I will fly with them again.

### "I was satisfied with the flight"
Not Verified |  I had a pretty good experience both ways. First flight was an older plane and it was a bit shabby but acceptable. The food and service was good. Our return flight was on a newer plane and and it was very clean and comfortable. Yes, the outward flight was delayed as they had to refuel in Malaysia due to lack of fuel in SriLanka but there was not much the airline could do about that. My IFE unit didn't work going out. I read my book and slept so not a big deal for me. Overall I was satisfied with the flight. The food was quite good for economy class and staff were pleasant. I would fly with them again.

### "they don’t take customer service seriously"
Extremely disappointed but expected! When handed the headphones they weren’t working so I told the attendant that I need this sorted as I couldn’t just sit there for 11 hours, he apologised and asked if I wanted to swap seats but I explained that I can’t just move seats, my partner has to as she suffers from severe anxiety however it wasn’t taken seriously. Then I swapped seats with my partner so I can watch something to only find out the seat doesn’t recline and it’s broken. The person in front had her seat far back and even though I asked her to move it as mine doesn’t recline she didn’t. Then I complained again and asked if my partner can have free Wi-Fi for a few hours as the headphone connection wasn’t working and he said he can’t do that so then my partner ended up paying but the Wi-Fi only worked for about 15 minutes even though she bought it for 3hours. I then told her to get a screen recording and proof of how many people are using Wi-Fi and there was 3 people including my partner. I spoke with the flight attendant again and I asked him if he can move us, we got told no as the flight is fully booked, so I asked him if we can upgrade and put us in business class and his response was that they’re not allowed to upgrade us to which I replied that we paid a lot of money and expect the right service. This is the only airline that I’ve been on where they don’t take customer service as seriously as other airlines will meet the customer requirements. I don’t fully blame the flight attendant as he’s following rules however I do think he could’ve done something to make our 11 hours a little bit better.

### "A lack of customer service"
Melbourne to Hyderabad via Colombo. Worst airline, delayed for 5 hrs and there is no information to customers. A lack of customer service. Please ignore SriLankan Airlines and no customer support.

### "the experience is a nightmare"
This is my first time about to fly with Srilankan Airlines and so far before even flying with them the experience is a nightmare. On Monday night, I received an email about the airline cancelling my connection with them from Mumbai on Sunday the 12th. My original reservation included another airline which is supposed to fly me from MLE TO Mumbai where I connect to Srilankan with SEZ as final destination. In an attempt to resolve the issue, I called since Tuesday morning and spoke with this agent who promised to put me on their flight leaving MLE to SEZ via Sri Lanka on Saturday night, June 11, around 9PM to arrive in SEZ on Sunday June 12th at around 4AM. I was fine with that as their next flight to SEZ on June 18th would ruin the remainder of my travel back home to the USA with Emirates. She promised to reach out within 2 hours and never did. I emailed several times but all I ever receive are general email acknowledgement responses. I called the Male office yesterday to be told that the 1 person who can assist me was in a meeting. I called back several times afterwards to no avail. Finally, I was told to call at 5PM before their office closes at 5:30. Then, I spoke with the same agent who spoke to me on Tuesday just to be told to email as she is unable to help and rudely hung up. Desperate to know when I'm leaving this island, I went to the airport but Srilankan staff was not there then. Airport information gave me a number that I called and spoke with someone whom again wasn't able to help me. After chatting with him on whatsapp for hours. He finally told me to file a complaint, which I will do in addition to other things but at this point, the priority to me is to continue with my travels planned 3 months ago.

### "very polite despite my little trouble"
I was running late, was 5 minutes to my flight time. I was stuck at security for an hour. I have informed the security staff three times that my flight boarding time is almost over but they say it is alright. The SriLankan Airlines team then rang my mobile phone at 3 mi utes to flight departure time asking for my whereabouts. I told them I am stuck in security and they were very kind to come pick me from security area and guide me to the gate. Special thanks to Jani, he was very polite despite my little trouble. Thank you for taking the trouble to ensure that I catch my flight!

### "trip was nothing but a nightmare"
I have flown with Sir Lankan Airlines for the first time after the reopening of the international borders post-pandemic softened in Feb 2022. The complete trip was nothing but a nightmare and the worst ever travel experience. Though I've paid additional charges on the ticket for the flexibility of changing the travel dates, I have been charged almost full charges for such changes made due to unforeseen personal events. Sri Lankan Airlines have applied penalty charges that are almost the price of the ticket on the date of change and made me pay the full ticket price. As I booked the ticket from an agent, the agent was unable to reissue the ticket without waiving the penalty (as I have paid the additional amount already for the date change flexibility). The agent asked me to contact Sri Lankan Airlines in the city I was living when making the changes to the ticket date. I contacted them over the phone, and they said they were unable to find my booking and asked me to visit their office in person along with my ticket and travel documents. When I went there, they said they are unable to change the date, as a travel agent has issued it and they have to manually calculate the fare difference for the invoice and they don't have the authority to do. Then have asked me to contact the main branch of Sri Lankan Airlines in the country from where I was requesting the date change. When I contacted the main office, they asked me to contact the Sri Lankan Airlines office which is located in the country from where I have booked the ticket. When I contacted them, they asked me to contact the agent, as they also cannot do anything. I have contacted the travel agent and he said they can certainly take over the booking and make the changes and waive off the penalty, as the travel agent was unable to do so. The travel agent has asked me to contact Sri Lankan Airlines located in Sri Lanka. When I contacted them more than seven times. Each time a different representative have taken the call and have asked me to repeat the full ordeal and put me on hold and disconnected the call all seven times. Finally, I was able to talk to one of the agents, Shimla, and she has put me through a supervisor. After listening to everything told me he cannot change the reissuing date. When I confronted them that they certainly can, and they are reluctant to help only because they have to waive off the penalty they are saying so, he simply told me "sorry about it". I have been going through personal grief and trauma, and during this time, I have to deal with such commercial-minded humans was not an easy process. Particularly, when I have done all the right things and demanded only what I am eligible for in terms of my rights (reissuing doesn't apply the penalty, as I have paid the additional fee for the date change flexibility). I have high regard for the Sri Lankan people; however, my experience with the Airlines is an absolute nightmare!

### "they will play you like a piece of baggage"
Terrible experience flying with Sri Lankan. They delayed my flight by 8 hours at Male, and then again by 7 hours in Colombo. All this time seats were available with other airlines but they refused to transfer us. My wife and I slept on the cold airport floor since none of the airport lounges had any vacancies and we were afraid to enter SriLanka (riots are going on). SriLankan Airlines staff were explicitly rude and hostile. They lacked basic communication skills and wouldn't even maintain eye contact. They were extremely unprofessional, not only with their work but their attitude as well. Several passengers, especially the elderly and families with young children struggled a lot, and they were given a meal coupon (as a pacifier). Cabin crew however were polite and warm during the flight, which is their only saving grace. The airline is very cheap, yes. But they will play you like a piece of baggage. Don't travel with them.

### "getting support from their teams is absolutely impossible"
I took my parents to the Maldives as a special gift, and upgraded the return flights to business class as a final surprise. During this upgrade process, Sri Lankan Airlines suggested I apply for a tax refund. I did this, but the airlines mixed up this refund request and cancelled our return tickets instead. We were stranded, and had to find additional accommodation and flights to return home, with no support from Sri Lankan Airlines. I understand there was some misunderstanding and was only seeking a refund for the flights that we couldn't take due to this error, but getting support from their teams is absolutely impossible. Despite phone calls and personal visits to their office, they insist they can only respond to queries via emails. Their team's response to emails is not only painfully slow but also never addressing the actual query. As a result, I am looking $1,300 worth of tickets being lost with the airlines taking no accountability. It's clear that their support model is designed to leave the interaction as one-sided with the customer having no room to have a real conversation, or receive any support that doesn't fit into their basic transactions.

### "still waiting for a refund"
Booked business class tickets to India based on the cheap fares they offered. Clearly, there was a reason as to why the fares were cheap. The entertainment system wouldn't work and the seat lost power during the flight. The flight from Colombo to Kochi broke down and we had to wait in the flight for two hours whilst the engineers fixed the engine. I have no complaints about individual staff, who were all courteous. I then cancelled my return tickets as I didn't want to fly Sri Lankan again. The cancellation was made through their office in India in December. I am still waiting for a refund, even though it's been 3 months. Have sent multiple e-mails to their reservation office with no response either. Will never fly Sri Lankan again and I would recommend that you use one of the other airlines flying to India.

### "don't have words how frustrated I am"
I flew with SriLankan Airlines Airlines from Sydney to Delhi and there was a transit at Colombo for 5 hours. At first when they started providing the food for being vegetarian myself I selected veg food before boarding the flight but they gave me some terrible food both the times. After we arrived at Colombo upon checking there is a transit time increased to 8.5 hours which was 5 hours when I booked. I am regretting why I have booked. This is last time in my life I flew or came to Sri Lanka. I don't have words how frustrated I am.

### "sleep-deprived and really angry"
Booked for a journey from Sydney to Colombo. The flight arrived late in Sydney. They started boarding passengers at 10:30 PM. Since the airport has a curfew from 11 PM, they couldn't fly. Passengers were deplaned by 12 AM. Srilankan staff was available in counters on the departure level. They took our name and told us there would be a bus that would take us to a hotel. Waited till 3 AM to get a bus to a hotel with a sleeping baby. Once at the hotel, there was a queue to check-in and it took another hour to get the room. That morning, we got a note saying that a bus will take us to the airport at 10 AM. Once at the airport, there was another queue to check in again. That took us 3 hours. we were issued a boarding pass for a 2:05 PM departure from Sydney and a transit time of 12 hours in colombo. Once we reached the gate in Sydney, they told us there is a delay as the crew is late. Once they arrived, the delay was to clean the aircraft. Once cleaning is done, they told me they have called the caterer and food is causing the next delay. But then, passengers were getting frustrated. They were demanding answers. Instead of answers, law enforcement officers were called in by the ground staff. Finally boarded by 4:30 PM. Once we reached Colombo by 8 PM, they started blaming the weather and passengers had to wait for another 1.5 hours to deplane. We finally got out by 9:30 PM. Went to the transfer desk and without informing the people who were in the queue, they pasted a sticker with the flight number of Kochi where they were serving business class passengers. Total mess and another waiting saga. Finally, accommodation is arranged by 12 AM and taken to hotels by 12:30 AM. The hotel reception told me that the bus would be there by 4:45 AM. Flight from Colombo to Kochi was on time and we did not encounter any issues Chaos and confusion is the only thing that comes to my mind when I think of this nightmare. At the end of the journey, all of us are sleep-deprived and really angry. We will surely avoid this airline for future travels (except the one that is already paid for)

### "Client service is practically non-existent"
Not Verified |  Horrible. Client service is practically non-existent. After one of my flights was cancelled, they put me on another flight which left 30 hours earlier, leaving me with 32 hours between my flights. Tried to contact Sri Lankan Airlines for 2 weeks, but only Facebook Messenger replied, and they couldn't help me. Contacted their phone number in Belgium and in The Netherlands, but none of them could help me. Wasted €30 calling to Colombo to stand in the waiting line for over 10 minutes. Finally, just 1.5 days before I was going to fly (and after stalking them on Facebook Messenger), they contacted me and rescheduled my second flight, so I left one day earlier than planned. On board, entertainment wasn't working at first, then, once it "worked", you couldn't watch a film because it froze all the time. Will never fly with them again.

### "a terrible experience"
Refunds via a 24 hour cancellation service on SriLankan Airlines is a terrible experience. Its supposed to get refunded in 14 working days as per the policy however I have been waiting 2 months for a refund. There is no central number or person you can call to get to the bottom of the issue and the call centres are staffed with people who will pass you to another department. In the end, its just emails to various depts, bookings, customer affairs ..so on without any hope of getting a response or your money back. Be warned ... the experience you are likely to encounter is terrible. We booked with Singapore Airlines at the same time as the ticket onSriLankan Airlines and had to cancel both flights due to covid restrictions in India. The Singapore Airline refund was promptly received while SriLankan Airlines is at best a basket case .

### "SriLankan have no concept of customer service"
Not Verified |  Poor service. Dirty plane. Awful food. Cabin crew were good. SriLankan have no concept of customer service. On return flight changed my flight to a stopping flight without consulting me. If I wanted a stopping flight I would have gone Qatar. Cheaper and much better. Will never fly with them again. I travel to SL at least 5 times a year.

### "very poor quality service"
The Flight was delayed and the SriLankan Airlines staff at the Melbourne airport are very rude and very poor customer service. The entertainment system was not working during the entire hour flight. Flight toilets are very dirty and the inflight staff do not do anything to keep them hygienic the entire 15 hours of flight time, especially in this pandemic (Covid 19) time. The food is terrible and did not have any options (since they ran out of what is in the menu) and was told to eat what was given. Thousands of dollars paid for the flight was such a waste of money and you will easily catch any kind of disease (not just covid 19) in those flights because of the very poor quality service standards.

### "It was a horrible experience"
I travelled to Sydney via the Australian Federal government-approved pilot program from Trivandrum-Colombo-Sydney. Our travel was not a good experience. They were out of vegetarian food for breakfast and the other soya chunks given was stale and also, the paratha was rock solid and I had no food to eat, I am a vegetarian and I had nothing to eat on my journey. I was ready to pay for the food but they didn't have any on the service menu and also they were out of the veg meal like I mentioned earlier, despite them taking our food preferences beforehand, this is really terrible and I have never experienced something like this. Moreover, our entertainment system was dysfunctional- mine and the one who was sitting next to me and some others but at least their headsets worked and mine didn't. We could not watch anything and when I tried, the movie was jumping to the end, I hardly watched for seven minutes, several rebooting was done but to no avail. To top it all, they were out of water bottles too. I don't consume alcohol, so while the others substituted that for water, I did not have any. It was a horrible experience and despite paying a lump sum, there were no basic resources that an airline promises.

### "cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful"
Not Verified | Heathrow To Colombo seat numbers 36a and 36c. The cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful, the screen was not working in 36a and cabin crew tried a lot to sort out the issue .. it came once after their several attempts  and then it didn't work consistently, but greatly appreciate the effort that they put and it was something out of their control. Also they gave a nice service and other members in the crew was willing to help for anything we requested. Food was OK though it was a fixed menu for veg and non veg. Would like to propose more PPI (kind of apron that they can use and throw away after each service) to the crew in this pandemic. Cleaning of the table is not acceptable.

### "never book with them again"
I will never book with them again. The seats are broken and dirty, the food is very poor and the bathrooms are dirty. I booked with them a trip from Male to Frankfurt with a 3 hour layover in Colombo and 3 weeks before the flight they changed one of the flights with a 12 hour Layover instead of 3 hrs. I called several times and sent emails to the customer service in order to get the transit accommodation but no one ever answered. When i went to their office in Colombo to ask for the transit accommodation they told me that as there was another flight arriving from Male during my stopover, i could not use this service. The staff in Colombo were very rude and do not help you at all. They left us waiting in the airport for 12 hours without giving us any possible facility. Although we were waiting for information at the desk, they took their coffee and talk to each other without bothering to help us.

### "have never seen this kind of service"
I saw some of the worst customer service, delay flights at Delhi airport but no apologies, food they serve was pathetic and dry especially the Hindu meal with no other option. Staff Crew were arrogant and uncooperative. Unprofessionally treating passengers. More important thing is the airline is not following any Covid-19 social distancing. The plane was full of passengers with no seat gap in-between passengers. I am flying internationally for the last 12 years but have never seen this kind of service.

### "disappointed with the customer service"
Very much disappointed with the customer service provided. I have booked my flight from Singapore to kochi via srilanka. On the date (Nov 11) When I booked my flight, there was no direct flight from Singapore to india. A week after booking; government announced there will be direct flights from Singapore . Since then I was contacting every week to Srilankan airlines checking about my flight status. Last week a customer service officer told me that my flight is confirmed on Dec 19th but he said there is a travel restriction for Indian passport holders till Dec 15th. That means Indian passport holder are not allowed to transit through srilanka. So since my flight was on Dec 19th he said there will be chance for extension of this restriction so he suggested me to contact them on Dec 15th to check about it if it is extended they will cancel the flights and fully refund. After that yesterday (10/12/2021) had heard that India is extending the travel restriction till jan 31st 2022. As part of that I called again to SriLankan airlines to check status of flight, this was very very very disappointing answer from their side. The customer service person told me that my flight is confirmed but since the travel restriction is extended and I am holding a Indian passport I need to check with Indian embassy whether I am allowed to enter India. I can’t understand how come SriLankan airlines is flying to Kochi since India as extended the travel restriction till 31st Jan. On the other hand if there was a restriction for Indian passport holders you are not allowed to sell tickets for them. What if I get stuck in srilanka. 2nd thing they told me that since their flight is confirmed if I want to cancel there will be cancelation fee. And it depends upon the agency which I have purchased ticket. I really felt like they are trying to make me cancel my tickets so that they don’t have to refund me. Really pathetic.

### "this grueling experience"
I have used first leg of my trip so far and it was not a good experience as no food options (halal) are offered but in flight service was extremely poor. To make it worse upon reaching Colombo, despite being a transit passenger we were forced to get a tourist visa at considerable cost. Then finding the right area to go to the transit hotel was strenuous. Finally, we did manage to find the desk, we were booked into Ramada and previously confirmed by the airline but we ended up in the Tamarind Tree hotel. This turned out to be a poor accommodation with insects crawling in the room and in terms of food no international cuisine was offered. Breakfast looked like dinner. With two nights being in transit to catch our flight to Karachi and losing sleep due to poor timings, I don't believe airline is doing anything worthwhile to reduce passengers misery. I now dread the prospect of returning to Sydney more or less in the same fashion and I am afraid I cannot go through this grueling experience. Despite writing to the airline nothing was resolved except fancy words and apologies. I will suggest prospective passengers to re think their options to fly with this airline as fare might be somewhat cheap but it is miserable and expensive as you otherwise spend on visas as well as your time spent. SL so supposed to be a tourist destination but lacks tourist centric behaviour.

### "Pathetic customer service"
It's the first and last time I ever fly SriLankan Airlines. I had a transit of 13 hrs, on the website it clearly mentions if transit is more than 8 hrs hotel will be provided hence did not book one. On arrival when asked about the hotel was told you have to register yourself 5 hrs before departure, why wasn't it mentioned when I was booking the ticket? Now they have delayed the aircraft another two and a half hours and all they can send is a lousy email. Pathetic customer service, would never recommend the airline to anyone.

### "not allowed to get on the plane"
We were not allowed to get on the plane because we didn’t have the credit card which we booked the flights with. And the horrible part is the front desk lady, so rude and incredibly disrespectful to an extent that is unbelievable. She refused to wait for us to get the card number and closed the counter and just simply didn’t let us get on the plane. This airline still is living back in the 90s! They still don’t know the booking process and the hundreds verification codes we receive to complete a booking. We are so disappointed and regret booking through Srilankan airline and will not use it if it was the last airline in the world. You need to train and educate your employees about customer satisfaction because this way you just lose expat customers. No words can explain our anger and shock from the way we were treated today.

### "not be changed due to policy"
Inadvertently whist booking online the child's surname was incorrectly entered. I tried to get the changes made through the airline as well as the agent, the only answers I got was could not be changed due to policy. I lost close to 1800$, tickets for mother and baby. Plenty of time almost 20 hrs in calling the agent and Airline.

### "No email, no explanation!"
Not Verified | Booked flights last year for a family of 4 - flights got cancelled due to coronavirus and refund was requested. This was accepted and stated refund by end of August. I have received a payment today after chasing them but the full payment was just over £2400 and I have received £1771? No email, no explanation!

### "still yet to receive a refund"
I was due to fly with SriLankan Airlines in July of this year, however, my flights were cancelled due to COVID19. Upon speaking to a customer service representative, I was told that I would be entitled to a full refund and that I just needed to apply online, which I did on June. It has now been 3 months and I am still yet to receive a refund and have not received any response to my follow up emails. This is not acceptable and reflects extremely poorly on SriLankan airlines, If this is how this airline treats it's customers, Now on I won't flight with Sri Lankan Airlines.

### "still yet to receive a refund"
I was due to fly with SriLankan Airlines in April of this year, however, my flights were cancelled due to COVID19. Upon speaking to a customer service representative, I was told that I would be entitled to a full refund and that I just needed to apply online, which I did on 15 April. It has now been 4.5 months and I am still yet to receive a refund and have not received any response to my previous 3 requests for follow up. While I can appreciate this is a difficult time for all, it does not take almost 5 months to process a simple refund. This is not acceptable and reflects extremely poorly on SriLankan airlines, If this is how this airline treats it's customers, then I would certainly think twice before booking with this airline.

### "say that they will refund asap"
The worst Airline in terms of customer service and handling of customers money. My Wife and kids were supposed to fly in Srilankan Airlines on 09/05/2020 and to return back on 02/10/2020. And I was meant to fly on 29th Aug and bring my family back on 02/10/2020. Due to Covid19, May flights got cancelled as a result airline promised to refund the fares. I requested to cancel my August ticket without any compensation as there is no requirement for me to fly if my family did not fly in May. Firstly, they said they cannot give a full refund for the August flight as the flight is still on. However no consideration given to the fact that all 4 tickets were booked together and paid as one transaction. Secondly, today is 20/08/2020, every time I contact them, they say that they will refund asap, However, it is been 3 and a half months and SriLankan Airlines still holding on to my $4000 for the tickets. Very disappointing as they are keeping my money for a service that they have not provided to me. Only reason i used SriLankan Airlines over the last 3 years is that they had a direct flight from Melbourne to Colombo and it is convenient to use them as a family as there is no transit. However the inflight service is very poor. Business Class is OK but nothing to be excited about.

### "Appalling customer service"
Not Verified | Appalling customer service - My flight was cancelled 19 weeks ago and I have still not received a refund. I received mixed messages from each representative I spoke with - at first being told the refund would take a couple of weeks, then 9 weeks and then by the start of August. It has now surpassed all of these dates and I still have not had concrete information on when the refund will be. The official Sri Lankan Airlines Twitter account blocked my friend for asking simple questions about the refund. You call up and they ask for one bit of information, keep you hanging on, then ask for a little bit more to keep you hanging on. This makes you think they are helping but it is all delaying tactics - they don't actually intend to help. It has taken them 30 minutes just to take my flight number. Totally inexcusable

### "refund policy  is unacceptable"
Not Verified |  SriLankan Airlines refund policy due to Covid-19 situation is unacceptable, we are due to fly 3rdJune 2020 for 30th wedding anniversary. Obviously due to travel restrictions we will be unable to travel, due to statement from airline all fees will be waived up to 30th May 2020 if cancelled. If i cancel or wait for cancellation they will class us a no show and then charges fees. Will be applied they say all flights operating month of June? Their own website states (see below) So if i cancel i will incur all cancellation charges totally unacceptable! Suspension of Visa in Sri Lanka Below restrictions were imposed by the Department of Immigration and Emigration of Sri Lanka in the light of coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. All types of visa issuance to enter Sri Lanka for all the foreign nationalities will be temporarily suspended until further notice Further, all types of Electronic Travel Authorizations (ETA), Entry Visas, Landing endorsements, Multiple Entry Visas and Resident Visas already granted to all the foreign nationals and not arrived in Sri Lanka yet will be temporarily suspended and they will not be allowed to enter Sri Lanka until further notice.

### "They are not paying me!"
I've wrangled for a year unsuccessfully with Sri Lankan Airlines for a refund of my parents' and my flight on 17 May 2019, weeks after Colombo's Easter 2019 terrorist attacks. On 28 and 30 Apr 2019 I called their hotline twice. The situation then was very uncertain after the blasts. Both times, I asked the personnel on the hotline if it was possible to cancel our 3 return Singapore-Colombo tickets due to the blasts. I quoted our 3 booking reference numbers and our names. I was told both times by the personnel who answered that I could cancel our tickets immediately on the call but had to complete and submit the refund request on Sri Lankan Airline's website to get my refund. On my call on 30 Apr 2019 I told the lady to process the cancellations of our tickets. I submitted the online request using the webform but i did not get any confirmation email and I did not receive any refund. I called again to follow up and was told to email the airline. When I emailed I was initially told that my tickets were non-refundable. When I asked why I was told twice when I called that our tickets could be cancelled and I could be refunded the airline emailed back stating "Please be informed that the company has offered a full refund only for the flights which departs from 21st APR- 15TH MAY 2019 and since your travelling dates are in 17th MAY, we regret to inform you that we are unable to offer a full refund. However we will be able to refund the unutilized taxes of the same, if you wish to proceed with the refund, please send us your confirmation for further assistance. I refused to accept just the tax and continued emailing them a few times. The customer service division eventually passed me to Customer Affairs Supervisor  who flatly pressed on denying a refund. On 13 May 2021 after months of frustration I finally told the airline to refund just the tax, stating that I reserved my rights to the airfare. They took awhile to reply, then finally told me that past one year of issuance of the ticket, even the refund of the tax portion was invalid! To this, I reasoned that tax was payable by the airline to the government. But if we didn't fly, the tax would not be paid and the fact that the ticket was issued a year ago could not bar me from receiving the amount of tax the airline collected from me. I have not heard back, but with the airline's outrageous stance so far, I am not hopeful. Sri Lankan Airlines may be going through tough times financially with the Easter blasts and now with Covid. Be extremely careful about believing anything they say about refunds. They are not paying me!

### "disregard for the customer"
Not Verified |  Singapore to Colombo. We were flying to Sri Lanka to celebrate my wife's and daughters birthday in March, booked in January. Then COVID 19 happened and as the situation worsened we called the airline to see if they would cancel. They refused a refund. We spoke as a family and decided we would go ahead anyway since there were few to no cases in Sri Lanka. The day we landed the airline started to consolidate flights and changed our flight time. What this meant for us 1) Check out from a full board accommodation a day early which could not be cancelled 2) Book a new hotel in Negombo next to the airport to make the flight on time. The flight was meant to be at noon, but was moved to 7am and we're travelling with a 4 and 6 yr old so parents will understand our predicament. When I explained this to the airline rather than offering to help us, they said the best they could do is give us a date change. How this would help us is anybody's guess. This after I had waited to get an operator on the call centre for about 45 minutes. Where things stand now, The callcentre does not have the "authority" to offer anything else and they have bounced us to "customer service" which is closed on Sunday. We need to fly out in 5 days and this lack of urgency and general disregard for the customer has shocked me. I've been a frequent traveller on cathay and Singapore Airlines and have literally never had to face such low levels of customer service. Never travel this airline if there's a chance you might need some customer service

### "extremely disappointing"
Not Verified |  Colombo to Melbourne. Service was extremely disappointing. We were travelling as assisted passengers as we are elderly. We got virtually no assistance at all. At one stage the airline staff left us at the baggage carousel and my 84 yr old husband had to collect the baggage with help from other passengers. Sadly I have another leg booked on this airline. I would strongly recommend that you do not fly this airline, especially if you are travelling as an assisted passenger. The cabin service was poor also. The food was equally bad. In addition, it was a rather expensive fare.

### "no extra leg room at all"
Delhi to Colombo. When we initially purchased our tickets and reserved our seats (12A and 12B), they were in the front row of economy class with extra leg room. We were told they changed airplane models and were assigned different seats (27H and 27K) with no extra leg room at all. When notified of the error, the airline offered us seats back in row 50. We did not want to move all the way back to row 50, especially since our initial seats were in row 12 where we would have been able to exit the plane soon after it landed. The seats they should have reassigned to us, the front row of economy class (now row 20) were given to someone else. As I am almost two meters tall, extra leg room is required for comfort. Their reassignment to row 27 was very uncomfortable and not at all what we had paid for or reserved online.

### "rude cabin crew"
Colombo to Melbourne. Flight departed one hour late without explanation, then rude cabin crew demanded windows be shut despite the fact that it was dark outside and everyone was awake for the meal service. They announced we could use the overhead reading light, which I did however, they turned it off without even asking me or looking at me reading! Really not happy that they felt so entitled, I wouldn’t mind if they had just asked me. I suggest that the airline offers eyemasks instead. Furthermore, the timing of the meals appeared to try to minimise the amount of work the cabin crew had to do - as it did not line up with the time in either the destination or origin. for example, we were served “dinner” at 3 am Colombo time and nothing until “breakfast” at 5 pm Melbourne time just before landing. Apart from that they just kept it dark and hid from the passengers. Bring your own food and entertainment.

### "Very friendly crew"
London to Colombo. SriLankan provides best economy class experience. Cabin service, entertainment system and spacious leg room a big plus. Very friendly crew, with smiles felt really comfortable in a long flight. Air hostess Ayeshmanthi one the best I ever seen in industry.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Colombo. Absolutely terrible customer service. After arriving in Sri Lanka I was told my baggage had not made it. I filled out all of the appropriate paperwork at the airport and was left halfway across the world with nothing but a backpack. My bags did not arrive until 3 days later on the evening of December 14th. In the meantime I purchased a few articles of clothing to hold me over. After submitting my receipts for around $200 US (or $50 US a day) I received a response that Sri Lankan Airlines was offering  $22 US dollars for all 3 days of missing baggage. Yes, less than $8 dollars a day. I reached out multiple times after denying their settlement with detailed receipts, credit card statements, etc but they have completely stopped responding. Whatever you may save on flight costs you will absolutely regret from customer.

### "The hard product was sound"
Check in at LHR was fine 3.5 hours prior to departure. Security quick. SriLankan don’t have their own lounge but was able to use the BA and Qantas lounges. Both were fine easy to get shower in BA lounge. The Quantas lounge was more spacious. Flight boarding was fine, welcome with usual fare. The hard product was sound, good chair / lie flat. Movies good and wide selection. Dinner service bit disorganised but the food (chicken curry) was good. I slept well. The big issue with this flight is the very tight connection time (40 mins). I expected the worst especially as we had a 20 minute delay. They did fine. Off the London flight and staff directed us to the next flight which waited for us. Our baggage made it too. Overall, I would use again.

### "worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  
Colombo to Dubai. I encountered the worst experience ever. If you're travelling with kids please do not book this airline. When I requested a bassinet for my 8 month old they refused it initially, telling me that the bassinet will be too small, but in reality it fit my baby perfectly. The staff have a major attitude and they are thinking it’s giving from their hand or pocket.

### "I expected more competence from the staff"
I had placed a bid for an upgrade to business class and was notified that my bid was 'under review' for the last 4 days (since the 18 January). On the day of my flight (23 January at 01.10), only when I went to check in did the airline decide to reveal to me that my bid was not accepted. Additionally, as a British Airways silver executive club member, I was told by the SriLankan Airlines staff that I did not have access to the relevant lounge. Even when I showed my executive club card, which shows my executive status, the staff member still did not allow me access. Only when I explained to the member what silver status means did he accept fault and provide me with the relevant lounge voucher. Furthermore, on the way to Colombo (from Chennai) the staff had allowed passengers to unreasonably extend their chair back and to remove their shoes (allow passengers to be barefoot) and raise their feet within the vision range of passengers behind them. As an airline that is within the same group as Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways and British Airways, I expected more competence from the staff and more foresight for the comfort of other passengers. I am extremely disappointed with the service this airline offers and am appalled by the way staff have been trained.

### "the worst experience ever"
Colombo to Bahrain. I encountered the worst experience ever. If you're travelling with kids please do not book this airline. When I requested a bassinet for my 10 month old they refused it initially, telling that the bassinet will be too small, but in reality it fit my baby perfectly. The staff has a major attitude and they are not flexible. I carried an umbrealla stroller (stroller met airline cabin specifications) to the aircraft and the staff collected it promising to return it back in the transit. They assured many times that my stroller will be handed it over as we land in Bahrain for my connecting flight since we had a long layover. But for our surprise in Bahrain they never returned it to us but has sent it to the final destination. Why would staff be so irresponsible after confirming their word?

### "Could not fault on board service"
Colombo to Melbourne. Overall was great, overcrowded business class lounge at Colombo is points off. Colombo Airport is no longer big enough for the amount of passengers at peak times and the Business Class lounge reflects this, at 11pm was totally full, no spare seats and was noisy and in need of cleaning. Could not fault on board service, crew warm, responsive and nothing was too much trouble.

### "staff are so polite and attentive"
I am a frequent traveler with SriLankan Airlines and I travel almost 5 to 6 times every year. New and very clean. Seating was good with loads of legroom. Their staff are so polite and attentive. The way they deliver food and drinks is not rushed, they are calm and patient. As an economy traveller I didn't expect the first class service. With there Frequent Flyer Programme you can earn and redeem FlySmiLes miles whenever you travel, whether with SriLankan Airlines or one world member airlines, The more you fly, the more benefits and rewards you'll enjoy. Can't wait to travel again with this Airline.

### "Be very careful when booking"
Be very careful when booking direct flight with SriLankan Airlines. I booked a return flight from London to Colombo for the 17th January 2020 for my wife and I. They proceed to take for the flight twice £1,145 Plus they have added an admin fee £252. I booked the flight on the 12th December and once I found out what they did, I have been trying to get my money back by emailing them six times and have placed eight calls to there non existent customer service. The fraud section of MBNA credit company has now intervene and is pursuing SriLankan Airlines for the refund they have not respond or issued a refund to date Monday 6th January.

### "SriLankan Airlines is really poor"
Not Verified |  Doha to Colombo. SriLankan Airlines is really poor. The planes are old, the food is bad, the staff is not helpful. They run out of blankets and keep the plane really cold. Unless it is very cheap, avoid it!

### "zero assistance"
Not Verified | Colombo to Singapore. Extremely poor service and attitude from the ground staff at the check-in counter. I arrived 2.5 hrs early at the airport. After clearing the initial security checks, arrived at the check-in counter and waited for more than 45 min in a queue which moved by 2 people for that whole time. There were more than 20 people still ahead of me at that time. I asked the staff at the check-in counter after another 20 min, as they started calling for my flight number. 3 of the check-in staff refused to help me saying I have enough time and asked me to wait in line. After another 30 min, the queue moved by another 1-2 persons and another ground staff walked away without helping me. Thanks to the kind people atound me in the next line, who allowed me to go ahead in their line to check in, I could arrive at the gate in time. I got zero assistance from the staff. Very disappointed at the standard of service and attitude of our national airline!

### "lack of communication and service"
Not Verified | Doha to Chennai via Colombo. Very poor service and attitude at the airport by support staff. We were assured that we would catch the 7.40 flight to Chennai before boarding from Doha and that information was transferred to Colombo airport. Our flight arrived 10 minutes late and they said they received no such information. The staff also were unaware of a connecting flight and completely ignorant of customers. If the flight would have waited for 10 more minutes about 30 more passengers could have boarded the flight. Very disheartened with the lack of communication and service.

### "all is extremely poor quality"
Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Colombo. I had travelled in this airlines earlier but now things have become bad. Except for the air hostess service, all is extremely poor quality. Right from their website. You cannot change your seats or meal preference using Manage Booking. They charge for seats and once you paid and booked the ticket you cannot change. The food quality is so bad. The airport staff at Colombo for Transit passengers in clueless about their own policies. The entertainment system does not work properly. Staff provides headsets 10 minutes after take off. And collects it 45 minutes before landing and there are so many useless announcements.

### "do not go with this airline"
Colombo to Male. I strongly advice everyone not to go with this airline! If you want to go to Sri Lanka, but only this airline is available, better change your destination! We had a flight with them from Colombo to Male. At the check-in gate they told us it is overbooked and we could not board. Due to having expensive connection flights we tried to talk to them about opportunities. We were at the gate two hours before departure. They did not care. Also Sri Lankan people were not able to go on the flight. They let them inside the airplane anyways after talking for three minutes in their language. First they offered us to fly in the night the same day, but 12 hours later. After 30 minutes discussion there was another flight in the afternoon available, how did that happen out of nothing? Our cancelled flight was still bookable in the internet while all of this happened. We tried to talk about compensation. Instead of showing that they were any sorry, they only tried to make us sign agreements, where it said that there would not be any possible compensation, for 50 Dollars Onboard Duty Free. When we asked them about it they suddenly didn’t speak English anymore! When the topic came back to compensation, they told that it was not possible at the airport. We should ask the customer support after vacation when back in Germany. Even when I asked for a contact person, the girl was not able to speak English anymore and just stared at me with a smile. I asked for a letter of confirmation that our access was denied. They pretended not to understand. Only the fourth person finally understood and gave us the letter. Afterwards they let again stand us in the airport for one hour before bringing us to a hotel in the airport. We asked for a phone call to our hotel in the destination to inform about not making it there, but they did not give us any opportunity to call. Only said we should try with our mobiles. In the hotel they gave us a lunch Voucher. The joke here is that the lunch started only after our boarding for the next flight would start. There was a Sri Lankan Airlines Lounge, so we asked if it was possible to get breakfast there because we were pretty hungry, already 2:30 hours at the gate. They denied the access. Hotel room was not prepared. The person from Sri Lankan airline just ran off ASAP, so we had no contact person anymore. So for real guys: do not go with this airline!

### "will recommend to others"
Singapore to Abu Dhabi via Colombo. Our holiday package involved 4 flights. Being a vegetarian, requested vegetarian food. Enjoyed good meals especially on flight UL302. Crew service for the flights was excellent. Only problem is the seat arrangements - very cramped. Initially was nervous about taking Srilankan Airlines. After this trip, was very happy & will recommend to others.

### "It was a worst experience"
Colombo to London connecting with Air Canada to Calgary via Vancouver. Started my Journey by Srilankan Airlines from Bangalore Airport. At Bangalore Airport My luggage weighed 24 and 24.5 kgs but they made me remove my stuff from One box to another and said it will go in heavy baggage and they charged me USD 75.00. And when I asked them why they are doing like this. the lady at the Airport said it is the rule you cannot carry any excess baggage. Even the guy supervisor was telling them charge from her USD 75.00. I understand they have to follow rules , but when they put the baggage tag , they put it at London final destination even though it should have been Calgary. This is how they work. When I told her please see to it , put the tag correctly, she told me, we will do it correctly. Reached Colombo. Flight to London was cancelled to 5hrs. Staff at Colombo Airport was also not very cooperative, when they issued the boarding pass for the next flight to London, then London Vancouver and Vancouver-Calgary. Got into the flight , there again the flight was delayed for 11/2 hour, when I told the crew, I will miss the flight they said they have a unknown baggage, and the owner is not there and for security reason they are removing it. And the funny part is I was in the flight and they did not load my luggage.At Colombo Airport the the luggage tag was for London and the staff at counter was telling me to pick up my luggage at Vancouver. When I told the crew member I will miss my connecting flight, they told me, you just tell the ground staff and they will wait for you. Anyway I missed all the connecting flight. My baggage lost. It was a worst experience I had with Srilankan Airlines.

### "unprofessional and unorganised"
I had a ticket to travel from Colombo to Singapore on 22nd April. Unfortunately due to the bomb blasts, I changed my flight to travel on 25th April instead. I paid the applicable charges. On 26th April they sent out an email saying they will not charge penalties for changes up to 15th May due to the situation. On 29th April I wrote to them with all the details for my refund. Since then I had called them over 10 times, sent over 10 emails and each time they say they are processing it ... or they are going to get back to be at the soonest, once they even told me that it has been approved and I will be receiving money back within 3 to 4 weeks! But nothing happens. They ask me to forward the email to their various divisions (reservations, booking, customer services, miles program) etc. as if it is my problem that they are unprofessional and unorganised. After waiting 7 months, today I decided to give up - I let them know I will not be pursuing it anymore. A big zero for Customer Service.

### "Very unprofessional people"
I and my wife recently traveled to Tokyo from Bangalore via Colombo. As the connecting flight from Colombo to Tokyo was more than 20+ hours I requested to book the hotel accommodation with them. Airlines initially confirmed the booking through email but when I reached Colombo, the staff said it was only confirmed for my wife, even after showing the email confirmation, they never allowed me to stay and none of the Srilankan Airlines staff members were available to sort out my issue. Please understand this was in the late evening of Nov 17th at 23:00, it really caused me a lot of trouble especially when I am traveling with the family at midnight wherein I had no Internet and local currency available. None of their staff members or local people helped me at that time, they asked me to travel here and there in the midnight but still, the issue was not sorted out. This is a big mistake and I regret using their service. To stay with my wife they asked me to pay another $87 plus tax for four hours as I have already planned the day out to travel locally. Hence, I canceled their hotel booking and took high risk in booking alternate hotel rooms for my family and also local travel wasn't available as it was a presidential election so I had to bribe the taxi driver to allow me to travel to the designated place. Very unprofessional people and poor quality of management.

### "very pleasant experience"
Chennai to Doha via Colombo. Had a very pleasant experience. The A321 has good seats with sufficient legroom and an IFE display at every seat. The cabin crew was very pleasent and delivered excellent service, the food on the other hand, can be improved. The A330 had ample legroom and good seats. All in all a good flight for the price and wouldn't hesitate from recommending.

### "never travel with them again"
Not Verified |  On a recent flight from Colombo to Singapore there were two passengers seated in front of me who had their seats reclined during take-off. I had to tell the passengers to put their seats upright. They were not happy and I could hear them talking about me. In fact as were were landing into Singapore there were passengers still walking around. Luckily they then sat down. I don't understand why they weren't told earlier. I will never travel with them again.

### "Overall a good product"
Flew SriLankan Airlines from Doha to Chennai via Colombo on their A330-300's. The flights were slightly delayed which in my opinion can happen because of some problems that isn't really in their control, so can't blame them. The inflight service was very good as the cabin crew were very attentive and worked really hard to deliver amazing customer service. The seats were comfortable enough for a 5-hour flight approximately and I would say its a decent seat for the price. The inflight entertainment is good enough with a decently sized collection and I did not face any problem using it. Overall a good product and wouldn't hesitate in suggesting this to others.

### "no wifi in the plane"
Kochi to Colombo. I was down with fever at the time of travelling. Asked for something hot (tea, coffee) to be served while they were serving Apple juice from boxes. The stewardess's replied they cannot provide as I haven't informed them earlier. They didn't ask beforehand what to be served. The menu displayed on the IFE clearly included hot beverage in it, so I didn't bother to inform them beforehand. The staff have no clue about being customer friendly. Also there was no wifi in the plane.

### "flight had left without me"
One of the cheaper ones available was Srilankan Airlines. I had an option to take Qantas for $100 more! Regret not taking it. During Check in - I requested if there were any Emergency exit seats since I'm tall and was worried if I would be able to cope for the 10 hr flight to Colombo. The Lady at the counter asked me to cough up $75 for a Seat and I politely obliged hoping to have a relaxed flight. I get into the flight to find that the flight was empty and here I see everyone stretching and sleeping on 2-3 seats whilst I sit there like a goose who paid for these seats. I continue to settle down and after take off I find that my Entertainment unit wouldn't work! I couldn't switch seats because the other emergency exit seats were taken up and I had to move back to a normal seat if I needed an entertainment unit that worked. This was after 2-3 hours of dodging around where they said they are trying to reset the system. Anyways this was the least of the problems. I am not someone who complains and I can understand we are not in a perfect world and things only start to get worse. I land in Colombo and I have a 14 hour transit. I'm shocked to see an international airport in such a pathetic condition. I decide to book in to a transit hotel and guess what they have a rule that says travellers can only rent the hotel for 3 hours and it must be just before the connecting flight! Nonsense! Why would someone want a hotel for 3 hours, I escalate this and apparently this is normal in their world. I go on to check in to a lounge which lets you sit and rest for 4 hours at $20 after waiting 2 hours at their bank which is unmanned mostly. This is a substandard airport who don't comply with the basic requirements of an international airport. No phone network, no Wifi, no credit card facilities, no currency exchange either. They gladly announce that the flight is delayed or cancelled depending on if they can restore the issue. I find out then that the flights are in poor condition and often delayed or cancelled and advised that the flight leaves in 4 hours and we meet at the same departure lounge. I meet the SriLankan Airlines Manager in Colombo and he confirms that its 4pm at the same lounge. I wait and I go to the lounge 30 mins ahead. Guess what! They said the flight had left without me from a different gate! Apparently its a silent airport and they had a few fools walking around shouting my name and I was sitting right outside the food court! Frustrated. I go to the customer service and I'm told that the next flight to my city is in 2 days. By Now my frustration level was at its peak and I couldn't wait in Colombo anymore. I ask if they could put me on a different flight to a different city. They oblige but I had to book new flights online to the neighbouring city and cough up $300 for it. Well I wanted to just get out of that place. I arrive into India and thank you SriLankan Airlines I get my 2 month old suitcase with all 4 wheels broken.

### "offer very competitive fares"
Sri Lankan Airlines is a gem. A great way to fly into South India with Colombo Airport such a good hub. I found the service close to perfect on board with very tasty choices and my favourite Chilean wine. The crew were professional, perfectly groomed, and very attentive. The first time in my life I've been offered a nice cup of tea immediately after taking my seat - and about 8 varieties to choose from. The Serendib Lounge at Colombo is a great place to work in with wonderful food choices. I selected Sri Lankan partly because its now part of One World but was also surprised to see how many places in India they fly to, so this is a very good alternative to mainline India carriers. However, their website needs to promote these opportunities a lot more, as I only found this out by accident and a bit of detective work. Finally they offer very competitive fares with business fares often less than some airlines offer in economy on my flights anyway. Needs to be 4 stars at least.

### "crew delivered faultless service"
Flew Dubai to Jakarta via Colombo on 5-6 October 2019. Check-in on line and got original BPs in Dubai transit including 2 more flights (with Malaysia Airlines) beyond Jakarta. This meant that I did not have to queue up again at a transit desk in Jakarta, which was very nice. Both legs were on old A330-200 aircraft where there were some minor faults in the cabin (no headlight, seats worn). Lie flat chairs in 2x2x2 configuration. All passengers who wanted could have a whole pair of seats on first leg. Business class was only 30% full and one could change seat if desired. Amenity kit provided. Cabin were clean and the crew delivered faultless service onboard with excellent, delicious food. I had two main courses, first spicy fish dish from Sri Lanka, and then mutton bryani of Indian style. Beers offered poor but wines and champagne were fine. Elaborate menu and drink list cards provided. Lounge relayed to in Dubai has now unfortunately changed from Ahlan to the Merhaba lounge which is useless as it is always crowded. Thus, I went to British Airways lounge instead as I have Oneworld status. In Colombo it was Serendib Lounge which is a cozy little lounge with good foods and tarmac view. Had shower and a cheese plate. 2nd flight were full in business. The breakfast was divine: a sophisticated local Sri Lankan Milk Rice trio with carry fish and pickles. The teas they serve are among the best in the air. The beautiful FAs make up for any shortage on the hardware as they are kind, caring, and attractive. Both flights on time. Can't really fault this airline and they are becoming my favorite when they have good online offers. The CC are so warm, focused, and truly caring. This business class trip rendered high value for money, around 1000 USD for a return trip which rendered lots of FFP-miles.

### "crew were eager to help"
Delhi to Dubai via Colombo. The quality of inflight services including foods and wide choices of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages made my flight better. The cabin crew were eager to help.

### "One of the worst travel experience"
My family flown to Colombo From Doha on 01.10.2019 .Had a very bad experience with the Sri Lankan Airlines. Before we book the ticket we ask bassinet for two month infant they ask to while check in counter we can get as they said we got 50D when we bored there are no bassinet available. We ask cabin crew after long argument they tried and they gave 20D. After that there are no any on board service provided by the cabin crews when we ask for glass of water after half an hour they served, when we ask for diapers kit they don’t provide. Their reply was flight from Colombo to Doha so it’s not available I was shocked. They know infant traveling from Doha to Colombo they should keep enough. One of the worst travel experience We had.

### "customer service is a joke"
Not Verified |  I will not fly SriLankan airlines again, the customer service is a joke. I flew from London to Colombo and my inflight entertainment did not work so I stared at a blank screen for 10 hours. When I e mailed to complain they tried to brush it off. When I insisted they escalate they responded with a 50.00 voucher  (insult considering the price of my ticket). I have flown with them in the past but never again.

### "all were taken well care of"
Jakarta to Dubai via Colombo on 31 August 2019 on A321 and A330-200, respectively. Started journey in Jakarta upon arrival from Kuala Lumpur by Malaysia Airlines. Online check in prints were accepted in JKT Airport so I avoided to exit transit. They are very strict on checking credit card information and cannot allow people on board without being verified. They use Plaza Premium Lounge in T3. Lovely lounge in a big panorama corner with long views in 3 directions. Got some snakefruits and guava juice. Fortunately, MH og UL now both uses this terminal. Previously, I had to exit transit and get a visa to enter among different terminals. Both flights were world class in terms of FA friendliness and care. Food was very good with 3-4 options. Elaborate menu and drink list cards provided. Drinks provided uninterruptedly and proactively in a charming way. FA attendants are the best in the sky to my taste. Well groomed, friendly, focused, caring, charming, smiling (flirtatious? ), explaining, suggesting, advising, and very honest and direct on whatever topics may pass. Flights full but all were taken well care of by hardworking staff. Aircrafts were worn and torn. IFE was not working properly and plugs are worn. Old, limited content. However, IFE has not any strong priority for me, anyway. Strange seating in the A330 machine, where the window seats in business class are lifted up 20 cm above all other seats in cabin; can’t sleep in such seats. In conclusion, good value for money and lots of Frequent Flyer Points given. First flight delayed 2 hours due to engine malfunction. Second flight awaited the delay of first flight, so eventually all passengers were delayed by (though only by an hour) at arrival in Dubai. Good for us but less good for the majority onboard 2nd flight for and extended 80 Minutes prior to take off. Not a good way for all as more people are affected and problems pushed forward. My two pieces of inscribed luggage were handled well.

### "value for the money paid"
Colombo to Phnom Penh via Singapore. Punctuality of the airline is commendable. The food was delicious with different options for economy class passengers. Beverages were served more than three times for a 4 hr flight. Comfortable seats, enough leg space and entertainment with new features are improving. Highly recommend this airline and ensure value for the money paid.

### "Business just 3 seats full"
Colombo to Dubai and the same 321neo as per Dubai Colombo flight around 20 days back. Business was just 3 seats full though economy was packed. Crew in business were friendly and efficient. Food at their lounge was fantastic and onboard wasn't too bad. Didn't make use of their onboard Wi-Fi but their IFE was enough for me. Only drawback was a major portion of the flight was severe turbulence that led to a seriously tiresome after flight which isn't a fault of the airline.

### "made my entire journey pleasant and memorable"
I travelled to Doha from Colombo on the 17th July, UL 217. As I settled into my seat, I informed the stewardess, that I suffer from sinus problems and requested a box of tissues and a blanket. I was surprised how she catered to my request immediately. She was also proactive enough to offer me a glass of warm water. The hospitality did not end there, just before take off she also brought me a cup of lemon tea. I have been a frequent traveller for past 14 years and only experienced such service in business class. This made my entire journey pleasant and memorable.

### "ample legroom and comfort"
Dubai to Colombo. The new A321neo with ample legroom and comfort. Their IFE isn't too bad as I managed to catch up with a movie and 3 episodes of my favorite TV shows. I did not avail their onboard WiFi. The crew are warm, friendly and efficient. Only complain is their ground handling agent DNATA in Dubai who's attitude towards business is beyond mediocre as they let Economy Passengers Queue in with Business and didn't do anything till I had given them a fistful.

### "extremely rude staff"
Bahrain to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Extremely dirty, trash in the aisle which never got cleaned up, extremely rude staff and when I asked for a glass of wine with the food I was told there was no wine left even though no one in front of me had ordered any. The steward fell asleep during landing, worst airline I have ever flown with.

### "Cabin crew were great"
Colombo to Melbourne. Late night departure. Dinner was offered but I choose to sleep as soon as seat belt sign was off. Cabin crew were great, movie selection could be a bit better with new releases and movies weighted towards Bollywood and S Asian movies. Breakfast served before landing . Overall very happy with service, seat comfort and food. Toilets clean. Only minor feedback, blanket could be a bit thicker and mattress would be good. Lounge in Colombo good , especially the food offerings. No complaints and would fly again

### "never fly SriLankan Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Colombo. Perhaps the worst airline I have ever flown. We booked 4 tickets for our family, 2 business class for adults, 2 economy for teenagers. Although we are priority pass members and my husband a platinum oneworld member the customer service at the airlines would not allow all 4 of us to use lounge facilities. Only 3 were allowed. We offered to pay for the 4th (child) but this was also not allowed. Instead they suggested we all head to the Lotus lounge where all 4 of us would need to pay. They were rude with all transactions and have a distinct ‘don’t care’ attitude. I will never fly SriLankan Airlines again. Their rude approach to us was unnecessary and offensive. At a time when visitors to Sri Lanka might be encouraged I suggest you use another airline if you’re looking to visit. We certainly will not be returning and will never pay fir a seat on SriLankan Airlines again.

### "carry on bag is too big!
Delhi to Melbourne via Colombo. I booked this airline for my parents . Airline staff asked them to pay Rs 10000/- on boarding time and they said the carry on bag is too big size and can’t be carry as carry bag and they have to put in Luggage. After they have received the Rs 10000/- they allowed them to put same size of bag in cabin as carry bag. They did not provide any wheelchair assistance to my parents even I sent to them medical report with form as email more than two months before signed by my mothers doctor she can’t walk for long time. I would never book with this airline in future.

### "provide bad service"
Colombo to Trivandrum. I paid equivalent to USD 236 for 35 minute flight. No refreshing paper tissue given. Meal was pastry in cardboard box and glass of apple juice. No choice. Asked for glass of water which I never got. This is not the first time I found SriLankan airlines provide bad service. But this was my worst experience.

### "reached the gate 5 mins after it closed"
Bangalore to Melbourne via Colombo. I reached the gate 5 mins after it closed. But the staff didn't let me board and had pulled out my luggage from the aircraft. The ground manager didn't give me an opportunity to explain my situation neither tried to get me on to the flight, where I think there was a still a chance for me to board. No staff was of any help, they made fun of me for missing the flight and nobody there was giving any information on what must be done next. They took my passport and my boarding pass and didn't return for long. I was standing there looking at what to do. I was stranded at the airport without knowing what is happening. I was advised to get new tickets and then they would tag my luggage to the new ticket. This is all the information I got and on repeatedly asking them to guide me. I requested them to assist me at least to the Singapore airline’s kiosk, to get the information on their flights as I could see there was one available seat on their flight, but they mentioned: “there is no kiosk at transit and Transfer service can’t provide any additional information.” I requested them to provide me with accommodation for that night, they had no answer for that. I was a single traveller, missed the flight stranded in the airport and don’t know where to stay that night, need to re-book a new flight with real bad airport Wi-Fi and no flight is available until next day, staff being unemphatic about my situation. I had to pay double the price for my new ticket and take a longer route to reach Melbourne. This is experience is unforgettable and the way I was treated.

### "service provided with a smile"
Colombo to Male. If you compare SriLankan Airlines to premium airlines in terms of sophistication, they have a lot to gain, but in terms of hospitality, Sri Lankan should be on top. Check in was great, with no queues, and their lounge at BIA serves meals with good quality wine (including sparkling) and snacks. The seat / cabin was okay, and the food served on board looked a bit tired. However, the service was provided with a smile.

### "a terrible experience"
Colombo to Chennai. We booked a business class ticket and was given an economy class ticket, when asked at the business class custom care desk in Colombo they replied with an attitude, if you're down graded ask for a refund from your agent. This was a rude way of answer. And they even replied "the flight didn't have a business class on the aircraft" On entering the aircraft we were shocked and, asked the air hostess for a reason and they asked us to go and find out from the ground staff. This is a terrible experience and I will never travel in this airline again.

### "pleasant staff and decent food"
Colombo to Doha. This is the second segment of my flight from Jakarta to Doha, transiting through Colombo. The reason I break it to 2 reviews because of different aircraft types and ground service experience. This A330-300 was equipped with reverse herringbone 1-2-1 seat configuration, generally my favorite as a solo traveler. However, the seat cushion was not as comfortable as on the earlier A330-200. Boarding was a bit less than ideal. CMB has security checkpoints right before the holding room at departure gates, which was a norm at many other airports. However, despite of a sign noting that business class passengers got priority screening, there was no dedicated line, and everyone was trying to squeeze through a narrow doorway to get to the screening machine. The holding room was tight with no WC and not enough seats. In-flight experience was similar to the CGK-CMB flight, meaning pleasant staff and decent food. The flight departed on-time. Overall, I'd pick this airline again considering its attractive price.

### "In-flight service was quite pleasant"
Jakarta to Colombo. I booked SriLankan Airlines due to its attractive price, and that proved to be a good deal. The A330-200 showed it age, with 2-2-2 configuration and worn out seats. However, the seats reclined to a fully-flat bed and were quite comfortable. In-flight service was quite pleasant, and the meal was decent, with all dishes were presented on one tray. SriLankan Airlines provided access to the Plaza Premium Lounge at Jakarta airport, and this was one of my preferred lounges. The flight departed and arrived on time. Overall, I think this was very good value.

### "refused to compensate us"
Sri Lankan refused to compensate us for the flights with their airline they caused us to miss, had to book flight with another airline when our connecting flight was cancelled due to a technical issue. Left us out of pocket well over £1000 and made us wait around the airport to fight amongst locals for help. Eventually refused to help us and would have had us sleep on the floor in an Indian airport. Out of 4 flights booked with Sri Lankan only 1 was successful, didn't get any compensation for the other 3.

### "ground staff is very rude"
Colombo to New Delhi. The ground staff is very rude. I was in the checkin line which was just a normal line. After entertaining few customers the staff refused to give me a boarding pass. I waited for around half an hour in that row and then was refused. They changed the details on the screen, before it was just check in and they suddenly changed it to online check in. I requested them and also told that the screen read just check in and I was guided by their own staff. Ridiculous experience. Also the flight experience is not that great.

### "upgraded my ticket free"
Doha to Colombo. SriLankan upgraded my ticket free of charge to business class. Cabin crew and were attentive very courteous. Food was delicious. AVOD system is very good. Hope to fly with SriLankan Again

### "seats are recliner seats"
Singapore to Colombo. There are 12 seats in business class on the Sri Lankan A320 in a 2-2 layout. The seats are recliner seats in full leather. After boarding was offered champagne and cashew nuts. I had the butter chicken Marsala as the main course and it was delicious. The flight attendant was friendly and attentive. I ordered tea for post-dinner beverage, served on a silver platter with teapot. The entertainment system has an average selection of Hollywood movies for the 3.5 hour flight. There was an extensive selection of Bollywood and Sri Lankan movies. Most of the channels were dedicated to Hindi and Arabic music while the classical selection was limited. There was onboard wifi but I did not use it being such a short flight. For a short regional business class flight, I would rate Sri Lankan Airlines favourably. They could however, improve on their online portal to enable passengers to pre-order economy a la carte meals online rather than having to order through phone. Same for their Serenesiva Transit Hotel where only e-mail or phone reservations are accepted.

### "is a bit of a mixed bag"
London to Colombo. I have to say, this airline is a bit of a mixed bag. I found out I was pregnant shortly before we flew, so we tried to call their customer service desk to ensure I had an aisle seat and ideally a bit of extra space. However, customer service were of no help at all and said we could only do this upon check in. So we wait until check in opens, and it would not let us change our seats even though we could see seats available. So again we call customer services, and again they say there is nothing they can do. So we decide to arrive at the airport 4 hours early to speak to someone at the desk, where AGAIN they say there is nothing they can do. I personally think this is an awful way to treat someone pregnant when going on a long haul flight. Our flight out was a night flight, and we were pleasantly surprised with the amount of leg room. My partner is 6ft 2 and said it was one of the more spacious flights he had been on. The food, however, not so good. When they got to us all they had was the fish option left, to which my partner hates fish so he did not eat and went hungry. On the return flight we managed to assign ourselves seats with extra leg room so my partner was very happy. It made for a very comfortable flight, and as we were near the air stewards, we got first choice of food this time which was tasty and actually warm!

### "A321 a huge disappointment"
Dubai to Jakarta via Colombo on A321s. Check-in online 2 days prior to departure went smoothly and my print-outed BPs were accepted in Dubai (by emigration and lounge). Equipment downgrade to A321 narrow body was a huge disappointment (no lie flat, etc.). Lounge used in Dubai have been downgraded from the luxurious Ahlan Business Lounge to the much poorer and overcrowded, messy Marhaba. The latter was so crowded that I had to escape to the BA Executive Lounge, opposite, which was quiet and nice. Flights faultless and only slightly delayed. The Narrow bodies had no lie flat beds and the cabins hold only 16 seats in business. Flights ¾ full only. No amenity kits nor pyjamas were given. Menus and menu cards fine, food very good, poor beer selection, wines average. The FAs hospitality is great, they are well groomed, well-rested, pro-active, flirtatious, humble, and kind. STPC in Colombo functioned well but precious time consumed to leave the airport (queued 6 times: transit counter (to get voucher), visa on arrival, immigration, baggage pick-up, bus-transfer. Likewise on way back from town to Airport. Colombo Airport is messy and many procedures are slow or unclear. I had a serious luggage issue as they had double checked in a bag of mine and only to half of the routing. Found it by incident in CMB left at conveyor belt despite it was promised by 3rd party check-in staff in DXB to go to “at least CGK” (I had 4 legs more on other flights after this one). Mileage earned were generous and were inserted correctly on my BA FFP pgm. Despite they tend to be my present favorite airline, I can only rate them 7 of 10 at this time. IFE was OK. Ticket was cheap due to promotion, purchased 300 days prior to departure. For tickets over 700 USD and with transit more than 8 hours they provide STPC in a decent Hotel in Colombo which is a relief.

### "good food served"
Not Verified |  London to Colombo. Excellent service and good food served with metal cutlery. Clean toilet. Good range of inflight entertainment. Plastic (drinking cups) waste could be cut down.

### "my whole bag was wet"
Dubai to Dhaka via Colombo. However seat with good pitch but not comfortable for sleep. Food was delicious and attentive crew. In-flight entertainment was unmentionable. My horrible experience was started when I came to conveyor belt, my bag came after 45 minutes of flight embarked to the gate and I found my whole bag was wet and all stuff inside was wet as well. I open a bag in front of Airline Staff and asked for written complaint. He showed, he was so busy and not authorized to take complaint. He informed his superior and told for wait a bit, I waited for another half an hour but no one has been came to attend to me.

### "staff were polite and kind"
Riyadh to Madurai via Colombo. The food quality was amazing, staff were polite and kind,  transit was easy and quick. I recommend this airline if you are travelling to southern parts of India from some other country.

### "An amazing crew"
Colombo to Dubai. An amazing crew on UL225 on 8Feb, for me they made the flight one of the best I've flown for the last couple of years.

### "Food not up to expectations"
Mumbai to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Good Service from the Cabin Crew. Airline on time but delayed due to passengers which is not the fault of the airline. Airline seat spacing was too close. The seat I was occupying was damaged and had a jagged opening. This was complained to the cabin crew by the passenger next to me but nothing was done about it. Food not up to expectations. This sector did not have In flight entertainment.

### "service was impeccable"
Melbourne to Colombo. I haven't flown with SriLankan since the early 2000s due to extremely bad delays and appalling service. I thought of trying them after this long assuming they've changed and it was convenient to fly direct to Colombo from Melbourne. To my surprise, the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The service was impeccable. The food was delicious with so many different food. Loved the tea service on board. The entertainment system and the seat weren't that great on the CMB-MEL sector. MEL-CMB was an A330-300. The seat was very good on that particular flight but the return flight's seat wasn't good. The cabin crew personally welcomed me at the beginning of the flight and thanked me at the end of the flight. The cabin was clean. I will fly with SriLankan again.

### "really surprised"
Colombo to Singapore - really surprised. Whilst the checkin at Colombo is very average (dirty carpets at business class, long queues, unkempt staff) onboard is much better. The crew were nice and the big TVs in economy are great. I had not flown with SriLankan in over 10 years and wouldn’t hesitate booking them again. A few things though, get newer movies and retire the old A330. The A320 was much nicer.

### "Bankrupt, badly run airline."
London to Kuala Lumpur via Colombo. Was scheduled to fly in seats 10 A, 10C on the leg of the flight from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur on 7th Jan 2018. Arrived at Colombo after a 11 hr flight from London, after a scheduled wait of some 2.5 hrs checked into the flight from Colombo to KUL only to be told in a brusque manner by ground staff that we would be at the back of the aircraft in spite of us having pre booked window and aisle seats. Our new seating was in the middle and aisle. Moreover we were asked to check in our hand baggage as this was a smaller A320 aircraft. Others were allowed to take their larger hand baggage onboard. The same situation regarding seat switching happened on the return journey JUL to CMB ON the 12th of Jan. Service was without smiles on both occasions. Bankrupt, badly run airline. As a frequent flyer I would not be travelling the LHR CMB sector with them again. There are much better alternatives albeit slightly more expensive ones.

### "sleep in the floor of airport"
Bangkok to Mumbai via Colombo. We landed at Colombo and went to catch our flight for Mumbai, as we reached we were told the flight had left. There protocol says we should get 45min between the two flights we landed at 10.58.pm and we reached the gate at 11.15pm. After which we asked the SriLankan Airlines to compensate for us they put us in to the next flight which was after 15 hours we were told they will not provide accommodations - the manager on duty and other employees were busy talking in they regional language and kept making fun of us. We had to sleep on the floor of the airport for 15 hours - this is the SriLankan Hospitality make ladies sleep in the floor of the airport.

### "I was more than satisfied2
London to Jakarta via Colombo. This was the return leg of my Christmas trip back to London. Overall, for the price, I was more than satisfied with Srilankan. The LHR - CMB overnight leg was fine; efficient crew, plenty of food and drink offerings and a newish aircraft (A330-300). The seat is OK but there's no mattress pad or duvet offered, just a fairly thin blanket, so it's not the most comfortable for sleeping. The IFE is just about adequate (it was the same in January as it was in December) but I'd say it's more geared towards the south Asian market with lots of Bollywood films. For transit of 8 hours+ the airline offers a complimentary hotel room but this seems to be assigned in a completely random way - initially, I was given a room at the Serendiva transit hotel which would have meant I couldn't have left the airport for my 18 hour transit (plus it gets horrible reviews on TA) - I dug my heels in and asked for something else. Eventually, they agreed and gave me a room at the Ramada, which was a 15-minute drive from the airport.There doesn't seem to be any distinction made between what economy and business-class passengers are offered, which seems slightly strange. Before the early morning CMB - CGK leg I went to the Srilankan Airlines Serendib Lounge which isn't that great, to be honest - greeted with an unsmiling 'Do you have an invitation? and the hot breakfast food was cold. This second flight was on a much older A330-200, which was fine for a 4-hour flight - friendly crew and on-time arrival.

### "storage space is incredibly little"
Dubai to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Ticket is priced competitively. For this route, UL deployed their smaller but new A320 Neo air craft. The usual good service and catering on board delivered, which is what I expect of UL. Seat pitch is sufficient for a single aisled air craft. Good recline and god touch screen AVOD. However, the storage space is incredibly little. Since the seat "pocket" is made out of hard plastic which is mounted onto the seat, it is more like a seat "rack", than a regular pocket with spring that can expand. That present a serious problem for storing the headphone and other things. To me, that's a huge design fail. Also there is hardly any space for putting a glass of welcome drink, unless you must pull out the tray table. Whatever the airbus company was thinking when designing these seats? It is worth noting that UL has other older types A320 in their fleet, the older sears are actually a lot more spacious, with decent seta pockets that offer good storage. This is a rare case when older is better than newer.

### "food for me was excellent"
Bangalore to London via Colombo. The food for me a diabetic was excellent. The TV screens were working well and we enjoyed a couple of movies. However Bangalore - Colombo they did not give us any headphones citing short flight. I just want to make an important point - try and avoid too much single use plastic. It's not good for the environment and airlines could cut back on so many sachets etc in use.

### "Return trip was disappointing"
Not Verified |  London to Colombo return. Flight out super staff very hard working good meal and lots of wine top ups. Return trip was disappointing. After lunch the cabin lights went off until the next meal not what we expected as this was a daylight flight. I know people like to rest but this was too long.

### "given us a bad experience"
Colombo to Singapore. We had booked Hindu meals. We were given a menu card showing 3 options during both the to and fro trips. During our journey from Singapore we were asked to place our order. Since my sister in law doesnt not consume chicken she had opted for chapati and veg set. But during the return trip she was given milk rice and chicken set although she requested for the chapati and veg set. The stewardess insisted that as we had order Hindu meals and that is what she will get. I was very upset on the way the stewardess behaved. She said she has to serve the rest of the passengers before she could accede to her request. More care should have been shown especially to elderly passengers. My sister in law and I had to ask a few times before the correct food was served. This episode has given us a bad experience. Please clarify how the chicken is classified as Hindu Meal.

### "staff was incompetent"
Colombo to Mumbai. The staff was incompetent, when meals were served the stewardess was rude to guests. They had a list with seats allocated with vegetarian option. Supposedly our names were not there which is not possible. So the stewardess asked us many times if we had ordered food. My problem is that why is the aircraft not carrying extra meals in such cases. After the meals the stewards and stewardesses just disappeared. We paid good money for this flight and basic service is expected. Food was so bad. Non veg got chicken and pineapple halwa while veg got beetroot curry and 4 pieces of fruit.

### "SriLankan Airlines never again"
London to Male via Colombo. On our way from Heathrow to Male we discovered that the plug for the earphones is broken. Reported it to the staff but they have not even tried to sit us somewhere else saying the plane was full. On our way back same plane same seat the plug was still not fixed -  2 times 10,5 hrs flight with no entertainment. The staff was rude not even mentioning that apart from the pre ordered special meal they did not provide any gluten free snack for me between meal times making me starved throughout the whole journey (I am coeliac not a fashion dieter). Got in contact with customer services who only reply to our emails once a month and their only way of compensating us a $50 voucher only valid for a year and only on theirs services on board. Well no thank you! After this experience I will never even consider booking with SriLankan Airlines ever again.

### "very good value for money"
Jakarta to Dubai via Colombo on A321 and A330-200 respectively. Arrived from Kuala Lumpur by Malaysia Airlines; checked in online and wasted time as the BPs evt. Said: “This is NOT a boarding pass. Airport Authorities require you obtain a Boarding Pass at the Airport Check–in counter. Counters close 1 hour prior to schedule departure”. Thus, I eventually had to line up in Jakarta where I got BPs from the ordinary check-in desk. In CGK there are no transit counters for Sri Lankan (maybe if you arrive Terminal 2?). I arrived T3 by other OW carrier (MH) and had to proceed to T2 which forced me to leave transit area, get a transit visa, pass immigration, customs, security, collect luggage and go by public transport to T2 as starting a new journey. Check-in opened only 3 hours before departure. Additional time prior to that is just wasted in check-in area. Thus, the Oneworld seamless experience is completely messed up like two alien airlines in two different airports. Check-in eventually was very cooperative except they ask for CC validation – I thought most (all?) airlines have dropped that. The payment for the trip was drawn 6 moths prior to the travel so wonder why they insist on CC-checks. The lounge provided in T2 is Pura Indah, a very stuffy, depressing place with substandard food and no views nor even a single window in the interior. They have no alcoholic drinks apart from 1 brand of cheapest local beer, Anker. Onboard Sri Lankan, as for both legs, I had a top notch experience and caring from fresh, proactive, observant, jolly (flirtatious? ), and neat FA’s. Food was excellent and well presented with extensive menu cards and drink lists provided on both legs. Take off champagne good. Wines were casual but 5 brands offered. A wonderful experience in the air. Smooth transit in CMB. Punctual flights. Good IFE entertainment. I think the A321 is excellent for dayflights. The last leg was on A330-300 with nice sleeper seats. Here, four dishes were offered on their menu cards. I could only manage two of them. Both were very tasty. Warmly recommend this airline, very good value for money. Paid three, almost four times less than what I should have paid going by Emirates or Qatar on the same routing

### "kindly and helpful"
Colombo to Singapore in business class sector. Onboard I got sick and the cabin crew was kindness and helpful to me and without hesitating they did an excellent job. I am pleased they are kindly and helpful to their clients.

### "Cabin crew are friendly"
Male to Heathrow via Colombo. Cabin crew are friendly, very attentive to yours needs. Entertainment system was good, good choice of films and games. Food was lovely, plenty of it! However was a little on the spicy side! We even got a roll on the 1hr Male to Colombo flight! Connection was really easy, and all flights were on time! Seats would have been beneficial with a little extra room - although loved the 2-4-2 layout! Overall, enjoyable flight and would fly again!

### "appreciate the cabin crew"
Trivandrum to Dubai via Colombo. I need to appreciate the cabin crew. Flight was extremely full on UL225 which operates Colombo to Dubai in both Business and Economy, in spite of heavy requests from different people the staff done there job with professionalism and patience. I was in 1A on Business class and the staff has taken care with my request without any hesitation.

### "flight was excellent"
I was traveling from Coimbatore to Dubai via Colombo. The flight which I taken from SriLanka was excellent, good staff, excellent good work. Indian airline staffs should take lesson from them. Really appreciated.

### "I was very disappointed"
Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Colombo. I was very disappointed with this flight. Travelling at 20 weeks pregnant with twins on a 10 hour 45 min flight and we are sat in seats knowingly before take off that there is a technical issue and that all seats from ours at 50 to the back of the plane had no power. We couldn’t watch tv, I could not call for assistance, charge any devices and was travelling with a teenager also. The flight was absolutely freezing and everyone who went to the toilet and stood by our seats commented on how much colder it was where we were. I asked for extra blankets on 3 occasions and none came. I could not sleep as I was so cold. On a night flight while pregnant none of this was comfortable or good for my health.

### "satisfied with the service"
Dhaka to Colombo. Flew economy class from Dhaka-Colombo-Dhaka. We wanted a direct flight and Srilankan was the cheapest option. Although little more expensive than the usual, we were rather satisfied with the service. Flight was on time. The cabin was clean and they had good collection of English/Bollywood films. Our 3 hour flight was not boring. The staff always had a smile and were very friendly. I quite liked their food - we were served lunch on board with options for veg and non-veg. We took the non-veg chicken dish and although it had a distinct Srilankan flavour, it was tasty. Do not expect restaurant quality meal but it should suffice for the journey. After our departure we realised we had left our passports in the airplane. When we informed a staff member at the check-in gate, she literally ran to the airplane and returned with our passports with a big smile. Very impressed with staff behaviour! Will definitely fly again.

### "not support you in ground staff"
Kuwait to Chennai via Colombo. If everything goes well, this flight is okay. If you have some correction in your booking they will not support you in ground staff unless you buy ticket from direct airlines. I won't recommend for an emergency travel with this flight. What ever less price ticket I will never purchase this airline ticket again..

### "service was horrible"
Colombo to Jakarta. This flight was overbooked by a large number and many passengers including me couldn't board the flight despite being early. I had a direct Colombo to Jakarta flight, however I was asked to fly via KL which added another 4 hours travel time. The service was horrible.

### "recommend the airline"
Reasonably good airline due to direct flight from Melbourne to Colombo return. The aircraft seems to be old. On our way up our seat 22K was faulty with meal tray practically hanging off the seat. I was forced to sit in another seat away from my wife. The seats are narrow and very uncomfortable. The plan was on time and arrived online at destination. Very encouraging. Service was good and meals are acceptable. One of the breakfast was egg omelette but it was almost egg soup. The staff are great. I will recommend the airline to travellers from Melbourne to Sri Lanka.

### "Would recommend"
Colombo to Melbourne. Excellent flight, most passengers including me choose to sleep rather than take dinner, was a past midnight departure. Crew were very professional, aircraft was a bit old but business class was great, good movies, good breakfas , bags took long time to arrive but more a Melbourne airport issue than the airline. Would recommend.

### "poor service"
Trivandrum to Colombo. The lesson learnt was never fly in cheaper airlines. Firstly, the food was not so good but I am OK with it. Seats were not comfortable at all, but it looks clean and neat. Entertainment were OK. Some of the cabin crew acted that they do not want or like to work in that airline. Rude cabin crew, zero hospitality, poor service. I would like to avoid travel by Sirlankan airlines.

### "good staff service"
Flew Male to Jakarta via Colombo. Both flights was on the A321 and the flight from Male to Colombo was the old A321 which do not have inflight entertainment, no recliner seats and smaller legroom on this short flight. Few days later, took the new A321neo on the CMB-CGK route which was more better and have recliner seats, more legroom and IFE. Both flights had great food and good staff service. Overall flight was good, but not for the ground in Colombo which was terrible compared to other airports been on. Next time would prefer to fly EK, QR, SQ, CX, CZ etc as they have better service than SriLankan.

### "worth the business class fare"
Colombo to Bangkok. The business class fares are a good deal. Serendib lounge at Colombo Airport has seen better days, but there'a good buffet and travelers are entitled to free showers and a 15-minute head massage. As I had a 7:50 am flight the lounge was not crowded. This flight makes do with the older A330-200 with adjoining seats. I lucked out and had both seats to myself. The breakfast menu offered an extensive tea selection and several meal entrees. Given the near 4-hour flight, extensive breakfast selection, lounge access with free shower and spacious seating, it was well worth the business class fare.

### "Great service onboard"
Colombo to Male. Short trip (65mins all up). Used Silk Route check in service which is great, within 3 mins of cab pulling up at Silk Route entrance we had been security screen and checked in, lounge was quiet as it was 5.30am but was full by he time we left at 7am. Good food options on offer for the earlier hour and flights called. Great service onboard, and breakfast served within 15mins of seat belt sign off. A330-300 has a great hard product and whole experience from Check in to Bags off belt was 10 out of 10, great start to a Maldives holiday.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Colombo to Dubai just a day ago on an A321 (4RABR). Flight on time, cabin spacious and pleasant, seats not lie flat but comfortable enough for a 4.5 hour flight. In-flight personal entertainment for me was very satisfying. Food and beverages with a decent array tasted just OK. Service onboard was impeccable, crew were friendly, warm and professional. H

### "needs to be consistent"
Overall I would say good but not excellent. The Aircraft registration showed the plane was manufactured in 1999, so getting close to 20 years old and it showed. It's a shame Sri Lankan doesn't use their newer A330-300's on this route, but I guess most of the traffic is holiday. The seating is fine and flat bed allows proper sleep. Crew were mixed, some great, others very surly, even up front. Food and beverages good, could improve on timing, 4pm take off and a full dinner is served with an hour and then another dinner 6 hours later, with 3 hours still to run. Movies good, headphones average. Sri Lankan has a great product overall but the difference in cabin lay out and amenities between the A330-300's and 200's is stark and needs to be consistent if you want to be airline of choice.

### "did not find the seats particularly comfortable"
London to Colombo. This is the only airline that has a direct daily service between London Heathrow and Colombo. The aircraft used was the Airbus A330. I did not find the seats particularly comfortable for this 11hr flight. The in-flight entertainment content – movies, TV, tourism was adequate for my requirements. However, there was only one USB socket that worked in the 8 seats around me. The headphone socket was very loose and I had to be very careful in the insertion. The cabin crew showed big smiles when they started off and they tried their best to do their work. They were formal and attentive but not warm. The food was adequate and unremarkable. Later in the flight, the toilet floor was wet. On both legs, the flight was uneventful and arrived on time. I would rate this airline as full service but functional in standards. I would certainly fly this airline again more because it is a direct flight to Colombo from London than the quality of service and airplane.

### "crew were fantastic"
Flew into Colombo from Dubai on the 30th of June with SriLankan onboard their A333's business class. Service was spectacular from the beginning till the end. Cabin crew were fantastic. Food and beverages selection was decent enough and tasted just ok for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment offered. Highly recommended.

### "a poor experience"
Male to Colombo. Had a poor experience with SriLankan Airlines recently. Flight got its aircraft changed about 2 days earlier and it was switched to the A321 from the A330 which caused a massive decline in service. To start, there is no lie flat seats like you will see on the A330. No IFE either (I believe this A321 must be the former Mihin Lanka airplane). The staff was ok and the food was fine. However, the lack of customers support with they did not tell that the aircraft was switched to the A321 is totally unacceptable. Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Had no such issues like this with other airline before - Emirates, Qatar, Singapore, Cathay, China Southern etc and they have a much professional customer support against this airline.

### "Would not recommend to anyone"
It started raining at the time of departure from Mumbai Airport and the flight got delayed because of that, which is understandable. But the thing that ticked us off was we were waiting for 12 hours at Mumbai Airport and authority from Srilankan Airlines didn't even provide us any accommodation. Airline was supposed to provide us with dinner, but they provided us with half a sandwich and told we can buy ourselves if we want more. We had a connecting flight via Colombo to Melbourne to Adelaide. We were rerouted through Singapore then Melbourne to Adelaide. There were flights directly going to Adelaide from Singapore of the same airlines from which we were going (Qantas) and there were seats available but the planning experts from Srilankan Airlines put us on Melbourne plane. And this is not all. From Melbourne, we were supposed to take a domestic flight to Adelaide, which was flying like every other hour. But our organisers, very conveniently, put us on the flight which was scheduled after 12 hours. We had to collect all our luggage to complete immigration process. We were roaming around the Melbourne Airport like idiots with 100 kgs of luggage, deprived of sleep and no service provided by Srilankan Airlines. We reached Adelaide 24 hours late, lost our bookings and whole day plan gone to drain. We understand that what happened was because of bad weather but what followed was just bad management. It was not only me, but all the passengers were harrassed. Why was accommodation not provided to us at Mumbai Airport or at Melbourne Airport? Why was there no facility for refreshment? Would not recommend Srilankan Airlines to anyone.

### "good short haul flight"
Colombo to Male, the first time I’ve experience Business Class on SriLankan Airlines. Overall its a good short haul flight. I a delicious meal for just an hour flight - Butter Chicken with rice with good drinks served. The flight was late due to traffic issues. The seats is big as Cathay Pacific Business Class and comfortable being fully flat. The staff was friendly and caring for its passengers.

### "The seats were dirty"
❌ Not Verified |  Melbourne to Chennai via Colombo. Very competitive pricing and the layover in Colombo was short. Decent Choice of Food - had 3 choices and all of them were available for most of us. Usually, if you are seated away from where the service starts, you end up have lesser options. The A33o-200 used for the Melbourne Leg is very old. The seats were dirty, not reclining fully and the headrest was bulging forward making it almost impossible to sit back without reclining. The cabin crew were really unprofessional when it came to bumping aisle seated passengers. While I understand its difficult to manoeuvre in a fully packed flight, a quick sorry for bumping into a passenger would have gone a long way. Transit in Colombo airport was not very good. The airport itself is very basic and the amenities in the airport were not maintained well( Dirty washrooms). Overall for the price offered, the short transit time and the decent food, I would recommend.

### "Service was pathetic"
Colombo to Bangalore. Service from ground staff and inflight staff was pathetic. While it was a full flight, ground staff behaved rudely asking us, a group of 4, to check in the only cabin baggage less than 55 cm. Spoke real harsh to us when we explained there was a laptop in the bag. Boarded flight disorderly, with two rows on boarding ladder. Preflight, there was no briefing to pax seated in emergency row, allowed elderly person to sit in emergency row, next to exit.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Colombo to London. SriLankan Airlines are one of the worst airlines I have flown with. The check in staff at the airport were extremely rude. Although they can appear to be pleasant to foreign tourists, they can be hostile to Sri Lankans and other Asians. On my last flight, I reached the check in desk in the queue one hour and 20 minutes before my flight, but they turned me away saying I was too late. This was despite the fact that they had already weighed my luggage and processed the passengers in front of me and subsequently the passengers behind me. The problem seemed to be that I had a voucher for extra baggage after trading in my Airmiles which the check in staff were not happy about. I had to purchase a new ticket for the following day at great expense and inconvenience. I contacted the customer complaints department in their office who were not interested in this issue or a refund. They claimed that the reason I was denied boarding was due to a heavy suitcase (I transferred some items to another case) and late.

### "unprofessional and inefficient"
Colombo to Dubai. After an emergency stop in Muscat due to lack of fuel, we were delayed 6 hours and missed our next two connections. After almost 4 more hours at the airport, everyone lies and pushes the responsibility to someone else. Aggravating is to be lied to for almost 4 hours and this includes also the team in the transit desk who are  unconsiderate, unprofessional and inefficient.

### "seating is not comfortable"
Business return Bahrain to Colombo on a A321 . Both flights left on time and landed slightly early . Both were smooth, Crew were pleasant, friendly and engaging. Did not load my gluten free meal on the return leg. But did their best to find something. Entertainment was adequate with sufficient movies and TV to keep you occupied on these 5 hour segments. Drinks were supplied non stop and wine was sufficiently well chilled, food was ok at best barely a step over economy - one starter - salad - option of three mains and one desert . so Y class faire. MY gripe is that the regional seating is not comfortable, hardish seats, cradle style, not suitable for sleeping as the curvature of the seats is non existant with no leg support. Whilst I appreciate that Bahrain may not be a premium route for the airline, both were very full flights being over 180 persons. Most other middle east cities get A330 aircraft with lie flat seats. The seat need to be addressed as they are not worth the extra monies in my view.

### "cancelled and not informed"
Singapore to Colombo. Our flight was cancelled and we were not even informed. We were put on the next flight which was 6 hours later. No compensation was given. I was on a short business trip and lost 1 day out of the 3 day stay. To make matters worse, the return flight was delayed by close to 3 hours. Again not even a snack was provided during the delay.

### "delayed by more than 3 hours"
Colombo to Singapore. Very unprofessional service. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours due to a technical reason. They only detected the malfunction at the last minute. Could not figure out how long it would take to get it corrected. Kept on posting false departure times. The due meal was delayed by more than 2 hours.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Doha to Colombo, comfortable journey, good leg room. IFE worked well, food is okay not great. Return also a comfortable journey, cabin crew are courteous food is good and IFE has good selection. Both Flights were on vtime. Would recommend

### "seat covers were all torn"
Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. I was seated with my husband in economy class seat numbers 12 E and 12 F in flight no UL319. The tray table of my seat could not be opened and I had to keep the tray on my lap while I was having the meal. My husbands tray table could only be opened halfway and hence the meal tray was leaning towards the seat in front. The seat covers of seats in front of ours were all torn exposing the packing material underneath and also back of the seats facing us were dirty. There was no reading material in the pocket. All in all our journey from Malaysia to Colombo was not pleasant at all.

### "worst flight I've ever taken"
Doha to Bangkok via Colombo. This was the worst flight I've ever taken. The plane smelt as customers were complaining about the smell, the cabin crew went around spraying chemicals and air fresheners to mask the odor. It was unbearable. The flight was late and 34 people missed their connection to Bangkok. Families with small children had to wait in the Colombo airport for 8 hours, just to board a plane to Singapore, to then get to Bangkok. No hotel vouchers were given. People lost days of their vacations. As a single traveler, I was lucky and was able to board a plane at 8am (so I only had to wait 6 hours). Unfortunately, I missed my connecting flight to Chiang Mai. No reimbursement, or course. All they would offer were breakfast vouchers. The breakfast was disgusting.

### "we couldn't enjoy the lounge"
Male to London via Colombo. We were waiting in Male business lounge, looking at the screen several times and found out that our plane was delayed. The lady behind the desk said: don't worry we will call you in time. After one and half hour we looked at the screen again and seen the final closing. Running to the gate we just managed to get on. We asked for a welcome sparkling wine instead of juice, but our request was refused. Surprised because on the to Male we had that drink. In Colombo we couldn't enjoy the lounge because had to rush to catch the flight to London.

### "spoke in a harsh way to me"
Bengaluru to Colombo. At checkin, the representative told me that I have got an upgrade and asked me to talk to the officials at the boarding gate. When I check with the person at the boarding gate, they said you have no Upgrade. I saw them giving upgrade to their known passengers. This is disappointing to me, they should not promise if they can't deliver and the officials spoke in a harsh way to me. I paid for my seat and i am not liable to take this kind of treatment.

### "next to nothing offered"
Flew Colombo to Bengaluru with SriLankan Airlines. Leg room is less. No entertainment even though screens are installed, won't give you head phones. Don't understand the logic of that. Food is poor and next to nothing offered. The only decent thing is the people, who are very sweet and kind from the entry into the airport. Was given middle seat, citing there are no other seats available and then I see that the last few rows were completely empty. Check-in at airport is exceptionally slow, so is the boarding process. They announce final call 1 hour prior to flight time and don't board till 20 mins before, keeping you holed up in a small room all this while.

### "chasing to get our money back"
My friend and I had to cancel the flights because we could not fly. After the flights were cancelled we were upgraded to business class and charged for this. It took us 10 telephone calls, around 50 emails and 1.5 months of chasing to get our money back. The customer support in the UK on the phone spoke bad English and could not explain anything properly. We got confusing messages on emails, were sent from one department to another and faced with numerous delays. Customer service is non existent, the refund system is confusing and requires you to fill a form for each ticket. One department of the airline does not talk to another. We ended up complaining to their customer support team (we were given their details after weeks of requesting them!) however we still faced delays and only got the money back after 45 days of constant chasing.

### "3 out of 4 flights were delayed"
Melbourne to Male via Colombo. 3 out of my 4 flights in this trip were delayed and I did not enjoy the quality of economy class cabin. It baffles me as to why they would use an A330-200 for a long haul flight while a decked out A330-300 was used for a flight that lasted an hour from Colombo to male. Price was cheep and so I guess you get what you pay for. Food was pretty average, drinks kinda limited too. The final flight heading back home was delayed by 7 hours. Although a hotel and dinner was provided but we found the quality of the establishment a bit on the substandard side. The transfer to and from the hotel and going through immigration almost makes it not worth it. My final whinge is around their online bidding system where you can make a bid for business class upgrades. It seems like no one is actually looking at it as my bid of $915 USD per person was got expired without an outcome. Its super odd that it wasn't even considered when one could have bought a fresh one way ticket from Colombo to Melbourne for $1085 USD on the spot at the airport.

### "aircraft was comfortable"
I recently flew SriLankan Airlines return from Dubai to Singapore via Colombo. I was quite impressed with the ease of check-in, attentiveness of the cabin crew and  meals served. The flight attendants smiled and made you feel comfortable and were attentive and eager to assist with any questions. The aircraft was comfortable and the toilets were clean. It was refreshing to see that some airlines still take a lot of pride in excellent customer service.

### "decent food, drink and entertainment"
Over the winter 2017/18 I have flown with Sri Lankan 6 times. This review is for the flights I made to and from Colombo in Jan/Feb 2018. These flights were comfortable, with decent food, drink and entertainment. Both left on time and arrived early. The planes were newish and clean. On the whole although the food and cabin service on these flights wasn't quite up to the standard I enjoyed in December I was very satisfied for the fare I paid. These flights are direct and consequently infinitely preferable to the alternative of transfering in Middle Eastern airports. If I fly this route again I would use this airline provided the fare remains competitive.

### "cabin crew were very helpful"
Colombo to Melbourne. The cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. The seats on the A 330 were average, the headrest being particularly uncomfortable. The trip from Melbourne to Colombo was satisfactory, but the return trip from Colombo to Melbourne was another matter! For goodness' sake whatever do people do in the toilet? The outward trip was okay except people kept forgetting to close the door. But the return trip was a nightmare! People had constantly left the toilet in a pretty filthy condition, water all over, and scraps of wet toilet tissues scattered all over the floor and stuck to the toilet bowl that wouldn't flush them away. The smell of urine permeated the air, and many passengers recoiled on opening the door. The cabin crew bravely cleaned the toilets (both of them) in the centre of the of the plane at least four times during the ten hour flight. I simply cannot understand why people treat a convenience that all their fellow passengers would need to use during the flight, in such a disrespectable and inconsiderate way. It is just a matter of clean personal hygiene. One wonders in what condition their private toilets are. I am originally from Sri Lanka and was looking forwrd to using Sri Lankan Airlines, but this experience has left me shaking my head sadly.

### "good legroom and a good entertainment system"
Flew Singapore to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Check-in and boarding in Singapore was fast and easy. Passengers take lots of luggage on board so board early (even if they haven’t called your row) if you want to ensure your bag goes in a convenient spot. This won't work when departing Colombo because they use buses - they called some economy rows for the first bus, then business class passengers for the second bus (so that bus left with only 10 people), then a third bus arrived 15 minutes later for everyone else. Maybe that was why we took off late. Four hours on an A320 often isn’t good but this plane had a new fitout, good legroom and a good entertainment system - big screen and lots of choices. Food was ok but heavy on carbs/starch - lots of bread, lots of potato. No real problems and seemed like a good value way to get to Sri Lanka.

### "Avoid at all costs"
We flew back from Colombo to Dubai and feel cheated by SriLankan Airlines. As a special treat we paid for business class seats for my wife’s 30th but got the oldest plane I’ve ever flown on that was not even worth an economy fare. It’s pointless to go into details about everything that was wrong but look at the photo of our entertainment unit and you’ll get an idea - In what modern day business class do you have to hold your tv? I get that this sounds like ‘first world problens’ but our issue is that we were sold an expensive service by SriLankan Airlines and they didn’t deliver. If they’d told us that they wouldn’t offer the service advertised then we wouldn’t have paid the extra money for business - we actually would have flown economy with Emirates and got a much better service. We made a complaint immediately to SriLankan Airlines and it took them 3 weeks to reply with a pathetic excuse that wasn’t even worth the wait. Terrible customer service, terrible airline. Avoid at all costs as there are much better options to get to Sri Lanka.

### "one of my preferred airlines"
** EDITED - HAVE THEY SENT TICKET ??
Flew SriLankan Airlines from Dubai to Singapore via Colombo. The friendly service together with the good food and the very good IFE make it one of my preferred airlines. The aircrafts are well maintained and very clean. In all the years I never had a delayed flight. The only negative aspect is the rather poor seat pitch.

### "aircraft was old and grubby"
Singapore to Colombo return. The aircraft was old and grubby, needs a refurbishment. Entertainment screens are outdated. Food was great, and so was the service of the cabin crew. Very approachable and attentive. In the return leg, they ran out of my meal choice and got down a tray from the business class for both me and my daughter. The announcements could be a bit clearer and must speak slower. All safety precautions were strictly followed. Apart from the issues I have noted above, the service has improved since I last flew with them over 17 years ago.

### "Pretty awful cabin service"
Booked Hong Kong - London via Colombo. First leg out on 18th Dec was very disappointing. Firstly we got an old aircraft with no lie-flat beds, just "regional" seating. Very small plane - perhaps a 737? - It was 3-3 in Economy and 2-2 in Biz. Before takeoff my husband and I realised we needed to organise a part of our intinerary when we landed and so were discussing options and on my phone fixing things up. Air steward came along to greet us, or should I say, greet my husband. He wasn't interested in me (I'm the OW Emerald who booked the tickets, hubby is my dependent) and tried to break into our conversation to do his greeting. It was so rude it was comical. This turned out to be a feature of Sri Lankan - no greeting (on any of the 4 legs) for me, much ignoring of my call button, generally I was invisible yet the men in the cabin appeared to be getting good service. Incredible in this day and age. Anyway - food - I enjoyed most of it. Usually a western option as well as a Sri Lankan one, and I like Sri Lankan food so that was good. Seats - poor on the HK- Colombo, Colombo - London return was a nice new herringbone configuration with decent seats. No in seat storage (at all) but otherwise fine. Colombo-HK we were pleasantly surprised to get the "old" long haul product - which is lie flat seats but old style. I actually find these very comfy and much more in-seat storage. I left a jacket on the UK-colombo flight (my own fault, but) never got it back. Was lied to by the staff in the lounge "oh yes, they really did go and look in the overhead locker you mentioned" (no, actually the plane had already left for the next leg so when she said this, it was blatantly untrue). Entertainment was dire. OK if you like really old films. The TV selection was laughable. A few single episodes of a few shows - nothing else! But luckily I already knew this and had packed some books. Another gem - was fast asleep on the flight back and was shaken awake for a hot towel! Some 3 hours before landing. After a short exchange when I indicated I wanted to stay asleep, then about 10 mins later shaken awake for food service by another guy. Pretty awful cabin service on balance. Oh - there are no hand-luggage trolleys in Colombo. Normally this would not bother me, but on this occasion I had pulled a chest muscle and even tiny hand luggage was hard to carry. No help offered.

### "comfortable economy flights"
London to Thiruvananthapuram return via Colombo. All 4 flights were excellent. On time in clean, newish aircraft with professional, friendly crew. The flight from Colombo back to Heathrow must rate as one of the most comfortable economy flights I have experienced. The food was exceptional for economy and drinks were  plentiful. I'm 1.93m and found my seat comfortable for the 11 hr flight with a decent choice of IFE. An excellent product which could teach other much larger airlines how to do it.

### "I will fly again"
Bangkok to London via Colombo. Bangkok to Columbo. A320-200; newish. Minor delay, crew generally friendly but some minor issues with English. Plane spotlessly clean. Best IFR touch screen sensitivity I have ever seen plus large screen although film, audio, TV and game selection poor. Poor headsets and also collected 20 minutes prior to touchdown for crew convenience. Leg Two Columbo to London Heathrow A330-300 Plane slightly delayed due to incoming delayed flight. IFE choice much better although screen not as responsive. Excellent crew; they were really attentive and went out of their way, example, multiple top-ups of alcohol plus provided me with Paracetamol when I knew I had overdone it. For the first drink I was given 2 large glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon and one of these was topped up prior to the meal 10 minutes later. Food was excellent; I had the white fish for episode one with Hollandaise Sauce plus a good vegetable assortment with roll, mini side salad and dessert was Tiramisu; all very tasty and served with metal cutlery. Food service speed also excellent; attentive staff: good deportment plus service augmenting eye contact. Episode two was a beautifully tender piece of braised steak with creamy sauce, beans, carrots and mashed potatoes. Small random side salad plus macaroons. An hour after eating one cabin crew wandered up and down the cabin topping up wine glasses. I particularly liked the captains announcement on the second leg as he explained the fact that we were to be flying at increasing heights along the way as we lost weight due to fuel burn. As a frequent flyer on the BKK to LHR route I always go via the middle-east but this airline is challenging the status quo and I will fly again.

### "an exquisite journey"
Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. A warm and culture influenced welcome by the crew. Cabin crew very hospitable and engaging. Take off was pretty smoothie. The only negative was the aircraft itself that was quite crampy. As it was a night flight the expectation of a really good meal wasn't the at high, but flavour and the choice of meal pleased  me. The cabin lights were  off shortly after service for a comfortable and well needed sleep. Seats were quite comfortable. Overall an exquisite journey. Looking forward to fly again.

### "Crew was nice and professional"
Frankfurt to Colombo. I flew with SriLankan Airlines in October 2016 . It was one of my most comfortable flights. Crew was nice and professional, they have beautiful uniforms and the food was delicious . Also the seats were comfortable and cabin interior Very modern and stylish. SriLankan Airlines is one of my favorites airlines.

### "cabin crew most professional"
Colombo to Melbourne. I was the last passenger to check in just 50 min before departure time. I was reassured by ground staff that I am not going to miss the flight. Excellent check in service. Flight was reasonable for a small island nation and nothing to complain about. Very professional captain explaining each every step and reassuring passengers while experiencing severe turbulence. Cabin crew one of most professional I have seen. Similar to Qantas and much better than other regional airlines. I loved the meal. Very smooth landing. Everything on time.

### "disgusting behaviour at checkin"
Delhi to Colombo. Absolutely disgusting behaviour at the checkin desk. In this so called digital India they don’t accept E visas or tickets. They forced me to get a hard copy of my visa which I have in my Phone with a big screen. I stand in a long Queue but after waiting there for 30 minutes the rude lady told me to get a hard copy of visa. When I question her back from where, She said somewhere from the Airport. And when I question her again she said not their problem. What unprofessional staff, However the Other managing staff helped me and check my bags in on E-Visa. They started Arguing with each other in front of me and other customers, no one know what they are doing. Absolutely not acceptable. I’ll try not to travel through this airline again. G

### "seat was spacious and comfortable"
London Heathrow - Colombo - London Heathrow with SriLankan Airlines. Check in on each leg was quick and efficient. I wasn't offered fast track security departing Heathrow, but I was given an invitation for fast track immigration at Heathrow on my return. UL business class passengers get the use of the BA / OneWorld lounge at Heathrow T3. Not luxurious, but comfortable and well appointed, plenty of hot and cold snacks, and reassuringly plenty of seating. The Serendib Lounge in Colombo was small and felt a bit cramped but comfortable enough with a decent breakfast buffet (closed for 30 minutes or so to switch to a lunch buffet). Good, clean toilets and complimentary wi-fi in both lounges. The SriLankan equipment was an Airbus A330-300. Business Class in a 1-2-1 herringbone type configuration (note – the Sri Lankan A330-200's have a less generous C class layout). The seat was spacious and comfortable, and easily converted to a fully flat bed at the push of a button. A blanket and toiletries bag are provided, but no pyjamas. There is an enormous TV screen, but the selection of programming was somewhat disappointing, with very few recent film releases. Good selection of journey maps though, as well as downward and forward facing cameras. Food was of OK but not fantastic quality, with typically three options of starter and main course, but only one desert. Crew were efficient and courteous, if a bit unsmiling on the outward leg, much friendlier on the return leg. One of the Business Class cabin toilets was out of action for most of the return journey. Basically a decent enough Business Class product with good quality seating, so-so meals and entertainment and inconsistent (but never poor) cabin service. There are worse business class products out there, but there are certainly better as well.

### "Friendly and very courteous"
Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. Fantastic service by the cabin crew. Excellent food. Friendly and very courteous staff. I am very pleased that I flew with Sri Lankan. Recommend this air line to anyone who wish to have a relaxed stress free flying.

### "Not impressed with call centre"
London to Melbourne via Colombo, with a 12 hour layover in Colombo. SriLankan Airlines provided a transit hotel in Colombo, and complimentary lunch and dinner at the airport. The hotel room was basic but clean, and had a safe for valuables if you are leaving the airport. Plane and lavatory clean, Flight Attendants were polite and friendly. Food and drink options were good, plenty of choice for inflight entertainment. The airline let us change our booking with no change fee (only had to pay the difference between flights, which was 60 GBP per person). In the 12 hour layover, we were able to go into Negombo to look around the city and beach, and still have some chill out time and a shower in the transit hotel before the second flight. When we tried to do our online check-in the day of our flight, the booking had mysteriously disappeared. We then spent hours phoning the airline to try and find out what had happened. Apparently, they had not confirmed us on the new flight, as they "didn't realise" we'd paid the fee (which was done on the spot when we re-booked). They tried to put us on the next-day flight, which we refused. After many phone calls, they finally confirmed our booking and all was well from that point on. Not impressed with the call centre though. Would be rating higher if we hadn't had to deal with this inconvenience.

### "Overall excellent service"
Bangkok to London Heathrow via Colombo. We have made this trip yearly using Emirates and decided to use SriLankan as they are cheaper, the disadvantage being the length of the journey is longer as we were routed through CMB. The flight BKK-CMB was on a A320, the reception onboard very friendly and they put our bags in the overhead lockers. The food was good, the plane clean, the FAs always to ensure the journey was comfortable. Very little to say negatively about the flight. The next leg was CMB to LHR on an A330-300 good seat configuration, again a high standard of customer care, good food and drinks of all tastes available. The toilets were clean, the FAs again there to make the flight comfortable. IFE not as good as Emirates but still a large choice of movies, TV to choose from. The one issue I have is having to pay for Wifi, not a problem for me but could for business travelers. Overall excellent service, the airline on time and friendly FAs, highly recommend this airline, will definitely be using them again, in my opinion a 4 star airline.

### "got delayed more than five hours"
Colombo to Guangzhou. The flight schedule at 17:35 but it got delayed more than five hours, and still I’m waiting for the flight. But Didn’t provide any refreshment and they told they are arranging dinner. They staff at Palm Strip Lounge was very rude to me, but still I got the lounge access.

### "wonderful array of teas"
Hong Kong to Colombo. Sri Lankan used to be my favourite airlines for traveling to Bangkok and Colombo, but they have stopped flying to Bangkok from Hong Kong, but opera 5 direct flights instead. Due to the low load factor, they now use a smaller A320 aircraft, but the newest one called NEO. The leg room in business class is quite good, good recliner seat with foot rest, suitable for a 5 hour flight. Their onboard service and catering have always been outstanding, such as the case in this trip. They have a good touch screen AVOD too, and a decent headphone. They also have a wonderful array of teas, which is what Sri Lanka is famous anyway. From Hong Kong direct to Colombo, SriLankan airlines is the only airlines that does that, and luckily, they are a very good choice. They are part of OneWorld, so you can earn mileage if you are members of any of the One World airlines.

### "service was impeccable"
Colombo to Bangkok on the A320 and successful with a very reasonable upgrade bid to business class. Used the dedicated silk route checkin facility at Bandaranaike Airport for personalised fast and efficient service. Only four in business class, and service was impeccable. Friendly smiling and obliging flight attendants. Food and entertainment adequate but nothing special. Good selection of drinks. Seat is ok for a three hour regional service, but dated and not that comfortable if you want to sleep. Announcements from the flight deck were crisp and clear, with a pre-take warning about expected enroute turbulence. Flight departed ten minutes ahead of schedule and arrived in Bangkok 15 minutes early. The standout was the excellent service by the Sri Lankan staff. Only my second time flying with SriLankan Airlines and first time in business class. Will definitely use again.

### "the crew were fantastic"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Colombo. The 2nd time I've used Sri Lankan airlines during the previous two weeks, check in at KUL was very quick security & immigration pretty quick at KLIA, once airside I used the Malaysia Airlines Lounge for a quick coffee before making my way to the gate gate C14. A 2nd security check then boarding was quick by number or service, boarding a well kept A320 shown to my seat 2A offered a drink & hot towel. Airborne on time and offered a menu and pre meal drinks by a very nice crew who where proactive and friendly, the meal on this flight was y well presented and finished off with coffee. Flight arrived CMB on time to a remort stand where we where bussed to the terminal with business class passengers on a separate bus, visited the Serindib lounge while in transit nothing special but fairly. Quiet. Boarded the flight to London from gate 14A which was fairly organised on to a newish looking A330-300 with 1-2-1 seating set up, seat 2A offered privacy and comfort slippers blanket & amenity kit waiting on the seat drinks and hot towels offered. Departed on time again once airborne service started quickly with pre meal drinks offered and meal orders taken, once again the crew were fantastic, friendly but professional. The food offered on this flight was presented very well and tasted great the quality appeared very good, lunch a mid flight snack and ample drinks & dinner served on this 11 hour flight. TV was good enough for an 11 hour flight I really have no complaints Sri Lankan offer a great product, Colombo airport is not the best so if improved the whole product would benefit. Bags delayed at LHR otherwise nothing to complain about. Complimentary chauffeur offered on arrival worked well. Great service would use anytime.

### "requesting refund for past 50 days"
Chennai to Dammam via Colombo. I booked my ticket in Sri Lankan airways for my family members (3 passengers) and cancelled 48 hrs before travel. I have been requesting refund for the past 50 days but no response. Refund actions are very very poor. After 30 days we received a reply mail for one passenger that the payment will be sent to the account. But still even that amount is not yet received. Local agents are not supporting. Complaint given to Customer care had no response at all.

### "economy class crew were rude"
Jeddah to Kuala Lumpur via Colombo. First time experience and shall be the last time flying with SriLankan Airlines,  the passengers were treated like school kids. The economy class crew were rude, impolite and using harsh words. He told me off saying 'sit down' with harsh tone without knowing that I had to make way for the next passenger to go out. At this point of time, the seat belt light had been turned off. Second incidence happened when the flight had touched down and passengers were ready to take belongings from the compartment above the head. there was a guy sitting infront of my seat no 64D, couldnt bring down his bag from the top compartment. We noticed he is a bit short and not able to reach up. He asked politely if the same rude steward to give a hand. This steward replied "you can do it yourself".

### "far better than my normal airline BA"
London to Bangkok via Colombo. Chauffeur collection from home worked well, check in at Heathrow T3 quick and polite as was quick track security, offered the use of BA lounge, however having Oneworld FF status choose Cathay Pacific lounge instead which is very nice with good food offering. Boarded from gate 24 onto a new looking A330-300, seat 1A which offered a little more space the layout on this aircraft is 1-2-1 similar and offers good privacy, drinks & towels offered. Once in the air the meal service was quick and well presented, after dinner I watched a movie the TVs selection is okay but not to the standard of perhaps Emirates but good enough. I managed 6 hours sleep woken to coffee and shortly after a full breakfast service, again food was well presented and tasted good - landed about 10 minutes late so total flight time of 11 hours. I stopped over for 18 hours, SriLankan offer hotel if required. I was already checked in for my continuing flight so formalities where quick, I used the Serindab lounge which isn't too good, boarded through gate B2 a remote stand but well organised. Boarded an older A330-200 with the older set up of 2-2-2, however full flat which is nice for a 3hr 30min flight, breakfast served by a nice proactive crew although food on this sector wasn't great. Managed 2 hours sleep before arriving more or less on time. Priority immigration and bags off quickly. Great service really far better than my normal airline BA. Only complaint I could think of is Colombo Airport and Sri Lankan lounge.

### "poor excuse for customer service"
Bangkok to Colombo. What a complete disaster and poor excuse for customer service. Six whole rows flew without any entertainment service: none of the movies would play, as would none of the music. Upon collection of excess baggage fees by the first airline for the whole trip, and presentation of proof of payment, SriLankan, the subsequent airlines on the same ticket, required that I repay it or they wouldn't let me claim my bags. Horrible, rude, indifferent customer service.

### "Good customer service"
Flew from Kuwait to Colombo and Colombo to Dubai. Both aircrafts were new A330-300. Good customer service on both segments. Food is satisfactory. Flight entertainment has improved a lot. Flights reached destination almost on time. Only issue with SriLankan Airlines is not adequate direct connections to Europe causing 2 stop overs for North American passengers.

### "needs to sharpen its act"
London to Colombo. As someone who travels regularly business class from Sri Lanka to London, Emirates is the best operator however if you wish to travel direct, SriLankan is the only option. SriLankan Airlines business class is not a bad product - is it just a bit sloppy and could easily be made substantially better. I am only going to mention two areas here, but everything they do could so easily be made better. First of all staff need improved training. The welcome into the business cabin is non-existent, for the safety briefing no one opens your tv, no one offers to take your jacket, or ask them what champagne they serve and you get a blank look. Food also, whilst not horrendous could easily be improved. For example, breakfast of nice poached eggs with a tiny amount of smoked salmon on a weird (but acceptable muffin) with hollandaise, was surprisingly good - but who in their right mind would put peas with this? (not to mention a chicken sausage). It shows an ignorance of food. We also eat with our eyes, - a vegetarian curry was so grey and miserable looking I just wanted to leave it. Why ruin yogurt but making it so sweet one can barely eat it (why not simply serve a fruit puree on the side so I can mix it myself?) Of course Sri Lankans are very charming, and the airline has a soul, it just needs to sharpen its act.

### "Poor service and was disappointed"
Colombo to Male. Poor service and was disappointed. We asked for a glass of water and staff lacked a smile. She looked like she wasn't happy to be working and someone forced her to be there. This was only a 1 hour flight so i don't know why they were lazy to do the flight.

### "refused to provide a good meal"
Dhaka to Chennai via Colombo. SriLankan Airlines flight which was to start @ 2 pm on 20th from Dhaka got delayed by 2 hours and started around 4pm to colombo. My connecting flight to Chennai was at 6.30 pm. When I landed in colombo, my connecting flight already departed and SriLankan Airlines puts me on the nxt flight starting at 1 am nxt day. The staff said that they are offering a meal which turned out to be acheap sandwiches with a drink. I demanded that the airline put me in a lounge as the delay was close to 7 hours. It was of no use as the ground staff refused to make amends and even refused to provide a good meal. Also there was no communication from Dhaka as how they were planning to connect us.

### "smiles and genuine respect"
London to Colombo. First time flying SriLankan since they left the Emirates group. A lot has changed, and it's positive. As a Oneworld Emerald, we used the Cathay Lounge which was a nice start to the trip. The gate crew were affable and caring, advising a 10 minute delay in boarding. On board, friendly smiles and genuine respect. Lots of drinks, cognacs, wines in proper glass, 3 options for food (nice curries, but also western), lot of water rounds and juices too. The TV has mainly older films (ie something you'd see on SKY TV) but it's fine, and I slept most of the 10 hours. Awoke to a healthy breakfast, smoothies. I cannot fault this airline, and how it is 3 star when BA is 4 stars needs review. Thanks SriLankan.

### "book a more reputable airline"
Colombo to Bangkok. The airline failed to tell us about a five hour delay until we had checked in, by which time we had passed all security points and were told we could not leave under any circumstances. Airline staff didn't seem to care. We were told we would be given a meal voucher once we cleared immigration, so with little choice we went. Once we reached the 'slop counter' we were told to go to was a grossly inadequate offer of food, I wasn't sure how long it had been there but I wouldn't have chanced it on my dog. I decided to talk to the customer desk and ask them to at least provide us with a cash equivalent value. Customer services didn't care, neither do their internet team. Colombo airport is one of the most expensive airports I have visited and it was literally 18USD each for a safe meal. My bottom line is this airline is fine if things go well, but fundamentally if things go wrong you are absolutely screwed, heed my advice unless they are rally cheap book a more reputable airline.

### "seats are quite roomy"
London to Colombo return. On the way in we had exit row seats (50 H/K) which were good as we still got a window seat (some exit rows don't). I was disappointed that my first choice of meal (chicken curry) wasn't available and they only had fish left but the quality of the fish meal was fine if a little bland. The cabin was clean, the IFE worked perfectly (the choice of English films left a lot to be desired (lots of box office flops) but there were a few older goodies on there so I didn't run out of entertainment. We got a snack shortly after boarding (cheese biscuits) and dinner a few hours after. The cabin crew looked wonderful and professional in their peacock inspired saris. I loved the map which shows your journey progression and the camera view from below the plane where you can see what is going on below you. Toilets were clean. Breakfast was good, an omelette with sausage and mushrooms with juice, yogurt and pastry. On the way back our flight was uneventful, I got my first choice of curry this time (as we were much further up the plane in regular seats 24 A and B). The crew were offering water throughout the flight. I think that the seats are quite roomy (but I am quite petite at 5ft 3) and my 6 foot husband didn't have any real problems with the seat.

### "lounge was terrible in CMB"
Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Colombo. My first problem with this airline started after I needed to change booking my leg DXB-CMB leg of this booking. Sri Lankan Airways provide a Skype level of customer support which is handy if you are overseas. I needed to bring forward by booking by a day. With each of four contacts with the Skype support I was advised of a fee of US$230 to change the flight, to which I agreed to. However each time the operator put me on hold to begin to process the payment the Skype call disconnected. These four calls took place over a four hour period. In frustration I bit the bullet and rand the Colombo based support number directly and got through quite quickly surprisingly. I was then advised that the same ticket change would now cost US$930! I asked why rise in price? I was told that they could see from their records of the calls that I was offered the US$230 but since this time the fare restrictions had increased the change for this fare. I told them not to bother. Things got worse. Check In experience in DXB was chaotic at best. Poor and inadequate lane signage to the point where most passengers had no clue where to stand. There was no priority given to Business Class passengers. Passengers allowed to jump to the front of line.and there was no passenger management by on site manager. Finally I got to the business class check in which is in reality no different to economy class I was advised at check in that I would be unable to collect or access my checked in baggage in CMB? Why not as this was the first I had heard of it? I advised manager that I needed my luggage as there were items in it needed for my business meeting in CMB. I advised that I had concerns that my luggage would get lost being in CMB for so long unattended prior to the KUL flight. (I was proven correct) I was advised to see what they could do for me in CMB. I did, and they could do nothing. So now I am in Colombo with no luggage. As I anticipated it would be, my luggage did not make it with me to KUL in the next flight leg. It wasn't until a chance meeting with a Malaysian Airlines Customer Service staff member was it established that Sri Lankan airways had indeed failed to put my baggage on the plane and it would arrive via a MH flight later in the day. Why didn't Sri Lankan Airlines bother to tell me? They had my email address. Now I had no luggage in KUL either! Finally the Sri Lankan Airlines lounge was terrible in CMB. People using mobile phones in quiet areas set aside for quiet times between flights, children allowed to run riot in the area without staff intervening with parents to control their children. Substandard and rudimentary food, generally served cold. Covers left up on food containers. I could go on, and on.

### "I thought they were excellent"
Colombo to London in February 2017. SriLankan Airlines has a car to door facility at business class check in at Colombo airport, and you sit down whilst a staff member checks in your bag and hands you a boarding card. Lounge is generic but was restful at 01.00 with polite staff. Priority boarding via separate gate. A warm and smiling welcome on board by cabin crew, greeted at seat and offered help with bag and coat storage. CSD adds a personal welcome. Usual drinks, hot towels and menu. After take off beverage delivered and a fast supper service offered. Full flat bed and slept 6 hours. When I awoke, crew offers me coffee using a silver tray, a sandwich and a hot towel. All with a warm smile and with a nothing is too much trouble approach. Wonderful breakfast menu. On time arrival. Bags waiting as I arrive at carousel. I did not use the inflight entertainment system as a night flight but the range and quality seemed excellent. Limousine driver waiting at arrivals. Home 2 hours after landing. I thought they were excellent.

### "expectation not met at all"
Muscat to Colombo return. They served me the fish ambulthiyal as my dinner meal sorry to said that rice was not eatable at all .I shoe to server those as well and she apologize once again. Flight was overbooked and economy passengers also travelling in the business class. They had same facilities as us with economy rate. On the way back from Colombo there are no screen for movies or entertainment. Once I asked from hostess she gave me one portable  thing which is nearly 2kg weight. This disappointed me and my experience. As a business class passenger I will think before I choose SriLankan Airlines for my next trip. My expectation not met at all during my travel .

### "aircraft was in good shape"
My return trip from Colombo to Jeddah. Aircraft was in good shape. Excellent IFE. Adequate food. Crew not friendly and some crew members rude to the passengers and doesn't smile at all. I felt SriLankan losing their reputation as friendliest cabin crew. However, overall good experience compared to my onward journey from Colombo.

### "top notch service"
Booked on SriLankan Airlines Business for my return trip from Colombo to Dubai, and flew just few days back on their A330-300 aircraft and I must say my second time with the same cabin was just fabulous. With top notch service, a great dinner, wide selection of on board entertainment and flight on time. One negative was their Serendib Lounge felt a little cramped particularly during their peakest hour. However it did have a very good selection of meals and other facilities.

### "Cabin service was excellent"
Flew with SriLankan Airlines from Dubai - Colombo 2 weeks back on board their A330-300 (4R-ALN) and had a very good time. Cabin service was excellent, great food with a very good selection of mains for economy, a wide selection of English movies/TV series to catch up on. Definitely recommended.

### "Service average, food appalling"
Singapore to Dubai via Colombo. Excited to take this route instead of Qatar Airways who can't currently fly to Dubai. Very disappointed. The DNATA lounge in Singapore was filthy and unfit to serve food. The first leg on the A320 was old worn and very uncomfortable. Service was average and food appalling. The A330 from Colombo was also a tired aircraft and again food mediocre and service average. I would not fly them again unless I absolutely had to. Hygeine and cleanliness costs nothing

### "cabin crew were efficient and friendly"
Flew Colombo to London with SriLankan Airlines. Surprisingly comfortable flight with good service despite the flight being fully booked. Seats: Seats were comfortable and leg space was sufficient as most long haul airlines I usually fly such as Qatar or Emirates. Meals: Average meals and nothing special, I noticed there was shortage of certain variety for few passengers such as the beef main of the second meal of the flight. Service: The cabin crew were efficient and friendly, they were going several rounds serving drinks despite few turbulence weather. There was just one male Cabin crew member who seemed to have an attitude problem and never mentioned the world please to me or fellow passengers nearby. However, the rest were really friendly. This was a surprisingly comfortable flight with good leg space.

### "flight had been overbooked"
Bangkok to Bahrain via Colombo. The first disappointment came when i headed to the check in counter at Bahrain International Airport where i witnessed a hostile crowd at the Srilankan Airways counter who were furious because the flight had been overbooked. I had checked in online a day earlier and this turned out to be an advantage since they called those passengers and told us we could proceed with immigration after dropping our baggage off, which was a huge relief. I never found out what happened to the other passengers that were not allowed to board. The next shock was finding out that our plane had no entertainment system on board and mind you were are talking about a flight that lasts for over 5 hours. I regretted not taking my ipad at that moment. And to add to my vows, the food I  had specially requested was an absolute disaster. The wait in Colombo airport was short and we boarded our next flight to Bangkok. Now this was more like the Srilankan airlines i had heard of, with each seat having a console. The food was absolutely fantastic and the seats were super comfy too. The rest of the flight went off without a hitch. The return flight was a repeat of the first leg with no entertainment consoles on the flight and bad seating. I had a 7.5 hour wait at Colombo and regretted not taking a Visa On Arrival. The flight from Colombo to Bahrain was in a plane without any of the livery that you would expect and a really old plane which had interiors that were peeling off. The staff were exceptional and friendly. I would also recommend that the airline refit its planes with entertainment.

### "unprofessional behavior"
My flight UL 195 was scheduled at 14:10 from Colombo to Delhi, I got the ticket confirmation e-mail well in advance through an e-mail. But when I reached at the airport at 12:45 the airline staff denied our check-in on a plane even when we had confirmed reservation. I showed them with confirmed tickets e-mail but all in vain. When nobody came to help me, I asked them to call their manager. To my surprise she said due to Sri Lankan airways customer care mistake they overbooked the flight and they have given my seats to someone else. At last they offered me another connecting flight through Air India from Colombo to Chennai scheduled at 16:30 and then Chennai to Delhi from 21:00. But situation got worse when I came to know that this flight is already delayed by one hour. I thereby waited for almost 4 hours at the airport and took almost 12 hours to reach Delhi i.e. somewhere around 12:00 during night. It was the worst experience ever facing the unprofessional behavior from Sri Lankan airways staff. Spending extra amount for direct ticket and getting delayed flights with 12 hours long journey in return.

### "transit staff were woeful"
Bangkok to Bangalore via Colombo. The trip was fine from Bangkok. No problems. Very helpful gracious staff. Good information supplied by the pilot. On the ground in Colombo where I had an 7:50 hour layover transit staff were woeful. I wanted to get a temporary visa to travel out of the airport for a couple of hours. Immigration said I needed a voucher from the airline to get the visa. Sri Lankan airlines ground staff refused to give me one because my stay was less than 8 hours. So I have to sit in the business lounge costing the airline money by eating their food and drinking their alcohol for 7:50 hours. Go figure.

### "handled very well by the staff"
SriLankan Airlines is know for its hospitality and this flight from Chennai to Colombo was no different. Cabin crew were courteous and the aircraft was wider with more space. The middle seat in the first row behind the business class has no tray table, separate tray is required to be fixed. Food was served on time and the short flight was handled very well by the staff.

### "great hospitality and service"
The flight was excellent. I was wowed by the entertainment system SriLankan Airlines has upgraded to with new modern, responsive HD screens with good entertainment collections. Well maintained aircraft. Food was great and service was efficient. One gesture I liked was staff offering water before takeoff to all passengers seated. Overall great hospitality and service.

### "the service was fast"
Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. Excellent crew and service. A short flight but the service was fast. The crew was very attentive and was available when you needed them. The seat too very good.

### "not hesitate to recommend"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. Excellent flight that could not be faulted. Departure from Bangkok right on time and arrival into Hong Kong 30 minutes early. The cabin crew were superb and highly attentive and the meal was really good. All in all a really enjoyable flight and I wish I had been travelling on a longer sector. I would not hesitate to recommend SriLankan Airlines.

### "flights I had with them were excellent"
It is with sadness to learn that UL will no longer be flying between Hong Kong and Bangkok, instead, they will operate direct flights to Colombo, which will reduce my frequency of flying with them. With their very competitive prices in business class, UL has been one of my most favourite airlines. The aircraft is spacious, 1-2-1 business class flat seats, attentive service and delicious food. The 2 flights I had with them were excellent in all areas. I hope they will consider to fly between HKG and BKK again in the near future. Meanwhile, I will have to be contented with TG and Emirates.

### "service overall has been slipping"
❎ Unverified |  Dubai to Jakarta via Colombo. I have flown on SriLankan Airlines in Business a number of times since 2010. The service overall has been slipping in regards to cost cutting. This trip gave a great fare in business, so was good value. Overall the A330 from Dubai to CMB was super, new 1-2-1 seating , full flat bed for a red eye flight. I skipped the food as slept. All other flights were on a A321 being from 4-5 hour flights with Cradle seats which were ok. Food was not great overly spiced or greasy and on two legs so not fresh and over spiced to conceal the fact that inedible. Tray service not far off Economy. Gone are the days when they had the meal trolley, cheese boards and desserts and the food was fantastic. Wines ok, white wine served warm on all legs, The crew were at best robotic and not engaging in fact they all looked flustered, tired and bored. Many inconsistencies in service, were reluctant to serve after the meal and were in the galley, which I passed though to use the bathroom they were asleep. Its a 3 star, its an ok seat and gets you from A to B, for the price paid was fine.

### "disinterested attitudes and lukewarm service"
Colombo to Bangkok return. Whilst the out bound journey was reasonably comfortable, on the return journey the seats were very badly spaced with very little leg room. The seats were very old and seats were no longer comfortable. Just an hour into the flight, I was developing cramps in my legs. Secondly, there was a beautiful, brand new, on board duty-free magazine. What was saddening is that they never had any of the products I asked for. Having travelled numerous times on Srilankan Airlines, I was used to seeing the cabin crew selling their ware very earnestly in the past. That enthusiasm was not there in these two flights. The cabin crew were just not interested in selling any duty free products. With such disinterested attitudes and lukewarm service, this airlines will never achieve its past glory. As for the wonderful cuisine Srilankan raves about, I must say I was disappointed. The glass noodle salad which I expected to see some greens, had a hint of celantro and one small piece of a salad leaf. Probably, they must have added some dressing although it was not very evident. Please also get some decent, better quality head sets. The ones provided were uncomfortable and would not sit properly. Srilankan Airlines better get there act together.

### "crew very professional"
Singapore to Colombo. This was a code share flight with Qantas. On time departure and arrival 10min earlier. Cabin crew very professional friendly. Seat was fine but not the best. Meal was fine.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Was a little concerned to use this airline given some of the reviews, but was completely wrong. I found them to be excellent in almost all respects, notwithstanding general economy class space constraints common to all airlines. Online check-in was as per most airlines, and Bag Drop at both London Heathrow and Colombo took just a few minutes allowing plenty of time for airport meals/shopping. We were then welcomed aboard with a bow by extremely friendly, polite and attentive staff (a theme we found throughout the country in fact). Seats: As a 6 footer, seat clearance is a general problem for me on most airlines. This seemingly new A330 in question had room to spare - measured a good 4 inches space in front of my knees, and good seat recline - I managed 6 hours sleep on both outbound and return legs - unheard of when generally I cannot sleep a wink in economy. IFE: Possibly the largest seat back screens I've seen - 10inch - iPad size with full touch screen, dozens of movies, TV series, live news, pause/rewind, gate to gate operation, live cams, etc. Onboard WiFi was available too though I found this a little pricey - the 15Mb I paid for was used up in just a few minutes. Food and drink: Always 2 options (1 always a curry which I find generally reliably good on long flights), and on this daytime flight we were served 2 full meals at the beginning and end of the flight. Drinks were plentiful, full bar, and staff very proactive bringing refills on beer, wine, water and softs for kids. Experience comparable Emirates, Virgin, BA and other highly rated airlines (this is of course a One World partner and it showed). Customer Service: My single complaint preventing higher score was the outbound direct to CMB was amended to have a stop in Male for 2 hours owing to an unforeseen maintenance period at Columbo airport closing the runway until 4pm for several weeks. This added around 4 hours to the trip, though was not the fault of the airline. I had booked 8 months earlier before the work was planned. Others were able to take advantage and fly direct to the Maldives. This however caused problems with seating and I lost the Window seats I had requested for my kids when the flight was re-scheduled (we were given 4 middle seats in a row). Customer Service were responsive to email, but despite multiple attempts, could not seem to undo this issue. All in all a very pleasant experience, and highly recommend SriLankan Airlines.

### "cost competitive but product is basic"
Bangkok to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Airport check in was not too bad, the people checking in, in front of me had excess baggage and chose to argue and delay the process. Boarding was quick, no champagne pre-take off, only orange or apple juice. Took off on time, menus handed out and orders taken including drinks. I didn't receive the drink I asked for. No table cloths. Tray is handed out with both starter and main all at once. Mains are served in heated doggie dishes not plated, small portions, quickly collected and the crew disappeared. No second drinks or bread unless you asked. Crew are polite but not engaging, they just go through the motions. No meet and greet or welcome by purser to premium passengers, unlike Emirates or Qantas. Cabin is clean but the seats are uncomfortable. SriLankan is very cost competitive but their product is very basic and lacks any premium touch . Arrived 10 minutes early.

### "pleasant flight experience"
Dubai to Singapore via Colombo. Pleasantly surprised. Because of the significantly lower price, I was apprehensive about what to expect. However, after reading fairly positive reviews on Skytrax, I decided to give it a try, and would not hesitate to fly them again on some routes. Like the 1x2x1 layout in Business Class. Food is mediocre, but adequate. Service was pleasant, though don't expect it to equal Singapore, Cathay Pacific, Qatar etc. Cabin a little worn, but not a turn off. Overall no complaints. However, don't expect much from their premium lounge at Colombo Airport. A grossly over-crowded mess of mediocrity. Needs to be 3-4 times the size. It was literally standing-room only when we entered at 5AM. Have to wait for a seat to be vacated, & remained so until we departed. Worst business class lounge yet encountered Internationally. Boarding is also an absolute nightmare at Colombo Airport, which is a facility in need of major upgrading, which I understand is due to begin. Mass of pushing, crowding and nowhere to sit at the actual gate where you have to go through a security check. A fiasco of total incompetence, poor arrangement and  confusion, and  Business Class passengers are just part of the same mob pushing at the gate. No separate boarding privileges. So overall, a pleasant flight experience, matched with a very subpar airport.

### "they are testing our patience"
Chennai to Colombo return with SriLankan Airlines. Of my 10 years of travel experience to many countries in different airlines, I faced the baggage loss situation for the first time, when traveled to Colombo on 13th Jan by Sri Lankan Airlines. I booked the complaint and taken PIR also. The staff at Colombo airport gave me a contact number for follow up during our stay in SriLanka. Throughout my 5 days stay, I called this number at least 25 times and there was no response at all even for a single time. Somebody takes the call and disconnect, thereby we lose the call charges also everytime! While returning, we are asked to come 6 hours prior to departure time due to renovation of airport and I utilised this time to go to arrival section for knowing the status of my baggage. There were about 500+ unclaimed baggage lying there, out of which my baggage is not found. After spending an hour's time I was told to contact at Chennai Airport. There is no swift response from their Chennai office also. They are simply keeping quite till end of 21 day tracing period and then take their own time to issue the compensation of 20 USD per Kg for the lost-baggage weight, which is not even covering 10% of original value lost. There is hardly any seriousness shown in tracing the baggage and they are testing our patience for providing the letter to process our claim with Insurance. Apart from losing the value of goods, we are facing hardships without the items planned in overseas tourism travel and also losing our valuable time in follow-ups, providing documents until we get the claim.

### "I was positively impressed."
Colombo to London Heathrow. This was my first experience of flying with SriLankan Airlines and on the whole I was positively impressed. I flew return to Colombo and both flights were early on arrival. Check in was painless and swift. Food was excellent and the crew were professional and well trained. One small gripe was I was travelling with a bicycle and depite following the packaging rules, I was told (at LHR) the bike was improperly packaged and I would have to sign a disclaimer. I refused and directed the agent to the Sri lankan website that clearly showed I had followed their directions to the letter. The bike was then accepted (in a slightly grumpy manner) and was transported without damage.

### "service was ponderously slow"
Seychelles to Colombo. SriLankan Airlines is a good airline but on this sector there were problems with cabin service. The all male crew looked inexperienced. Food service was ponderously slow and halfway down the cabin the choices ran out. Even basics like ice was not available. Otherwise this flight was fine. The seat configuration was a standard 3x3. The flight was smooth, took off 15mins before time and arrived earlier than scheduled.

### "never flying with these cowboys"
London to Colombo return. What more can I say than I should have known better? I went with SriLankan Airlines because they were the only people to fly straight from London to Colombo. On the way back, 10 minutes before due to board the plane the flight was delayed. Disorganised staff had no clue what was going on and did not tell us when the flight would be going for 2 hours. Flight ended up leaving 6 hours after expected. As a result, I was so late back to London I missed a friends wedding! When I complained to SriLankan Airlines about this and asked for some sort of compensation for this delay, they said they couldn't give me anything more than an apology because they were not an EU airline and not flying within the EU. They thanked me for my complaint and looked forward to seeing me on a flight again. No chance what so ever. Sri Lanka is a great country and I will be coming back, but never flying with these cowboys.

### "never fly with them again"
We were asked to come 5 hours in advance due (3 AM) to airport renovation at Colombo international airport, which we did. Due to technical issue flight got delayed by 9 hours. We were given an option to take hotel or stay at airport lounge. We took the lounge option to avoid immigration process again (which itself would have required us to reach back at airport from hotel 3 hours in advance + 1.5 hour drive to the hotel and 1.5 hours back). We were served very limited food with very sub standard quality. Then after 2 hours we were asked to pay $25 if we want to stay in lounge. If we don't pay then we have to move to the restaurant section. Service was very disgraceful and attendants were rude. There were hardly 15 people in the entire airport yet they didn't open any lounge for us. There was no coordination and communications among them. Sri Lanka is beautiful but SriLankan Airlines services are pathetic. I'd never fly with them again.

### "I didn't fly with them"
I was booked to fly Delhi to Colombo. My flight from Kathmandu to Delhi with Royal Nepal Airlines was cancelled because of weather. I called SriLankan Airlines and told them the problem and I requested a seat on their next flight from Delhi to Colombo, which was the following day. They told me that since I was a 'no show' I would have to rebook my flight at a much higher price than the original ticket. I wasn't willing to pay twice for the flight to Colombo so I didn't fly with them.

### "incompetence from Sri Lankan Airlines"
We were booked with Sri Lankan Airlines to fly Singapore to Colombo. return. We also reconfirmed this by calling the Call Centre in Colombo and the Singapore office of Sri Lankan Airlines visiting personally. On reaching the check-in counter – approx. 2.5hrs ahead in Singapore, we were told that “our booking doesn’t exist”. We then confirmed with call centre which reconfirmed that our booking had no issue but the airport check-in team couldn’t print our boarding passes. After waiting for 2 hours we were issued hand written boarding passes (I did preserve them) and then asked to go-to the gate. On reaching the entrance, the security officer said how were we sent without an airline escort and sent back. Finally we did manage to board the plane. I didn’t want the same issue to be repeated so emailed [email protected] to confirm our reservation. The response was – as we didn’t fly on 18th our return ticket was cancelled. I then sent pictures of our boarding passes, luggage tags and entry stamp on our passports. After a few calls and follow ups the customer service centre confirmed by calling me on the day before that the reservation is confirmed. I also got an email confirming the same. On reaching the counter for the return flight, we were again greeted with the same problem, that our booking had some issue. After harassment of about 1.5-2hours we were finally issued our boarding passes with seats in 3 different places (we were travelling with a child). This is despite telling the check-in clerk to block 3 seats right at the beginning. Our seats were changed to enable 2 of us to sit together. On the flight, there was another surprise awaiting us as our child was given another kids food and then requested to return it. Not to forget for both sectors, we received the Bid to Upgrade and our bids were even accepted. Glad we didn’t win the bids. Sri Lanka is an amazing country with amazing people. But at the same time the incompetence from Sri Lankan Airlines will definitely rank it as once of the worst in Asia.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Colombo to London. Worst airline I have flown with. After ordering a vegan meal at the time of booking we were then given vegetarian meals (complete with milk and butter!) Why would you state on the meal options you have vegan food when clearly you don't. Also the 2nd service meal was brought out 2 hours before we landed and they said they had ran out of vegetarian meals. The staff (except one lady who was on the left hand side) were rude. In the end we were so hungry we went to the back of the plane to ask if there was any food available. It was embarrassing having to beg for food and when we asked the 2 women looked at us as if to say no but then begrudgingly gave us the smallest roll ever. I also wanted a cup of tea and was stirring the sugar into the mug at the back of the plane on a table and the young male member of crew snapped at me to 'get back to your seat and drink your tea there'. Most of the time the staff were never around except when bringing around water. I was also sat next to a little boy on the flight whose father was asleep and not once did one of the members of the crew ask the little boy if he wanted a drink or if he was ok. I had to take it upon myself to do this.

### "a pleasure flying with Sri Lankan"
Colombo to Dubai with Sri Lankan on board their brand new A330-300 (4R-ALM). It was a pleasure flying with Sri Lankan as always. Decent legroom in economy, a good selection of movies/tvshows for a 4.5 hour flight, tasty meals topped with their famed hospitality was a perfect way to start the new year. It was a fabulous flight indeed.

### "a huge disappointment"
I took SriLankan Airlines from Delhi to Singapore via Colombo. All I can say is that I was flying this airline for the first time and it was an awful experience. Firstly the flight from Delhi to Colombo was delayed and we did not receive any information about the delay, I had even called up the SriLankan Airlines office 3 hrs before the flight to find out if the flight had been delayed and they told me that it was on time. I finally got on the flight and reached Colombo an hour before my next flight. Anyway I get to the departure gate in Colombo only to find out that my seat had been changed and they just over wrote over my boarding pass and assigned me a new seat without my consent. I had specifically done a web check in so that I could pick a seat that was reclining as I have a horrible back condition and it is a long flight. I was still trying to be cooperative so I did not say anything. I quietly boarded the flight where I saw that the new seat assigned to me was non reclining. The cabin crew were not able to help me (they told me my option was to either sit on the non reclining seat or to off load). I had to sit on a non reclining seat for a 4 hr flight. I do not think that writing over a passengers boarding pass and assigning a new seat without a passengers consent is allowed. All in all SriLankan Airlines was a huge dissapointment. This is the first time I'm flying this airline and sadly I got my return also done with this airline, but after that it's definitely my last.

### "such an embarrassing situation"
Colombo to London Heathrow. Usually I receive good service from staff of SriLankan Airlines, but yesterday something unusual happened before my flight. When I checked in at the airport in Colombo, for my return flight to London,, the clerk weighed my hand-luggage and my laptop bag and put baggage tags on these bags (as done by any other check-in staff). After clearing customs and immigration, as I came to the gate, the lady who was checking boarding passes requested me (in front of around 200 passengers) to put both my laptop bag and my hand luggage on their scales! After weighing both, she said the maximum weight allowed is 7kg and I need to either pay (at US$30/kg) or leave some of my stuff behind! At this point,when I asked why it wasn't told at the time of check-in and why both my hand luggage and the laptop bag was tagged, she didn't provide me with a clear answer. Instead, she withheld my boarding card and was persistent that I pay or leave my stuff. I have never encountered such an embarrassing situation where a check-in clerk ask a passenger to pay for something which was already confirmed and tagged by one of her own colleagues. If I was told that my hand-luggage was overweight, at time of check-in, I could have easily given it to the driver who bought me to the airport. At the end, I had to empty most of the things I was carrying and leave it with staff before they gave me my boarding pass back.

### "Random seat changes"
Singapore to Bangalore via Colombo. Random seat changes, no redressal. I'd confirmed seats for flights from Singapore to Colombo, and from Colombo to Bangalore. However upon reaching my airline gate at Singapore, it was discovered I'd been given different seats. After going back to the Sri Lankan Air counter, I was told there was a change to a smaller aircraft (this was incorrect, the scheduled A320 flew eventually). After I protested the middle seats I was newly assigned, I was given a different pair of seats. However, upon reaching the boarding gate, my seats were again changed, and new boarding passes issued. Three seat changes within two hours! I tried to file a complaint, and was told to stand in a line that had 25 people in front of me. Upon sending an email to the airline, no response was received. I wouldn't ever fly SriLankan again!

### "experiencing dropping quality"
London Heathrow to Colombo. I've flown with SriLankan Airlines before and I have been experiencing dropping quality. The staff in the call centre and ticketing office are clueless. They failed to upgrade my flight in numerous occasions even though I have more than enough miles. If you are a frequent traveller who expect a bit of respect and courtesy from the airline you fly, SriLankan Airlines can never give that. Their staff can't do anything other than reading what's in front of their computer screen and one of the worst customer services experience I have ever with an airline. Their so called loyalty programme 'flysmiles' is designed for loyal customers never to be able to utilise the miles and compared to Virgin, Delta, BA and even American Airlines, srilankan miles are inflexible. Though the airline is part of oneworld, they don't seem to have full privileges as other airlines within the alliance as transferring miles are very restricted. No value for money at all, Cabin service is just average and nothing great for the value other than the fact it's a direct flight from LHR to CMB. Emirates and Qatar Airways service is superior with much more flexibility.

### "good value for money"
London to Singapore return via Colombo in Business. A decent experience overall. All flights on-schedule and uneventful. On LHR-CMB leg they use their newer A330 with proper Business Class cabin, featuring lie-flat seats and even paid in-flight wifi. On CMB-SIN the aircraft was A320, and business class seats were also proper for a narrow-body, miles ahead of what you would get with European or US carriers on their narrow body aircraft. Meals OK, in-flight entertainment selection somewhat limited compared to competition, and moving maps did not quite work properly. Colombo airport is best enjoyed in the lounge, and SriLankan provides a proper lounge for its business class customers, with nice regional food, reliable free wifi, and a good selection of drinks. They offer some of the lowest Business Class fares on the market, so overall I think they are good value for money.

### "good seat comfort and nice staff"
Chennai to Shanghai via Colombo with SriLankan. Very good airline to fly with, good seat comfort and nice staff service. Value for money but the airport is just ok and could improve. Overall, experience is very good.

### "fantastic value for this route "
After a few days stopover in Colombo continued Colombo to London on Sri Lankan Airlines. Check security at CMB was okay although the airport isn't the best, the Serendib Lounge isn't that great either -pretty small very busy and old. Boarding through gate B12 was also a little bit chaotic. However once on board to seat 2A on a new looking A330-300 things improve greatly, intro by cabin manager drinks hot towels and amenity kit offered pre take off. Meal orders also taken before departure, left the gate right on time and in the air within 19 minutes.. Service started around 30 minutes later with drinks then full meal service, which was very nice all courses well presented and tasted great. I prefer Airbus to Boeing on long haul flights, they appear quieter and this flight was no different. The seat had lots of space and while similar to other Asian airlines felt comfy and relaxing. A  1-2-1 set up the same as CX or BR, I managed 5 hours good sleep, additionally I used the AVOD with a good enough selection, a 2nd meal service once again great presentation and taste offered 2hr 30 min out of Heathrow. Arrival 30 early to T3 after a flight time of 10hr 55min. Bags off within minutes I used the free limo transfer service offered to business class passengers arriving/departing LHR which is a great addition. I was home 1 hour after arrival. Airport service apart this is a great service and fantastic value for this route originating in KUL with a stopover in CMB. Would have been 10/10 if not for airport service.

### "airline a positive surprise"
Doha to Colombo on an older A330-300 on 20th October 2016. On time. The trip was marketed by Qatar Airways, but operated by SriLankan Airlines. This airline was a positive surprise and a new adventure for me. They may lack a bit in hardware and it was an old aircraft. Configuration 1-2-1 felt slightly cramped and the two aisles were very narrow. However, the atmosphere and FA’s performance was superb, honest, caring, and they were doing the best to create tranquillity. Nothing was forgotten, despite they were busy attending a full cabin. The Sri Lankan exotic touch on food and drinks were excellent – I loved the food, tried lamb (“mutton”) and chicken hot dishes. I had real tea, not made on teabags! Pre-departure drinks. Business and economy class were almost full, but the pleasure of, and attention by, the FA staff was deeply felt. A nice amenity kit provided even for this 4½ hour flight. IFE the best I have seen and so easy to navigate and operate. Big touch screens made remote control superfluous. Slept well despite the seat is narrow. Faultless!

### "very bad experience"
Tiruchchirappalli to Kuwait via Colombo. While traveling to Trichy Airport, I came to know that flight from Colombo to Kuwait delayed by 6 hours. Then I asked the Boarding pass issuing officer regarding this. They told no problem if any delay they will provide the Accommodation. When we reached there, Reception representative told that we can’t provide accommodation for delaying of 6 hours. He argued for 2 hours and finally I waited in the airport Waiting hall. It is very bad experience with SriLankan Airlines.

### "great service, great crew"
Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. First time on Sri Lankan, actually I booked a series of one way tickets on various airlines for this trip instead of my preferred alliance and airlines. Check in at KUL done in less than 2 minutes, priority security available which was very quick. SriLankan Airlines use thePlaza Premium lounge it's nice with lots of seating, good choice of food and drinks. Wifi good too. Boarding orderly onto an A320 with 2-2 seating in business, cabin manager introduced himself hot towel and drinks served pre take off. The seat 2A a little old but very comfortable with PTV great recline and foot rest, lunch served shortly after take off which was very well presented and tasted very good, followed by drinks. Managed 2 hour sleep before arriving about 15 minutes late. Flight of around 3hr 30min one of the best short haul business class I've used. Immigration quick bags already waiting landside 15 min after arrival. Great service, great crew clean aircraft. If Sri Lankan can do it, why can't airlines such as my normal carrier BA?

### "enjoyed the flight a lot"
A short one hour flight from Colombo to Male. Aircraft with ample legroom and seat width. Ambience was good and crew service was efficient. The IFE was also good, with a choice of information and movies. The breakfast served was good and had ample quantity. The crew served the food quite fast with plenty of refills of tea and coffee. Enjoyed the flight a lot.

### "not willing to give accommodation"
I booked SriLankan Airlines to go from Chennai to Dubai via Colombo on 7th October in business class. It's transit flight. We  Colombo at 10pm, my flight to dubai is at 6pm next day. We enquired for the stay, they were not willing to give accommodation. We had to pay for visa, Taxi and hotel. Nothing was provided by the airline. But at least the immigration officer was humane enough to give us transit visa for free of charge. Horrible experience. Till 12pm, I was with my wife in airport deciding what to do.

### "it was a disappointment"
Flew Dubai to Kuala Lumpar via Colombo. All flights with SriLankan Airlines were on time, the crew were average and were nowhere near as good as previous flights with them. The A330 had the old style eating, as this was a red eye trying to get the bed into a cradle or lay flat was like being catapaulted to the moon. These are well past their sell by date. One big irritation was that a VIP's daughter who was a UM in business and two of the crew were talking/laughing to her at the top of their voices for nearly 2 hours whilst the rest of the cabin was trying to sleep being 2 am in the morning. Just not good enough within a premium cabin, why pay the extra to sleep if crew dont have the basics. Food and beverages were ok, they were out of my main course option on the DXB-CMB leg and the breakfast was greasy on the CMB-KUL leg. Lounge in CMB is ok and serves a mix of food, teas and juices. Overall adequate for the 2 hour layover. On arrival to KL we were appraching and came into a strong monsoon rain spell, the captain had to do a touch land and go around procedure due to bad weather, unnerving and no word from the cockpit had many people very nervous. Overall from previous flights it was a disappointment.

### "delay was managed well"
Colombo to Bangkok with SriLankan Airlines. The aircraft had the new seats which were the angled herringbone ones and were very comfortable. We took off on time and the usual efficient service started. Unfortunately just as we were finishing breakfast, the aircraft had to return back to Colombo as there was a technical issue. This was distressing but the crew kept us informed regularly and luckily a replacement aircraft was present right adjacent to us and we took off in it. Overall we had a delay of almost 3 hours but this was managed well by UL.

### "crew were very nice and efficient"
Dubai to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. This airline offers a good value travel to the far east. Check in was swift and efficient and we took off 45 minutes late due to ATC. The seats were flatbeds with great amount of space. A full course meal was served with 4 choices but I opted to sleep. We landed on time and had to be taken on a bus towards the terminal. The crew were very nice and efficient in their job.

### "very nice and attentive"
Frankfurt to Colombo and Colombo to Paris on A330-300. As I understood its a pretty brand new plane. The plane looks good: seats good condition, bathroom clean. Legroom is minor. I'm not a good reference because Im 6'6 but my girlfriend who is 5'8 just fitted well. On the way back to Paris I was fortunate to have emergency exit seets (row 20 & 50). In-flight entertainment system is Android based and mediocre: just 2 new movies, the rest is pretty old (range from 2 years old to classic movies). Also not a lot of TV shows. Food was good according to Economy standards: on both flights had 2 dishes of which 2 options each were available. Cabin crew is good: they were very nice and attentive. No delays on both flights. Landing was perfect. Recommended.

### "are always very helpful"
I am a platinum customer of SriLankan Airlines and travel frequently to and from the Maldives from London, as I built a boutique style hotel there specialising in diving holidays. SriLankan Airlines have been very helpful in carrying all the strange and varied things I have had to take with me for the hotel. All our china crockery, glasses, towels, etc have been transported by SriLankan Airlines and very little was broken. They are always very helpful if I give them advance warning. The food is special and the staff are couteous and helpful. Flights have been on time and I recommend travel from Europe to all my guests. You generally don't have a long transfer time in Colombo so you can get a nights sleep and then only another hour to Maldives.

### "crew was efficient and friendly2
Chennai to Colombo. Very disorganised boarding at Chennai airport. Flight left with a 10 min delay. Service resumed soon after a take off on this very short flight. Crew was efficient and friendly. Meal consisted of a vegetable fried rice, semolina pudding and rea coffee. Food was delicious. Seats were comfortable on this flight. Entertainment was ok but could be improved like Emirate's ICE system

### "made us miss our flight"
We booked 3 seats in the flight from Colombo to Chennai. The take-off was planned at 00:55am. At 00:00, the person who was taking care of our checking checked our passports and printed our 3 boarding passes. He then asked my friend to show his return ticket to his home country. According to him, this was required as my friend had a business visa expiring in less than 6 months. From 00:00 to 00:30am, we literally begged Sri Lankan employees to provide us an internet access in order to show the required ticket. Moreover we were not able to use the airport wifi as the connexion was too slow. None of the employees helped us in any way. The trainee in charge of our check-in kept on asking us to wait 5 mn for his help, while taking care of the other customers, without finally helping us in any way to solve the situation. His manager was also present, and literally ignored our request. He even threatened us to call the airport security and to throw us out of the airport as we were becoming really worried and helpless. Eventually, I managed to load the ticket of my friend on my own phone, and showed it at 00:30am to the employee. He then replied back that the gate was already closed and didn't let us proceed to the boarding, though we still had 25 mins before flight take-off. We therefore had to change our three tickets for the next flight, paying extra charges, and waiting from 00:55am to 7:20am in the airport. SriLankan Airlines staff made us miss our flight for no valuable reasons. We tried raising a complaint, but they refused to take any action to compensate us.

### "flight experience is above average"
The SriLankan Airlines timing and price, is probably one of the best to fly from Singapore to Colombo. Overall, the flight experience is above average. The flight attendants are attentive and respond promptly to the passengers. On the other hand, the seats are old and in-flight entertainment is limited. Look forward to better in-flight entertainment and they could actually spray a little less of the air freshener before touchdown, this would be greatly appreciated.

### "an absolute delight"
Recently flew Dubai to Colombo and back with SriLankan Airlines. The out bound journey on board their A330-200 was in Economy Class with a fantastic team of flight attendants, great tasty meals and good selection of onboard AVOD. While on the return I was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to Business Class and that too on their latest A330-300. The crew on this flight was superb too, exquisite food and beverage selection, and a good variety of AVOD again. I must say the lie flat was an absolute delight. Would highly recommend SriLankan.

### "seats look old but comfortable"
Kuwait to Colombo in March 2016. The seats look old but comfortable and very wide legroom. The food is tasty, entertainment system is good but needs  more upgrade for the video material. I was flying with my leg in cast and they did everything to make me comfortable.

### "spacious with 2-4-2 seating"
Colombo to Dubai, ground handling welcoming. Flight was spacious with 2-4-2 seating and clean cabin. We had a nice variety of movies to watch. Staff was attentive, food was tasty and had a very pleasant journey. The price was also good.

### "very attentive cabin crew"
Excellent flight experience as always with SriLankan Airlines from Paris CDG to Colombo. Newer lie-flat seats in Business class are comfortable. Herringbone configuration means everyone has a decent amount of privacy. Boarding on time and generally smooth. Take-off also on time. Champagne service upon boarding. Very attentive cabin crew. Food is excellent with different choices of cuisines. IFE was a little limited in terms of selection but for a smaller airline, totally adequate

### "clean and spacious"
Flew SriLankan Airlines from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur on June 16. CMB-KUL Leg, A320 (UL 314). Old Aircraft but clean and spacious and plenty of leg room. Cabin Crew were good, smiling courteous. Food was good with a good taste. IFE is small and was not properly working. KUL-CMB A320, (UL 315) same old aircraft. Cabin crew were not smiling. Food was ok. Both Flights on time. Overall good flight. Will fly again.

### "business class at incredible low price"
Hong Kong to Bangkok. In June, they are selling the business class at really incredible low price, almost on par with some big airline's full fare economy. I got my return ticket at around US$290. I am happy to fly with them because of the flat bed business class seat 1-2-1, private, spacious and comfortable. Service is top notch, generous offering of drinks and food. Throughout the years of flying with them, I have observed how they improved standards, and trying their best to up their game.

### "crew very friendly"
Flew SriLankan Airlines from Frankfurt to Colombo. The service was good and the crew very friendly. You could ask them any time for help. What I appreciated was being given the immigration-card on the airplane, so I did not have to fill it in at the airport standing surounded by many people, etc. The menu-card had a huge variety, which was acutally a little bit confusing to me. We got two hot meals which were very nice.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Singapore to London return flight with SriLankan Airlines and I was pleasantly surprised. The first leg (Singapore to Colombo) was comfortable, although the aircraft seemed a little dated. There was a short stopover in Colombo and access was given to the Serendib lounge which was fine. The second leg was in a much more modern A330-300 which as a 1-2-1 configuration. I had a single window seat which was very comfortable and converted to a flat bed for sleeping, although no separate mattress was provided. The food and service on all flights was quite mixed. The former being a little inconsistent and the latter although very friendly and helpful, a little lacking in some areas. For example, most other airlines when flying business class would serve wine with your meal, but because of the way SriLankan serve meals, this is not guaranteed to occur. I was left waiting looking at my main course, hoping for a glass of red to appear. A white wine was also served warm. No a big deal, but it did detract. In relation to the food quality, I had a lamb cutlet dish on the Colombo/Singapore leg which could have graced a Michelin star restaurant, however this was the highlight, and other meals were just ok. Taking everything into consideration including the price, I would recommend SriLankan and fly with them again,

### "seat was excellent"
Colombo to Dubai with SriLankan Airlines. The flight was excellent. had some turbulence at the start but as time passed it was smooth. The seat was excellent and I always choose 3K. The crew was excellent and attentive. The meals was not up to the mark. Only the on board duty free was not fully loaded. High End Liquor. Ground staff was good. The food at the lounge was not to the mark as before. May be the choice that day.

### "solid business class product"
London to Male with SriLankan Airlines business class. The seats on the new A330-300 on the London to Colombo leg are arranged in a 1-2-1 layout. As we were travelling as a couple we chose the centre 2 seats and as each row is slightly staggered there was a surprising amount of privacy. Seats are flat bed and very comfortable. There is a lack of storage space around the seat but this is made up for by the large overhead lockers. The only slight niggle with the seats is that for a 5" 11" male the foot room when fully reclined was a little tight - but it did not interfere with a good nights sleep. The second leg to Male was in the older A330-200 series with a 2-2-2 layout. But the seats were comfortable. But being such a short leg of just over an hour I am unable to comment of sleep quality. Food was excellent on both legs, and was really nice to see curry's and local breakfast dishes with bold and hot spicing - the SriLankan breakfast was especially spicy! Drinks onboard were varied and the cocktails were good. It was good to see premium fever tree tonic used (but you have to ask) and the Champagne was adequate. Cabin crew didn't come round regularly with drinks but were more than happy and courteous when asked via the call bell or popping into the galley. Cabin crew were well presented, friendly and professional. The only niggle was when serving food they forgot my wife a couple of times - the crew on the left aisle thinking the crew on the right aisle had served and visa versa. I cannot comment on the wifi as I didn't pay for this. I'd expect it to be complementary on business class but as it wasn't - I didn't bother. In-flight entertainment was acceptable with some up to date films but the choice was limited so I can only give 4 stars in this area. If I was to have a criticism it would be the lack of water on the flight. Small bottles were offered at the start and end but we drink large quantities of water each day (even more on long haul flights). When I asked for 2 large bottles of water for my wife and I was told we could only have one. It would seem you can drink massive amounts of champagne and spirits but no so of water. I'd expect a little better on expensive business class tickets. Otherwise SriLankan is a solid business class product and one I would recommend and when we head to Male again I am sure we will book with them.

### "staff are nice and helpful"
Bangkok to Male via Colombo with SriLankan Airlines, and flight is on time. Aircraft was not new but clean. Flat-bed seat is wide and comfortable, meals were average. There are 3 meal choices to choose and some teas. Cabin staff are nice and helpful. Inflight entertainment is average. Movies are quite old and few.

### "disappointed with consistency of service"
After having heard many positive reviews of SriLankan Airlines, I was looking forward to this flight from Colombo to Bangkok. However, I was slightly disappointed with the consistency of service. They surely make an effort to provide outstanding service, but not all cabin crew members provided the same level of service. For example, while on the left aisle, the cabin crew member was handing out blankets, on the right aisle, you had to stop a cabin crew member to ask for a blanket. The one thing that disappointed me the most was the leg room. Several reviews here state that the leg room is good, this may apply to relatively short people. I am 187cm tall and while in a normal sitting position, my knees touched the seat in front of me. I found this very uncomfortable. If you are taller than 185cm, you will not be able to sit comfortably.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Male to Narita via Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. The new A330-300 from Colombo to Narita return was pleasant with the best courtesy from senior cabin crew. The seats were very comfortable and ample leg space. The food from Narita back to Colombo was surprisingly elaborate as I had a bento box with the most extensive small, delicate items - each with a fancy name – and the taste was as nice as the Japanese restaurants on ground. I had some small problems with the Male to Colombo flight but the Colombo Narita flight changed my opinion for this trip. Highly recommended for the A330-300 Business class.

### "service was second to none"
Having read some of the previous reviews, I was looking forward to my flights on SriLankan from Bangkok to London Heathrow via Colombo, particularly as I'd not used this airline for many years - they were Air Lanka back then. Check-in at BKK was swift, fast-track through security and into the Louis Tavern Lounge - nothing to complain about here. The first leg to CMB was outstanding. The senior flight attendant welcomed us by name and shook my hand and thereafter the service was second to none. We arrived on-time and delighted by the experience. We went into the rather crowded Serendip Lounge as we had an hour or two until our onward leg, but having found a seat, the lounge was pleasant with a good choice of food and drink. We boarded the A330 to LHR and found a clean, spacious cabin. The flight was not unpleasant but it wasn't a patch on the first leg. Sitting at the front of the cabin, we were served first at lunch time and had the full choice of menu and the food was good. The later, afternoon snack was served in reverse order so we were last to be served, by which time there was only one option remaining, which didn't appeal, so rather disappointing. During the flight I visited the galley for a drink - it must have been a crew rest break as the only person there was the male cabin supervisor who was sat doing paperwork and ignored me completely. After waiting a few minutes, he was clearly aware of my presence but still made no effort to serve me until I asked for service. Rather poor. Overall, nice planes, good spacious cabins but variable service. They are competitively priced and I would happily use them again.

### "cabin crew were quite serious"
I had never flown with SriLankan Airlines before, so wasn't sure what to expect flying from London Heathrow to Colombo. The aircraft looked quite new. Seats were as comfortable as economy seats can be on a 10hr flight. I did like the larger inflight screens, there weren't as many new release movies as I have experienced on other flights, but they did have a wide selection. The cabin crew were ok, quite serious, they didn't serve many drinks and when they did, they walked past offering wine, then tea or coffee, without a trolley, so you had to be alert and assertive to get their attention or you missed out. The food was good for aeroplane food, they had 3 choices, chicken curry, cod or vegetable curry. They had options for breakfast which were also ok, the only slight quibble would be that the food was not hot enough.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Flew SriLankan Airlines from Colombo to London Heathrow. After a terrible waiting time at Colombo International Airport, we were welcomed by a brand new A330-300 aircraft (3 months old), with good legroom and friendly cabin crew with round the clock service of drinks and snacks. Have good entertainment system with lots of movies.

### "couldn't wait to get off"
My sister and I accompanied our 91 year old aunt (who had health issues) from Colombo to London on a SriLankan Airlines flight on 28 January 2016. My aunt had a Business Class ticket and we travelled economy. Prior to take off we explained our situation to cabin staff and asked if we could check up on our aunt every now and then and also if they would let us know if she was not settled. That was all ok and a couple of times the crew called us over to business class to reassure her that all was well. However, half way during the flight she was unhappy and wanted to sit with one of us, so a cabin crew member suggested I take her business class seat and she sits next to my sister. Peace prevailed for a while until a new face appeared (business class cabin manager) who pompously demanded that I leave this seat as it was not SriLankan Airlines policy that seats be swapped. I explained the circumstances to him and he said it was 'not his problem' and said he can find me a seat at the back. I further explained that the cabin crew in economy were aware if the swap. At this point he walked up to one of the air hostesses and in a very arrogant tone pulled her up for not informing him - humiliating her in front of me. Then my aunt who was half way through a meal was asked to return to her business class seat, which she did but was very shaken. We asked to speak to the superior but was told he was too busy. I understand that you need to have policies in place but some compassion and decency could have been shown in this instance. SriLankan Airlines website describes business class as "Walk into a sanctuary of comforts that is closer to your dreams than to reality. Be a guest of the trademark SriLankan hospitality at 30,000 ft and find your home away from home amidst the cottony clouds. We saw none of this and couldn't wait to get off the plane.

### "cabin staff were pleasant"
Return flights from London to Colombo. The flights were on time both ways. The cabin staff were pleasant and attentive, if a little disorganised regarding meals on the return flight. The entertainment was good, and the lavatories were kept clean and fresh. It did get a little uncomfortable on the eleven hour return trip, but that was to be expected. Would certainly use again.

### "an excellent flight"
Bangkok to Hong Kong, on a SriLankan Airlines A330 with 1-2-1 business class seat layout on this flight. Service was excellent. As a platinum member, the purser came to greet me and introduced himself. Food was plentiful and tasty, followed by wonderful Ceylon tea and dessert. Upon arrival, bags were delivered quickly. All in all, an excellent flight.

### "without business class service"
The boarding was horrible. SriLankan Airlines charges the highest business class fares on this route from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur without corresponding business class service. This morning, all the business class passengers were herded into a common bus without sufficient seats and there was no difference in the handling of business class passengers at all! Understandable if the fares were not more than twice (or higher) than economy!

### "not just about a larger seat"
My wife and I regularly fly Business Class to Sri Lanka and usually use SriLankan Airlines despite having numerous problems over the years. Our flight home earlier this year was simply awful in all respects so we have finally decided to put 'pen to paper'. Dreadful ground staff, dreadful food, poor inflight entertainment plagued by sub titles - the list goes on. Needless to say we will never fly with this airline again but, having said that, I doubt that anyone at the company will care. They simply do not understand what Business Class travellers expect for the premium they pay - it's not just about a larger seat.

### "very comfortable flight"
A very comfortable flight from Colombo to London Heathrow. I wasn't feeling particularly well which one of the cabin crew noticed and made sure I was well hydrated and had food that I wanted. The new business class seat is very comfortable, although slightly confusing in what positions you can achieve. I spent a while trying to understand what positions I could get myself into.

### "flight very comfortable"
I was dreading the SriLankan Airlines flights from London to Colombo return because I don't like flying. On the way out I paid the extra to fly business (which was also excellent), so that I could take a sleeping tablet and go to sleep. On the way back, as the flight was daytime, I didn't feel that paying extra was justified and I made the right decision. The flight was very comfortable, two of us had seats 22 H and K, window and aisle, offering plenty of leg room. Plenty of food, good in flight entertainment and even hot towels! Great service with courtesy.

### "a pleasant flight"
Me and my husband travelled with SriLankan Airlines after many years, from Delhi to Colombo, and we had a pleasant flight. Special thanks for the cabins crew who were working on that day, they were very friendly and efficient with their work. Food was excellent too.

### "high quality service"
I was pleasantly surprised to discover a new SriLankan Airlines A330 aircraft from Paris to Colombo. Stewardess were pleasant and provided high quality service. Food is good. Seats are a bit hard, but there is enough place for legs (I'm 1,75m high). TV / IFE screen is good and large. It was two pleasant trips.

### "lack of customer service"
London Heathrow to Male via Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. We were informed at check-in that our flight departing Heathrow was 1 hour late. Our connection in Sri Lanka was 45 minutes so we asked if there was any risk of us missing our connecting flight. They said that the flight would be held. We departed 1h30 late and were informed we would make some time up in the air. We did not. We landed 1h30 late into Colombo. The onboard staff informed us throughout the journey, right up until we disembarked that the plane to Male had been held. We got off the plane and were directed straight to the ticket desk, where there were two tickets waiting for the next plane, 5.5 hours later. No apologies were made and nobody seemed to care that we had been delayed never mind actually telling us our flight had left. Our next plane to Male was then delayed by a further 30 minutes, meaning we arrived over 6 hours late into our final destination. Again, no apologies were made at any point. The food onboard was good quality as was the service. The Business Class Lounge at Colombo was spacious and staff were friendly. Food was not good. Overall, poor communication and lack of customer service for delay.

### "cabin crew very friendly"
Family holiday travel Frankfurt to Colombo on SriLankan Airlines new A330-300, business class 1-2-1 seating. This new business class can match a similar product with a lot of airlines and I found the seating spacious in comparison with a lot of European or Gulf airlines (except for Qatar Airways). IFE very decent, and the food offered first class. Cabin crew was very friendly. The only minor issue I can mention is the amenity kit, which did not have shaving materials for men. This is value for money.

### "good product at exceptional price"
Business class Paris to Singapore via Colombo. New A330-300 had pod style seats arranged 1-2-1. The next A320 had 2-2 seating. A very good product at exceptional price. The FAs were very attentive and strict adherence to safety procedures. Food and presentation wonderful. Entertainment screen large and up to date. Only slight negatives would be that some other carriers give thicker duvets and seat toppers for sleeping which aren't provided on SriLankan. Many airlines adopt this pod arrangements but I find (being average height) it hard to get comfortable, and feet get squashed when laying flat.

### "Great value for money"
Business Class Paris to Singapore via Colombo. The plane on the Paris - Colombo leg was the older model A330-200 I flew on last time. Having travelled over into London on the new A330-300 it was hard to not wish the newer planes were on the Paris-Colombo run too. The flight crew advised that more of the new planes are on order. The Crew in Business Class were of the high standard I've come to expect. Food and Beverage options were of an international standard. The Business Class Lounge at Columbo Airport is well appointed as one relaxes for the ongoing flight. Great value for money.

### "surprisingly comfortable"
Colombo to Kuala Lumpur is a short 3 hour flight on an A321 with 2x2 configuration recliner style seats. Bus transfer to the tarmac for boarding. The seat pitch is spacious and comfortable. Excellent service and delicious food (3 choices), it was a smooth flight.

### "wonderful service and delicious food"
I was very lucky to have enjoyed the new A330-300 1-2-1 pod style business class seats all the way from Hong Kong to London. The same style seats are now used by EVA, Cathay Pacific, etc. They are comfortable in sitting and relax position. When in fully flat sleep position, only a little narrower at the foot end. Not a problem for me as I sleep on my side. With an overnight transit in Colombo. I was offered a nice 4 star Gateway hotel which included a complimentary private car transfer, although it was a short 10 minute drive. Being a frequent flyer with UL, I am used to their wonderful service and delicious food. On this occasion, like many other, UL has maintained its high standard without fail. The beautifully presented food and the outstanding service is what set this airlines from South Asia apart from all the other competitors in the same region. Once again, it was another smooth and excellent flight to London. Being a Gold member flying business class allows me a whooping 55 kg luggage, priority luggage handling and of course, lounge access. Very often UL offers very special price flying this route, and very well worth considering with such perfect flight time. Leaves CMB at 1pm into London at 8pm, practically a "day" flight and solve jet lag problem. If everything remain as good as it is, they have my continued patronage in years to come.

### "cabin crew were professional"
SriLankan Airlines from London to Colombo. It was a new, clean A330-300. Service was perfect. Cabin crew were professional with smiling faces and friendly approach. Staff made everything to make us feel comfortable onboard. Water and drinks served on a regular basis, food was great, I loved my special meal. Touch screen worked though movie selection was modest. Will fly with Srilankan Airlines again hopefully next year.

### "seat is comfortable"
I recently flew Srilankan Airlines on their new A330-300 in Business Class from Paris to Bangkok via Colombo. The seats are lie flat arranged in a 1-2-1 layout. The seat is comfortable with plenty of surfaces around to place your drink etc. It's not so comfortable as a bed and they don't issue mattresses. The movie choice was not good for a 10 hour flight. The inflight service is excellent with a good choice of food and drink, I liked the cheese, fruit and port service. Business Lounge in Colombo was ok but I've used better. The second 3 hour leg to Bangkok was on their older A330-200 with 2-2-2 seats, not as good but at least you can sit together by the window.

### "onboard friendly crew"
Mumbai to Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Good airport check-in staff and onboard friendly crew. Travelled with my baby and support was given to make the journey comfortable. Meals are good and well presented.

### "did not enjoy my flights"
Male to London via Colombo with SriLankan Airlines. Did not enjoy my flights mainly due to the poor service and the poor quality of the food. Curry is not my favourite and the dishes that were not curry were really poor. How can egg come in a solid square block! The service was poor particularly from Colombo to London. There was very little offered in the way of drinks throughout the journey and when they did come along you had to be quick to catch the attendant. Sometimes they only serviced one side of the plane. They said they had run out if the non-curry choice for myself and our friends but some time later 'found' some? The rest of the food offered was also poor. Potato chunks and sweet corn do not make a 'salad'! Another 'salad' consisted of mainly cucumber, a thin slice of red pepper, yes one thin slice, and about four half inch squares of lettuce. Entertainment was also poor with few games and old movies. I did not enjoy the experience at all and do not intend to fly SriLankan Airlines again.

### "cabin crew did a great job"
The check in counter in Paris was easy to find. We found the lounge very poor in terms of choice of food, with cheese, bread and sandwiches which ran out very quickly, there were plenty of drink options. Onboard we were greeted by friendly cabin staff and offered champagne, water or juice and provided  a menu with dinner choice. As it was the older seat myself and husband chose window seat and aisle which seems like a good choice, issues occurred later when I was asleep and My husband had to step over me - (this is where the new A330-300 is much better with aisle access for all business class passengers) Dinner was served, several courses finished with cheese and port. Cabin crew did a great job. The comfort of the seat were good with a lot of room, the only issue is the seat when flat can be hard to sleep on, so a cover would make it really comfortable. As for entertainment, the choices are not as good as Emirates, sadly my screen broke down and cabin crew spent ages trying to fix it, but with no success. Changeover in Colombo, where we decided to try and get some sleep in the recliner chairs, nice. They have a great choice of food if you like spicey curries along with sandwiches fruit and desserts. A320 which has armchair style seating for a 4 hour flight, comfy and great service again. I would us them again on my next visit to Europe. In my opinion the old A330-200 seem more spacious and exclusive compared to the new A330-300, but aisle access and having a working entertainment system wins, so it's the new plane for me.

### "crew who are very polite"
I flew from Bangkok to Rome (layover in Colombo) a couple of times so I decided to give them my review as I am quite happy with service. I feel confortable travelling with them. Amazing cabin crew who are very polite and with a smile (at least in my experience)! I always check to see if SriLankan Airlines they have a good deal for my journey.

### "cabin service on this flight excellent"
My wife and I selected SriLankan Airlines primarily due to their codeshare arrangement with Air Canada, and the time to reach our destination. We found cabin service on this flight excellent, and cabin crew could not do enough to make passengers comfortable. For the first time, one of the cabin crew helped us with our carry on bags both at embarkation and when leaving the aircraft. The food and bar service were outstanding. We will use Sri Lankan on our future visits to Sri Lanka.

### "best experience of business class"
Our best experience of business class yet. First flight on a smaller A320, comfy recliner seat with good leg room, good service and food. Quick stopover in lounge at Colombo, great selection of foods and drinks, best we have come across. A330 was a new plane with good service and food. New seat each with aisle access and you still can share the middle seats with a partner, this is the same seat that Cathay pacific use in their product, but can seem cramped at the foot end. Cabin staff friendly and the manager came round and shook everybody's hand.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
The Sri Lankan hospitality and the smile is gone. Most of the time they were hurrying back and forth not paying any attention to the needs of the passengers. Seemed more keen in serving the tourists than the Sri Lankan passengers. The rest was fine. The flight was pleasant and on schedule.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Check-in staff and boarding staff were professional and cheerful. Cabin crew were without the usual SriLankan smile. I asked the staff to hang my coat up and the cabin crew member point blankly said that there was no space to hang coats in this plane. Crew seemed in a hurry to serve the meal, clear it and rest.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Check in staff were courteous and helpful. Invitation to priority security lane at Heathrow. Use of terminal 3 British Airways lounge at Heathrow. Serendipity lounge in Colombo very good. High standard of comfort and cleanliness with good selection of hot and cold food. My window seat was very comfortable, and reclined to a flat bed. Would have preferred a duvet and pillow rather than the blanket and cushion provided. Good choice of food served by attentive cabin crew. Good choice of in flight films shown on larger than average personal screen.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
It was a very pleasant surprise to know they changed to a better aircraft from 200 to 300, which means seats were 1-2-1. Very private and the best that this airlines could offer at the moment. Wonderful service from the whole crew, food (a 4 course meal) was delicious and nicely presented. The 3 hour flight went smoothly, although I would have liked to try out the flat bed. Luggage delivery was prompt, my bags were amongst the first to be delivered.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Superb check-in at Delhi. Boarding was average and staff were good. Delhi to Colombo food was good and drink selection was good. As I had a 14 hr lay over at Colombo I was at an airport hotel which was awful. Check in at Colombo was good and the Colombo to Karachi flight was fine. Overall an average experience.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We checked in at Hong Kong airport quickly and easily. Issued boarding passes and lounge invite. That was the Plaza Premium lounge. A lot of airlines use this lounge so there is a separated area for us airline customers. It is important to ask about that, as the normal part gets quite crowded. The airline reserved area has alcoholic drinks and better quality food. The main area has more substantial food. You can go from one area to the other. Our flight was delayed an hour in Bangkok, so we had plenty time to investigate the lounge. Boarding the flight was done in a hurry to try and make up time. Unfortunately, Hong Kong airport is a busy one, so we had to wait for a new take off slot. In the end, we were about 90 minutes late for take off. These things happen. The flight was smooth and comfortable. SriLankan business class is one of the best in terms of friendly service, good food and drinks. The A/V offering has been boosted in the last year, so now there are over 100 movies. Now nearly all business flights have fully reclining to flat bed seats. On arrival we were issued with priority arrival passes. That saved a few moments as immigration wasn't busy at 10pm. Our bags arrived in minutes and we were out of the airport and in a taxi. By that time the traffic into the city had thinned out, so we made up a bit of time there.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I bought this ticket at a very special deal, which included a free stopover in Colombo and Bangkok. Meals were nice, service some of the very best. The connection to LHR involved an overnight about 12 hours. Had a hotel voucher issued and escorted to the Gateway hotel, close to the airport. Back to the airport next day for my LHR flight, departing at 1pm and 8pm arrival. Serendib lounge a delight, with a wide selection of a buffet lunch. Staff talked and interacted with customers. A330-300 with 1-2-1 configuration and flat bed is good, particularly a cheap ticket like mine. 2 meals were served, good AVOD and  on board wifi (not free but reasonable). 10 hours passed by easily. Arrived 8pm at Heathrow and collecting my luggage - which came out first - took about 30 minutes. I am really impressed and was very happy with my choice for my first London trip, I would do it again any time with UL.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Connecting flight from KUL to CMB. Boarding started ahead of scheduled time, something that we don't see normally. As we boarded, we were greeted and directed to our seats. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. Captain did a great job welcoming the passengers and briefing. Inflight service was excellent and a range of movies and TV shows to choose from. Meals were amazing. Departed on time and arrived on time.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Checking is was quite quick at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport. We were issued with priority passes to get through security and immigration. Sri Lankan uses the Louis Tavern Lounge. That lounge offered plenty of variety to drink, (Scotch, gin, wine, vodka, brandy, rum, campari, martini, liqueurs) but rather limited food- a noodle dish, sandwiches pastries and icecream. It was a wonderful way to pass 2 hours trying this and that. Boarding was easy. Economy and business passengers were divided. Sri Lankan offers flat bed business seats to most flights including this, so it was a luxury experience. Champagne was offered and meals ordered before take off. In flight service was perfect. Prior to the meal we were served sherry and cashews. The meals were wonderful. Plenty of choice. SriLankan has upgraded the inflight entertainment to offer 100+ channels. So it matches most airlines. But surpasses many airlines in terms of friendly service. Lunch was 4 courses, but more if you wished. Drinks included wines, spirits, sherries, port and liqueur. Excellent tea! Departure on time and arrival on time. Bags took a while to arrive, but that is outside the control of the airline. Overall perfection!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Since they offered a very low fare and being the only direct flight to CMB from FCO, I decided to give them another chance. It's an A330-200 with completely refurbished cabin with very spacious legroom. IFE - quite an impressive collection with very good LED screens. Food is excellent. Two main meals served with a premium collection of vines. Staff is always smiling and attending. Always ready to help you. A very clean wash room with lots of amenities. It's an impressive improvement for the airline within just three years. A truely five star service.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-DXB 2 April UL225. DXB-CMB 11 April UL226. Flew 2 moths back CMB-DXB-CMB both sectors on the Airbus A321. Really great down to earth food and friendly service. Onboard AVOD did fit well within my entertainment needs.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong just now. The biggest comment is that some of their staff are rude and unhelpful. After the meal a crew member was walking around asking if anyone needed some tea. She walked very fast like she was not intending to serve people anyway so it was impossible to catch her. I finally caught her when she came to clean up our meals. I will never take this airline again if I have a choice.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Colombo to London new A330-300 Business Class. Individual pod style seats. 1-2-1 configuration. Flight on time Attendants friendly and attentive food mostly very good and alcohol freely offered. Probably only negative was the cabin temperature seemed too warm for me but thats a personal preference. Large crisp and clear entertainment screens however the on board flight camera function not working. Fast track immigration pass given out for Heathrow very thankful when we saw the queues. Price paid was cheaper in Business than a lot of other carriers in economy. Fantastic value.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
UL142 (BOM-CMB) and UL225 (CMB-DXB). I would like to start with the CMB-DXB sector flew 4R-ALJ (A330-200) fully refurbished aircraft with RAVE IFE excellent food not the new light-weight sears but was a very pleasant experience. After reading the comments here I did not want to expect much but I was pleasantly surprised that on- board service is better than my previous business class experiences on other airlines. I have to say the cabin crew did every possible thing in their capacity to make all passenger's feel comfortable. I expected much more from the IFE considering its RAVE but it was adequate enough for the 4hr 15min flight to Dubai. On the BOM-CMB sector I flew 4R-ABK (A320) no IFE but superb legroom and great comfort. However in comparison to the cmb-dxb flight smiles seemed forced on the crew's face which disappeared mid-flight and it was noticeable that they wanted to just distribute food except for 1 or 2 of them. It was however a short flight and did not bother me much. Transit Time was 13 hrs and I stayed at the Goldi Sands Hotel Negambo 15mins from the airport with a transit visa all courtesy SriLankan Airlines. Very Impressive and Great value for money. Would definitely recommend.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
UL0504 19th March. Aircraft's require regular internal check ups and I am afraid this does not occur. Before you sit down I suggest you check to ensure all electrical as well as chair is in good working order. If not report immediately. The Staff and entertainment are both great but not the basic operational stuff like seat movement light switch folding table and leg room adjustment.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I have flown multiple times between LHR-CMB and SIN-CMB with Sri Lankan Airlines. This used to be one of the best airlines but its deteriorating. I see a big difference (negative) in cabin service/staff after they joined One World.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I flew on the worst aeroplane I have ever flown on yesterday flying from Colombo to London with Sri Lankan airlines. 1) On the way to Colombo my family were lucky enough to have the seats at the front of economy so actually had some leg room - this was not to be on the way back. The leg room was so poor that my husband had to stick his legs into the aisle for the whole flight and the man sat behind my daughter virtually begged me not to put my daughter's seat back when she wanted to sleep. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable. 2) On boarding the plane we noticed that my daughter's tray table would not stay up. We informed the cabin crew who got an engineer on to have a look at it. We were told it would take too long to fix and they would have to tape it up after take off - the table fell down three times during take off and the attempt to tape it up involved using masking tape to try and tape the plastic to the material of the seat in front - this did not work and the table fell down regularly during the flight and landing - including when my daughter was asleep. 3) The inflight entertainment screens for myself my daughter and my mother-in-law did not work properly the touch screen malfunctioned and any programmes regularly stopped and started making it difficult for us to watch any films to take our minds off how uncomfortable we were. 4) The food was very poor and my son (who has an allergy to spices) was given an identical meal (fish and vegetables) twice in a day. 5) Two of our reading light controls stopped working and the only way we could switch our lights on and off was to ask a member of the cabin crew to go to the front and control them from the main control panel. Overall I will never fly with Sri Lankan Airlines ever again and would not recommend them to anyone.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
This airline is better than the reviews here suggest. Our flight London-Colombo return was efficient and reasonably well managed. The staff are nice the seats are fine with good reclining. The food is nothing special but standard airline fare. The in flight entertainment system is dreadful and broke down shortly after departure for our whole row and the row in front. Staff tried to fix it but couldn't do anything. Moral: nice airline but if inflight entertainment is important for you bring your own tablet and backup battery!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We travelled Doha to Colombo on a Sri Lankan Airbus on the 1st April 2015. The Boarding was delayed as there was a sandstorm blowing. Boarding 30 minutes late we then sat for an hour on the aircraft with no central air due to the sandstorm outside. The staff did nothing apart from bring towellettes. No drinks and we were broiling. The on- board entertainment was operational but the staff didn't provide headsets until an hour after take-off. Throughout the flight the staff appeared totally disinterested in the passengers and when the food was served they tried to palm us off with the fish curry when we had asked for chicken. This was available in the galley they were just too lazy. In all events the food was diabolical and have been suffering since. Deeply regret that we are booked to Oz with Sri Lankan Air and would never fly with them again. QA is infinitely better.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We just returned from a vacation to the Maldives and had the pleasure flying with SriLankan Airlines. We expected the worst and instead we were pleasantly surprised. For a one hour and fifteen minutes flight from the Maldives to Colombo on March 29th 2015 the comfort and service was incredibly good. In the US for this distance travelled you will be lucky to get water and a few cookies while here you were given a very tasty dinner and a smile to go along. What's more the seats were very comfortable with your own TV console and the flight was just great.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-SIN. The at seat entertainment screen was difficult to operate. It did not respond to gentle finger touching and was mostly unresponsive however much one moved one's finger over the desired result. Jabbing at it was not possible because this annoyed the passenger in front. The strange way in which the seat pocket is fixed allows documents to fall to the floor. No one expects flight attendants to continually smile but on Sri Lankan Airlines they often look quite glum.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-FRA UL 553 A330-200 4R-ALC. Badly maintained aircraft None of the PTV's were working. Cramped leg room. Catering was a nightmare. The Cabin crew were friendly and were making a good attempt to interact with the passengers. However sometimes not responsive to the call button. FRA-CMB UL 554 A330-200 4R-ALJ Fully refurbished cabin and properly functioning PTV which was in contrast to the outbound sector. After departure a child vomited and was ignored by four cabin crew members who walked passed the seat leaving the father of the child and the passengers around him to struggle. the crew were not entirely friendly and ignored many passengers including myself when being spoken too. Once again they were slow in response to the call button and distanced themselves as much as possible from the cabin. During service they presented the look as if obligated to smile. The catering was up to standard and exceeded expectations. In the end the airline fulfilled their duty to get me from A to B without a delay hence I recommend it.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew London Heathrow to Colombo in January 2015 our first time to Sri Lanka. We were really impressed with the whole experience of the flight the checking in the staff. A very comfortable flight with excellent food on both flights - we chose the SriLankan food options. Would certainly recommend this air line Flew 11th January to 25th January.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
SL504 28th Dec and return SL505 on 6 Jan. The planes are old and filthy - no inflight videos poor service food served an hour before we landed at HTR toilet not working oxygen tanks changed by engineers whilst we were boarding the plane delayed. It is not fit for purpose and in no uncertain terms should be a member of the One World Alliance. It is an embarrassment to British Airways and the rest of the airlines which maintain good standards. I won't be using them again after travelling with them for almost 10 years.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
For the seat I put 3 because on some flights the seats were excellent but some were almost like economy class seats where you are unable to lay down totally and rest your legs. My main concern here is the food. The choice of the food mainly focuses on SriLankan local food. As foreigner a Western food choice should be added. The other things are the toiletry set. I feel that one should be provided to on a flight of more than 3 hours. Lip balm and lotion also needed as the air in flight was very dry.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Fully deserves its 3 star rating judging by return flight on 4/2/15 Colombo to London. The ageing Airbus 320 plane interior clearly maintained like many SriLankan hotels! Some seats were recovered. Our reading lights did not work. My video did not work. But the cabin crew worked valiantly to restore power and partially succeeded. We were able to move to seats behind bulkhead for more leg room which was essential on 11 hour flight. Curiously legroom seemed 1-2 inches less in this plane than newer A320 on way out. Stewardess did not know but after initially ignoring our request she allowed us to change seats. Otherwise anyone over six foot or perhaps an inch or two less depending on leg length would be severely punished on this flight.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I recently flew on SriLankan's new A330-300 on Bangkok - Colombo and am highly impressed how they have improved over the last couple of years. The new aircraft's seats are very comfortable with an excellent in-flight entertainment and the aircraft also had in-flight Wi-Fi and mobile telephony options. The cabin crew were as friendly as usual and I would highly recommend the airline to anyone.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I bought a round-trip flight from Rome (Italy) to Male (Maldives) four legs (change in Colombo Sri Lanka). FCO-CMB: the seats immediately appeared old and not really clean. Each seat had a display which definition was extremely poor and despite the in-flight guide told that there were a couple of movies in Italian I didn't find them. I asked a cabin attendant and the answer was "I'm afraid that there are no movies in Italian". The available space was average enough comfortable and the food had a good taste. The only positive aspects: good to have metal cutlery and bar always opened. At the duty free they didn't have the cigarettes I asked for (even in the catalogue). CMB-MLE: short flight on a pretty new aircraft but the temperature was set extremely cold despite many passengers asked for increasing it no results. MLE-CMB: 1.5 hour delay trip acceptable. CMB-FCO: 5 hours of lately announced delay about 6 real hours until the effective departure time. Tens of passengers waiting for the opening of the waiting room sitting on a few chairs and on the floor (it was 5 am local time). They opened it about half an hour later that the announced boarding time. Again old-looking seats but better displays with movies in Italian. The displays however seemed not to be originally "built-in" the seats and the inclination was not wide enough per a perfect view. I needed a glass of water to take a medicine and I had to ring the cabin assistants 8 times before to have their attention. The only reason why I booked with SriLankan was the saving of about 150 EUR per ticket but after such a bad experience I will never travel with them anymore preferring to spend more with other companies.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Appalled by attitude and service - family of 5 with children with pre-booked flight back from Colombo to Heathrow - were told on arrival our flight was overbooked so we would need to be put on next flight with no apology or compensation - manager reported they routinely overbook their planes!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I only gave 2 instead of 1 for comfort as the way back to UK we had a little more space but the way there was horrendous I have flown a lot but never experienced being so squashed on a flight. The staff were ok service was very slow I was hungry by the time the second meal came. I asked on the way to Colombo if someone could fix the entertainment system which had a very limited selection of films and twice was ignored exactly the same thing happened on the way back to UK. The food was revolting fish was dry deserts had no substance and cakes tasted like jelly. It took an hour and a half to retrieve our baggage from the baggage reclaim in Colombo. Also on the way back to UK the flight was delayed 3 hours times kept on changing people waiting for hours not knowing what was going on. No one apologised or explained why we had the delay at any stage.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Travelled Business Class SIN-CMB-FRA return. A320 SIN-CMB-SIN fairly standard narrow body seating with limited recline and without footrests. A330 CMB-FRA-CMB seating an old version of 'lie flat' but quite comfortable (new A330-300 has modern seating). Service on all but the last sector was excellent - the Purser on that flight seemed to have missed the 'smiles' slogan. Food was very high standard with a good selection of choices. Passenger entertainment system is dated but adequate. Punctuality was excellent. Lounges in SIN and CMB excellent - at FRA (JAL Oneworld) less so. During a long transit of CMB airline accomodated us at a very good off airport hotel - system worked well. Overall a very satisfying experience and would travel with Sri Lankan Business Class again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
BKK-CMB on an A320. Was marginally better than my CMB-MLE flight last year. Half of the crew friendly and talkative other half very distanced and did the minimal tasks required of them. Got an emergency exit row and so very happy with seat space and comfort. IFE on demand and had a pretty satisfactory list of entertainment options. The food was surprisingly (based on my Maldives flight) the best aspect of the journey - an almost perfectly cooked breakfast. Flight departed 10 minutes late but caught up for lost time in the air. Baggage came out well timed.

Delhi to Colombo and few days later Colombo to London in economy with 2 year old twins. Excellent experience. DEL-CMB was a new A320 with AVOD personal screens. Full flight. Crew were friendly and professional. Food was good. CMB-LHR was an older A330 but with a refreshed cabin also with a new large screen AVOD system. Handling of kids was excellent with juice and cookies on boarding strollers delivered to the ramp etc. 2 full meals served professionally (e.g. allowing us to feed the kids first before coming back to serve us when we were ready). The bathrooms were clean and well stocked with toothbrushes etc. The crew were friendly with the kids and attentive whenever one cried or some food was dropped. They were courteous and also quite stylish and well groomed. The sari uniform and peacock theme throughout the cabin gives some personality to the airline. I would say they have better service than Emirates (although less gimmicks). Certainly better than any European carrier I have taken recently in economy.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I flew Dubai to Bangkok via Colombo and return - Business class. Three legs on Airbus A330 and one on Airbus A321 and I found all aircraft cabins to look a bit tired. All flights on time except the first leg Dubai-Colombo about 40min late. However this first leg was the most pleasant flight - very friendly and welcoming crew they were eager to please and handled very well a group of 4 passengers in Business class who were being loud and drinking too much. On the other 3 legs the crew varied from "not so friendly" to friendly but unprofessional. The food was tasty and portions quite generous I had my champagne glass topped up without asking! Their inflight entertainment was not the best but that didn't bother me personally as I have my own tablet. The headphones and blankets are not really premium quality just the same as in economy class. Even though the toilets were kept clean and fresh on all 4 legs I found the cabins were not very clean. On the return from Bangkok to Dubai I had a 18hr layover in Colombo and SriLankan provided a car and a room at an airport hotel. The lounge at Colombo airport was OK nothing special but pleasant enough.

AUH-CMB-AUH. 90min late departure outgoing due to 'congestion'. I have read previous reports with comments of late departure. Inflight entertainment and food okay. Full flight due to UAE holidays. Return flight - no IFE for 4.5 hr trip. Food okay. Flight okay but only compliant is uncomfortable seating.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-HKG. This looked like the oldest plane I ever travelled on. An A340 which was in a shabby condition. To my surprise all seats had entertainment screens but that 5 inch screen looked like the old television sets of seventies and only 4 or 5 video channels and 5-6 audio channels. The seats were old but spacious as its configuration was 2-4-2 which is rare in newer widebody planes. It had plenty of leg room. The food was average to poor. On first leg CMB-BKK they served breakfast with juices. On second leg BKK-HKG they served lunch but no drinks. The lunch was as bad as the breakfast. No special meal request taken care of. Hope they improve the food services although I find the onboard staff courteous and helpful.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew from LHR to CMB and onwards to MLE on 7/11/14 and back 14/11/14 all in Economy. Outgoing flight A332 seat was uncomfortable - had to sit on the blanket to smooth out the lumps and the in flight entertainment screen was poor. The cabin staff were hard working and attentive. Flight probably 80% full. The A320 for the onward flight to MLE was more spacious and comfortable. Both legs of the return flight were much better. MLE to CMB A343 flight was full but still OK with full inflight entertainment. CMB to LHR in a recently re-furbished A332 which was much better than the outward flight. Lucky to move a front/bulkhead seat with plenty of leg room. Excellent choice of inflight entertainment and hard working and attentive cabin staff. Each flight departed and arrived in good time. Overall would use SriLankan Airlines again but would hope to avoid the remaining old tired rolling stock.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
AUH-CMB - A320 Airbus. Travelled on a Red-Eye flight. Only 2 check-in counters open for both Business as well as Economy Class Passengers. Staff had little knowledge of the check-in system - for a group of 4 passengers on one ticket the service took more than 25 minutes. The plane was old with a shabby interior. Flight was delayed by almost an hour - due to the late check-in of passengers. The food was not up to standard and gave a low cost impression. They did serve wine with sufficient choices. The seats were not that comfortable. Very limited choices for the entertainment system.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Singapore-Colombo-Trichy return on business class last month with my wife and my 5 months old daughter. Both sectors were A320-200 aircrafts with two different configurations. The seats were pretty comfortable but not electronically controlled. Crew were very friendly and professional. The infant-Care trained stewardess introduced herself once we settled down in our seats and promptly reminded my wife to latch my kid before the take off to nullify the pressure effects on the toddlers. Great professionalism. Good variety of food and drinks even though it was a short haul flight. What's impressive is the meal service with in the 45 minutes trip to Trichy from Colombo. The crew were really swift and efficient. Both lounges at Colombo airport was impressive and really appreciate their service. There was a mixologist to shake up your drinks at the lounge.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flight LHR to Colombo business class October 29th 2014 UK 504. We have just arrived at Colombo Airport and have experienced the worst service ever due to no one taking responsibility for the delay which has had a knock-on effect causing us to miss our connection to Male and our sea plane connection. In London we were already told there would be a 1 hour delay and that the Cabin Crew would advise on the connection. Just before landing we enquired again and were told to seek ground crew in the airport for advice at the transfer desk. The transfer desk issued us with a voucher to make calls to sort out our problems ourselves. The voucher was insufficient and the desk operator kept cutting us off. There were no announcements for passengers about connecting flights there was no explanation for the delay nor an apology. Basically no one cares. The flight itself was fine although the cabin was very dated and looked dirty especially the floor in the toilets. I found the staff very passive and slow to respond equal to indifference. If you can find another provider then don't hesitate.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Recently completed my return leg from Dubai to Colombo on Sri Lankan onboard their A321. Service by their cabin crew was very polite courteous efficient and friendly. They even took the effort to assist with a young traveller seated in front of me and immediately put them to sleep. Highly trained to take care of little travellers is one of greatest attributes of Sri Lankan crew I feel which in fact ads a touch of class to their service delivery. Onboard cuisine was good and IFE was lovely. Flight departed and arrived bang on time.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew FCO-CMB-NRT-CMB-LHR at the start of October. Outbound flights were on A340s and needed some refreshing with poor entertainment systems but the cabin crew were above excellent and provided a full bar service throughout the flight. On the NRT-CMB-LHR leg we had refreshed cabins with AVOD system with a good selection of films to entertain us. Cabin crew were excellent with the numerous children on board and also seemingly provided congratulations cakes to couples heading to Sri Lanka on their honeymoon - lovely touch. Would fly again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew Singapore-Colombo-Paris return in September 2014. My first experience with this Airline having travelled First or Business Class with most other Airlines over past 30 years. Check in Staff on all legs were very helpful. Lounges in Singapore and Paris shared with other Airlines very clean and well serviced. Business Class Lounge in Colombo is well laid out well serviced clean great range of Eastern and Western foods and Wines from all major Regions. Flight crews on all legs could not have been more helpful the planes were clean and fresh and well maintained. Extensive Eastern and Western Food Menu International Wines as well. On the long haul legs - Colombo - Paris just a 10 hour night flight the seats recline to flat beds and I slept very well both times. The Singapore-Colombo legs are just 3.5 hours hence the seats are the normal Day Business Class seats. This airlines does not fly to Australia so I used some frequent flyer points to get to Singapore and return. I joined the Airline's Fly Smiles program as I will definitely be looking forward to flying to Europe (Rome London Frankfurt or Paris) with them again. They fly into and out of Paris 3 times each week and have more new Airbuses coming on stream from October to increase their capacity etc. They don't offer a First Class option - they don't need it! Their Business Class performance is better than some First Class airlines I've flown with. They represent excellent value for money and looking forward to flying with SriLankan Airlines again.

Flew Colombo to Dubai on board SriLankan Airlines Airbus A321 and the service was excellent from check-in to destination. Food was lovely. Must say AVOD was just the right amount to keep one busy and the legroom was highly generous for economy class.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Great deal in business class! Flew from Bangkok to Colombo return in business class. Aircraft was an A330-200 which provided us with a nice smooth flight. Business class cabin was clean and inviting however some of the seat furnishing could do with some TLC. Full lie flat bed was comfortable and comparable with most Middle Eastern carriers. Cannot be complimentary enough about the cabin crew nothing was too much to ask. We travelled with our 20 month old daughter and the crew spoiled her rotten. Food and beverage selection is what you would expect from a business class ticket. Inflight entertainment was old with all TV selections coming from prerecorded tapes. Priority pass boarding and immigration was provided which helped a lot as immigration in Colombo looked long and chaotic. Was my first time flying with Sri Lankan airlines and I would very much recommend their business class product.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew UL 852 from Rome to Colombo. I must say for a 3 star rated airline they were pretty good much better then some 4 star airlines I've flown. Given 2 hot dinners with a full drink service. Aircraft in good condition and despite leaving Rome late we arrived in Colombo on time. Entertainment was pretty good and touch screen on the A330-200. Captain kept us informed about the flight and cabin crew were lovely. Had heard stories of FA's disappearing during the flight but it was not the case rounds of drinks offered throughout the 9 hour 20 minute flight. Very good experience.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew Dubai to Colombo on board one of the brand new A320's (4R-ABM) and I must say I was pleasantly surprised to receive a free upgrade to J cabin at the gate. Service on board Sri Lankan J class is superb with plenty of food and drinks. IFE (AVOD) was more than adequate for a 4.5 hours journey. Very impressive and highly quality Crabtree and Evelyn Amenity Kit was also provided. However I must say that the seat comfort on board UL's new A320's was absolute tranquil.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Returning from what had been a fabulous holiday I was brought down to earth with a bang with a sad old aeroplane particularly poor cabin service and morose staff. Food was of a fair standard however having suffered with a stomach upset I choose two bread rolls - fair. On exit from the aircraft the staff all stood with fixed smiles wishing us a good onward journey I spoke to a member of staff who I assumed to be the Cabin Manager who was somewhat nonplussed that I had the temerity to criticise his crew. Would I fly again with this airline again - not on your life! Flight from Colombo to Heathrow Monday 24 Sep 2014.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Travelled from Colombo to Bangkok. Everything was better than expected except the flight was delayed by about 20 minutes which isn't too bad. Seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep the entire flight. The food was great too. I briefly used the inflight entertainment service and that was good from what I could tell.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew UL503 from CMB to LHR in economy on 24/08/14. Tired old Airbus really showing its age. I can't fault the attentive and polite staff and the food and drink were really nice. However ancient seat-back video (on pre-set tapes in 2014 really?) and a really dated cabin made this a really tedious flight considering this is one of their flagship routes.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We a family of four flew to Sri Lanka last Easter from Geneva via London on the way there and Frankfurt on the way back. Sri Lankan has extremely good deals on business class and I have to say the service both off and on board is exceptional specially for the price one pays. The cabin crew were one of the nicest and politest we have had the pleasure to be with and there was nothing they wouldn't do to make the flight as pleasant as possible. The seats were lie flat and very comfortable and we had the best and most copious airline food we have ever had. The curries were tops. The inflight entertainment could be better but when one has such large and flat seats conducive to sleep the entertainment becomes marginal. Would fly them again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We travelled from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur last week on UL226 from Dubai - Colombo then UL314 from Colombo to KL. Both sectors were in Business class. Calling this Business class is simply misleading the seats barely reclined and there were no leg rests at all. A more accurate description really should be "premium economy". These are not business class seats. The food was fine certainly not spectacular however the amenities kit was quite impressive. Crew were polite and friendly but lacked the personal touch such as using your name as the higher rated airlines do.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Our flight was UL 822 August 6th 2014 at 7.05am to Bangkok from Colombo. We had this booked from February 2014. Arrived at Colombo airport two hours before departure as is expected. Extremely long waiting time for check in only to be told that the flight was over booked and we would have to delay our flight. We had already spent four weeks in Sri Lanka and was looking forward to three nights in Bangkok before flying home to Australia. We had to forgo one paid night in Bangkok because of their incompetent booking system! In July 2014 we flew from Bangkok to Colombo to begin our journey and remember the cabin being quite shabby with very poor leg room. Will avoid future journeys with this carrier. To their credit they did give us a paid hotel booking between trips but that is another story regarding the hotel provided. I would have rather have had the flight that was booked. Oh by the way the staff at Sri Lankan airlines said that this happens every day!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Colombo-Delhi. I was expecting a pretty bad flight based on some of the comments below. Was completely surprised. Seats were comfortable with ample legroom. Staff were polite and courteous. Good selection of beverages. Food was excellent- one of the best I've ever had on a flight. The only problem was the lack of inflight entertainment. I understand that this flight is considered regional but it did last more than 4 hours. If you are traveling with SriLankan on its regional flights bring a book. Overall great flight.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
On July 22 we flew from Rome to Singapore via Colombo. Business class check-in was quick and easy. Note that the economy queue snaked for a long way. My partner uses a walking stick. Actually this was an advantage in Rome airport as the queues at immigration are long and slow. With the walking stick and me as carer we could cut those queues. The Business class lounge at the airport is ok. It is a quiet place to sit. Drinks are served but make sure you don't need food! Onboard everything was bliss! Memories of that airport dissolved. The cabin crew were kind. Drinks and snacks were always available. The meals were full and copious. The seat reclines to a flat bed. This means I can't remember much of the flight except for eating a lot. So that's good. The transfer in Colombo airport is problem free. There is the Serendib lounge. Here you can have a shower grab a snack and get another rest in the recliners. The transfer time is 2-3 hours. we had to wait for an incoming flight to arrive for more passengers so it was more like 3 hours. The flight to Singapore takes about 3 hours. The meal was again copious! On arrival our bags were there waiting at the conveyer belt before we got there! We were on the MRT within half hour of arrival.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
UL 554 FRA to CMB on June 25th and return UL 553 CMB to FRA on June 29th. A very friendly and welcoming crew. The in-flight Serendib magazine provided a great read as always. Comfortable seating although lack of AVOD was rather frustrating for a 10 hour flight. Food was decent and the constant beverage service was comforting and appropriately necessary.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
My son and I flew Sri Lanka Airlines a few weeks ago from Rome to Colombo and then on to Bangkok with a 2 hour connection in CMB. The flight went well. The aircraft appeared to be fairly new and clean with a great crew. On approach to CMB a go around was necessary due to an aircraft's failure to clear the runway prior to our landing. The captain was quick to let the passengers know all was routine and we would be on the ground in a few minutes. The second leg into BKK was also good. All was on time and uneventful. The crews were courteous and professional. We would fly Sri Lanka Airlines again in a heartbeat.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
May 2014 we two middle aged Australian couples travelled Singapore to Paris and return five weeks later in June 2014 Rome to Singapore. Both flights business class and via Colombo as a transit. SriLankan airlines would equal other business class airlines especially Australian business class operatives. The staff were happy to attend to anything and actually looked happy to be doing their job. Aircraft clean and check-in staff that don't consider you an inconvenience. My phone call to Singapore reservations were promptly returned. As a well travelled semi retired couple we would recommend and travel again with SriLankan Airlines if they coincide with our destinations.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We travelled business class from Singapore to Rome via Colombo on May 28th. The prices charged in business are a fraction of the competition airlines. The airport lounge used by Sri Lankan in Changi airport is the DNATA lounge. It is quite good. Showers and plenty of food and drinks. The flight left on time. The seats were comfortable and plenty of food and drink was offered for the afternoon flight. We arrived in Sri Lanka late in the afternoon and had booked the transit hotel service. That worked easily. You go to the transfer desk and they issue you with a form. Then through immigration and to stopover desk. You are issued with another form and taken to a bus with the other transfer customers. The Kuala Lumpur flight arrives at the same time and Europe flights don't depart till after midnight so there was a bus load of us. We were taken to the Airport Garden hotel. Immigration was quick and then we went into the Serendib Lounge to wait for the Rome flight. That is the newly remodelled airport lounge. It has good bathrooms and also a snoozer lounge area where you can recline. Plenty of food and drink if you want it. The flight left on time and we got the fully flat bed seats! Wonderful. That meant we could sleep all the way when we weren't eating. I have to mention you are offered huge amounts of food and drink in Sri Lankan business. The staff are really kind and attentive. Next morning we were in Rome! Fresh and relaxed.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
As a frequent flyer I would expect the entertainment system to be good but SriLankan Airlines entertainment system is very lousy. All other airlines let you choose your movies and play it but SriLankan Airlines don't let you do that and all movies start at the same time. The cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. I was traveling from Colombo to Doha which is 4 hours and they only showed around 2 movies on all channels. I would not recommend.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Really great and friendly service from the cabin crew. Good food (compared to other airlines) and very polite flight attendants. The flight got delayed 5 hours due to a bad thunderstorm at the Delhi airport and the flight had to land at Jaipur airport. However there were some angry passengers causing a hard time for the crew and other passengers. The cabin crew handled the situation in a very friendly manner.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-DOH flight on 26 May 2014 was one of the worst travel experiences. After flying for over an hour the passengers were informed there was a problem in the water retention system and the aircraft was getting back to base. By the time the flight landed half the passengers had been served food and unfortunate few like me had to eat what was served sans any beverages (hostess informed no beverages would be served once grounded). The problem took more time to be rectified than expected and passengers were let out for an hour with a bottle of mineral water each. The same person kept on apologizing over the PAS for what had transpired but his crew seemed annoyed and took it upon the poor passengers as if it was all our fault. Being the national carrier a little bit of courtesy could have been the order of the day to the people bringing in a lot of foreign revenue.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew London-Colombo March. Okay on out trip but cabin crew more interested in resting behind their little curtain than looking after passengers. No water/juice offered during flight. Slightly stroppy if asked for any. Poor trip back (Colombo/London). Scruffy old aircraft with broken seats. Every seat taken. Cabin crew had attitude problems towards passengers and disappeared behind their curtain. Annoyed if disturbed. Water/juice which wasn't offered. Although menu given most dishes were not available so you had no choice if you were hungry. Crew obviously had no idea how to serve alcohol as was given 3/4 glass full of gin and virtually no tonic. This might sound good but not on 12 hr. flight! Toilets dirty. This is a hit or miss airline - sometimes okay sometimes unacceptable. Cabin crew should be reminded of why they are employed.

UL882 Colombo - Bangkok Seats 59E and 59D –We've been assigned unwanted seats by their on-line check in system: (not reclinable no room for a person that is taller than 1.70m tables built into the seats arm etc.). System would not allow changes and surely didn't take in to account our next long haul flight with the same airline. We asked for this change at the counter in Rome but they had issues as well with their own portal and could not do much besides promising the transfer desk in Colombo would change our seats. Ground personnel kept on bouncing us between transfer desk and gate shifting responsibility. The Manager in charge showed up during boarding 30 minutes before take-off. Problem was not solved and when I wanted to express a formal complaint I was given a piece of paper for printers and a complaint box was indicated to me. Useless to say that I never got a reply to such paper nor to the 4 emails I sent during the following weeks.

Flew from Hong Kong to Colombo I have flown with them before but found the plane slightly older this time and seats a little cramped. Fortunately no one was sitting next to me and I was able to stretch a bit otherwise it would have been uncomfortable. Flight to Colombo had an ancient entertainment system but the return was on a more modern plane one with a touch screen display. Food was good and staff were typically SriLankan in that they were always smiling extremely polite and helpful. Overall excellent service for the price. Check in at the airport can be a little slow. Would definitely recommend them in the future.

Flew Mumbai to Colombo return on SriLankan. Check in at Mumbai was easy. Flight to Colombo was alright with very uninterested crew who we barely saw. They did little to provide any service. Check in for the return flight at Colombo was a nightmare. One queue open for what looked like many flights. We moved to the web check in queue when it opened and that was slightly better. Service on this sector was better and the staff seemed a little more responsive. Food very okay. No inflight entertainment whatsoever.

Travelled KL to Colombo on first leg to Rome on A321. A bit bumpy to be expected in the tropics at this time. Cabin staff very professional and friendly. Reclining business class seat and space fine for a shortish flight. Everything in good condition at least in Business Class. Excellent food. Devilled fish moist and fresh. Adequate choice of wines/spirits. Hand held entertainment system poor with less than satisfactory vision quality but not really an issue for the shortish flight. Cheers for Kindles. For the low price very satisfactory.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Having read reviews about this airline (especially economy which we would be flying) I was concerned with absolutely no reason. The check in process was quick and easy when we got on the plane we were greeted by beautiful smiles from the cabin crew. The seats did lack leg room for such a long flight but that is my only gripe. My daughter and I had trouble with the audio which was quickly sorted once we'd pointed out the problem we were told we could change seat if they weren't able to fix it; there was a good choice of films to watch. The food was lovely on the outward trip not so good on the way back. The service was very good the cabin crew came round with water between meals and quickly brought anything else requested always with a smile.

Dubai - Colombo - Singapore - Colombo - Abu Dhabi. All flights on time with the usual warm service. Great down to earth food and drinks. Most flights had the lie-flat beds which was very comfortable. The only downside was the poor hotel provided during my long layover on the way back to AUH.

We flew business class in February 2013 to Colombo and thoroughly enjoyed the journey. On the way home the aircraft used was not refurbished - we were told by the crew it was the 23rd plane in the fleet. So for 11.5 hours - no fully reclining beds video screen disappeared once the passenger in front pulled back their seat scruffy all round and decrepit toilets. We complained on our return and were dismissed as it being just one of those operational problems. We did not use SL again on our return this year.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew on UL504 from Heathrow to Colombo recently - after reading some of the reviews I was somewhat concerned but the flight was on time and boarding was orderly. Passengers were allowed oversize bags in the cabin which made it difficult to find room in the overhead bins. Cabin crew were attentive and brought water round between meals. Meals were tasty and the tea served was the best I have been served on a flight. The only downside was the very hard seat. Return flight was fine - different version of the A330 with more comfortable seats.

Flew Dubai to Colombo recently boarding in Dubai was quick flight on time crew very friendly and courteous food was good too.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We upgraded to Business for the outbound LHR-CMB the service was good and the seating good. The one issue I had was that no landing/immigration cards were handed out so when we landed we had to go off and fill one in it should have been done on board! The return CMB-LHR was economy. The difference was very marked. The food was dismal and cold even duty free was poor only had one of the things we wanted and that was broken when we checked it. Cabin crew were polite but not overly sharp. If they were giving out drinks and were distracted they often forgot to come back to those they had missed.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Travelled the short distance from Colombo to Mattala and back. The aircraft (an A320) was clean and punctual on both occasions and the on-flight staff were friendly and attentive. However I had previously received 7 emails in the previous two weeks amending either our flight time or the flight number. Because of this check-in at Colombo was a total farce. I am not sure if it is systems training or both that are the problem but the impression given if of total incompetence.

Awful flight from Colombo to London Heathrow on 23 February. Uncomfortable seats smallest leg room space I have experienced on any aircraft let alone a 11.5 hour flight. Food choices dreadful and the laziest staff I have come across. Served 2 meals but there was no offer of any additional drink or indeed any interaction with the passengers whatsoever my seat was immediately behind the crew area and the crew spent the entire flight chatting together and flicking through magazines. Needed to be told by passengers that there was no toilet paper or hand towels available We asked for a white wine with our meal were served red asked for coffee and tea was poured I had finished eating my meal before my partner even received his. All in all an appalling experience. The crew collected the headphones from the passengers 45 minutes before landing and each then spent around 15 minutes in the toilet preparing themselves for landing. Never again.

Travelled with family of 5 on return journey from London to Colombo during half term. Checked in seats on-line in the middle of the front section of economy to try and get some sleep on the night flight a week in advance. When we arrived at Heathrow we were given 5 seats in the back two rows of the back of economy - toilets on both sides a light on all night and constant footfall. Worst seats on the plane! When we complained at the check-in desk we were told by embarrassed staff that head office in Colombo had decided that day to give a group priority and move people who had already checked in to other seats. Outrageous! As it happens it was a newly kitted out plane with decent entertainment and the staff really looked after us as they knew we were cross so not as bad as it could have been but cannot believe that they could just decide to move you after checking into seats. The flight back was an older kitted out plane with poor entertainment and very uncomfortable seats. The sound did not work on my seat so no films for the 11 hour flight. Given to understand that loads of them don't work and they don't have the spare parts to fix them.

Flight UL0315 KUL-CMB 7th Jan 2014 and UL0263 CMB-DMM same date. Return flights on 28th Jan 2014 on UL 0264 and UL0314. Relatively good airline but not punctual. Horrible IFE and slightly lazy crew. Website also needs upgrading. Only redemption is the price far cheaper than other airlines which could be the reason for the popularity.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew A330 from Bangkok to London. 2 flights same type of plane. One of the cheapest choices. First off the Pro's: The service is excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. It felt like any request could be met and I saw myself and other passengers receive such. The food was good but not as good as I hoped. Don't sit in the middle of the plane as your choice from the menu will have run out. Cons: Plane seemed clean but a little old and the seat was uncomfortable. There are boxes underneath the window seats and some inner seats so stretching your legs was impossible. The entertainment system is awful for today's age presenting around a small choice 5 Hollywood movies plus some foreign ones and TV but you cannot pause them or restart. So choose one film at the start and that's it. 2 of the screens I looked at didn't work and a 3rd had bad audio. On a whole It was not as enjoyable a flight as it should have been but there is potential. For the money I guess it was ok.

Flew from Paris to Colombo and return. Plane was a bit shabby on the way out but everything worked and the seat was comfortable. Food and drink were very good and service was excellent. IFE was awful Paris to Colombo although on the return journey the list of films had changed and the programmes available were much better. The headphones provided are truly awful. No amenity packs provided on Colombo to Paris as the airline had run out of stocks. For the price paid a very good product and well worth the money.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Karachi to Colombo the A320 KHI-CMB was brand new. Spectacular plane great service and excellent staff. The flight from CMB-Kuala Lumpur was not very good. It was an A340 and the seats were very uncomfortable the staff were good but that's just about the only thing that was good. The food was fair. The staff did offer coffee tea and drinks throughout the flight. The Entertainment was fair.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I have been travelling with Sri Lankan Airlines since 1987 from Dharan to Colombo. I travel twice a year and always prefer to travel with Sri Lankan Airline. Last time I travelled to Colombo from Dammam on 16th January 2014 and return to Dammam on 6th February. On 6th flight to Dammam was a new experience. Cabin crew were friendly smiling and lot of energy. Even checking counter staff were very polite and helpful. Keep up good work Sri Lankan Airlines.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
BKK-CMB in economy class. Old plane seats are ok for 3-4 hours flight but would be dreadful to it in for a long haul flight. Food looked very bad I did not touch it. Cabin crew were friendly. The only reason to choose this company is that they have flights in normal hours somehow most of the airlines flying during night to Colombo.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Travelled in January 2014 from London to Colombo and return. Delayed flight by 1 hour 40 minutes outbound but departed on time on return. All staff on both flights were friendly and helpful. The choice of food was fine - 3 choices of main course and the use of real metal cutlery. Drinks were plentiful and when I asked for a glass of wine and a rum and coke I was served both without complaint or any negative indicators. Not all the seats were of uniform colour some were green and others brown but that is a covering the seats my wife and I sat on were comfortable and plenty of leg room. Sufficient entertainment to keep me entertained though not as recent in the line of films than other carriers. This was my first experience of SriLankan Airlines and having read the reviews prior to flying I was a little sceptical but I was pleasantly surprised and will use SriLankan again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Dubai to Colombo (UL226) on 19 December 2013 and Colombo to Bangkok (UL882) on 20 December. I returned to Colombo (UL887) on 31 December and on to Dubai (UL225) on 1 January 2014. I had 4 flights with them last month two of which were delayed. The airplane toilets were very dirty right from take-off. The food also unpalatable. The staff begin with big smiles but these disappear very fast especially if you voice a comment or question they don't like. They are highly unprofessional and very quick to display irritation with passengers. The entertainment service malfunctioned so much it is better to forget about it. Even when it worked in 3 of my 4 flights my TV or earphones didn't work. Very cramped seats flimsy blankets which the staff takes back 40 minutes before landing in an aggressive way on all my flights. The tickets were cheaper than other airlines but next time I will pay more to use a different airline. I frequently use budget airlines so am used to lower quality but Sri Lanka Airlines hit new lows for me.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-Rome. Silk route check-in a delight and fast track to the Serendib Lounge. Busy but nice views of apron and excess of food and beverages with waiters in white jackets. Boarding a bit chaotic but as usual a warm and smiling greeting onto aircraft by cabin crew. Addressed by name and welcomed on-board again by crew at my seat. Quality amenity kit with extensive menu placed next to me with my melon juice. Superb personal service everything anticipated by crew and better than first class on many high tier airlines. Night flight so I did not bother with IFE but I think this needs improvement. Breakfast was 5 course luxury again served with style and charm by crew who I feel sell this airline. Flights on time. I am sold as booking next flight to CMB in J class. It is an outstanding product for the price paid.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
You'll see earlier a post from me from SIN to CDG via CMB. My return flight from Paris to CMB was quite different. We had an old seat A330 (creole recliner style) which disappointed me. The seats are pretty bad but for the price one cannot complain and its pot luck whether you get the new or old version at this stage. The IFE is continuous loop so bring an iPad full of stuff to watch as the UL offering is terrible (and I'm being polite). However the food and service from CDG was markedly different. The cabin crew were on the ball and were polite prompt helpful and caring. The food quality was excellent even though I ate very little due to the timing (desert was a let down as the advertised offering and what came were strangely different). My partner and a friend all ate more and enjoyed theirs as well as the flowing wines including Australian quality wines. Now if only the product and service was consistent UL J class would be a force to reckon with. But then again the price would skyrocket I'm sure. We'll be doing this again later this year so clearly we're sold.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Dec 2013 flight between Bangkok and Hambantota was cancelled with only 3 days notice from Sri Lankan Airlines. All future flights between these cities also cancelled. No explanation given. My family were re-booked onto a flight between Bangkok and Colombo 15 hours after the intended departure time requiring an overnight stay in Colombo and then a 5.5 hour car drive the following morning to get my family to our Pre-booked accommodation in the South East of Sri Lanka near Yala. We had 3 other flights pre-booked with Sri Lankan Airlines as part of our holiday (which was partly ruined by our forced itinerary changes). In summary our flight experience was as follows: Food and beverage seemed slightly better than many other airlines we've travelled with. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and professional. In-flight entertainment may as well have been non-existent. I don't recall it being that bad 30 years ago. The age of the plane it's seats screens and entertainment consoles must be approximately 30 years old. Flight times were consistently changed by 10-20 minutes (early and late) without any notification. The staff at airports were grossly under-staffed and consequently appeared irritable cranky and unprofessional. We will never fly with them again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Recently had return flights BKK-CMB. Our flights were at civilised hours in the morning and afternoon. 2 weeks before departure I had an email to say that the flights had been changed - to late in the evening and the early hours of the morning - very inconvenient for us. Flight to CMB was on time the plane was a bit old and the in- flight entertainment units were very dated and did not work properly. The food was poor. Return flight to BKK was a poor experience and Bandaranaike airport was dreadful. Arrived 3 hours before our flight at 1.30am. The airport was packed and chaotic. There was no system at the few and inefficient check in desks open and passengers were very confused. No staff to help or guide people. We queued for 2 hours and checked in with 15 minutes to go before our flight left. No fast track system for people in a hurry and minimal information the very few announcements were too quiet and unintelligible. We managed to get on the plane but it was then delayed for over an hour. It was the middle of the night and people were trying to sleep but as soon as we were airborne the air hostesses went around waking people up to give them a drink and meal. The lights were not dimmed for sleeping. It was a very stressful and tiring experience. We will not fly with this airline again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew after several years from SIN-CMB return. A320 aircraft small but the cabin crew was good and attentive to passengers. This was a change from the last time I flew where the crew was very unprofessional and lazy. Food was ok and entertainment was generally fine.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew with my family SIN-CMB 2 day stopover then CMB-LHR just before Christmas and then FCO-CMB-SIN in January on the way home. All in business and A320 to/from SIN A330 to LHR and A340 from FCO. Boarding on all flights orderly interestingly business was boarded last to avoid economy crush but economy boarding appeared to be very smooth. Silk Route service at CMB was great like first class on other airlines dedicated check in entrance all paperwork sorted out while waiting in a lounge then escorted through customs. Small service company lounge in SIN nice enough lounge in CMB but no Singapore Airlines or Qatar equivalent though food offering was good and nice view over the airport. All flights left on time except FCO which was 30-40 minutes late due to customs debacle but time made up en route. Large short haul business class seats in grey leather on the short (3.5 hours) SIN flights. Very nice catering tray based with 4 main choices. Functional on demand entertainment system with some good movies. Long haul flights both featured full flat beds in attractive terracotta colour leather fine seats and good for sleeping. Two pillows and nice wool blanket supplied along with small but very nice Bulgari amenities bag. A330 entertainment system was loop based some ok movies but mainly slept on this sector. A340 entertainment system was much more modern on demand system with good movie choice. Maybe they have not finished upgrading the A330 fleet with new entertainment systems. Catering on long haul flights out of Colombo and Rome was outstanding full table cloth and china metal cutlery quality glassware. Served with pre meal drink and cashews appetisers mains cheese and fruit dessert coffee/tea/liqueurs etc. 4 main choices restaurant quality food comparable to first on some other airlines I have travelled on. Wines were pleasant enough but not of the same standard as the cuisine but fine nevertheless. I don't think I have ever flown on an airline with so many hot towels being offered! Overall cabin service was amongst the best I have encountered very professional but also very friendly and personal. The crew had a wide age range and were all charming and a credit to the airline. Pilot announcements were clear and informative. All aircraft cabins were clean and we'll maintained and fare prices were incredibly competitive. My first impression of flying on Sri Lankan was very good indeed.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
My email to the airline regarding a seat request was never answered my special meal request was not taken into account. Flight BKK to FRA via CMB was a disaster: have never seen such an old and run down aircraft (A330 dating from the early 90's) dirty seats torn seat covers non working entertainment facilities dirty screens and windows overhead lockers opened at take off. Cabin crew not trained extremely unfriendly and unmotivated. Food was cold and inedible only water available during night. Never again will I will with this airline.

We upgraded to J class from Y class for a flight from Shanghai to Bangkok a stopover point between Shanghai and Colombo. At the time of the upgrade the call centre informed me that the plane was a new updated A340. After the upgrade was complete and the seat plan made available for J class it became evident that it was in fact an old A340 with bucket seats rather than lie flats. Check-in took 45 minutes in the J Class counter with 2 people in front of us. and an empty business class. The Lounge at Shanghai Terminal 2 was mediocre and the lounge staff incompetent not knowing where the flight was boarding or when we should be boarding. They actually made us almost miss our flight by taking us for an unnecessary drive along the tarmac. We eventually got back to the terminal building and found our way to the plane after running away from lounge staff. The flight itself was ok. The plane was old with uncomfortable seats. Once the person in front put his seat back you were completely restricted and could not extend your seat fully. The seats were not great. The staff were very good and friendly and so was the food. All in all they did make up for the sub-standard equipment. The IFE was almost non existent. The airline has a long way to go.

Flight back from Colombo to Frankfurt 5th January 2014 we arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure. Check-in at all counters was very slow We waited more than 1 hour and when it was out turn we were told the flight was over booked and there were no seats for us! We got the information about 1 hour before departure. On our flight to Frankfurt there were 8 people on standby and the flight to London and to Sydney was over booked. We finally got a plane at 2 am to London and arrived in Frankfurt the late afternoon instead of 5 am.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
BKK - CMB. Terrible experience before even checking in. They cancelled our flight two weeks before departure without even offering an apology just a terse email. Had to ring customer service to get new e-tickets. They moved us onto a later flight and then when we got to the airport they told us they had over booked the flight and we would have to come back tomorrow. No discussions or compensation offered. After much complaining they finally admitted that there were a few seats left and let us check-in. Planes are old. Seats uncomfortable and my partners in-flight entertainment system didn't even work. Avoid.

CMB-MLE Business. Had bought two coach tickets and bid for a Business upgrade which was confirmed several days prior to departure. The CMB SriLankan Lounge is newly refurbished and had an amazing buffet. The older A340-300 had about 35 paxs and 6 of us in Business. The cabin is a little dated but clean. A nice breakfast menu was handed out for this 1.5 hour flight to Male. Food was good not exceptional. No inflight entertainment was available. Colombo is a great stopping point to spend a few nights before heading to Male. Arriving in the late morning allows for day arrival connections to the islands. Look forward to SriLankan becoming a member of OneWorld.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
DXB-CMB-BKK KUL-CMB-BKK. A real variety with the seats and IFE but consistent in excellent service and food. DXB-CMB on A320. AVOD but seats not comfortable. CMB-BKK on an A330 with AVOD and pod like sleeper seats. KUL-CMB on a A340 with cradle seats and no AVOD. CMB-DXB on an A330 new flat seats (more flat than other A330) but no AVOD. Online check in didn't work so took 15-20mins checking in each time. Only given Bvlgari amenity bag on DXB- CMB. Would fly again but plan for A330.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Had an excellent Business class return flight COK-CMB-MCT on 29 November 2013. COK-CMB sector with a new A320 with Flew A320 SIN-CMB followed by an A330 CMB-CDG in business. A320 seats mildly comfy but the A330 seats are excellent (being ex Emirates). IFE is limited on UL but adequate enough. Amenity packs are basic but I never get excited by them so were OK by me. Food looks good on paper but average in reality. Drinks are OK. Service is very patchy the FA's try but this is an airline from the third world and service reflects this. NB: no noise cancelling headsets (or sleeper suits/pyjamas) so if this is important to you bring your own. If space on a budget is what you want I think Sri Lankan will please. If you want to be blown away by service and luxury pay the extra and fly with a legacy or middle eastern carrier.

Had an excellent Business class return flight COK-CMB-MCT on 29 November 2013. COK-CMB sector with a new A320 with IFE and CMB-MCT an old A320 which has no IFE but provided an IPad. Seats not fully reclining but very comfortable. Crew very polite attentive and pleasing and full of energy to serve the passengers with their warm welcome. Choice of tasty food and quality beverages but no amenity kit provided on the CMB-MCT night flight. Cabin and Toilet very clean and tidy. On time performance. Announcement from the Cockpit were clear and audible. COK Business Lounge (Earth Lounge) very average but at CMB the Serendib Lounge is well maintained food is adequately stocked but good selection of beverages. Lounge toilets are spotlessly clean and well maintained at CMB. Only one charging point for laptop Wifi connection. Other internet available are either very slow or cannot access. Apart from minor points overall an excellent experience with SriLankan airlines and will fly again.

LHR-CMB. Planes are dated worn and seats could be more comfortable. reasonable selection of films on the inflight entertainment screens were viewable but the image quality not great.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Excellent service at business class desk in Colombo lounge too busy. But ok. On board excellent service better than many 1st class services. Excellent food and attention to service the inflight entertainment was poor but it is on British Airways. The wash bag was excellent but on arrival at London nobody knew about the car service which was booked. Excellent flat beds on board.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Outward trip Heathrow to Colombo. IFE is fairly new to me so impressed by choice and selection to start of film. Seating ok. Service ok too. Return trip way worse. Why on earth do they allow passengers to tilt seats back? 11 hours of cramped seating next to the window leads to wild thoughts of jumping out just to feel comfortable (for a short time). Woken by cabin lighting nine hours into trip - for a hot towel and the worst meal I've ever had on a plane. Staff seemed more intent on making their duties easier - not keeping us comfortable. At the end when descent (as always) makes my hearing go I was being asked to do something by a stewardess - turns out she wanted me to raise the cover of the window behind me. Not my job or problem. IFE mostly Asian language films but enough there to do some distracting from the awful legroom problem. On loop system. Cabin tatty. So ok out - poor return.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Rome to CMB. Generic lounge below par at Rome and boarding chaotic with no separate lane for premium passengers. Then things change. A very warm and gracious greeting at aircraft door and met at seat with more smiles. Jacket taken with no request and purser introduces himself with a chatty welcome to every passenger. Menu excellent and food well presented. Attentive and warm cabin crew with proactive service. Flat bed great but lacks a cover and duvet. Good amenity kit. Silver tea service the good old fashioned away. Flight on time. AVOD good but needs more film choice. Will be up there with SQ and CX if only they can improve boarding procedure give noise cancelling headphones and I think a more extensive wine list. For price paid an outstanding service and flight. Cannot wait to use again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
On 14 Nov flew flight UL 205/161 MCT-CMB-TRV in Business Class. Wonderful experience compare to airlines in/around Indian sub-continent. Apart from an hour delay (unavoidable technical glitch) the A320 flight experience was superb and commendable. Wish to congratulate the Crews for their presentable personable manner in which they served the passengers (a mixture of business class passengers - I mean some are freely upgraded from Economy) but all received that warm welcome and sincere services. The FA's keep smiling and all requests are met and well attended too the food was delicious and in good quantity with plenty of softies and drinks served without hesitation. The minor lags to point out is no IFE and seat non-reclining to a half bed to keep up with modern luxury of travelling but its ok for a four hour trip. Even the toilets were kept clean and full of amenities stored and presented a personal amenity kit to Business Class passengers. To be honest it is my first experience with SriLankan Airlines and I am fully satisfied with their services.

I flew Business Class from Colombo to London. I have used the airline several times in the past and have always had a pleasant flight but this exceeded my expectations of Business Class. The crew were gracious and attentive. The food was superb and beautifully presented. The comfort of the seats enabled me to sleep peacefully for a few hours something I normally can never do on a long haul flight.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I flew from Colombo to Hong Kong with a short stop in Bangkok for one hour where we had to stay on the plane. Strangely enough for some reason they did a roll call on the plane while we were in Bangkok but I had my Bose noise cancelling ear buds in plus I was sleeping while waiting for them to get ready to go again. I didn't hear anyone calling my name and this would not be a concern regardless since I was just continuing on to Hong Kong. Because the head crew guy for the flight attendants didn't get a response from me he had my checked bag pulled off the plane and also found my bag in the overhead and pulled that also. I was then rudely poked in the shoulder to wake me up and asked if the bag they just brought back on the plane was mine and then they put it back in the overhead bin. Then the main guy came and informed me that they had to delay the flight had pulled off my luggage and then somehow realized I was on the flight - go figure - and had to put everything back. I was shocked and was being treated as if this was somehow my fault. Totally hilarious and crazy. We left half hour late and continued to Hong Kong where my checked luggage showed up. I was worried actually. Otherwise the entertainment system worked great and the plane was a pretty new one. The service was good otherwise.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB return. Outbound flight on newer A330-200. IFE functional but no AVOD so choice rather limited. Crew friendly food good and drinks free-flowing. Toilets spotless throughout. Inbound flight on older A330-200 which was showing it's age- seats barely had any cushioning left and overhead CRT monitors flickering but otherwise well maintained. Crew more surly and absent for long periods of the flight. Again food excellent but had run out of options half way through the dinner run. IFE again rudimental but functional. Both flights on time. Overall the only direct option and a reasonable proposition for the price. Marred only by outdated IFE and inconsistent crew.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
London to Colombo return airbus 330-200. Aircraft's were a bit tired but clean and on time. Seats are hard and uncomfortable and beware the window seats with IFE underneath in boxes if you are tall. Food is average and service slow. Return flight: Inflight entertainment did not work for window seat or aisle passengers in many cases - tried to get cabin crew to fix this- eventually it was done but very late. First choice meals for second meal ran out and some did not get a meal for a long time while crew ran around trying to find something for them to eat. To be fair our particular cabin crew were very polite and helpful. Both flights full.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I have flown Sri Lankan many times and had little to complain about. However this flight was a nightmare. I flew from Colombo to LHR and back. The entertainment system was not working properly (No Volume). This I brought to the notice of the cabin crew member who changed my headset 3 times with no result. Then I was told that the flight was full and that if they could not get the system working it was "hard luck" which is not the answer I expected. I managed to get it working by gently kicking the box under the front seat which I know now is something to do with the entertainment system. I usually stay awake on my flight to London as it helps me to overcome jetlag when in London. However due to this I was always trying to sleep as the entertainment system kept malfunctioning and as a result had a lousy stay in London for the 1st 2 days. The food too was not what it was and was mediocre. However ignoring the reply I got regarding the entertainment system the service was very good. The aircraft's need to be changed as they are old and this was the case on my return flight as well. All in all I see a deterioration in the quality that was offered by Sri Lankan and gives me the indication that I need to look at other options. Another issue is the price of the tickets fluctuate greatly which is not the case with other better known airlines.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Our flight from Heathrow to Colombo was without doubt the worst flight experience I have had. I don't sleep on long haul flights so distractions and entertainment are absolutely essential for me. It soon became apparent that there was a problem with our system in our window side seats with the entertainment system we alerted a cabin crew member who said they would reset the system no follow up communication was received and the system still did not work and after food had been served staff were not very visible and as the flight deck also operates the call button this was not an option either as it was not working. Eventually a second flight attendant was alerted and again we were told that it would be reset again nothing was done. A third member of staff was told of this and yet again nothing was said or explained to us. 9 hours had passed during this time and I was going stir crazy no sleep and not even able to read as the controls also operate the reading light. Eventually it was time for our second meal and we made one last attempt to resolve the problem and this time the staff member had the guts to admit that it was not working and would not do so for the flight and that several other people were affected as well. 11 hour flight with no entertainment whatsoever no way to read or call a flight attendant they were rarely present between meals and the only way to get there attention was hope someone else used the call button. No offer of refreshments between meals and fairly surly staff this is not acceptable treatment for human beings trapped in a metal tube for such long periods of time and should be taken very seriously by the Airline. I was praying that it would be over and have never been so relieved or eager to leave an Aircraft. In defence all of our short flights were fine and the return flight from Colombo to Heathrow was such a staggering opposite to the original that I find it hard to believe that they are the same airline unfortunately the first experience was too terrible.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We travelled from Singapore to Colombo and then onto London. The shorter flights were older planes but still comfortable. The long flights both ways had lie flat seats and we all slept for about 5 hours perfectly comfortable. One of the planes had on demand TV the other you had to wait for movies to start but it was fine. Where they really excelled was their food and service the food was very good and served very nicely and they also changed the choices around for my daughter. They put us up in a hotel on our return transit through Colombo so it was very easy. Much better than Qantas business class and for about a third of the price on our dates.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew LHR-CMB. A330-200. I was apprehensive about my trip after reading reviews on this airline. I needn't have worried. Check in at LHR was very efficient the only time I have ever been able to have a joke and laugh with the staff at check in. Boarding was slightly late but flight still left exactly on time. Being over 6" I had an aisle seat a lot of legroom for an economy seat! Encountered turbulence over the Channel staff were very good at dealing with passengers that clearly did not understand what the Seatbelt Sign meant. Amazing food followed by a very comfortable sleep the cabin heat was turned up to make it very cosy for a night flight. IFE is very dated but you can live with it Sri Lankan are supposedly updating during next year. Landing was an hour early and baggage was ready for collection very promptly. A very pleasant experience and looking forward to the return!

Flew BOM-PVG and PEK-BOM with a stopover in Colombo. We were very pleased with the level of service with SriLankan. All flights were on time and the aircraft were okay. Seats were pretty comfortable. Meals were adequate although some combinations of food were a little odd. Inflight entertainment was joke with very poor sound and picture quality. The toilets on the plane were regularly cleaned and the attendants made sure that they were well stocked. Would I fly with this airline again yes especially for the price I paid. FA's were very attentive and friendly.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew from Bangalore to Bangkok via Colombo and Back. On the Bangalore-Colombo-Bangalore sector food was pathetic portions very small and no drinks served. Sad considering it is an international sector too. From Colombo- Bangkok-Colombo food was good aircraft old and only wine and beer were served - no other alcohol. Flights were on time and their 30Kgs baggage allowance is a bonus. Considering I am over 6' tall I found the seats comfortable and legroom good. Not a bad airline considering I found the food better than Emirates. Only complaint I had was that the gates on the ground floor lacked air-conditioning seating capacity and was stuffy and sweaty.

Pittsburgh-Toronto-Ottawa-Frankfurt-Colombo-Heathrow-Toronto. Also included as part of our itinerary was Colombo- Trichy-Colombo. The SriLankan code share flights A340/A330 were old. The A320s used for short hauls are not that bad. The hospitality used to be very good few years back but now standards have dropped quite badly. The most annoying thing was that I pre-booked for AVML throughout my entire journey but it came with an absolute shocker in two separate instances. I was offered beef salad along with AVML main course on my way to Colombo. The cabin crew were rude in their behaviour. On my return the same thing happened chicken or fish salad was served along with AVML. Despite those incidents the AVML tasted good. I hope the airlines would take better measures and educate cabin crew on respecting the beliefs of its customers or at least keep them informed of what's being offered them.

On my return leg my opinion has completely changed. LHR-CMB-SIN. I will never fly them again customer service is the worst I have come across. I am yet to see a lie flat bed delays mean that I am out of pocket the lounge simply does not rate. My care factor of this airline is the same as the care factor shown to passengers - absolute zero. I get better service from no frill airlines!

LHR-CMB-MLE-CMB-LHR. Very old and dated aircraft entertainment old style loop system. My remote control was broken so couldn't play any games notified crew who didn't care didn't even write down/look at seat number. Terrible service both ways. Outbound - the cabin wasn't even a quarter full yet still had our meals thrown at us and not even offered anything to drink just given a very small glass of water. Crew seemed more concerned with getting to crew rest (curtained off passenger seats at the back). Inbound - even worse service than outbound! Asked for a veg meal was told there wasn't any yet the crew member on the other aisle was handing out plenty of veg meals. Basically there wasn't a veg meal available for me! Were not given bread like everyone else had to ask for it. During drinks service asked for a sprite was given a glass decanted from a standard sized can. Other passengers around us were bring given the whole can. Safety onboard is almost as bad as the customer service. Seatbelt sign went on numerous times for turbulence and numerous times this was completely ignored by most passengers. Crew didn't say anything and were not enforcing it. Completely undermines the pilots why bother putting it on in the first place! Also flight from MLE-CMB there was no cabin crew sat at either of the third set of exit doors!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
SIN-CMB-LHR August 2013. Hadn't used Sri Lankan before and chose on the basis of value for the one-way flight. SIN-CMB was a recent A320 with AVOD. Only complaint was lack of footrest and limited seat recline but this wasn't a major discomfort on a 3.5 hour daylight flight. Good service standard and choice of menu items. Punctuality was good and PA announcements clear and appropriate. Pity about the remote parking at Colombo but an airport limitation rather than airline. CMB-LHR in an A330 with fully horizontal recline and AVOD (with flight progress disabled for some reason). Again excellent service catering and punctuality. SIN Lounge was fine and the alternative at CMB adequate while the regular airline lounge is being renovated. Complimentary limo transfer at Heathrow worked well despite slow luggage delivery - not sure whether airport or airline at fault here.

Flew CMB-DXB recently on board the A320 (4R-ABK) although there wasn't any personnel TV's I must say that SriLankan's software seems to be the best. Boarding at CMB was highly organised followed by a warm welcome on board and must say that all crew were highly friendly and efficient. Flight was on time. Food quality was in fact of superior standard the crew kept me well fed on board right throughout the flight. Plus kids were given free complimentary goodies. Choice of drinks were good too. I would highly recommend this airline to anybody who needs comfort quality in flight service and all for good value for money.

Flew Business Class from Singapore to Colombo then Colombo to Frankfurt and return. Top service excellent food friendly courteous staff and great seat fully flat leather seats on the A330 and big leather recliner seats on the A320. The best part was the price 50 percent cheaper then other business class fares for the same distance. Will use them again.

Flight from Frankfurt to Colombo was on time comfortable and the service good. Flight back from Colombo to London was delayed but arrangements had been made to rush those of us who had connecting flights to Canada through Heathrow so that we were able to make our connections. The in cabin service was excellent and the entertainment service on the flight back was much better than on the flight to Colombo.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
PEK to BKK. Great crew with excellent service. Loved everything about the flight and extras apart from one thing. The seat. It was a new style one they have and was without doubt the worst seat I have ever sat on in my 40 years of extensive a air travel. Two questions spring to mind. Who on earth got away with designing it and who inside UL actually sanctioned its purchase.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
London to Colombo return. Check in at LHR very efficient however check in at Colombo was very slow. On board the service on both flights was very good the crew was ever present and professional with plenty of refreshments served throughout the flight. Food was of very good quality and snacks were available mid flight. Outbound the seats were spacious and there was plenty of legroom slightly less legroom on the older aircraft on return. Planes and toilets were clean. I cannot comment on the inflight entertainment as did not use. Overall a very good service. Would fly with Sri Lankan Airlines again.

LHR-CMB-LHR. Very poor service and found they are 19 year old planes. Interior was quite filthy. Could not find staff in middle of the journey while looking to get some water as they gone to sleep on the back seats. With high price paid for direct flight there is no value at all. What is the real point of travelling at a high price for the poorest service.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
AUH-CMB-BKK-CAN-PVG-BKK-CMB-AUH. Overall a great experience. Had the new lie flat seats on all but the first and the last leg. I would have give full marks but the C class seats on their A320 or unacceptable for a 5h flight. Service in general very good with the usual hearty SriLankan catering. Choice of wines has improved. All flights on time with most even arriving ahead of time. Generally speaking their business class product has improved significantly. Unfortunately this cannot be said about the ground service in Colombo. The meet and greet service for pax with a long overnight transit has been scrapped. Overall a good experience with some rough edges.

UL423/422 HKG-BKK return: This is one of my preferred airlines choice on business class flying this short route as their prices are often very competitive (between 350 USD to 500 USD) over 9 other airlines who are serving the same route but a much more inflated price. Srilankan airlines gives you 40kg luggage allowance and lounge access it doesn't get any better. Service is always attentive and smiles all the way food is very delicious and nicely presented which is one of their strong points. This route often use the flatbed which offers so much more luxury and comfort. Great leg room storage space large AVOD screen etc. Entertainment system is okay not the top of the top but passable. Duty free shopping is great often they have incredible promotions. Only one gripe is their chaotic boarding process in BKK business class passengers weren't given any priorities which to me was very disappointing. Other than that it remains one of my most favorite airlines. If the air fare is cheap (check their website) try it by all means you will be pleasantly surprised.

3 Star airline and that is what you get. SIN-CMB-LHR 20/7/13. Staff were very friendly food was ok seat I had was the old cradle style still waiting for the lie flat bed on time on each flight IFE was not good. I will say that it was excellent value for money. There are improvements SL Air can make but overall good flight for a 3 star airline.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
BKK-CMB-FRA return in business class. On all flights except the CMB-FRA sector we had their new lie flat business class seats. It was quite upsetting that this configuration was not available on the long CMB-FRA flight moreover as this was a red-eye flight. Check-in in BKK quick and efficient given priority passes for security and immigration. Lounge in BKK is Air France - quite sterile and no real food. Service on board was excellent delicious meal served. IN CMB boarded from the bus gate air conditioning not working and business class boarded last - weird! Luggage in FRA came out last despite being tagged priority. On the return flight quick check-in at FRA. UL is using the JAL lounge - quite poor choice of food available. Great dinner on board but not sure why they serve a 2nd dinner just before a 5am arrival in CMB. Serendib lounge in CMB closed due to renovation used another old fashioned lounge but was quite ok. Flight to BKK left 30 mins late. Delicious breakfast served on board. Entertainment on all flights quite a joke. Choice extremely limited and the AVOD system in business class is almost impossible to navigate. Luggage in BKK came out first. UL business class product clearly has some shortcomings but given that the ticket is only nominally more expensive than an economy class ticket on some other airlines it is still a good choice and value for money.

Rome to Bangkok via Colombo July 13th. Business class. Check in was quick and easy. Given a priority pass for security but everyone has to face the same endless queues for immigration. Had asked about a wheelchair for my elderly partner. We had booked the service for disabled passengers at Rome airport but it is quite understaffed so we chose not to worry about it. On arrival only 2 wheelchairs for the morning rush time so waits can be quite lengthy. Business lounge is a quiet refuge. Nothing special to eat but plenty to drink and of good quality. Onboard staff caring and will go to a lot of trouble to keep the business class passengers happy and comfortable. Considering what we paid for the return business class flight from Bangkok to Rome return we consider we received excellent value for money. On each flight we had reclining armchair type seats. They fold out almost flat and have plenty of personal space. One toilet in business class for 8 passengers. Colombo stop was only a couple of hours. From Colombo to Bangkok we were served a wonderful breakfast. There are movies shown on-board but to tell you the truth better to spend time enjoying the inflight service rather than worrying about the movies! On arrival at Bangkok we were given priority passes for immigration and a wheelchair was waiting for my partner.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
BKK-PEK it is surprising how many routes into China this airline operate - to Hong Kong Beijing and even Guangzhou. The flights to Beijing don't operate every day nor at the same time on the days they do fly but I was able to squeeze them into my routing by using their very early Fri morning departure and an excellent one-way fare in business class that was about the same as the competition - Thai and Air China - were charging in economy. There was no wait at check-in but some delay as the staff were unaware that China has dropped visa requirements for many nationals who are spending less than 72h in China. After this frustrating delay I was able to proceed through fast track security and into the shared lounge. The hors d'oeuvres were appalling possibly toxic but drinks were available and there was a partial view of the airfield. Boarding was an hour late due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Colombo. Once onboard the four-engined Airbus A340 cabin crew incredibly kind and charming. The seat was an old fashioned cradle recliner extremely comfortable and massive seat pitch. Only two other passengers both of whom were rude to the doting crew. Perhaps there is something unique about Sri Lankan passengers that requires the laminated card in seat pockets regarding zero tolerance for disruptive passengers something I've never seen before? I had a look in economy which was a bit shabby but still looked comfortable. I opted for the Sri Lankan meal option the main course a curried mixed grill absolutely gorgeous. The Ceylon tea service that followed was the best tea I've had. Finally enjoyed an hour's sleep before landing and a kind farewell from one of the nicest crew I've flown with. Despite the lack of alliance mileage on offer I will fly this airline again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew as part of Code share flight from BLR to SHJ via CMB. Srilankan flight was from BLR-CMB. Mihin Lanka flight was from CMB-SHJ. Aircraft was an Airbus A320. The airfares are low (sometimes). They serve free food. Some in flight entertainment. Planes are clean and comfortable take off and landing very smooth Staff very friendly. However the flight was unduly delayed by half an hour. They don't provide any headphones or anything to use the IFE if it is a short haul flight. They provide free accommodation for long connection flights only if some of their criteria of booking are met which includes a high base fare and connection of over 8 hrs. For connection flights that don't meet their criteria they'll at best give you free transport to and from the airport to the hotel. I shall definitely fly Srilankan again.

Flew Colombo to Bangkok. Excellent service at check-in quickly through immigration. Flight slightly delayed. A really old A330 but SriLankan's online check-in lets you choose any seat including emergency exit seats as well. Choose 10 AB. They used to be designated Premium Economy seats so had a lot of legroom. Cabin crew excellent but let down by old hardware.

UL319 on 3 July 2013 KUL-CMB and UL318 9 July CMB-KUL. Outbound was a morning flight which was pleasant. The seats were reasonably comfortable service adequate but the meals were inedible. Departure and arrival was on time and cabin service was polite and friendly. Return flight was a night flight which left CMB at 12.55am. It was odd that we were served a meal after take off considering it was 1am in the morning. It would have been better to have switched off the lights and let all the passengers get some sleep and serve a light breakfast before landing. Crew was perfunctory and little else. Again the dinner served was inedible and IFE was limited in selection but it was only a 3.5 hour flight. Adequate all around.

Frankfurt to Colombo. Aircraft cramped and seats had very little space. I felt almost trapped in my seat being in the window. Flight was fully booked. Service was decent but no space to walk about. Toilets were half the size of other long haul flights that I have taken. I haven't flown SriLankan in a while but will definitely think twice before booking.

KUL-CMB-CDG and return. Truly a joyful experience to fly Sri Lankan. The service is excellent cabin crew very caring and regularly checked on your comfort and requirements. The A330-200 between Colombo and Paris has the lie- flat seats and it certainly makes the flight most restful.

Flew BKK-CMD-FCO-CMD-BKK business class all legs apart from CMD-FCO where I was downgraded to economy. Flight was 5 hours late causing missed flights onward. One plane had updated cabin on BKK-CMD leg. Other 3 legs were in old aircraft with ashtrays and aged fittings. Crew were good food fine and toilets clean. Silk route at CMD is terrific. I contacted the airline prior to booking and it was strongly inferred the long leg flights would have refurbished cabins. You get what you pay for I suppose.

Business class seats return flight from Bangkok to Rome via Colombo. Seats a thousand dollars lower than the nearest competitor out of Bangkok. My partner is elderly so I organised a wheelchair for Bangkok airport. That was a big help as the airport is huge. That evening the boarding gate was 1.5 km from the business lounge. Business lounge was fine plenty to drink and eat. Flight to Colombo was 3.5 hours and that passed quickly as we were served a full dinner that was excellent. There was no time really to notice the audio-visual. The seats reclined to become a very comfortable armchair. At Colombo we were taken to the Business class lounge. There was plenty to eat and drink. Escorted to the plane. On-board again it is reclining lounge chair type with footrest. Dinner was served. There were some movies but it was late at night so we slept instead. Breakfast was the best airline one we've had! Again served course by course and more if you want it. There were some movies available if you wanted. In Rome the dream comes to an end but that's Rome airport for you!

Staff are incompetent and Business class seats are the industries worst. The entertainment system was not working on a 10 hour flight to FRA from CMB. Asked the pilot to confirm in to which terminal Delta flies in to. Point blank said I can't. Despite asking them to make sure that to check my bag through to JFK this did not happen. If they said they couldn't would have taken it on board.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-BKK outbound in economy on a refurbished A330. Interior in good condition seats new and relatively comfortable. Legroom ok boarding a bit of a joke - with a mass surge towards the walkway when boarding was announced. IFE poor but staff were friendly and attentive - responding to requests. This was a morning flight and served breakfast - western and Sri Lankan option the former which was good. Return on Business. Lounge at BKK was decent - with plentiful options of canapés and drinks. Located close to the gates that UL use. Equipment was an A330 with the new business class seat. Staff friendly and attentive. Food great - with plentiful options alcohol free-flowing. Seat comfort was good though the motors are quite noisy when adjusting the seat. IFE system was good - the joystick control to navigate screen needs to be more sensitive. Lack of noise-cancelling headphones a significant drawback - would expect this for Business class. Luggage out quickly at CMB. A pleasant 3.5hr flight with SriLankan good value-for-money and would definitely use again for short haul trips.

Colombo-Mumbai round-trip in economy. Both flights on time with excellent catering. Warm meal served with wine which is impressive on this short 2-hour sector. A320 was new and clean however lacked any form of in-flight entertainment - not even a moving map on a bulkhead screen.

Paris-Colombo and Colombo-Rome in Economy. Both flights on time and crew very attentive especially on the Paris flight where I was addressed by name and made to feel welcome. Catering was good on both flights but I don't understand why the second meal on the CDG-CMB flight is served 3 hours prior to landing in Colombo when a couple of additional hours of sleep would be welcome. Both aircraft (A330 and A340) clean and well kept but seat back TVs small and dim and in desperate need of an upgrade to AVOD. New" interior on A330 disappointing - ugly carpet and seat covers the colour of mud. Check in Colombo totally chaotic and disorganized I had to wait in line for over an hour despite having checked in online! Fortunately the warmth of the on-board service makes up for the shambles at Colombo airport and the outdated in-flight entertainment.

HKG-CMB-BKK-HKG. Using a combination of new biz class flat bed except one sector from CMB to BKK with their old recliner seat. Flatbed is spacious lots of storage space and comfortable for sleeping also has massage function. Recliner was ok too for short flight less than 5 hours. Service and food were outstanding on all sectors. In fact I had some of the best food in the sky with them also plenty to eat and choose from alcohol was free flowing and top up frequently. If you can find a good fare they are very worth considering. Boarding in HKG and BKK orderly only when in CMB was a bit chaotic but still tolerable. A note about the Serendib lounge in Colombo airport. Because UL is joining One World in next year the lounge is undergoing renovations they now temporarily uses the lobby of Serendiva transit hotel. It's dark and no windows a bit sad but the food is still good. The new lounge will open again in a few months.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Booked flights from Bangkok to Male via Colombo - as direct flights on our honeymoon. Not only did they change the departure time 3 times from 10am to 8am to 6am but the direct flight Bangkok to Colombo was changed on the date of travel to be non-direct through heir new airport Hambantota with no communication to passengers - whatsoever - with the entire flight getting up to depart and having to be told that it had now stopped. It therefore left us with 6 hours to pass in Colombo because of the earlier departure time (from 10am to 6am) and staff were rude! We did not get what we paid for - the later flight departure which was meant to be a direct flight! We will not fly SriLankan Airlines again.

Recently flew on 2 occasions. First on UL 0554 from FRA to CMB on April 24th and then on UL 0553 from CMB to FRA on May 5th 2013. On both flights the in-flight service was excellent with the flight crew making every effort to make the flight a very pleasant experience as possible. The meals served on both flights were of a very high standard specially in comparison to the meals served on board North American carriers. As a Sri Lankan residing overseas it made a proud of the level of service offered on our nation's national airline.

Dubai-Colombo Business Class. Flew A330 and was lucky to fly the new equipment of SriLankan Airlines Business class. Check-in was smooth and fast with the express counter for J class passengers in Terminal 1 in DXB Airport. Pre-departure lounge was decent with comfortable rest chairs and a good variety buffet and drinks. The flight was 30 minutes delayed. Was welcomed onboard by a very friendly crew with a smile and was served drinks before takeoff. The seats were very comfortable i must say. Full flat bed reclinable chair with a wide Entertainment system and a inbuilt massager in the chair. Was very impressed with the quality of the New business class format of the airline. The Crew onboard was very helpful and indeed very friendly. The food was warm and delicious and had a good selection on the menu presented. Will definitely fly SriLankan again.

Flew LHR to Colombo on 27th April. Everything OK not outstanding. Returned to UK on 11th May. Problem started at check-in we had booked our seats weeks before the flight at check-in they tried to bump us to a flight to Frankfurt then LHR with no explanation. We refused. They then changed our already booked seats from row 30 to row 50. Not good but got worse at the gate they changed our seats again to row 62 with no explanation. When we got to our seats they were at the very back of the plane with restricted room for the window seat. I couldn't put my tray full down as there was not room. The IFE did not work at all. The seats are rock hard and really shabby. It was a very unpleasant experience and we will not be recommending anyone to use this carrier.

LHR-CMB-LHR A330-200. Fast check in at both ends and efficient boarding. A warm and smiling greeting at aircraft door by crew and overall fantastic crew on both flights where calls bells answered with a smile and drinks plenty. Food was not to my taste on outbound but best ever on my return. Only down side is the inflight entertainment that needs up-grading and the airbus aircraft that have a cramped feeling. That said a very good product for this route.

KL to Colombo and return as part of a round trip from Saigon. Equipment was new and clean and the on board staff professional skilled and charming. Absolutely nothing to complain about except the parents of an unruly obnoxious child on the KL to Colombo leg who threw a 2 hour temper tantrum and seemed to feel their malevolent offspring's behavior was somehow acceptable in public. As the parents were unwilling to the FA's and several passengers attempted to intervene. When I spoke to the purser about a seat change she instead invited me into the galley for coffee and desert. Will definitely fly Sri Lankan again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
London-Colombo return. Main dissatisfaction was that after making very specific enquiries about weight and dimensions of cabin baggage we scrupulously limited ourselves to 7kg only to see people carrying large cumbersome and clearly heavy cases onto the aircraft. If they make rules they should enforce them and not rely on Brits to do all the compliance! On three out of four meal services the options shown on the menu card we had been ceremoniously presented with had run out. On one occasion a cabin stewardess made a special effort to try to provide something better than the default. Ordering a drink that came out of a can (eg beer) you did not get the can - just a glass! The safety demonstration was very poor. I was twenty rows back from the cabin crew and they simply seemed to wave their arms around to demonstrate the emergency exits. Terrible lack of rigour. Ironic that we had to make a safety stop at Frankfurt on return to London and the cabin crew we called upon to demonstrate emergency procedures again just before we landed. That said the flight was reasonably comfortable and passenger handling otherwise to an acceptable standard. My main yardstick is BA who would win hands down.

CMB-FRA UL553 21 April Business Class. Smooth Check-in at Silk Line Route Departure Area especially for Business Class Passengers. Comfortable Serendib Lounge with a lot of hot food and many alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage offerings. Bus Gate with late Boarding for Business Passengers. Onboard: the new Flat Bed was announced it was an Old Style Business Class maybe ex BMI Aircraft with roomy comfortable Business Seats but with a dirty old look. Terrible non AVOD TV and Audio Program and not the promised full flat seat. Very good first class style dinner and breakfast. 4 flight attendants have to serve a maximum of 18 seats but no one knows what the other one is doing. They walk back to the galley for every single plate and glass which is very confusing for them and the passengers. Anyway very friendly crew and excellent meals served. 30 minutes late departure in Colombo 20 minutes late arrival in Frankfurt. Good Value for Money and if they offer the new Flat Bed soon I will fly again with them.

BKK to CMB 18 April UL887. Lounge in BKK is the Air France Sky Lounge which is big but very basic and with limited Food and Beverage Service. Low quality Wines and no Champagne served (in an Air France Lounge ). Very good organized boarding with separate doors for Economy and Business Class. Old style Business Class seat in an A340. Good enough for a 3 hours but very bad if a long distance flight. Very limited video program audio did not work at all. Good dinner but kind of rushed service by very friendly crew. On Time arrival in Colombo. For the same low price I would not mind flying again with UL.

We flew London to Colombo. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable there were children yelling and running up and down the aisle for a good portion of the flight (flight crew allowed this to go on without talking to the children or their parents).

Bangkok to Frankfurt business class April 9 2013. Flight departing from Bangkok UL887 was on a A330-200 4R-ALH which now has the new business class seats (lie-flat). I transited at Colombo in their lounge for flight UL 553 with a A330-200 4R-ALA just equipped with new business class seats. It was a great product but flight delayed 30 minutes. Service was great and food was good but entertainment was limited to a few movies. On my return trip UL 554 with the same aircraft as my flight to Frankfurt and new business class seats there was a little problem with the air conditioner so I couldn't sleep so well. Flight arrived one hour early and left early so I had 3 hours to transit at Colombo for UL 422 to Bangkok. Again delayed almost one hour as the flight arrived late from Dammam. The entertainment functioned well this aircraft was the first introduced with new business class as it was the one only working with safety videos before take off. Flight was fast and arrived late for about 20 minutes than schedule. I give 10 for seats 9 for entertainment.

AUH-Colombo-BKK return in Business Class. Usual good service and food but the worst business class seat in the industry. I made 8 flights on their A330 and A340 in the past year but none of the flights had their upgraded business class seats. I am not sure if they actually upgrading their fleet as indicated on their website. IFE not even worth the effort to switch on. Its not really worth the extra $$$ to fly C class on UL.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Heathrow-Sri Lanka return direct and had both the worst and best business flights I have had thus far. On the outward journey the plane was so old it had ashtrays and awful seats which were definitely not adequate for long-haul by today's standards. On top of which the TV was in the seatback of the seat in front so consequently when they reclined you could not see the screen. My screen only worked on 1 channel so I had 1 film to watch on an 11 hour flight and my husband's TV didn't work at all. On the return journey it could not have been more different. Excellent lie-flat beds great food great amount of channels to watch superb flight! I suggest you ring the airline before hand to check that the aircraft will be a lie-flat before you book!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR to Colombo return. A340 on outward flight - cabin felt cramped compared. Clearly a fairly old aircraft that was showing its age in the cabin and lavatories. No soap in the lavatory and when I asked for some the response was rather surly! Same can be said of the general attitude of the flight attendants on this leg. In general the in-flight service was slow and not particularly friendly. Inflight entertainment is on a loop and several large old style TVs complimented the seat back screens. Return leg on an A330 which felt more spacious although seat pitch was the same I believe. Service a little less surly than the outward leg. Good briefing from Captain - clear and informative which makes a change. New choice of movies from outward flight - very limited selection though and nothing that appealed to me but this is of course a highly subjective area. Tried to buy duty free - again it was possible but I the surly attitude prevailed and I was treated very much as if I was making an out of the ordinary request! Overall surly cabin crew on both legs and flights were OK but nothing really stands out - a little bit of effort from the cabin crew and some updating of the aircraft and they would be in a much better position.

AUH-CMB on a reward ticket and was impressed with the service. Dedicated generic fast track check in and security area in Abu Dhabi worked very well and check in to lounge took less than 5 minutes. A320 is just over a year old unfortunately the interior is already showing its age. The leather on the seats was dirty and I used my hot towel to clean grime off the arms of the seat. Friendly welcome by crew and great service with drinks being filled up regularly. This A320 flight leaves AUH at 2230 and therefore most people want to sleep. Dinner service a little slow and when the main courses did come mine was stone cold. Unfortunately my first choice wasn't available the passenger across the aisle got the last one. Dedicated J class bus in Colombo to main terminal. Return journey J class passengers can avail of the silk route lounge where you are checked in by an agent while seated brought through a dedicated security kiosk in the lounge and escorted to the Serendib lounge airside. Service on the return was friendly the dinner was delicious. UL are not a premier carrier but do an excellent service at a much cheaper rate would most definitely be happy to recommend them and fly with them again.

Return flight FRA-CMB-BKK-CMB-FRA in Business. Booking process very smooth online was looking forward to their new business class at least on part of flights but all 4 flights were in the old business class. Nevertheless it was a surprisingly good experience. Priority check-in/priority lane on security check and boarding worked well on all 4 flights warm greeting from crew all flights were on schedule. In FRA they use the One World lounge in Terminal 2 ok but nothing special. Serendib lounge in CMB is easy to find (small airport) and only a few steps from/to the gate what is very convenient compared to some other airports. Not the newest but excellent food service drink selection and Internet access working well. Lounge in BKK on flight back was ok but again nothing special. Flight experience basically the same on all 4 flights older business seats that do not recline flat but are still very comfortable. Inflight entertainment is outdated. What makes the difference is the friendliness of the cabin crew. Food and drinks were very good as well. The downgrade is due to the old seating and no IFE although that was not bothering my very good experience flying with them but for others it might be an issue. Highly recommended will fly with them again on next occasion.

Heathrow to Colombo (UL504) and return (UL503). Business class on outward leg to take advantage of the flat bed on an overnight flight (7 rows with 2-2-2 configuration i.e. 42 seats all of which were occupied). Tried repeatedly to check in online but got an automated message that this was not possible. BA desk at Manchester confirmed they could not through check pax or luggage. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the baggage collection on arrival from Manchester transfer between terminals and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare taking almost 3 hours. Lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – spacious and relaxing environment. Boarding was a bit chaotic. Families with children called first no preference given to business class. Onboard service and environment was similar to typical business/club class with many other airlines with the exception of the entertainment system (very limited selection not easy to use poor quality sound). Crew very attentive drinks served frequently good choice of western and Sri Lankan meals for dinner and breakfast. Flat bed was very comfortable. Good Bulgari amenity kit. Returned in economy class (2-4-2 configuration). No queue for check in at Colombo and were allocated requested seats. Surprised that we were automatically through checked to Manchester even though we were overnighting at HRW. CMB airport was a reasonable size with a good selection of shops. Airport has a limited number of toilets and these can be very busy at certain times. Clear boarding announcements. Good welcome and attentiveness from crew. No amenity kit despite this being a 12 hour flight. Seat pitch and width is not significantly better or worse than many scheduled economy seats. There was no foot rest. Overall there are issues because the planes are dated but otherwise the cost of business and economy class service represents good value compared with other airlines. Would definitely choose Sri Lankan again for a direct flight.

Flew from Kuwait - Colombo round-trip. Business class cabin very comfortable and seats recline to 180 degrees making it a comfortable fully-flat bed. Cabin crew very attentive and professional. My dinning experience was very good. Would defenitly recommend this airline and can't wait to fly with them again soon.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Paris to Malé via Colombo and had a very mixed experience. We had latest A330 aircraft's on our way to Malé with new seats. These seats are very good plenty of storage space fully flat and very comfortable. Only one minus - remote control did not work so I had to touch the screen to navigate through entertainment system. Very good meals (especially Sri Lankan options) and very pleasant service. On the way back to Paris got older A330 with old seats which is different story. Difficult to find really comfortable position to sleep which is important on an 11-hours night flight. Main remark on both long-haul legs is the fact that they serve breakfast very early almost two hours before landing around 3.30am. So if you want to sleep - let attendants know! Sindbad lounge in Colombo is medium size but toilets are very small and busy. All in all - not so bad (except old seats on way to Paris) especially known the price which is as twice as cheap compared to Etihad or Emirates.

I had the connection from Heathrow to Colombo which is remarkable very good comparing other US airlines. Because I was travelling from Columbia SC through Washington DC to London UK. The service hospitality and the flight environment was very nice. Food was excellent! I paid more because of the day - Dec 23rd but my score was not for the money but for the service.

PVG-BKK A340-300. Aircraft was on time totally full in Business but only 18 seats. Very friendly flight attendants. Looking always during flight with a big smile. Food was medium IFE was medium too and still an old seat in the Airbus. Flight was 5 hours so really not comfortable - but for the price and time of this flight a good offer. Will fly again next time.

16/01/2013 London-Colombo-Chennai A330/A340. Well maintained aircraft's best inflight meals crew very attentive and friendly water and drinks served frequently between London-Colombo. Very short connection of 45 minutes at Colombo and arrived at Chennai in under 13 hours with one stop over. Inflight entertainment good considering a night flight. On time performance for London-Colombo-Chennai. 22/01/2013 Chennai- Colombo-London A330 on both legs. Same flight used on both legs short connection of 1hr at Colombo - very attentive and friendly cabin crews on both legs. Good inflight meals water and drinks served frequently during the long flight between Colombo-London. On time performance for both Chennai-Colombo-London.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-MLE and CMB-SIN on A330 in what seemed like a 'short haul' business class cabin. The seats were wider reclined and were fairly comfortable although nothing like the comfort of the lie flat seats on the DXB to CMB leg of our journey (highly recommended). Meals were quite tasty and service was quite good but the IFE really let the experience down with very limited selections. In addition my touchscreen kept freezing but there was nothing they could do as the cabin was full. Fortunately the problem fixed itself after a while. The dedicated check in and immigration area for J class was a nice touch and we found the Serendib lounge to be spacious and comfortable.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Direct flights from London and Frankfurt are convenient. But I was very disappointed to see that the maintenance of the cabins are not up to date. My fellow traveller had to sit on a seat in which the springs were coming off. The flight was full but if Sri Lanka wants tourists they have to cater to the comfort of the passengers. One of the bathrooms smelt before takeoff from London and same from Colombo. I have commented that I do not recommend but if measures are taken to improve the comfort in the cabins specially in long distance flights I would definitely recommend it.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Return Heathrow Colombo. The planes are very shabby seats dirty and old. The IFE was broken on both legs on my wife's seat when mine worked it kept cutting out and losing the sound the standard of films was terrible 4 very low budget films. Staff really didn't seem interested in their jobs not friendly did the bare minimum. Food just about acceptable better than a 12 hour fast. Booked with them as it was the only direct flight I could find and so thought this would be a better experience than having to take a connecting flight I was wrong.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB-LHR. Outbound check in smooth flight delayed 5 hours onboard dated and IFE was faulty to point of annoying and not using. Return leg arrived at airport at 10pm to find flight delayed 6 hours check in bordering a comedy sketch. In flight slightly better than first leg. When going on a 11 hour flight last thing you need is to get to airport both time for lengthy delays. Loved our holiday in Sri Lanka but shall return with a different airline.

Return between CDG (Paris) and Colombo on 14 December 2012 and 30 December 2012. Check-in in Paris was easy and smooth although the lounge was small we still were served champagne! Onboard - smiles from the cabin staff who were excellent and could not do enough for us although my inflight entertainment did not work. This was not a problem as I used my IPad. Return flight to CDG was on a more modern plane and again the staff were brilliant! Food cannot be faulted and the inflight screens were large and easy to use. Would recommend this airline!

30 Dec MAA-CMB-LHR. A330 on MAA-CMB and A340 on CMB-LHR- both flights comfortable. Christmas decorations in-flight was nice. Food tasty and plentiful. IFE needs upgrading on older 340s. FA's were courteous and smiling. Collection of food trays delayed before landing at LHR. Landing cards were not supplied earlier flights they were supplied. Would have saved me time in immigration queue at LHR. Otherwise a nice flight and I am flying again in 2 weeks time with SriLankan.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB. Check in smooth and flight on time. The plane looked old and dirty and in need of an upgrade the seat's fabric torn and an old entertainment system. Food was great some of the best I have tasted on a plane! Restricted choice of IFE and what was on the magazine wasn't available to watch and sometimes the screen would randomly shut down and turn on disrupting what I was watching. Staff were OK but seemed to be tired with their job. Regret paying that much money for a disappointing flight.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
FCO-CMB and CMB-FCO. I didn't understand why in the middle of night flight I was awakened (like all other passengers) to eat the second meal 3 hours and 45 minutes before landing while all the passenger resting and sleeping. After that they started selling duty-free items and only 1 hour and 45 minutes before landing they switched off the lights.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew London-Colombo-Kochi. Check-in was straightforward staff were ok onboard not great but certainly much more courteous than other carriers! Unfortunately the flight was a let down. The plane really needs updating. The overhead CRT screen rattled above us for the whole 10 hour flight. The entertainment system was archaic. The headphone jack for the entertainment system doesn't allow you to use your own headphones the audio didn't work anyway so no entertainment on a 10 hour flight. The food was ok. They didn't have landing cards - luckily I was in transit. But the deal breaker for me is the reliability of this airline granted my flight was only an hour late but my wife's flight is 5 hours late today. This is my first flight with Sri Lankan airlines but I will in future try to avoid it.

KUL-CMB-DOH and back. I was impressed with the service upgraded A340s KUL-CMB really good. A330 from CMB-DOH and back not as good but compensated by onboard service. A330 needs a real upgrade. Meals a touch disappointing in the CMB-DOH leg of the flight. Price is extremely cheap compared with direct flights from KLIA.

Very good even for a short haul flight. Flew BLR-SHJ via CMB. Sri Lankan flight was only from BLR to CMB. CMB to SHJ was a codeshare flight on Mihin Lanka. Airbus A320 which was not very spacious but comfortable. Food provided the take off and landing very smooth. Staff are friendly seats comfortable and standard. No headphones given for using the inflight entertainment on short haul flights A320 airbus is not roomy.

Flew LHR-CMB-BKK with Sri Lankan. Food served is western or Sri Lankan. I opted for the Sri Lankan dish (lamb curry with rice and dahl) best food I've had on an economy flight - and metal cutlery. Finally an airline prepared to treat me like an adult. Great service.

31 Oct Dep LHR - 1 Nov Arr MAA via CMB. Both legs A330 - decent seat pitch with foot rest. Good food and plenty of drinks. Good attention by cabin crew considering me and my wife travelling with twin infants. On time departure from LHR and connection to MAA from CMB on time. Entertainment needs overhauling but not an issue considering night flight and travelling with infants. Otherwise both legs were enjoyable. Excellent landings in thunder storms at CMB/MAA. Will fly Sri Lankan again.

KUL-CMB-CDG and return. Excellent service all the way from the ground staff to the most hospitable cabin crew I have ever come across. Serendib Lounge in Colombo is great place to unwind. Meals onboard were sumptuous beyond expectation - especially the spicy Sri Lankan option. Cabin crew are very caring and regularly checks on your comfort and requirements. Flying Sri Lankan is definitely like flying in the 70s. I'm looking forward to flying with them on two more flights to Europe in the next 6 months.

DXB-CMB in the new business class cabin. Really impressed by the seat its a true flatbed and I slept for a good 3 hours. Entertainment options a little limited and there seems to be some teething issues with the controllers for the AVOD system I had to used the touch screen which meant reaching quite far forward. Food was a little disappointing on this journey normally its top notch. Service was great. 10/10 for value for money.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB-LHR 2 Adults 2 Children (Aged 3 and 6 yrs). Boarding at LHR delayed and flight was 1 hour late. Boarded families with small children first. Staff very attentive food excellent with choice of Sri Lankan and Western cuisine including vegetarian option. Impressive leg room although there is an IFE box on all window seats which prevents you from stretching your legs underneath the seat in front. IFE is old fashioned streamed and not on demand and requires updating and increasing in content for such a long flight. Outbound flight arrived early even though it was late leaving. Inbound flight on time take off. Boarded by seat numbers no advance boarding for families with small children. Crew attentive available and on both sectors it should be noted that there were snacks and sandwiches served between meals which was great. Free drinks were plentiful. Arrived almost an hour early at Heathrow but had to queue for landing. Sri Lankan offer the only direct flight from London to Colombo so if travelling with children and do not want to hassle of a stopover then this is your obvious choice even though it is marginally more expensive than alternative carriers via a Middle East stop. Now that the Business Class product has been refurbed it is time to extend it over Economy too.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
HKG - CMB via BKK on UL 423 an A330 small aircraft but installed with their new biz class with flat bed. Service courteous and efficient. Meals are delicious and well presented and in 3 courses ample amount. Frequent presence throughout the flight welcome drinks hot towels and high tea service. There was an hour stop for refill and change of crew in BKK the hour went by quickly. Flat bed was amazingly comfortable. Only setback would be the AVOD system not exactly an easy one to use also with limited choices. However considering their reasonable price I would gladly fly them anytime.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
FRA-CMB. Scheduled is an A330 but the reality is an A340 with the oldest seat in the fleet. Did web check-in so baggage just drop off. Staff efficient and friendly. UL use JAL lounge. Beverage is alright food very mediocre. No priority boarding big pile of pax trying to get first to the airbridge. Gate staff do not bother to let business pax pass around the mass. Nicely welcomed by the purser and a female flight attendant. The seat is an old reclining seat very bad recline; pax in in front of me almost crushed my feet while reclining his seat. I could not get comfortable because of this situation. Toilets are clean throughout out the flight. Food is very simple but the quality especially the main option of curry is great; starter and dessert disappointing. Meals are rather small in size. No noise cancelling headphones. Old and back quality TV monitors. Films and music choices are mediocre. Amenity kits from Aigner only given when requested specifically. Items are okay but no lotion/cream. At some stages during the flight request calls were not answered for a long period of time have to flag one attendant down. The very competitive ticket fare and the nice service attitude of the flight attendants are the only positive factors the rests are huge disappointments. CMB airport is small and easy to use. Serendib lounge is small with former EK chairs etc. Food is plenty and in good quality. Toilets are small in number and can be very busy.

UL2964 from CGK to CMB. I tried repeatedly to check in online for this flight but always encountered a message that the online facility is only available between 2 and 48 hours prior to departure. Strangely I was attempting to check in 16 hours beforehand. Even mailing the supposed "online check-in help desk" was pointless - no reply. When I arrived at CGK I discovered that this flight is operated by Mihin Lanka A320 - quite a step down from UL in terms of standards. There is no IFE on this flight of 4 1/2 hours duration - not even a route map displayed on an overhead screen (although all seat armrests had IFE controls fitted). You cannot lift any armrests so even if you have three seats of a row to yourself there is no way you could lie down across all seats. Catering is basic. A carton of fruit juice or water from the trolley prior to the meal service. The meal tray was about A4 size and was populated by a lone and small aluminium food container with a cardboard lid plus a set of plastic cutlery. Contents: three small morsels of chicken plus rice. Even on my first flight to Sri Lanka on Aeroflot from Karachi in 1980 I was offered more. My attempt to purchase a beer was unsuccessful. Whilst a 330ml can of Heineken (why no Sri Lankan beer) was produced and a price of US$3 charged the crew had absolutely no change for a £5 note. On a positive note the flight was on time. I am at a loss to understand why a full-service carrier like UL operates code-share flights with a LCC.

I travelled out of Kuala Lumpur to London via Colombo on 19th of September. My flight was scheduled to leave KL at 9 am but was pushed to 11.30am when we were loaded on to the flight but did not take off until 2pm. The service on the aircraft whilst on the tarmac was good. We were given meal vouchers for McDonalds in KLIA. The reason for the delay was given as Airspace is closed en-route! As a consequence I missed my connection. However the transfer desk arranged for me to get to Doha and from there to London on a Qatar Airways flight. Instead of arriving on the 19th at 20.05 I arrived in London on the 20th at 7.15 am. Transfer desk service was good but was not offered any meal vouchers whilst in Colombo. The aircraft's are older seats are uncomfortable. Quality of food was comparatively fair. Staff as usual were good. My return journey was fine and no delays.

Flew Business class from CMB - Rome return on 28 August returning 9 Sep. 2 hr delay did not feel it as the lounge was very good check in process in Colombo is fantastic - VIP process for business class. Onward bucket seats return flat seats equally comfortable crew friendly. Menu great except the choice on return breakfast time was food for supper rather than breakfast! Entertainment system did not work. Boarding process in Milan quite chaotic no preference given to business class. Overall this is a business class service which is great value for money.

I used flight UL 503 Colombo to London on 12th September 2012 it was delayed by approximately 90 minutes the service provided by the cabin crew was one of the worst I have experienced I have used this Airline before and it was a much better service. The management should do something about it before it becomes too late as customers may choose one of the other Airlines which fly between London and Colombo.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Both flights outbound and inbound (UAE to Colombo) did not offer any in-flight entertainment for 4.5 hours of flight time. In fact the outbound flight from Colombo did not have TV screens in Economy class at all in business class (where I was sitting) I had screen but it was not working properly. Crew offered me a heavy Portable Media Player! It had maximum of 10 movies to select from and was annoying to keep on my lap.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
DXB-CMB-DXB both legs on an Airbus A340-300. Dubai to Colombo sector on old A340-300 (4R-ADB) and must say that the ground handling agent in Dubai for UL lacks customer service for a flight with 300 plus passengers we were put in a mini gate in Dubai. Boarding was chaotic and since families were asked to board first we literally had to manoeuvre our way into the aerobridge as travelers without families were blocking the entrance and ground staff did not do much to ease the boarding process. Aircraft was worn out and looked tired my IFE did not work for the rest of the 2 hr journey no AVOD at all. Food and beverage took ages to be served and must say that the meal wasn't that tasty. Service on the other hand was alright with the usual smiling presence on-board. As for the CMB-DXB we were on the re-furbished A34-300 with new interiors and AVOD. This time food was good and so was the service. UL crew lived up to the expectations they were friendly and helpful and most importantly responded every request promptly and with a genuine smile. All in all the return leg was highly impressive. Must say that legroom wasn't a problem on both legs of the journey.

Please expect regular flight delays and cancellations. My flight from Sri Lanka to England cancelled on July 22 2012. Horrible flight options were given after keeping passengers at Katunayake airport nearly 9 hours. People were waiting since 3 am. Not even breakfast offered to passengers. I was scheduled to leave on 24th. That flight got cancelled as well. I have taken Gulf and Qatar airlines and they are better.

AUH-CLM-BKK return in C class. Yes its true UL has not the newest fleet not the most advanced seats not the best IFES but they provide what many other carriers lack; service from the heart unpretentious and warm. And their simple but very tasty food is a good break from the usual nonsense of a long list of wines and fancy food which usually does not taste that good after re-heating anyway. I rather have my good old simple curry on UL. Considering their reasonable fares in C class a good alternative to more established carrier.

Shanghai-Colombo-Shanghai. Not bad really. Food was OK although they ran out of options but you have real cutlery. Friendly cabin crew average inflight entertainment. Seats were cramped though.

DXB-CMB-MLE-CMB-DXB. Average food. No IFE on return leg and it was a much older plane. Boarding both times was a fiasco as there was no control. Appeared to be no limits on cabin baggage as many on the outward leg had 4 or 5 bags. Could only do online check in on outward leg not return journey.

I regularly travel transatlantic with Delta also within Europe and USA on whichever carrier serves the route. This trip was overnight LHR to CMB. Sri Lankan knocked spots off everyone a return to what air travel used to be like. Helpfully and attentive flight attendants proper cutlery (not plastic) and wine served from a bottle into a glass rather than from a Tetrapak into a plastic cup (Delta). Airbus not in the first flush of youth but not as tired as some I've flown in. I stupidly left my Kindle on board but I emailed them and they've found it and are holding for me to pick up. Lamb Curry was the best and tastiest airline meal I've had. Recommended.

Colombo - Male - Business Class. Check-in was quick lounge in Colombo was excellent with a great selection of food wines and champagne (at 6am). We were personally escorted through security and to the gate from the lounge once ready for boarding and received a warm welcome onto the aircraft. Service was superb and personal. Food consisted of a filling breakfast (with 3 choices) and more champagne. We were asked to complete a survey and received a $15 duty free voucher as thanks for doing so. All in all superb service.

DOH-CMB-MAA. Departure from Doha delayed 15 minutes it was an A330-200 (4R-ALH). No in-flight entertainment for economy class only business class had a working entertainment system. Food served on time because I was seated in the 7th or 8th row but they took more than 1 hour to collect the plates. Seats were rock hard only leg room was satisfactory landing at CMB was 5 minutes early. CMB-MAA was delayed by almost 70 minutes. Aircraft was an A320 again no in-flight entertainment seats were rock hard. Would not recommend.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
The seats were broken leaving you sitting in the most awkward and uncomfortable position the seats were mismatched in fabric that was well past its sell by date so obviously seats had been poorly replaced. The in flight entertainment didn't work. Consequently it was the longest 10 hours flight of my life. The check in at Heathrow was a nightmare a 'trainee' had to consult his notes after I had asked him why I had only been issued with one boarding pass and I was transiting on to Male. My reserved seat was not available although I had confirmation email.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Have flown the DXB-CMB route twice with them. Had the older BMI flat beds on the outbound sector and inbound had the even older cradle seats. Once the new flat beds are introduced on all flights seating comfort should be great better than Emirates which aren't fully flat. Service and food in business is outstanding. Staff were always pleasant and accommodating. Champagne served is a little poor though. Keep in mind they are switching to A320's on certain days and I wouldn't fly on those given the limited seat comfort.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Seats are fairly comfortable. Not bad though. The food is pretty good too. The staff are incredibly hospitable and kind. They have good service. I also love how they gave you hot towels in economy class! not only that but they had frequent drinks and kept you refreshed. Entertainment was really good to. It had a remote which was good. The cabin was clean and passenger friendly. They did lose my luggage twice however during the transit but the plane experience was overall good.

DXB-CMB-KUL-CMB-DXB. First leg 1.5 hours delayed. We boarded on time but it was delayed 1.5 hours at the airport. We arrived in CMB at almost 7 am thinking that everything would be on time for the second leg to KUL for 8.40 am it was delayed till 10.45 but boarding started by 11.00. Return flight from KUL to CMB was delayed as well. Onboard food serving was done randomly. Not in order. Since it was already delayed we all boarded at the same time and not by zones. Our original seat was not given on our return.

LHR-CMB-LHR. Flight out was one hour late due to slow baggage loading. The cabin crew quickly served a round of drinks an average meal with no drinks and got the cabin in sleep mode. This went on for over 5 hours during with no drink round was made. The outdated entertainment system worked but the screen and controller were in very poor condition. My main complaint is reserved for the quality of the seats I have been so uncomfortable before and had to collect spare cushions to pad out the seat. The return was much a repeat story one client had to request water to take medicine from the same attendant three times. The screen on the entertainment system at my seat did not work and when I reported it the only interest was to note the sound worked. The most efficient part of this organization is its website.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB-LHR in economy. Took advantage of 'Manage my booking' and 'Check in Online' on website which made things easier at the airport. However requested seat on outbound leg was changed without explanation. A330 both ways generally clean and tidy except for dirty marks on and around video screens. Despite being 'new' seats with lumbar support they are rock hard and I squirmed around continuously but never really get comfortable. Range of movies and music was good for economy although not AVOD. IFE system was a bit 'dicky' with handset showing signs of wear and tear on outbound but fine on return. Food drink and general cabin service super which mitigated other shortcomings. I would use this airline again - hope they can do something about the seats!

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Male via Colombo (where we changed plane) to Frankfurt. We had two quite old planes with extremely little legroom. Furthermore the onboard entertainment didn't work at all. On the second flight (CMB-FRA) even the reading lights didn't work. As it was very uncomfortable and we couldn't really sleep we also weren't able to read or watch a movie - 10hrs can be quite long. Also online check-in didn't work it told us our booking can't be found. Compared to any other Asian airlines this was very disappointing and we definitely won't be flying Sri Lankan again.

CMB-BKK-CMB. Extremely uncomfortable seats. They are lumpy and hard. Can barely sleep. Old aircraft. The staff are not that friendly. The food is warm but not excellent. Check-in was slow in Colombo. I'd call it 'cattle class' rather than economy class.

Overall I can recommend and happy with their inflight service.

Only down side on A330-200 is the IFE which remains out of date with no AVOD. Attentive service makes up for what they lack in up to date aircraft. Look forward to return flight.

LHR-CMB. Planes slightly dated and worn and seats could be more comfortable. Good selection of films on the inflight entertainment screens were viewable but the image quality not great (in my seat anyway). On the plus side food was really good and drinks were offered frequently.

LHR to Colombo. Greeted at check in desk 4 hours before departure with request to fly following day as flight overbooked - there were 10 of us on the ticket including 4 young children! Pre-booked seats were in middle of plane. By the time meal service met in the middle there was no food choice. Colombo to Male ok. On return at Male airport we waited 2.5 hrs to get checked in. Took off 1 hour late. Colombo to LHR had to rush between planes. Same problem with no food choice (difficult with children). Drink service - they had run out of Tonic water before serving half the plane and everybody complained how dry the air was.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
My wife and I boarded a plane from Colombo to Tokyo and the service provided by the ticket counter and crew was to say the least very unprofessional. We were made to wait outside the check-in area for an hour. The ticket counter outside the airport gates were unprepared and kept bouncing us from one office to the next. After being told to go inside and check-in; the guard told us we could not go inside until our flight was posted on the monitor. Furthermore once we arrived at the ticket counter to check our bags and receive our seat numbers the gentleman behind the counter seemed to have little knowledge of his duties. Again we inquired about lounges for Platinum American Express members and I was met by a very rude staff member who was loud and belligerent. To add insult to injury one of our bags did not arrive in Tokyo along with the other bags.

BKK-CMB-CDG FCO-CMB-BKK. We paid 2400 EUR for two business class tickets. Surprised by quality of the service. BKK check-in was quick and easy fast track offered. Skyteam lounge in BKK is basic felt cheap and run down. Flight to CMB was ok old cradle seat for 3 hours welcome Champagne cocktail before meal and wine during the meal meal was ok but very friendly staff and attentive service. CMB lounge was better. Flight to CDG was good lie flat seat for 11 hours IFE did not work at all and they did not bother to apologise. Check-in at FCO was quick and easy fast track offered but lounge at FCO was another sad one very limited food. Seat was old cradle seats hoping to have lie flat but no luck. We were the only passengers in biz class there were 4 flight attendants and 2 passengers. Good service but was a bit too much they brought out full tray of cheese and fruits it was very nice. IFE did not work but they offered media player which worked well. Flight to BKK from CMB was ok we got off the plane in BKK they gave us fast track pass so we could avoid BKK immigration mess. They don't have lie flat on all their business class but the friendly staff and attentive service makes up for it.

AUH-CMB-BKK-CMB-AUH. All flights on time. Food was good and service professional and friendly. New A320 to/from AUH with AVOD and a good seat for a 4 hour flight. CMB-BKK-CMB on an older Emirates A340 which was excellent AVOD again. Connection on return was 22 hours so picked up from aircraft door and transferred to a 5* city centre hotel. Breakfast and Lunch provided. Very impressed all round especially for the price paid.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Colombo to Heathrow Business Class. Old cradle style seat disappointing for a 11hr flight with an 0200hrs departure time and thus difficult to sleep. Flight left and arrived on time and service was fine although food rather basic. Price paid was very good and thus cant quibble too much.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
BKK-CMB-FRA. First flight was ok about 1.5 hrs late arrival. The second was 7.5 hrs delayed with no arrangement of rooms some of us slept on the floor! The food coupon was not accepted at the airports only restaurant and neither they nor the airline could take responsibility! No management or service. Ticket was cheap but it made me missed my next connection and it cost me a lot to buy a new one.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
On a recent UL flight the pre-booked meal I ordered online did not materialise. Subsequently I have complained to the airline but all they do is offer an apology. Upon pushing them further they then responded that they had no records to show that the requested meal was not provided. As a frequent traveller on the airline over the years I am disappointed the customer service level has deteriorated. There is usually also too much waiting about for the hotel transfer at CMB airport.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Roundtrip from London to Bangkok via Colombo. Outbound my entertainment system did not work. The cabin crew offered to move me but before doing so they tried the entertainment systems on 3 vacant seats and none had working entertainment. They gave up and apologised offering me a sandwich! On the return flight I was transferring at Colombo expecting a 15hr stopover and to be given a complimentary hotel by the airline. Staff told me I was not "eligible" for a hotel eventually I was put on an earlier flight to London. The return flight was acceptable but seats are extremely small and with little leg room. I requested a glass of water this was acknowledged by staff but it never arrived.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-MLE-COL. Terrible outward flight on a very old A320. Really narrow seats with no leg room as there was a kind of solid metallic box under the seat in front no foot rest upholstery on seats lumpy and uncomfortable. The seat in front of my husband could not be properly adjusted to upright IFE did not work and anyway unwatchable as the picture was awful. To add insult to injury the food was inedible and cold and we were only offered one tiny glass of wine. We often fly Economy and know that one cannot expect too many frills but this gives a whole new meaning to the expression "cattle class". The return flight on 27th Feb in an A340 marginally better in that the seats were no quite so beaten up but all other comments apply.

LHR-CMB return. Flights left and arrived on time. Regular supply of drinks. Seats slightly uncomfortable. Going out my wife's IFE didn't work but our seats were swapped.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB-BKK return. All flights more or less on time. Food good for economy. Transit in CMB outbound straight forward. Off the plane and into a departure gate within 10 mins. Had to hunt for gate on return but no hassle. The home bound leg is tiring as its all night flights. Seats are a bit hard.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Paris-Colombo and Colombo-Rome (via Milan) in Economy. Crew friendly and proactive on the CDG-CMB leg. The small touches - distribution of menus 3 choices for main meals and warmth of the crew - makes UL stand above the rest on a good day. However an A330 which was added to the fleet recently - shockingly tatty on the inside with armrests held together with duct tape. Tiny video screens barely watchable. A340 on the CMB-FCO flight was in better shape despite being one of the older aircraft in the fleet. Seats were rock hard. Crew were somewhat disinterested on this flight. Check-in at CMB was a hassle with long lines at both check-in counters and immigration. Both flights on time and overall good value for money although cabin interiors and entertainment systems badly need to be upgraded.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
I flew DEL-COL and COL-BKK. The aircraft used for DEL-COL leg was smaller but the food (dinner) was quite good with plenty of wines/drinks. Staffs smiley and attentive. From COL-BKK we were given a menu to select breakfast but in the end were brought whatever they had! Personal screen and entertainment was quite good however FA's a bit rude this time.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
London to Bangkok via Colombo return. The outward flight was ok with just one exception - leg room! No room at all and when the passenger in front reclined there was no where to put my tray for meals. Food nice and the cabin staff on the London/Colombo were excellent - very polite and attentive for the whole flight. Colombo/Bangkok not so crowded so a lot more room. Entertainment not brilliant and English programmes seemed to be more animated films. Landing cards 'ran out' in the front of the plane and at the back I heard no mention of landing cards at all which proved a nuisance on arrival at Bangkok. Food quite good on outward journey and service was excellent. Entertainment not brilliant.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
DXB-CMB A330. Decent welcome on board and comfort. Only negative aspects were no personal TV screens lights left on at full brightness for the entire night flight making the passengers restless and noisy. I was also woken up several times by the cabin crew at midnight assuming I automatically wanted to have dinner (despite having an eye mask on and ear plugs). The most frustrating thing was the beeping sound every time someone pressed the attendant button (every 1-2min for the whole flight). This should be switched off like some other airlines do.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
SIN-CMB in Business Class. I take this flight as it leave/arrives at good times and avoids overnight flying. They recently changed from A330 to A320 and there is a big difference. A320 is cramped no leg rests (in row 1) little recline lack of overhead storage embarkation is a zoo! Meals are now on trays rather than the A330 trolley service. Crew seemed overworked. This compares to intra-European biz class or US domestic biz class on cheaper airlines. I would only recommend this service due to departure times.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Tried for the first time. We flew roundtrip form Riyadh to Bangkok Business Class. The lounge in Riyadh was no too bad but very crowded. The flight was delayed from Riyadh to Bangkok but it was made up by the warm and friendly staff. The service was excellent and so was the food. On our return trip to Riyadh we enjoyed the Serendib Lounge. They have great food and service.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-BKK-CMB. Both legs on an old A340-300. The outbound flight was delayed 4 what annoys me is that UL knew about this delay well in advance yet did not contact passengers ahead of time. Delay voucher was given for a filthy breakfast in the airport restaurant. Food on the outbound flight was terrible and no other alcoholic beverages apart from beer and wine were served. What a plunge in service! Return flight left BKK on time again food not great but this time at least 'proper' drinks were served. Unfortunately if you want to avoid red eye flights between CMB and BKK you have to use UL all other airlines fly at ungodly hours in the middle of the night.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
RUH-CMB-BKK-CMB-RUH. This is the second time my wife and I have travelled this route with this carrier the last time being in July 11. Lounge at RUH very poor but it is not the airline's lounge and we normally use the Costa Coffee anyway because the lounge is so dire! RUH-CMB-BKK: an old A340 with cradle seats. The service is good and with a choice of movies games or the now dated hi8 cassettes. Food and drink very good and unlike last time we were able to have a 'real' drink 20 minutes after take off. Excellent cocktail menu and the cabin staff pleasant. On the second sector the food was brought round hot on a trolley. BKK-CMB - A330-200 but with a new interior including lie-flat beds with VIOD (unfortunately the IFE was not working on this sector so no movies were available). Seats comfortable and again staff very friendly. CMB-RUH - again A340-300 (see above comments).

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
AUH-CMB-BKK return in business. AUH-CMB in new A320. I have flown this sector several times with an older 320 but UL is probably the only carrier able to decrease the quality of its Cl class product. Seats are the most uncomfortable I have experienced in C class. Service and food decent. CMB-BKK in old A340 with worn seats and broken IFE. Put up in a shabby Colombo hotel during my 14 hr transit on the return. UL refused to credit my FFP's into my Etihad account (their FFP partner). Overall a rather disappointing experience.

LHR-Colombo-Male return for honeymoon. When we booked as a honeymoon couple we had hoped we would be sat together this was not the case but was managed by check in staff at heathrow. The plane was old and very tiredd looking seats were very uncomfortable and cramped. Inflight entertainment was either not working (games TV Movies etc) or working poorly. Cabin crew did the minimum to make the long journey feel comfortable and were unapproachable. Food okay OK on the journey out on the return was poor. No beverages were offered to passengers other than with meals. Would not recommend to anyone!

SIN-CMB-BOM return. UL was the most economical option between Singapore and Mumbai and the most pleasant I have had on this route. With the exception of check-in staff who were outsourced all other UL staff were pleasant and friendly both in the air and in Colombo. The food was delicious and drinks were proactively offered. IFE on SIN-CMB was basic but did the job. The SIN-CMB sector makes a 1 hour stop in CMB which is difficult to discern from the booking process.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
LHR-CMB-MLE-LHR. Very enjoyable flights both ways. Clean A340 a/c with acceptable comfort. Very attentive and agreeable service from friendly cabin attendants. The meals - two on each main leg plus a snack CMB-MLE - were substantial with a choice of three main courses. Overall exceeded our expectations and we will certainly use again.

HKG-BKK return. The product is fine good service and excellent food. Although plane is a little old with cradle type seat not fully flat bed for this route I still got better than what I paid.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew Cochin-Colombo-London return. The experience was overall very good. The ground handling was good and competent the staff friendly. The cabin service was efficient and pleasant. The crew were helpful. Online seat reservations turned out to be tricky. In the A320 aircraft seats 17B and 17C are shown on the web diagram as bulkhead seats. They were not. In the A340-300 aircraft seats 51 H and 51K are shown as bulkhead seats. They are not! The airline should be more straightforward and forthcoming in these two areas. If they do and maintain the same standard in the other areas they will be a great airline. I would recommend with some reservations.

AUH-CMB-KUL return in C class. Sri Lankan has improved tremendously since my last C class flight 3 years ago. Service was excellent with a good choice of food and drinks. Flights on time and lounge at Colombo airport with a good spread of food and drinks and a free 30 minutes spa treatment. Only the conditions of seats/IFE a concern. Seats are very worn and in dire need of upgrade/refurbishment.

LHR-COL COL-DEL return. We flew 4 times in 10 days and each journey has been unpleasant. Inflight entertainment has never worked properly and sometimes never worked at all. The meal and the food quality was poor. The service onboard wasn't anything special and crew allowed passengers to get drunk and make noise without any problem.

LHR-MLE. One hour late departing LHR. Online booking in was easy check-in seamless. A343 aircraft with clean cabin and comfy economy seats although footrests would have been welcome. Attentive crew who served drinks and food very efficiently. Food quality acceptable and some of with the best I have experienced in economy. Frequent trips with drinks and snacks snacks available from the galleys. Toilets maintained to a high degree. IFE buttons worked it was good and quite acceptable for an 11 hour night flight. A delightful flight primarily due to cabin crew. Despite late departure out of LHR the arrival into MLE was close to schedule.

AUH-CMB Business class. Separate bus to aircraft A320. Greeted warmly and jacket taken. Seat is cradle type and has seen better days with no foot rests and whilst clean it was tatty but spacious. Only 3 pax in the cabin so plenty of space. Newspapers offered drinks order taken with a wide choice of drinks and wines. Food was good older style presentation but tasty. Great to see tea coffee served in a Hotel afternoon tea presentation. Staff were friendly but not intrusive. A personal video player was offered not many movies but fine for a 4 hour flight. Arrived on time we were met at the aircraft by a ground rep who obtained our bags and arranged our transport to our air taxi. Overall genuine service although seat product could be updated.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Bangalore-Colombo-Kuala Lumpur return 3 weeks ago. The return flight was pleasant but the outbound flight to Kuala Lumpur from Colombo was a disappointment. No one served me tea that I asked for during the inflight meal service the inflight entertainment wasn't put up during the 4 hour flight even though the screens functioned alright. I am not sure if they forgot to load up the respected movies/entertainment.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
The flight both ways for me was not what I expected from Sri Lankan. The onward flight to CMB was pleasant but the service onboard was not all that great and I was never asked if I needed a drink during the inflight meal. The return trip was much better but quite an uncomfortable landing. I think the airline can certainly work on the meals being served it was just awful.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
At Bandaranayake International Airport check-in was quick and we were quickly directed to departure lounges. The gates were open at the correct time the aircraft arrived 5 mins after the boarding time and then the airport authorities started to clean the plane. After all we were boarded 2 hours after the estimated boarding time. We were warmly welcomed onboard and seats were comfortable and large. Take off and landings was smooth the food was excellent and they offered 3 choices of main meals. The service was nice crew always at our fingertips to give assistance.

Two Business Class seats to and from Colombo. Outward was fine but the return leg from was very poor with no attention to our needs between lunch and dinner. Ringing the service bell had no effect. Eventually I had to walk to the service area to request tea where I found staff sitting and having a chat. Toilets weren't up to much either.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
RUH-CMB-BKK-CMB-RUH. RUH-CMB 2 hours delay which caused concern because we only had a 1 hour connection time in CMB. The lounge at RUH is awful so we tend not to use it but even though we were first in the queue we were prevented from boarding by the Ground staff as they wanted Business Passengers to board last. This is a really good concept at CMB as you are the last to board and the Lounge staff escort you to the gate but not in RUH were you are sat in the open terminal and when we did board they had both entrances open! An old A340 with old business class seats (not lie flat). Decent choice of movies and extra choice with a library of Hi8. Cabin crew slow at the beginning but good choice of food and drink. CMB-BKK on arrival at CMB we were met by ground staff and informed we had missed our connection but were given a choice of flying CMB-SIN (economy) and SIN/BKK (business) or wait 18 hours - we chose the latter. Put up in a nice hotel in the centre of CMB and made the most of the day. The lounge in CMB is very nice with hot/cold food complimentary massage and cocktails. A330-200 with lie flat seats and a great crew. Service was excellent with little touches like espresso available. Video same as the earlier flight but with no Hi8. BKK-CMB an A330-200 but with the older Business Class seats. IFE same as first flight but crew were friendly and wanted to help. CMB-RUH again service in the lounge first class but A340 was probably the oldest version I have ever come across - levers instead of buttons to move the seat and old business class type seat. Food and service good. Three sectors on time and except for first sector crew were great and great value for money.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Singapore-Colombo transit and then onto Kochi India. Business Class. It was a superb experience though I had been worried after reading other reviews. The cabin crew were of a high standard very professional and friendly. The use of the Skyview Lounge at Changi was nice and it offered a great view of the tarmac activity with all arriving flights visible. UL was delayed from KL. Only issue perhaps was the boarding sequence at Changi where it was an utter free for all. The airline should try to maintain some order or queue priorities. The Serendib Lounge at Colombo was also very nice with a great spread of food.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
DEL-CMB-NRT return. I chose UL because it was the cheapest. Their online booking system check-in and seat selections were very easy to navigate and use. Service was excellent from ground staff to above the air crew were responsive to attendant-call buttons. The return sectors had an over night stop in Colombo in which transit hotel + breakfast was provided nearby the airport. The last sector (CMB-DEL) was operated was brand new Airbus A320 which had an advanced AVOD system and the seat pitch was excellent. Above all despite of very competitive price it was 100% mileage applicable on their frequent flyer program which means that now I can redeem free return tickets between South India and Colombo from this trip. Overall very good value for money I'd love to fly with them again. Few complaints are: Most SriLankan aircraft are outdated - on NRT-CMB it was a leased aircraft and seat pitch was very tight. Also catering from Colombo is poor as compared to catering from Delhi or Tokyo which had a very nice presentation as well as taste. 2 hot meals on 9hr+ journey on NRT-MLE was a nice touch (with 3 choices each).

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
DOH-COL-DOH Business Class. A mixed bag here flights out and back both on A340 -300 so had the lie flat beds which were good and allowed for a couple of hours sleep. Outbound flight Business cabin full and you could tell with the service being slow (1 hr for first drink) and orders forgotten. Food outbound ok. Return journey a huge difference Business not as busy but the service from start to finish was excellent and attentive with a great purser. Food much better as well. Both flights on time.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
FRA-CMB in Business. The flight time was changed a few days before departure and arrival in Colombo was almost 2 hours later than previously scheduled. The airline scheduled for a stopover in Dubai to pick up other passengers. Why - because the flight from Frankfurt was almost empty and it probably was loss-making. Nevertheless the airline marketed the flight as a "nonstop". Its station-manager refused any compensation. Airbus 340 was very worn out and the business class as old as it can get. Not to be recommended.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-LHR prompt departure (having had a 5 hour delay in the earlier flight out of LHR). Check in line very slow and tedious online check in empty!

LHR to MLE Economy. Check-in at Heathrow open four hours departure and for web check-in there were no queues for baggage drop. Internet check-in is supposed to open 48 hours before the flight and when I flew was still not open 12 hours after this time (ie. 36 hours before the flight) – a phone call to their reservations centre produced the information that check-in was not working (IT problem) but they were willing to reserve my preferred seat for the way out and way back in one weeks time. Drinks served after take-off followed by a reasonable meal and then lights out. Because the flight was only one quarter full we could spread out. Unfortunately not all the armrests could be lifted so I had to wriggle a bit to get comfortable but it was far better than sleeping upright. Inflight entertainment old seat back non AVOD and the choice of films was poor. Breakfast edible if you were hungry. They came round with the duty free trolley before we landed at Male selling all sorts of alcohol but they did not mention that you are not allowed to import alcohol into the Maldives – if you bought any on the plane (which I did not) it would have been confiscated on arrival. They also gave out landing cards for Sri Lanka (final stop) but not the Maldives where most passengers got off and then had to fill landing cards in at passport control. On the way back the flight was only 1/3rd full and once doors were closed we could again spread out. Service relaxed and attentive as the way out meal and film choice almost exactly the same. Although planes were a little old and showing internal wear I enjoyed both flights.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We had an appalling experience flying with Sri Lankan and would advise families flying with infants to not fly this airline. We bought premium economy seats and reserved a bassinet seat. When we came to check in we had been bumped down to economy. We were offered no refund and were told there were no bassinet seats in premium economy. When we boarded the plane we found that there were bassinet seats and asked to be moved to them. We were told no because they didn't want an infant in premium economy disturbing the other passengers. We were forced to move to economy seats and to this day (we flew in February) we still have not received a refund. They also managed to loose our pram despite the fact that it was taken to the airplane door. As a result we missed our internal connecting flight and had to wait for 4 hours at Male airport with an extremely tired baby and no pram. When we eventually got our pram back (5 days into our holiday) it was badly damaged. We have written to Sri Lankan airlines and not had a reply and we sent the complaint eight weeks ago.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
CMB-KUL surprised they are using an A340 for this route that continuous to SIN but was less than 50% empty. Service good food well presented but tasteless. Plane was old with old IFE and seats that needed refurbishing. I would use then again only if the price will be great.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
London Heathrow to Male in Business Class. We boarded with ease and took our seats in row 3. Dinner was served shortly after take off and UL have this annoying habit of serving you from a trolley that is laden (to a point) with several options for you to choose and they'll plate it up for you. It took 1 hour to reach our seats (only row 3) admittedly we were the last to be served but what was left of the food was cold and not very appealing. Breakfast was just as poor. The seat is an old cradle seat they are switching in the future to flat seats. IFE was poor and I could hardly see a picture on it. The worst part for me on this overnight flight was that the crew had stowed their bags directly over my head when trying to sleep they did try to not disturb me but failed on every attempt so very disappointing and not worth the money to upgrade from Economy.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
HKG-BKK-HKG economy. Flight departure delayed for 2 hours without explanation from the crew. Service was OK cabin crew pleasant and professional enough. Plane showed signs of age (frayed seat covers peeling carpets) IFE OK for a short flight although would be nice to have more varieties similar to CX SQ etc. Good value for money. Food okay but felt that more beverage selection could be available. Inflight magazine OK but should have more substance rather than ads.

Male-Colombo. Business Class was simple no entertainment system but seats comfortable. However after take-off they let some kid (screening in excitement) from economy class run up and down the aisle which was bothering. Stewardess did not respond to my request and let the kid continue for the entire flight.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
London to Colombo return. A330 which had angled flat beds in business class - the seat ends up at a strange angle where the lower end dangles down not totally flat/ no bedding apart from normal cushion/pillow and static blanket. IFE the old type which was poor and terrible picture quality combined with a basic headset made it not too pleasant. UL have gone back to the open trolley concept for meals which is so outdated despite being able to view all on the menu. Food relatively cold but selection good and tasty. Overall service remains quite amateur and not co-ordinated. Having been flying UL from 1995 I still long for the old days of 1st class where the Chief Steward actively managed the cabin service and every flight was a delight. But with UL you know what to expect - when its good its terrific.

CMB-BKK-PEK Economy Class.Check-in and boarding relatively smooth. The staff were efficient and friendly but meal served on the first leg wasn't very nice. There were three choices of main dish. Rows 10-12 in Economy are between Business and a bulkhead/galley so that made things a bit more private. IFE okay but not on demand.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Flew to Male. Check in including offering to book me my return seat because I was 4 months pregnant made me feel pretty positive about SriLankan Airlines. Flight was already delayed by an hour (due to late incoming flight). In the end we boarded 1.20 minutes late and then continued to sit on the tarmac for approx another hour without being told what was going on. The captain struggled to provide updates. Once airborne the experience didn't improve - shocking food staff were disinterested. Coming back was no better - again sat on the aircraft with no updates as to when we were taking off - the plane was boarded on time and we just sat there (nothing from the captain until we pushed back). The food on the return flight was even worse.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
Mumbai - Colombo - Heathrow return. The cabin was clean and well maintained. Comfort good in the economy seats. There was confusion regarding seat allocation (when a lady decided she would be assigned my seat for her baby - which was not the case) but the situation was handled quite well by the head of cabin crew. I am 6'5" tall and legroom is almost always an issue but crew and airport staff ensured my seats were booked on emergency exit or the front row. The meals were almost excellent. The in-flight entertainment could do with more channels and aircraft was quite dated on he Mumbai - Colombo sector. Anyway value for money!

Male to Colombo A330 Business Class. Clean interior and spacious seats very comfy. Excellent crew helpful and friendly service. Male check-in was good. Great food choice. Overall good inflight service.

KWI to Colombo. They have a child trained crew in every flight and took care of our kids keeping them entertained while we had a nice sleep. Food was good and options for drinks is very good.

I was most disappointed with the check-in procedures both in Singapore and Colombo. In Singapore I was refused check-in because I did not have the credit card used to pay for the (return) ticket. The monies had transferred to SriLankan Airlines weeks before and I was clearly booked onto the flight but I was point-blank refused. In exasperation I had to buy another ticket online there and then - no-on was able to sell me one so I paid twice for the flight to my son's wedding. The check-in in Colombo was a joke : please update your computer system - it took nearly 2 hours to reach the gate from the check-in queue. There was very nearly a riot. It did not help that one member of staff was manually allocating seats on a list! The flight was fine the rest was dreadful. I will not fly SriLankan Airlines again.

We were on the same flight as C Robinson (22DEC). It was the worst flight we have ever been on. Now we are back home we want to claim on insurance for the delay however their feedback forms on their website do not work their London Office email address does not work their Office number is temporarily unavailable and calling any other number we get put in a queue for approximately 15 minutes before being cut off each time. Appalling!

From beginning to end the experience was awful! Heathrow to Male check in at Heathrow the staff was rude she didn't look at us let alone speak during the process. Halfway through landing at Male the pilot decided the weather meant landing was dangerous ended up in India where we spent 3 hours with no air conditioning (they didnt tell us what was happening or offer water) on the runway while they learnt how to refuel an aircraft that big! Eventually went on to Colombo - where again they gave us no info and eventually after hassling (and 4 hours in the terminal) we found we were instead getting an Emirates flight to Male. They told people there was no need for new boarding passes - it turned out there was and several people having gone through security were turned away and had to go back and get one. The return journey was no better - more delays and poor service.

KUL-CMB-BLR. Trip to forget. Checked in Kuala Lumpur and was told I would not be able to board the aircraft until I produce a photo copy of my credit card for the ticket purchased. Went all over KUL airport to find a computer that can print PDF documents finally found one. Went again to check in counter and was told flight was delayed. I ended up finally making it to CMB but missed my connecting flight to BLR. Was put up in the airport transit hotel and flew in the morning to Chennai where I was told to catch a Jet Airways flight at SriLankan Airlines expense. All in all a terrible experience will think twice about flying this airline again.

BKK-CMB-MLE. Handling agents at BKK were very poorly informed on running the system numerous problems arose and it took over an hour to check in. During check-in they informed us that the CMB-MLE leg of our trip had been cancelled and that we that it was rescheduled for next morning. At CMB we asked the information counter about the transit hotel assigned to us at BKK. They claimed to have never heard of it and were no help at all whatsoever. All this happened in the middle of the night so we were really frustrated. The woman at the transit counter was exceptionally rude. We were then put on a bus with some other passengers and were brought to a small and very dirty little inn quite a long way from the airport. On the way to BKK the MLE handling agents refused to check us in saying that our ticket (issued by SriLankan) was for 15 days while our visa covered only 14. Right from the ticket agents to the transit hotels this was a ghastly experience.

Male-Colombo-LHR We were on the awful flight on 29 Nov. We were only told the night before our direct flight to LHR that we were to be diverted via Colombo and we had to do our own phone calls to arrange our return flight. What made the journey more tedious was that at the Colombo boarding gate we were all searched even ladies rubber flip flops were checked. The passengers were getting very angry with the lack of information being given and were told time after time the delay was due to operational reasons. Not the truth that the Sri Lankan President was too rude to get to the plane on time and that we could all wait for him!! Never travel with this grotty airline as they have no customer service at all.

Male-LHR via Colombo. Having booked direct flights both ways we were dismayed to be informed 3 days before the end of our holiday that our direct flight from Male to LHR was cancelled and we had to fly back via Colombo. This meant starting 3 hours earlier to get to Colombo. On arrival at Colombo our flight showed 'check-in' but no departure time. No one at the SriLankan Airlines desk and eventually heard a rumour we were delayed awaiting a VIP. All this time our aircraft was ready at its departure gate and never found a SriLankan Airlines rep to explain the delay. We were called for boarding 1.5 hours late and then sat on the aircraft for a further hour with no explanation. After anger levels getting pretty high the captain came on to apologise for the delay due to operational reasons. (Plane surrounded by armed army personnel). Eventually 2 helicopters arrived and disgorged said VIP - President of Sri Lanka on his way to UK . So 6 hours added to an already tedious journey with just one weak apology. We will never fly with this airline again.

Paris-Male via Colombo. Service nice and efficient. Seats are a bit old in business food is good. IFE is dated but is okay. Plane clean crew smiling and friendly.

Travelled from Colombo to the Maldives. It took over an hour to check in. Staff unhelpful and was constantly hit with the cart as it passed up and down the aisle. Very cramped seats. Luckily I was on a different carrier on the way back.

Heathrow to Male return in business. We don't need fancy IFE just space and we were impressed. The limo pick up from home is an excellent way to start a holiday. Service was excellent both ways staff very good and dealt with the children in our cabin very well. Limo pick up to home was good too.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
We flew from Heathrow to Male and back - believe the negative reviews you read here! Firstly the airline only has two long haul A340-300's running this route both pretty tired looking planes though one of them seemed slightly better than the other. Inflight entertainment is a complete joke - didn't work on the way out or back (thankfully due to reviews on this website I had bought myself a Sony PSP to keep me entertained). Staff seemed pretty miserable and disinterested in helping (I asked twice for them to reset my screen and was ignored both times - also took them an age to clear trays from the seats - this after one of the stewardesses had kicked my tray as I had put it on the floor as far out of the way as possible and she managed to scatter the contents. Rather than pick it up she pushed it back under my seat - hence I cleared it away myself. Overall very disappointing and I shall make a determined effort never to use this airline again.

We flew SriLankan Airlines to Male from London on and were due to fly back on 31st Oct from Male. Our experience with them was a disaster from start to finish. We checked in 3 hours before the outward flight to find our online booked seats were not available the flight was overbooked and they were trying to bump people off we had to sit far apart on the plane - row 50 and 24 - not a great way to start a romantic week away. The flight entertainment did not work on many of the seats flight was delayed service and the food were both awful. We complained at Heathrow and got the Service manager from Sri Lanka that night to at least make sure we had seats together for the return journey. We tried to check in for the return flight on the 31st to find we had been bumped off the flight - apparently due to overbooking. We were told there was nothing they could do. To cut a long story short we got them to pay to re route us via Qatar but despite promises of many things ended up being stranded in Doha airport for 8 hours without accommodation before being able to get a return flight to London. It took us 37 hours to get home on a journey that should have taken no more than 14 hours door to door and caused us great distress and inconvenience. SriLankan Airlines are a dreadful

Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow with a stopover in Colombo. Colombo to London was delayed for 4 hours for reasons unclear and unexplained by the airline. We had to be seated in the plane for approx 15 min. without aircon which caused feelings of sickness. After asking one of the crew members to switch on the air con we were told that it would be working after the plane reached a certain height. Flight security demonstrations on the TV screens stopped due to a "power loss" which was the explanation given by one of the crew members over the speakers. We were scared to fly after this announcement! Due to the 4 hours delay of the flight we lost our connection flight. We went to the counter of Sri Lankan Airlines at Heathrow Airport to ask them for refund or an alternative flight but for one hour no one came. After all that waiting at the counter the man who finally showed up just informed us that he could not do anything for us. He did not even offer us a meal or a refreshment after all this time waiting. We had to book a complete new flight to reach Barcelona and spent a night at the airport in London.

London Heathrow to Male via Colombo on an A340. Business class full so went for Premium Economy at £50 a head - remarkable value for money. Food tasty and no complaints. IFE is a bit basic but expecting that. Legroom perfectly adequate. Colombo to Male economy class only a short flight on A340 so cannot really comment on the food. I am glad I upgraded to Premium economy on the flight out as normal economy was a bit cramped. Male to London got an upgrade to business class and well worth the £600 it cost. Food superb and lots of it angled flat seats. On all flights the crew were very good bordering on excellent. Flights all on time and no complaints about baggage. All in all a very pleasant experience.

LHR-CMB-LHR. Our honeymoon started with a 4hr delay during the time the crew did not update us and we were left at LHR whilst everything closed without being able to buy drinks or even knowing if the flight would still leave. When we finally boarded at 2am crew did not even apologise! Staff unfriendly food was below average and the entertainment system was bad too. On the way back we again had 2 hr delay and crew did not feel that this was worth an apology! The same movies were played on the way back as on the way there and food was poor again.

### SriLankan Airlines customer review
HKG-BKK A330 with lie flat seats. Use of CNAC lounge in HKG was fine but very far from the gate. Cabin Crew friendly but one flight attendant seemed quite new and unable to handle basic questions/ request. The seat was good for the short flight. The food was served seat side from a trolley and well presented. The salad starter was good but the main course and dessert tasted pretty bad. They also incorrectly identified the food on two occasions. I am not picky with food but if I had strict food preferences or allergies. I would have probably been quite upset. PVT lacked choices but managed for find something to watch.

AUH-CMB on A320. The service by the cabin crew has improved over the months nevertheless the facilities were dreadful. I am 5'10 and the seats very extremely cramped and there was no IFE on this 4 plus hours flight. The food was inedible.

LHR-CMB-LHR. I was shocked by the state of the A340. Food was poor and onboard entertainment also poor. No effort what so ever to make the passengers trip memorable.

BOM-CMB-MAA. Outgoing flight 0325 departure too sleepy to care. Hard seats on A320. Return long check in queue - 1 hour to get to the desk. Onboard hard thin seats on the A340. Possibly the worst breakfast onboard - 2 spoons of watery lentils 2 small stale loaves of bread and a tetrapak of mango juice. Enjoyed the tea - can't go wrong with that Otherwise unremarkable.

LHR-CMB-LHR economy class. Honeymoon holiday wanted to fly direct and Sri Lankan Airlines is the only carrier to fly direct from the UK. Customer service terrible no way of communicating with UK SriLankan Airlines by email. Outward a rugby scrum at the gate food ok entertainment system rubbish - kept freezing seats uncomfortable. Plane on time. Return flight ground staff better food below average seat broken and wouldn't stay upright - staff didn't seem interested when I reported it entertainment system didn't work at all this time. Have complained to the airline but yet to get a response 2 weeks on! Not a good start or end to our honeymoon.

My wife bought a ticket from Goa to London via Coloumbo. The outward bound was fine. When she tried to change the return trip she was informed that the Goa leg was no longer being run and she could change it to Chennai and they would arrange an internal flight for her to Goa. This was very good service. However due to luggage etc she decided to cancel the return leg and book another airline. SriLankan Airlines agreed that she would get a full refund. 9 months later and many many emails between her the issuing agent and Sri Lankan Airlines including a visit to Sri Lankan head office and there has been no refund. I can only assume that SriLankan Airlines do not honour there promises and refunds are not issued!
