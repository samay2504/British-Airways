### “Crew disinterested”
Not Verified | First time flying Royal Jordanian. Flight delayed for two hours. Unbearably hot temperature inside the cabin. Crew disinterested in what they do. Flight half full is a sign that probably many are not showing interest on this airline.

### "regret spending money on this upgrade"
I recently had a disappointing experience with Royal Jordanian Airlines. I decided to pay for an upgrade to business class on my flights from Amman to Jeddah and back. Unfortunately, the service did not meet my expectations. On my outbound flight, the experience was subpar, but the return trip was even worse. I expected a certain level of comfort and service for the price I paid, but I was let down. The breakfast was poor, and when I requested a blanket, the stewardess informed me that they only had ONE set available, which was already given to another passenger. This is unacceptable, especially on a morning flight when passengers naturally want to rest. Moreover, there was no entertainment provided as they did not distribute headsets. It was frustrating to be unable to sleep or watch anything during the flight. I doubt that the airline will take this feedback seriously, but I feel it's important to warn other travelers. Save your money and consider other airlines instead of Royal Jordanian. I truly regret spending money on this upgrade, and I do not recommend this airline at all.

### "it has become a budget carrier"
This is an increasingly tired airline on the cusp of mediocrity, a far cry from the Royal Jordanian of six years ago. The plane itself looked old, its black paint visibly chipped all over the fuselage, the carpets stained, the seat trays worn and constantly falling open, the headrests incapable of staying up. The entertainment system for this five-hour plus flight was non-existent (in years past, RJ planes flying this route had featured entertainment systems). The cabin personnel was lackadaisical, slow, and indifferent to passengers needs or, worse, egregious behavior. The food was scant, and frankly bad. Having been a fan of Royal Jordanian before, I’m sorry to say it has become a budget carrier masquerading as a mid-tier airline.

### "disorganization and poor service"
Not Verified | I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent flight from Istanbul to Amman. The flight, originally scheduled for 2:05 PM, was delayed multiple times—first to 8:55 PM, then 9:10 PM, then 1:00 AM, and finally rescheduled to 7:00 AM, before being moved again to 5:30 AM. The delays were attributed to a technical issue, yet no replacement aircraft was arranged despite the extended timeframe. The lack of communication and support from your staff made this experience even more frustrating. Given your airline’s pricing and reputation, this level of disorganization and poor service is unacceptable.

### “will never book with this airline again”
The airline changed my connecting flight to three days later than the original date! This means I would have to stay at the airport for three days! I called my agent for assistance, only to be told to cancel my booking and request a refund (4-6 weeks). I had to make a new booking close to the departure date, which was obviously more expensive. I was also charged ~$100 by the agent to get the refund. I will never book with this airline again.

### "trust in them has been shattered"
I am absolutely appalled by my experience with this airline. After a long and exhausting flight, I arrived at my destination only to discover that my luggage—filled with irreplaceable items and medication—had been lost. This was not just an inconvenience; it was a complete disaster, and the airline staff offered no real assistance. The customer service was shockingly unhelpful. I was met with indifferent attitudes and vague responses when I inquired about my luggage. They claimed they would look into it, but I received no follow-up, no updates, and no real apology for the situation. It felt like they simply didn't care about my belongings or my distress. To make matters worse, the process to file a lost luggage report was a nightmare. I spent over an hour navigating through a maze of paperwork, only to be told that I might have to wait weeks for any resolution. I can't believe that an airline with such a supposed reputation can't manage something as basic as ensuring passengers' luggage arrives with them. This airline has completely failed in its responsibility to its travelers. If you value your belongings and want a stress-free travel experience, I highly recommend avoiding this airline at all costs. My trust in them has been shattered, and I will think twice before booking a flight with them again. Absolutely unacceptable!

### “a good experience”
Due to cancellation of BA flights to/from Amman, I ended up taking RJ. Had a good experience in both directions. Plane was clean, the seats comfortable, and there was a decent IFE selection for the 5-hour flight. Crew were fine - polite, but not particularly friendly or warm. They didn't go out of their way to assist, but were responsive. I was impressed that before meal service, they came around with drinks and nuts (you don't get that on many airlines anymore). The meal selection was decent, with a choice of hot dishes, accompanied by a starter, roll and dessert, and a selection of alcohol. All flights were on time. I wouldn't hesitate to take them again.

### "They changed my departure date"
In an attempt to save money I booked my flight months in advance with Royal Jordanian. They changed my departure date from the 19th to the 20th, however they left my connecting flights on the 19th! When I called to explain the physical impossibility of this itinerary, I was rudely told there were no other flight options on the 20th and there was no refund. I opted to call back and speak to someone that was having a better day, and was told I could get a refund minus a non refundable non negotiable $250 tax. My other option was to go kick rocks. Long story short, I had to take the $250 hit, purchase last minute flight with another airline (which cost over $300 more than my original flight) and waste an hour and a half of time being treated horribly on the phone. And mind you, they are the ones that screwed up. Never again!

### "leaving the tickets as credit"
Booked a flight to Beirut, the country is at war, l called the airline at their office in McGill, the manager was sarcastic and extremely unprofessional, emailed their office at the airport and their office in Amman asking them to cancel the flight and leaving the tickets as credit to be reused in the future, they declined and only accepted to do so by charging me 250$ penalty fees per passengers, I explained over and over that there is a war situation, and they insisted on charging me 250$ penalty per passenger.

### "asked me if I would relocate"
Not Verified |  Before the flight I upgraded to an empty seat beside me. the seat was 28A, however there was a family booked the other 2 seats beside mine. The cabin crew asked me if I would relocate, I did explain that I have paid for an empty seat beside me. I was moved to a seat which does not recline because was just in front of an emergency exit. The seat was almost upright and was the most uncomfortable position for Five and a half hours, beside the flight was late taking off and late arriving by 30 minute. I must admit despite all this the cabin crew were fantastic very helpful and polite. Un my view they have tried to solve the problem. unfortunately I did suffer a lot with such an uncomfortable position sitting upright for the whole flight. the food was great. I have paid 126 JOD equivalent to 142 GBP, in Amman for extra bag to check in. while I paid for the extra bag to check in from Newcastle 85 GBP. Same bag same weight 23kg double the price why?

### "Very rude employees"
Every time we travel with Royal Jordanian Airlines, we face same problems. Very rude employees and they are confused with their airline regulations. They don’t respect you at all and they may leave you while talking to them and talk to their friends. Very old aircraft with uncomfortable seats, no menu options, screens are not working. Very expensive flight for their services and compare with other airlines.

### "very happy for the price we paid"
Not Verified |  Chaotic check- in at Cairo for Business Passengers but once sorted boarding passes issued for all three sectors in Business Class and nice lounge provided in Cairo (No Alcohol) plus Crown Lounge in Amman very good whilst in transit. Food onboard very Arabic / Western choices available and portions huge in size plus crew on all sectors were friendly but once service completed they stayed in the galley most of the flights Amman to Bangkok Business was comfortable with blankets and pillows on the night sector and anything required was obtainable by the call button. Overall very happy for the price we paid

### "everything was perfect"
I booked a ticket for my mother, with special assistance. Everything was perfect. The crew, food , plane seats and everything was perfect.

### "the worst I've ever flown"
This airline is the worst I've ever flown! They lost my luggage for over a week forcing me to have to buy a bunch of necessities just to get through until my luggage could be returned. Then when I finally got it back, my luggage was damaged. I reached out to multiple people from their customer service to get some kind of reimbursement for their mistake and kept getting bounced around. I still have not been reimbursed for anything and it's been over a month since I been trying to get someone to help me with this. Their customer service is a joke! Never fly Royal Jordanian unless you want the worst service an airline could offer.

### "decided to hold my passport"
I was quite satisfied with Royal Jordanian’s business class offerings on the 787 from Bangkok to Amman and back. The food, the service & the flat beds were very satisfactory. On the Amman to Athens & back legs the airline operated the A319’& A320 aircrafts which were adequately spacious. My nightmare began on my return journey. I had a 10.5 layover at Amman. When i checked in for my business class flight in Athens i was told to collect a hotel voucher in Amman for the layover. On arrival at Amman airport i collected the voucher thinking that the hotel was within the airport. After waiting for an hour with a bunch of other passengers i was ushered towards immigration by hotel personnel. Once at immigration my passport was held back as i didn’t have a visa. I had checked visa requirements for my weak passport before my journey & had been told that because i had long term visa to the US&the UK i could get one on arrival. Well immigration didn't agree & decided to hold my passport. I then asked to go to the lounge and not go to the hotel but that was not allowed & i had to proceed to the hotel without my documents. I spent the next 5 -6 hours at the dump of the hotel in a state of extreme anxiety. The hotel staff kept assuring me that my passport would be returned to me as soon as i went back to the airport at midnight for my 2am flight. However when i got back to the airport the immigration officers didn't seem to know where my passport was moreover they were so lackadaisical that they continued to do their job while i was having a meltdown. After pleading with them for 40 mins or so one of the officers went to look for my passport & finally found it & stamped it and returned it to me. It was the most horrid experience of my travel life. I then ran to the Crown lounge at Amman airport to grab a bite to eat and proceeded to the gate to board my 2 am flight, which a few hours ago i had been convinced I would miss.

### "Very rude employees"
Not Verified |  Very rude employees. Constantly late at checkout stands and at gates. Constantly yelling at customers and being rude. Wouldn't recommend if it wasn't for the cheap price.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. I flew from Detroit to Beirut via Amman, they lost my 2 bags, I have no idea where , tried to contact them and sent an email, no one even bothered to email me back. I have no clothes or anything else on me, so I have to buy everything from here, I will never fly again with them.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
Royal Jordan Airlines is the worst airline I have experienced. They advance the flight by 5 hours which means not sleeping and then waiting 10 hours at Reine-Alia airport for the stopover, warning us only one day before. And despite this lack of understanding and seriousness, they offer no compensation. The staff becomes nonchalant when listening to a request for possible compensation or any help. Also, the staff people are not doing their job. They don't go to their information counter, they don't help people, the counter is empty all day (I waited 10 hours in the airport.). This company has an amateur level, or even worse. The rest of the company staff were rude and speak no English, which is further proof of their level of amateurism.

### "Wi-Fi does not let you access anything"
Not Verified |  I ordered the lasagna but it was horrible, I couldn't pull it apart because they put the cheese first on top so it was literally impossible to eat it. The entertainment website on board, I think has less than 60 movies and the Wi-Fi does not let you access anything except their website. They do not even offer a package so you can speak with your family members

### "no longer answering my emails"
Our luggage was lost and it was not clear when it would be returned to us. We had obligations that required us to buy clothing. We spent more than $350 dollars for suitable clothes for the two days the luggage was lost. I have made repeated requests for reimbursement, they say they will but they have not sent the money. I have emailed and called more than 10 times. Now they are no longer answering my emails. They said they would pay $300 but have not paid any.

### "food itself was incredibly disappointing"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying on Royal Jordanian Airlines, and I must say, it was a major (12hr flight) let-down. Not only were the ticket prices high, but the food itself was incredibly disappointing. I expected much more from an airline that claims to offer a premium experience. The overall taste and quality were also highly disappointing. As someone who enjoys flavorful cuisine, this was a major letdown. I anticipated a delightful culinary journey, but unfortunately, it was far from it. To make matters worse, the portion sizes were incredibly small. I understand the constraints of serving food on an airplane, but the amount provided was hardly enough to satisfy even a moderately hungry passenger. It felt like an afterthought rather than a carefully planned meal. Furthermore, the lack of creativity in the breakfast offerings was disappointing. The meals lacked innovation and seemed to be basic, standard choices that did not leave a lasting impression. As a passenger, I believe it is important to have a breakfast experience that is not only nourishing but also enjoyable and memorable. Considering the ticket prices associated with Royal Jordanian Airlines, I expected a more diverse and enticing meals. Other airlines manage to provide a wider range of choices. Unfortunately, Royal Jordanian Airlines fell short in this aspect. Finally, the combination of high ticket prices and subpar food left me feeling dissatisfied and regretful of my choice. If you're someone who values quality dining during your travels, I would strongly advise exploring alternative airlines that prioritize culinary excellence.

### "never come across such dreadful behaviour"
I flew Business Class Bangkok-Amman; upon boarding, I could not find a space for my one piece of hand luggage, as the overhead locker and those near it were all full. There was a member of cabin crew looking at us, but he did not offer to help, so I asked him to help me find a space, as the economy class passengers were streaming through the business class cabin and I was finding it hard to move around. He seemed very unwilling, but looked in a locker further away, so I mentioned that he could rearrange some backpacks on the locker above my seat or the one next to it to make some room. He told me not to tell him what to do and to shut up and wait, so I told him he was being rude, to which he responded by shouting at me in front of the entire Business Class cabin and moving menacingly towards me until he came face to face with me in a threatening manner, shouting at me. I was so taken aback and shocked, I told him not to raise his voice at me, that it was unnecessary and frankly wrong. He then called me the rude one and said he would have me taken off the flight if I didn't shut up. At this point my partner intervened and told him he had no right to talk to me in such a threatening manner, as I'd done nothing wrong, as in fact he was the one with the anger issue. The cabin crew member then shouted at my partner too, so I had to try and calm the situation down and asked the crew member to identify himself, as he wasn't wearing a name badge. He refused to answer, so I asked to speak to the senior cabin crew member, to which he replied that it was him! I therefore asked for his name and he refused to give it to me again. As space was found for my bag above my seat, I asked him to help me lift my bag into it: he refused and told me I have two hands and to do it myself! I pointed out that my visibly bandaged right hand was broken (I have a medical report to prove this too) and that it was an unkind and discriminatory thing to say to a passenger, to which he just laughed and stared at me with a sarcastic look. I then asked another crew member for help me, but he would not help me either saying he wasn't allowed to touch passenger's bags, even though I then saw him help several other passengers with their bags and jackets. Finally, my partner put my bag in the locker, and I sat down completely shocked and frightened by what had just happened. He told me that the crew member in question was indeed the senior member and that he should have been wearing a badge. You can imagine what a terrible flight it was: the senior crew member would strut down the aisle helping other passengers and bantering with them, whilst shooting me horrible, threatening looks: I was too scared to even eat my dinner, in case it'd been tampered with, as there was no trolley service whatsoever. We were only offered red wine, the food was awful and there was no trolley service and nobody asked if we wanted to drink or eat something more. The seats were old as well and the film selection very poor. When we disembarked, the senior member was at the door and refused to say goodbye; just awful. We are frequent travellers and have never come across such dreadful behaviour in our lives. We shall never fly with Royal Jordanian again.

### "Never again travel with this airline"
Not Verified | Absolutely rubbish customer service. The staff at the check in counter was extremely rude. Very unhelpful and dismissive not ready to listen. Talking like Robots and treating the customer like an idiot. Keep repeating what is said and not listening at all. The security check in Jordan for a transit passenger was another level!! The guys don't speak English and took one half hour for the line to clear and I had to run for the flight as my transit time was 2 hours. Never again travel with this airline - total waste

### "not good customer service"
They left my luggage in Jeddah, arrived in Amman not good customer service, and they said will deliver my luggage to the hotel but lied. The next day I want pick up my luggage at the airport they make it hard. I believes if that reviewing all the service will bring improvement, especially with their human resources quality.

### "Transfering my baggage was miserable"
Transfering my baggage was miserable, everything got broken, my baggage and my sweets boxes got damaged. I did not think that Royal Jordanian airlines would accept such a practice

### "do not want to refund me"
Delayed 2 hours, no information about it. Stranded in New York for 24 hours, no help in the airport. Bought a ticket JFK to SFO myself and Royal Jordanian Airlines do not want to refund me, despite the 2 hours delay caused me not to catch my connecting flight in JFK.

### "Very nice trip overall"
Not Verified |  Very nice trip overall. In flight service was friendly and efficient. Food quality well above average, Plenty of legroom and a comfortable seat. The IFE however is fairly awful.

### "already a negative experience"
Haven't even traveled yet and already a negative experience. Purchased Business Class tickets for my family of three Amman-Erbil return. Recently received an automated notice that we have been downgraded to economy on return flight segment and to "enjoy our flight. No explanation. Only change is to a larger aircraft with even more business class seats so what's the story? No review of options, most of all offer of partial refund for fare differential due to their downgrade , as a responsible carrier would do. Stuff happens but take ownership. Insult to injury, RJ then put us in the back of the plane, not even a front or exit row as a basic courtesy. Sought clarity. Calling Center said to email. No response to email of course. Be careful about giving this company your money. You might not get what you paid for. Not a reliable OneWorld Alliance "partner.

### "Terrible experience. Never again"
Terrible experience. Never again. My bags were held at the airport because they didn’t have enough storage in the plane. I waited nearly 24 hours before getting my bags after we drove an hour to the airport to get them. The airline advised us that they were going to deliver the bags to us however, they kept delaying and never ended up delivering them. I tried calling the airlines numerous times without an answer. Very terrible customer service, I have never witnessed anything like this before. My mother stayed without her medications for over 16 hours until I had to go purchase more. The trip also initially started with a very rude staff member at the Detroit airport. I lost a lot of money including paying for a train trip back and forth to the airport and purchasing extra medications and clothes for the time I did not have my luggage.

### "Overall poor service"
This was my first experience with Royal Jordanian. Communication is very poor, almost impossible by phone to speak to an agent. Flight attendants were mixed: some friendly, others acted as if they were doing you a favor serving you. Food service was slow. The smaller meals were inedible, the main dinner was okay. Drinks were mostly self-serve, only one in 13 hours did they come through the aisle offering drinks. Overall poor service. Entertainment selection was not bad. Seat comfort in economy was average. Getting through the Amman airport for a transfer was a nightmare. I recommend only if you are on a very tight budget, their prices is comparatively low.

### "It is stressful and tiresome"
I had a bad experience with RJ travelling from Chicago to Saudi Arabia via Amman. I feel the service lacks respect and consideration for the passengers' requirements. No consideration was given even when I flew business class and was in a wheelchair. I haven't come across any airlines where wheelchair bound passengers are the last to board the flight and the last to leave the flight. All economy class passengers were given priority to board the flight while I paid to upgrade by ticket to business class. When I confronted this I was told a lie that they are going down and not boarding while they all boarded the flight and I was last to go in and couldn't find the place to put my hand carry. The food was terrible and staff service was very negligent. Even when I requested for water to take my medication nobody paid any attention to it. Seats are terrible in economy class. My stopover was over 12 hrs and I was not given a hotel even after my request. I felt I wasted my money upgrading the ticket and could have used that money to stay at a hotel. No customer service phone number to communicate. Through email they just forward you the general info to all your inquiries. Lost baggage tracking is zero. So if your baggage is lost it is lost forever. I lost my baggage of Zam Zam water and couldn't contact airlines for almost a week now and have not received any response from them either. I would not recommend anybody to use this airline. It is stressful and tiresome on a long journey of 13 to 14 hr flight. I hope my comments will be taken seriously and action will be taken to give better service and to live up to its name of ROYAL.

### "Don’t use this airline"
The worst customer support, before I travel I contacted them to check about the regulation for covid, they said I don’t have to do pcr anymore. I went to the airport and couldn’t catch my flight because of that, and paid extra fees in order to get my money back, they just refunded money now after one year of chasing, and only refunded 1,700 dhs out of 5,000 dhs paid for 2 tickets and they said this is the only refund I will get, Don’t use this airline.

### "You can’t get a hold of anyone"
Worst airline ever. You can’t get a hold of anyone via phone or email. They lost my bag in Amman, not sure how as we had a long enough layover. It was supposed to arrive on the next flight today and nothing came and there is nobody answering any calls or emails and they haven’t since Friday. The food was also horrendous and they don’t pre board people needing assistance.

### "the aircraft was not well cleaned"
After boarding the aircraft and finding my way to my seat I noticed that it was very dirty and there was trash in my seat. The flight attendant was kind enough to clean my seat for me but I was disappointed to find that the aircraft was not well cleaned.

### "Fees for everything"
Worst Airline ever with their customer service. Fees for everything. it was about $1000 fees to be able to just change the flight day because I had an emergency case to travel earlier. And no convenient option for cancelling at all! No full refund and not even a credit option. The only option was to leave the ticket on hold for a fee of $270. This is ridiculous and waste of money. with all the extra fees, another cheaper flight can be purchased. it's the last time for me to travel with this airline.

### "worst service in our lives"
Not Verified |  Wife and I flew here back in May and just the other day. Lost luggage 2 pieces x5 days. Thus time 2x pieces luggage now counting 3rd day. Cannot say the customer service is awful because when you are rarely able to reach anyone you get the run around no responsibility, no professionalism, no accountability. I could go on about the flights themselves yet would take far too long here. Been traveling globally for 40 years and we have never seen and had to experience worst service in our lives. Yet, they have the audacity to charge outrageous prices and their idea of excellence is simply getting you there in one piece alive. Pitiful, pathetic, incredulous to describe briefly! STAY AWAY, you will be denied access to water on the plane and the food is inedible to say the least. Didn't even have a boarding pass for our connection out of Paris.

### "pay for a flatbed, get cramped upright seat"
Never ever book and pay for a flatbed on Royal Jordanian. They advertise a flatbed. You pay for a flatbed, and they give you a cramped upright seat on a dirty old A320. It is a scam because you have no recourse and no way to change flights or ask for a refund due to the late notice of aircraft change being provided. We had a long flight from Rome to Bangkok and we booked RJ, especially and only because they advertised a flatbed on a new 787. Less than 24 hours before departure we got an email, you have an aircraft change to a short haul A320, with cramped uprights seats. I phoned their reservation centre who are hopeless and couldn't understand what the problem was. Ground staff and the cabin crew had no interest in the problem and besides what could they do. Look at flight data they do this regularly, sell with the promise of a flat bed on a new aircraft and then swap out an old A320 the day prior with pax having no recourse and due to the last-minute change, no ability to seek other flight options. Do not trust them. Do not waste your money. Oh, and by the way in their own business lounge, you have to pay $25 for a shower. And the food was inedible. Not why we chose them, we wanted a flatbed, but all up, they are APPALLING. Not one aspect of the experience was worthy of a single point 0/10 for everything.

### "avoid at all cost"
Royal Jordanian had decided to change my flight last minute to one that is 6 hours earlier! I have a booking from Royal Jordanian airlines for a 12 hours layover. They suddenly put me on an earlier flight cutting short my layover to 5h 50 minutes which was ridiculous as I had paid extra for the longer layover and had plans to see the city otherwise I would have never fly through Jordan or take their airlines. In any case, they do not want to provide any refund and I find it absoutely ridiclous that I essentially paid $200 more and spent 6 hours more just because of some stupid last minute change and they didnt even offered any reasons or compensation. ridiculous service, avoid at all cost

### "a pleasant experience"
My flight from London to Amman and the return flight were all good. Clean comfortable plane, half full on the outbound flight and full on the return. Polite friendly cabin crew. The flights left and arrived on time. Choice of hot meal. Basic but ok entertainment system. I couldn't fault them and they compared very favourably with British Airways who now only serve a bottle of water and a bag of crisps on this route which, for a 5 hour flight arriving into Amman after midnight, is outrageous. All in all a pleasant experience

### "a pathetic group of liars"
After checking in and checking a bag on my return flight to Rome, via Amman Jordan, Royal Jordanian most likely canceled the flight and left many of us sitting at the gate, where there never was a plane at the end of the "passenger walkway" nor any boarding done at the deserted embarkation desk, at the time of boarding and departure. They then ridiculously claimed That I had missed the "boarding call" for flight RJ735, sitting right in front of the Gate. They are a pathetic group of liars. Now they are refusing to refund the unused part of my ticket and cost of flight on Qatar Airways I incurred to get Home.

### "The absolute worst round trip"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst round trip from Los Angeles to Amman in my life. The service is horrible on both ends. From the start of the trip until I arrived and the same coming back. Cancellation and non organization. Just chaos. They tell you one thing on the phone and the complete opposite when your under the gun at the airport. They make you wish walking was the best option of travel. It’s the most disappointing experience of travel I can ever think of. Nightmare experience.

### "customer service are not helpful"
I won't travel with them again. My luggage was missed during my flight and it's been 4 weeks now, I didn't receive them. I made a feedback online and i was surprised that they marked my complaint as solved although i didn't receive my luggage yet. Their customer service are not helpful, their call center is not answering most of the time.

### "Will not fly with them again"
Have 10 luggage allowance but used only 8, in addition to frame. When I wanted to check in at the seventh circle office, they told me that the frame will not be allowed to board the airplane because the sum of dimensions is above 205 cm (it is 240 cm)! I see people check in way larger items and bulky luggages. Even if you think of luggage dimensions sum, it would be more the frame’s. I keep hearing that Royal Jordanian is the worst airline to fly with and didn’t believe it till I experienced their customer service! Will not fly with them again.

### "dirty seats, no multimedia"
First time I travelled through this airline, aircraft are too small, dirty seats, no multimedia. And while returning from Istanbul they lost my luggage which I get after one day. The problem is their mismanagement at Jed airport, almost 30 passengers luggage was missed and there was no one at airport to log the complaints. We have to wait 3 hours to complete the process. And once luggage arrived at airport they didn’t even call me. I just roamed around at airport and luckily found my luggage.

### "will never fly with this airline again"
The worst airline, customer service, and experience ever. it's shameful how bad their customer service is. No response to our emails or calls. I had to pay for a whole new ticket on another airline to return back to Chicago. We were not able to get our money back because they would never offer anyone a refund. We will never fly with this airline again!

### "It’s the worst airline"
It’s the worst airline. I bought a return ticket from Dubai to Larnaca via Amman. There was a 3 hour delay in Amman, the food was terrible, the staff was rude and not providing any clarification for the delay. In addition, tv was not working on the first half of the route, and their was no tv on the second half of the route. Upon return from my trip, another 2 hour delay in Amman. Moreover, upon arrival to Dubai, my luggage was lost that Was not found till current date. This is a terrible airline.

### "they rescheduled my flight"
Detroit to Beirut via Amman. I've booked a ticket on Sep 4th from Detroit to Beirut through Amman and a stop layover of 4hr at Amman Airport. For no reason, they rescheduled my flight from Amman to Beirut and so the stop over is now 12 hrs instead of 4hrs. If I need to remodify the booking to have a shorter layover, they told me I need to pay an extra 250 USD for a fault that is not my own but because of this airline. And every time I complain that it is not my fault that the flight has change, the customer service would simply hung up on me unexpected. They hang up on me twice and I'm not flying through Royal Jordanian but though another airline. Thank you for losing a customer.

### "No one picks up the phone"
Amman to Dammam. Very bad. No one picks up the phone. I sent an email to customer service no one replied. I went to the Royal Jordanian agency in Khobar and the officer told me you are the fourth one this afternoon who didn’t receive his luggage and good luck if you’ll have it in 1 month. The airport officer sent them and email to find out wherever my luggage is and no one answered. I don’t recommend this people as they are unprofessional and not responsible at all. My worse experience ever that was the first and of course the last time I’ll use their service.

### "One of my worst airline experiences"
Return trip from London to Kuwait turned into a complete farce. Connecting flight in Amman was cancelled and new flight was announced as 24 hours later ! About 2 hour wait at the airport followed by another 3-4 hour wait at the Amman Airport Hotel (a 2 star facility at best) in the middle of the night to get a room key for room arranged by airline. Complete chaos at the hotel with no airline representative present and the airline had also ‘forgotten’ to provide vouchers before shipping passengers from 3 different cancelled flights to the hotel. Airline also stamped a very restrictive transit visa on everyone’s passport which forbade leaving the hotel or getting a different hotel on own expense. I qualified for a tourist visa on arrival but was not informed. I would have gladly paid for my own accommodation in a different hotel but was informed that I couldn’t leave - I was literally in a jail! Room was a shambles with no towels, dirty floors, broken furniture. Other flights cancelled too with families with children in poor state with not even water offered to them. One of my worst airline experiences in 40 years of air travel and my first and last time on this airline. I’m an Emerald (highest tier) member on One World and booked on RJ as they’re a One World airline. Does One World have any basic standards of membership ? Seems not. My sincere advice to everyone is to avoid this airline. Flight cancellations do occur but airlines don’t abandon and disrespect their passengers like this airline did.

### "beyond low cost airline"
Not Verified |  Royal Jordanian Airlines canceled and rescheduled our flight 3 times within 3 consecutive days, and every time they cancel, we just receive an email without any apology. The way they treat people is beyond low cost airline.

### "no luggage shipped for us"
Not Verified |  Not recommended, we are three persons flew from Istanbul to Amman with RJ with first class. When we arrived Amman there was no luggage shipped for us. On the return flight at the same class, no water or juice served.

### "Never seen a company so reckless, careless, useless and horrible"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst customer service in history! My luggage has been lost for over 5 days! I'm in another country without medicine and clothes - I've called every number provided to me and still no help and no luggage. One person told me that they think my luggage is in Chicago and hung up. What am I to do? The line is supposed to be 24 hours and yet I can only get a useless person at a certain time, otherwise they "experience system problems and can not process the call". Never seen a company so reckless, careless, useless and horrible - full of lazy and unknowledgeable personnel!

### "Nobody will respond or answer"
Not Verified | Amman to Cairo. I flew to Cairo on Royal Jordanian on 5/20/22 and never got one piece of luggage. The other piece arrived back in Charlotte on 6/17/22. I had to buy clothes in Cairo and have never gotten any response from the airline on how to file a claim for my missing luggage or obtain a statement for proof of loss and delay in getting bag. Nobody will respond or answer a phone.

### "worst airline I ever fly with"
This airline is the worst airline I ever fly with. The seats are close to each other so you can not sit unless your knees tough the the back of the seat front of you. when your knees tough the back of the seat front of you, the passenger will feel your knees in his/her back. I have to change my seat multiple time just to not touch the back of the seat front of me. It seems the seats has nothing to prevent any movement from the passenger sitting in your back. I hope this will be taking in consideration because I will never fly again with this airline. The food is very little and the crew member gives you less than half class of juice or coffee, I have to ask the crew member to please fill it up!! Staff are not friendly dealing with passengers, if you ask one of the crew, will not do what you ask unless you keep asking them and give them explanation ! Toilet is dirty and out of toilet paper.

### "the inflight service was horrible"
Not Verified |  Took Royal Jordanian to Amman Jordan. The flight itself was ok but the inflight service was horrible. There were so many ethnicity on both legs of my flight but that wasn’t taken into consideration when it comes to the meals that were served. They catered only to the Arabic passengers. Just my opinion. I went to and returned from Amman without eating anything but rolls. Very first flight I’ve been on and you can’t get cranberry juice. All the money paid for a flight and you get a half of a small cup of something to drink. Ground crew was ok both in Chicago and Amman. I’ll be returning to Amman pretty soon and obviously the price of the ticket will dictate which airline I’ll be flying on. If I have a choice it won’t be Riyal Jordanian.

### "What used to be excellent soft product has really worsened"
I have flown Royal Jordanian and its earlier version Alia for close to 40 years. It has always been reliable, safe and good value for money. Recently the business class has taken a bit of downgrade, first the good points - good connection in Amman, good airport, good aircraft, gracious cabin crew and great value for money. The minus points - no more champagne service and very odd meals mostly inedible, of four legs I took some had headphones, some not, some amenity kits, some not. What used to be excellent soft product has really worsened and the small tapas like food is awful.

### "Staff were extremely rude"
Horrible staff who basically have no service whatsoever. Staff were extremely rude. The aircraft was delayed for 3 hours. And we had to stay in a hotel in Amman until they found us a plane that had space for us. Amman airport is the first airport that I see take medication and throw it out. They don’t even talk to nice or try to explain why they’re doing that they just do it because they want to do it.

### "the carry on did not arrive"
Staff stopped my mom and took her carry on away to be checked in. They claimed the suitcase is bigger than what they allow. Staff were extremely rude and threatened that we have to pay $250. They assured us that the suitcase will arrive at the destination in Amman. After several hours of waiting to claim the luggage, the carry on did not arrive! We left the airport and came back to search for it again without any luck. They could not even trace the carry on that they took and asked us to follow up with their office in Chicago because they think the suitcase stayed in the storage unit at the airport. We followed up the next day to see if the luggage arrived at the next flight and still nothing. Calling the airline number at O'hare airport is a joke! We called over 20 times and nothing! Our luggage is still missing. We have a lot of valuable stuff of holiday gifts and most importantly my mom's medication.

### "never fly through this company"
We flew from Tel Aviv to Cairo via Amman. We arrived in Cairo, my wife's suitcase did not arrive. We filled out a form with all our details, and waited for someone to contact us. Of course it never happened. Every day, we made sure to contact the airline, via phone and emails, but no answer. They did not answer us, hang out the telephone after long time of waiting, and simply did not feel like working. For 12 days, we took care of buying new things, spent the trip initially at clothing and shoe stores, and paid about $900 for the new things. In any case, we returned to Israel. We tried to contact the airline again, suddenly they answer. Now the funniest part about it, they found the suitcase today and they offered us compensation of $70. Our recommendation is never fly through this company. Because if you're in a situation where you'll have to talk to someone, you'll never find anyone.

### "I did not receive any refund"
I was due to fly with Royal Jordanian on the 17th December 2021 to Frankfurt with a stopover in Amman, Jordan and return back to Abu Dhabi on 1st January 2022 via Amman. As I had booked the flight on Skyscanner, the booking was made via a third party website called Trip, which seemingly came across as a decent third party booking website. The problems began on 12th November when I received an email from Trip stating that Royal Jordanian had made schedule changes to my return flight and therefore would make it impossible for me to make my connection to Abu Dhabi. The change was only 15 minutes, however this gave me only 35 minutes to make my connection which I was informed is not allowed as per airline regulations as you are required to have at least 45 minutes between the two flights. I was directed by Trip via email to make a cancellation as this trip was now not possible and was assured me that I would receive a full refund as the changes were made by the airline and not by the passenger i.e. myself. I called the airline before I made the cancellation and their customer service team were firstly unaware that there were any issues about the returning connection, and when I did direct their attention to the issue they simply stated there is nothing they can do and I have to deal with the Third Party only. One of the customer service representatives of Royal Jordanian was arrogant enough to state why I was making problems and I should just change my return date! I reminded him that it is the passenger's choice about when he/she wishes to travel and if the airline has accepted payment for those dates then they are responsible of providing that service. After all this, I spoke with the Third Party company, Trip, who directed me to cancel my flight and that there will be no issues with the refund. Therefore on the 14th November 2021 the cancellation was made. Over 5 months have passed, and I did not receive any refund and now have been duly informed that "as per the fare rules" the ticket is completely non-refundable and I will not receive any money back, even though it was the airline that caused the cancellation! The customer service of Trip has been deplorable. They are only available via a phone number located in the UK, or email to which they barely respond to. They stated that they contacted me via email with all updates of which I have received none, with the last email sent on 24th December 2021 stating that the airline has rejected the refund. I called them back and they said the will escalate the issue again as it is not fair and they will try their best as I have a genuine case. This went on and on for another 4 months. Over the 5 months I contacted Royal Jordanian and they said they don't deal with refunds regarding bookings made by Third Parties. Trip kept assuring me that the refund will come and that they will "escalate" the issue and "try their best". Both parties in this situation have been culpable and have utilized poor business practices and customer service. It took them less than a minute to take my money and over 5 months to reject a valid refund. For anyone reading this review, I implore you to please avoid this airline and avoid the third party booking website; Trip. I have had a nightmare experience dealing with them and I am shocked at the fact that through no fault of my own, and due to changes made by the airline, I have lost over 400 Euros.

### "rude and unprofessional staff"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience with rude and unprofessional staff. I was traveling from Amman to Doha when they started to tell me that that there were missing papers and from there, they refused to cooperate at all. The papers “missing” were unnecessary and I can confirm this because the staff weren’t updated. They simply cancelled my flight without any valid reason. On top of all this, they refused to reschedule my flight and I simply lost all the fares paid. Upon arriving to Amman from Doha, the plane had no entertainment methods whatsoever. Moreover, upon reaching my turn, the attendant simply chose my meal for me because the food was all out. The chairs were ripped and torn, bathrooms were filthy without soap or tissues. Rarely anyone was wearing a mask and the chairs were jammed.

### "I was completely ignored by other personnel"
When I arrived at the Royal Jordanian check-in counter, I presented my Australian International Certificate of Vaccination form with a QR code. Note, this is anti forgery document issued by Health Ministry. The employee informed me that this document was insufficient to allow me to board the flight. I was told then to wait for the duty manager to provide assistance. I had to wait too long—believe me, it really is unpleasant when time is slipping through your fingers while watching other passengers boarding the plane. I was completely ignored by other personnel, some were sort of condescending and come across as unprofessional. Most passengers had boarded the plane during this time, I finally got to speak to duty manager, She was not aware of an important change in travel requirements. The duty manager was unfamiliar with recent changes in travel requirements. Despite all of that, I was prevented from boarding my flight after proving that I have fulfilled all the required international travel requirements relating to pandemic.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Terrible Experience, I almost missed my flight from JFK to Aman because they insisted I need a PCR. I explained that as long as I am fully vaccinated, Lebanon no longer requires a PCR. To my great distress, they refused to let me get on the flight. I had to ask for the manager to resolve the issue. If I didn’t have an existing reservation back to Cleveland, I would never step foot on Royal Jordanian ever again. The inflight entertainment was non-existent. All the movies were old. Avoid at all costs.

### "Royal Jordanian refused to reimburse me"
I am a US citizen, who had to pay for a ticket when leaving Baghdad on a recent trip even though I had a valid one issued previously. Around December 13th, a friend of mine who has US bank rewards miles secured for me a return ticket Detroit to Amman to Baghdad. The return was scheduled for January 13, 2022 flight RJ 811 Baghdad to Amman and from Amman to Detroit. I flew to Baghdad without incident, but upon my arrival, discovered that my father was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I knew I will not be able to return on January 13th. My friend in Detroit called the US visa bank reward program and told them I will not be able to return on January 13th. They told him they will cancel the return and asked him to call them again whenever I knew when I am returning. Around January 31st, 2022, I decided that I need to return to Detroit. My friend called the US visa reward program and they secured a new return ticket for me. The flights were confirmed with Seats 24C from Baghdad to Amman and Seat 31C for the flight from Amman to Detroit. My friend in Detroit paid some fee to secure this new ticket in lieu of the cancelled one. I called Royal Jordanian office in Baghdad to confirm and to see if I need to visit them. They said I do not need to do anything as the reference is enough. On the day of my return, February 7th 2022, I arrived at Baghdad airport, and was told by the Jordanian airline ticket counter that I need to have a ticket and that the records do not show any valid for me. I was kept for two hours at Baghdad airport at the Royal Jordanian ticket counter. I asked them to call the main office in Baghdad, but they said they could not. I had the documents from Detroit re-sent to me for me to show them that the print out showed confirmed status, but to no avail. I was told I need to return to my parents home in Baghdad and to arrange another flight. But, that was extremely difficult for me. I had already packed my luggage, and made the arrangement to travel, had my Covid test done and could not wait another week for the other flight. Finally, I paid $855 for a new ticket. The counter person said he could not take credit card but it had to be in cash. I was not given any receipt. To avoid further hassle, I paid the cash and ended up getting a new ticket which I used to fly to Detroit. I was not given a receipt and could not afford to argue as I needed to return to my home in Detroit. Royal Jordanian in the US refused to reimburse me. Those traveling overseas using Royal Jordanian should be very careful.

### "very rude towards guests"
This review is for the 11:20 flight RJ111 from Amman to London Heathrow on 10 Feb 2022. The lady at the boarding gate for the economy line was very rude towards guests. She needs retraining on her on how to interact with customers politely.

### "I've been waiting close to 24 hours now "
My worst airline experience in over 30 years of flying regularly. There were no toll free international numbers to call to be found. Wait times calling to make a meal request were long and the calls kept dropping. I called later to change my flight dates. The flight number and time I was given ended up being different than the one they booked me for so I unintentionally missed my flight. Even though the confirmation of the change sent to me confirmed my claim I was disregarded and told I'd have to pay a no-show fee. I spent four hours in the airport trying to change my flight which they had me call the service center that again kept dropping calls with no call back after long waits. The airlines reported the flights I would normally be rebooked on were cancelled so I'd have to wait another 1-2 days to get out. Meanwhile saying they couldn't confirm a change and I'd have to call the next day which I did and the same process repeated itself. After 8+ hours invested in trying to get a flight I still do not know when I'm flying out. The airlines keeps telling me to call back, that they are waiting to find out how much no show fees are before they can confirm if I'm on a flight tonight. I've been waiting close to 24 hours now just to find out what the fees are so the flight can be confirmed. The flight is in a matter of hours and I still don't know the status. Each attendant has told me something different. I received an email confirming I'm on the flight tonight but the service center says I'm not and will not connect me with the department that sent the email. Bearing in mind, I showed up for the flight I understood I was scheduled for and had an email to prove it. I've spent a lot of money on international calls and still no resolution.

### "The worst airline ever!
The worst airline ever. It is sad to write this review about my country’s airline, but honestly I had 4 bad experiences with them, the last one was that they didn’t even provide me with solutions after cancelling the already planned trip and wanted me to pay more for rescheduling in different not convenient dates. The service in the cabin was good before 2020, after that everything is bad, even the main meal is bad. They charge a lot of money but they provide no service. I changed all my trips to Lufthansa and Austrian with a better prices and possibilities. Please think twice before booking with them!

### "simply canceled the flight last minute"
They simply canceled the flight last minute and I have my own 1 year child we were left at airport for 10 hours. No customer support, no apology. Avoid in all cases, don't ever use this airline.

### "nobody was there to help her with wheelchair"
Not Verified | My mother who is 73 years old who needed a wheel chair and we booked a wheel chair. Her flight was on 27th January 2022 and she was supposed to travel from Detroit to Jordan. When she reached Detroit airport, nobody was there to help her with wheelchair in both the destinations. She struggles with language as she is not able to talk in any other language. Being a 73 years old suffering alone is a rubbish service as she was not able to walk and breathing abnormally. What ls the point to book a ticket with wheelchair if nobody is there to help. I have never seen worse flight service than this.

### "Overall it was a good experience"
Flew from Heathrow to Doha via Amman on 18th December. Arrived at Heathrow 4 hours before the flight. Smooth Check-in process. They only checked PCR and didn’t care about the Qatar Entry Requirements. The aircraft was clean & the the seat was comfortable. They locked our TVs until take-off but not much of a problem. It was a 4 hour flight to Amman, which went smoothly and the food was good, not great. We had a 30 minute transit in Amman, Which was extremely bad. The staff were rude and extremely impolite. They had no regard that our gate was about to close. Our next flight to Doha onboard RJ’s A319. They had a great alternative to an onboard IFE, using your own device to play their IFE system. A 1 hr 55 min flight and we landed in Doha on time. Overall it was a good experience. Not as good as Qatar Airways but better than Turkish. I flew with them on the way back. Both flights were A319s so significantly worse experience. But still OK. The ticket price was quite high though.

### "last time we fly with Royal Jordanian"
Today me and my Mother travelled onboard flight RJ 268 from Montreal to Amman as a transit point to Cairo. Upon our checking in at the airport, we were told by the counter check in agent that we require a PCR test. On their website it's written that transit passengers do not require it, as well Egypt as final destination doesn't require it. They stalled us at the airport and made us go get tested for a cost of 300 dollars. The manager was very rude to us and didn't bother to explain. This is last time we fly with Royal Jordanian.

### "claimed that I did not show them the email"
I have arranged my Round trip ticket with RJ to USA stopping over at Chicago and back to UAE. When I reached Chicago on the way back the ground staff in ORD wouldn't allow me on the flight blaming it on the PCR test and they asked questions about the email that I have received. The Lady on the counter (R.M) and her manager walked to the room behind the counter acting that they were trying to solve my problem, but it seemed like it’s a well-rehearsed drama. during that time, I called RJ call center in which the gentleman on the other side of the call told me that it’s a full flight and they will not be able to provide me an alternative flight until 27th of Dec. Soon after the manager and her employee walked out from the back room trying to apologies for the situation. I asked since its their mistake if they could offer a hotel at least and arrange a flight for the following day. They rejected and claimed that I did not show them the email of the PCR (in which I did) and it was my fault, and they are not able to provide me a flight for the following day.

### "aircraft are dirty and uncomfortable"
This airline does not provide any type of update for passengers on upcoming flights as other airlines do not even a reminder of your flight or the option to do online check in. The website is so bad and provides the very bare minimum in terms of flight information. The aircraft are dirty and uncomfortable, and there were lots of passengers that took their mask off during the entire flight without repercussion. The food was gas station quality at best and I was stuck with a broken screen during the second half of an almost 18 hour journey. The staff were nice, but they have little to work with.

### "refused to do refund"
Not Verified | Rj cancelled my flight and refused to do refund and provided only one option to use a voucher which I accepted (there were no mention that vouchers are non refundable ) few months later I wanted to use the voucher but there were no RJ trips from Sydney to Cairo (which is the original trip ) then I asked for refund and here comes the problem, they started sending me to different departments and ignoring my refund request then I waited for sometime and tried to book again but still no flights. I when I complained again that all other airlines now have flights on those routes I got a response to call customer service and when calling customer service they tells no flights and you can email customer care, email customer care and they point you to customer service really bad experience. One positive note that all customer service employees were personable but not helpful.

### "greatly disappointed"
Cairo to Doha via Amman. I was greatly disappointed with the rude, unprofessional approach of the staff. I politely asked a staff who has issues the Boarding pass to me, that I need a permission to say goodbye to my wife. The staff rudely replied to me that ‘give me your boarding pass and I will cancel your flight’ . Through the flight, I thought I was the only customer who experienced such rudeness. At Amman, they delayed a flight, changed the one gate to another and the customers are angry and screaming to manifest their anger. By the way, the gate to board is not mentioned on the Boarding pass, you have to check on the screen by yourself. A worse experience, I will never book Royal Jordanian Airlines.

### "had to ask for anything/everything"
Not Verified |  Rude staff, minimal attention, had to ask for anything/everything, ran out of food, poor for entertainment - old movies, and almost had to demand cocktails. If this trip wasn't paid for w/AA airmiles, I would have been seriously annoyed. Even the seats reclined to a bed - you could feel the cross bars. This airline is only for those who have no other choice, shame on RJ! Suggest the official in charge take a British Airways trip and compare. RJ is the "Walmart" of the airline industry.

### "staff at check-in would not let him board"
My son and I took PCR tests on Thursday afternoon for a Saturday flight to Dubai from Chicago. His negative PCR result lacked a time of day. Mine did not. The RJ staff at check-in would not let him board despite the fact that this test would have been within 72 hours no matter what time the test was taken on Thursday. We were offered no compensation nor any explanation where the RJ or UAE rules require a time of day stamp on the PCR test. He was unable to come and we lost a few thousand dollars in a series of flights and other ticketed activities.

### "Royal Jordanian you are appalling"
Not Verified |  Booked Crown class LHR - BKK but got an email from Royal Jordanian advising the flights had been cancelled two months after booking them. Had to call the airline to get a refund as impossible to sort out online via their website. Useless member of staff answering calls who didn't even know the airline had ceased operations to Bangkok. Told I had to email refunds department to apply for a refund - why I had the apply for a refund when they cancelled the flight I don't know. A month later no refund and the fun began with numerous emails and calls needed to chase. Each call worse than the last, I was lied to, told to call the London office and finally told they would process the refund but deduct admin fee's first. They used utter blackmail on the refund, accept the admin fee or get nothing back. In short even though they cancelled the flight I never got a full refund back. Royal Jordanian you are appalling, no morals at all, rude staff and thoroughly backward. I will never book again with you or recommend anyone else to book with you.

### "sad about the bad experience"
Not Verified |  I was traveling from Amman to Los Angeles. This was not a direct flight and it was stopped in London. I was in the waiting lines for close to 2 hours. Luckily I was ahead of time. When I approached the counter, I was asked for my passport and my ticket. I was told that I need to get a Visa from London for Covid. I was trying to explain to the counter staff that I was just going to be in London just for the few hours in the airport and go on another flight from there to Los Angeles as a transit. He was confused and yelling at other workers, asking if I needed a visa for this transit. The process was unprofessional and un-respectable. I had only 25 minutes to get to the flight. I asked if there was any way he could help me out and told me to visit, Passenger locator form and register myself. The internet was very slow and I was being accused for having a poor travel agent since I had not filled out this form. I called the travel agency and they looked at the book and the manual and called Royal Jordanian and informed them that I didn't need to fill out the form for Covid. They said it was only for those planning on staying in London, not for a transit flight. This cost me $100 since I had to redo the form twice. At the end they told me I was right. One of the workers escorted me to the flight. I am surprised why all the workers have no idea what the difference between a transit passenger and a passenger visiting. I was under stress for two and a half hours, and finally when I approached the boarding area to the plane. They asked me about the visa AGAIN! There was not supposed to be an application for a transit passenger. When I sit down in the airplane, I asked for water. They told me they will get me a cup of water before the plane took off. I didn't see the flight attendant again for another 45 minutes. The staff scream to each other. There is no manager or any one who knows what they are doing. Even in London, I checked with American Airlines, and it took me five minutes with a boarding pass. They understood I was just a transit passenger. There is a big difference about the service between AA and RJ. I am very sad about the bad experience. Hopefully they fix things in the future.

### "not allowed to board the flight"
Not Verified |  Unethical staff. Very bad services, I have spend an hour on checked in. They keep asking my visa, I am Malaysia Passport holder which is electronically approved at Dubai airport and no need to be stamped. I worked in Dubai since early the year and i have showed my employment history. After an hour, they checked in my bag. At the departure, suddenly i was not allowed to board the flight because no return ticket… The staff insist me to buy a ticket to Malaysia? Why i need to do it since i worked at Dubai?! They scammed me to buy a ticket and prevent me from board in. They left me with me trying to retrieve back my bags.

### "Very bad staff at Istanbul"
Very bad staff at Istanbul, they didn't allow me to enter to the plane and I missed my flight. I have my visa on my phone and they told me need to take copy from that! 2 hours later I booked Turkish airline and I went to the Dubai with that visa which was on my phone.

### "I will avoid at any cost"
Not Verified |  Flying Business class to present work at Dubai Expo. My connection in Amman was short, I asked them at the transfer would you be able to load my bag. The answer was of course. They delayed my bag, no updates, I keep calling airport after every RJ flight arrives to Dubai, no luck. I am still stranded at the hotel with nothing. The strange part when I call them they keep in hold for 45 min the respond we will send your bag ASAP. I will avoid at any cost even if the alternative airlines has 3 connections.

### "very rude and disrespectful"
Staff were very rude and disrespectful, it was very bad experience. I was asking them some stuff in English language they was replying me in Arabic and I have no idea what they talking about. No screen on the plane, no USB charge, all USB charger was broken in Amman Airport.

### "I don't recommend it at all"
Not Verified |  This is my first time travelling with RJ and for sure my last, i called the flight attendee to help me with the chair because the head moved out totally and i couldn’t fix it. He said I'm coming and ignored me all the flight. And my booking was with a snack/ brunch and no one served any one anything. Royal Jordanian is the worst airline anyone can book. I don't recommend it at all.

### "Seats are too small"
Not Verified |  Seats are too small for a straight 12 hour flight. Food is not the best. Plane just looks outdated. It was definitely not the most comfortable flight I’ve been on just because there is no leg room and the person in front of me kept putting their seat all the way back, they were literally sleeping on my lap. Also no WIFI

### "staff went on to say that the card was fake"
Today my wife and and two sons 10 and 13 who are US citizens had the worst experience with Royal Jordanian Airlines. My wife and two boys were flying out of AMM to Sharm. As my family arrived to the ticket counter my wife presented the boys PCR tests and the CDC vaccine card showing that my wife had been vaccinated. The staff went on to say that the card was fake and that she can’t take it. My wife called me immediately and I called customer service and was told that their staff is wrong and the CDC card is good enough. Here are the rules from the RJ site going into Sharm . PCR test before travelling: - Either a negative PCR test result 72 hours prior arrival, except children less than 06 years- Or a certificate of vaccination provided to conduct a PCR test upon arrival at Sharm El.Sheikh with a cost of 30 USD Fully Vaccinated Passengers: Vaccinations certificates proving that full course of vaccination has been completed issued from the following countries are approved: (Australia, Bahrain, Canada, China, EU Countries, Japan, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Morocco, New Zealand, Oman, Qatar, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunis, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and USA). The vaccination certificate shall be in the Arabic or English language only and presented to airline personnel prior to boarding. My wife tried everything and was forced to stay behind and our boys went on with their Aunt leaving their mother behind. My wife then left the airport went and got her PCR test and was forced to purchase a one way ticket from a different airline to be able to go on her trip and meet with our boys and her sister. Once back At the counter it was different people helping her. My wife presented her passport and CDC card again just to see what they say and they looked at the card and issued het boarding pass. To my wife’s shock she said I was told I needed a PCR test and here it is and to her shock she was told we don’t need a PCR test from you or even need to see it because you already showed us your CDC card. It was obvious that the staff intended to prevent my wife from not leaving at the time and forced the separation of a mother and her 10 year old and 13 year old sons. My wife asked for a supervisor many times and kept getting the run around which is always thicker with the employees of RJ at Amman Airport. I tried calling the RJ offices and was on the phone for 45 min with a rep continued to give me the run around who refused to give me her last name or even transfer me to a supervisor!

### "I was fully reclined all throughout the flight"
Believe the reviews. Because I didn't. I thought how bad can it be, but it was so bad I can't describe. Incompetent ground staff, a 24 hour delay with no communication and wrong information all throughout. My flights were booked on top end airlines that codeshare with RJ, and my goodness, disaster at the airport both in Paris and in Amman. To top it up, my seat was exit seat, and broken, I was fully reclined all throughout the flight. It wouldn't sit upright, great safety for an exit seat.

### "never choose this airline again"
Not Verified |  I was surprised by what happened to me during my flight from Paris to Beirut, the first of which was the delay of take-off to Amman by two hours, which put us in the possibility of missing the flight from Amman to Beirut, and secondly, I was insulted at Amman Airport by one of the employees at the boarding gate as He arrested me without justification or explanation after I arrived at the plane 15 minutes before departure of the flight (because the first plane was delayed) and his reason was an error in the system which I was not responsible of since I already have my boarding pass. At the end, few minutes before the plane took off, his mood allowed him to leave me alone, and this made me feel insulted and nervous. I will never choose this airline again!

### "not recommend flying with them"
Not Verified | Very bad experience, they did not keep distance between passengers. They sold out the flight, I believe they measured the temperature of the passengers upon boarding the flight in an inaccurate way and the meal on flight was a cup of water a 150 ml juice. Inflight entertainment system did not work, the crew did not answer me when I requested them. In conclusion, very expensive flight for short airtime and a bad experience. Would not recommend flying with them.

### "Very bad experience"
Jeddah to Chicago via Amman. Very bad experience, the workers in this airline are not polite,they over charged me on the 2nd luggage. When I get to the airport I got charged $250 and no body to talk to. In their website it is 200$ but they make me pay 250$. Bad service in the grand and air, bad experience.

### "it is tired and frayed"
Flew Amman to Istanbul with Royal Jordanian Airlines. The business lounge has been upgraded. Now has decent food and coffee and clean toilets. The same cannot be said for the aircraft. Unfortunately, like a lot of their fleet now, it is tired and frayed. All TV screens were removed from the aircraft (the stem was there and exposed wires in the seat). See my photo. Appalling for the premium for business class that you pay. We were told to use RJ sky Connect app to use the entertainment system. Which might have been good had a usb charger been included in the seat.

### "Another bag has a large crack"
Tel Aviv to Chicago via Amman. The airline checked-in my 2 bags in Tel Aviv, and when I retrieved them in Chicago they were both badly damaged. One has a large dent pushed in on one side. Another bag has a large crack that has split the suitcase. Obviously it was massive force of some kind that caused this damage. I sent the pictures that I took immediately of the damage to the airline, but no response. I called them but there’s no answer. The way my baggage was handled by the airline is extremely shoddy and they need to compensate me to some degree. Both of the bags are relatively expensive and of good quality, and Royal Jordanian should at least acknowledge and communicate with me.

### "food wasn’t good"
Flew RJ BKK to HKG last year and now to KUL. Had a terrible check-in agent last time but a better lady now, although quite slow. Boarding procedure was so annoying as monitors showed “Final call” but the boarding hadn’t even started. Could have spent more time in lounge. I think I had the same fantastic FA last time, she is really great. The food wasn’t good but the same Chablis as last time was flowing with a big smile.

### "rude and unprofessional"
Amman to Dubai. As I landed to Amman airport  I had to run to be on time for my next fly, at first I came to the wrong gate because on the screen it wasn’t even shown this fly , so the employee of the airport,kindly show me the way where I need to go and it was totally different side of the airport and he informed me that the boarding is mostly closed. Finally I see my gate and the boarding don’t even start. I see in the scream delayed for 30 min, after 30 min still no information and again we see delay for 1.hour. In the end we get in, after 2 hours no explanation or apology i find my seat and there was no space very uncomfortable seats. A passenger In front of me put his seat back while the flight was about to take off not even one cabin Crew notice it. The staff was very rude and unprofessional, and very dirty toilet

### "Disgusting crew service"
Moscow to Amman. Disgusting crew service, I was with a small child and asked for warm water for the formula, instead, they brought me just cold water from a bottle. A lot of passengers pressed the call button several times, but no one came. instead, the flight attendants just sat and chatted behind the curtain. I had to go for drinks ourselves.

### "attendants are practically invisible"
The Boeing 787 is relatively new and the economy seats have great legroom. The food quality is decent and the time between meals is not too long. But don't board the flight super hungry as the food might not be enough. Inflight entertainment is decent and provides enough options to kill time on a long flight. Amman airport is modern and has so decent food options. Also the Petra lounge is very nice and doesn't get very crowded. If you have a tight connection they may hold the flight for you. Luggage made the connection. Amman airport is very poorly organized. There is a serious lack of professionalism. Upon arrival there is an initial security screening for connecting passengers. It looks as though this security station was shoved into a hallway without the architect's knowledge. The line is chaotic and nobody has thought to add ropes. They also don't communicate what is going on so most passengers are unsure of where to go or what to do. Also, passengers travelling to the US & Canada have to have their passports and visas checked before passing security. But when I was there one of the two agents working this counter abruptly left. Leaving about 100 passengers with tight connections in a panic. Nobody communicated anything about what was going on. For US & Canada flights there is yet another security station. And here too nobody has thought about adding ropes to organize the line up. Note this is the third line you have to wait in when connecting. Despite having not appropriately resourced the airport to handle large volumes, for some reason they schedule multiple US & Canada flights within 30 mins of each other. So the 800 or so passengers totally overwhelm the airport facilities during high season. The flight attendants are practically invisible when a meal is not being served. They just lounge in the galley at the back. You need to use the call button to get any service but they seem to resent you for disturbing them when you do so. There are long periods of time (up to 4 hours) between meals where no drinks are served. On most other long haul airlines the cabin crew will walk the aisles to pass around cups of water every few hours. It took almost two hours to remove the meal trays from the seats. They seem to keep the cabin quite war which makes the lack of water problem much more acute.

### "Ticket is among cheapest"
Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. The service is okay. Cabin is clean. Meal is good. Ticket is among cheapest. The Cabin crew is not so friendly.

### "TV screen is not working well"
My trip with my spouse and daughter from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. 2-hour flight with Royal Jordanian B787-8. The plane is a bit old and the TV screen is not working well. Aircrew with poor service and attitude. The worst is when they provide food. Normally they will ask to open the folding table or they will open for us then only serve the food but this airline they will only leave the food tray to our hand, even the folding table does not open yet. This the first airline I had such experience.

### "discomfort caused by 9-abreast 787 seating"
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. While a hot meal is served despite the 2-hour duration, Royal Jordanian Airlines does not offer a choice. What they do offeris real cutlery and a full bar. Legroom is generous on this aircraft, even though that doesn't really compensate for the discomfort caused by the 9-abreast Boeing 787 seating. On my seat, the touchscreen was malfunctioning and misreading touch inputs. This meant that even as I wasn't doing anything, the map view was constantly shifting around and settings were being changed all the time. Passengers on certain sectors can be insufferable. In this case, be prepared when you fly Royal Jordanian Airlines for passengers to incessantly and vociferously demand attention from the FAs (in some cases, interjecting while the FAs are about to or in the midst of serving you). I had to contend with this on both the outbound and inbound legs.

### "had the worst experience with them"
Amman to London. We had the worst experience with them. Very bad service. Me and my wife were put in seats apart. Very bad meals, never flying with them again. Personally I don’t recommend it.

### "I had a bad experience"
Chicago to Cairo via Amman. I had a bad experience very bad service and very bad customer service. When I booked my ticket there was no any information indicating that how many bags luggage you suppose to take. So I was under the impression of taking two bags. However, they only allowed for one bag and I had to pay $300 for the second one. It was rape off. This happened with a lot of other people. People were so made at this, and no body cares. In addition to the service and the food were not good at all. Not recommended.

### "No Customer Service"
My luggage was lost 8 Aug 19 from Chicago to Amman. No Customer Service in trying to locate and return it to me. It took me 7 weeks to get anyone at Royal Jordanian to answer any phone calls or emails. Their "Customer Service" phone system simply keeps looping you from 1 recorded message to another then hangs up on you!. At 2 months to the day, my luggage appears on my doorstep at home at 0300 while I am out on the road. At a little over 3 months to the day, along with more than 200 emails and phone attempts, they offer compensation of less than 20% of my incurred expenses having to deal with their incompetence.

### "airline with very bad service"
Amman to Cairo. I arrived in Cairo in nov 6 to find out my luggage was no where to be found. They made me fill out a form Where I needed to buy an Egyptian sim so they can call me. I emailed them the documents as instructed. Ever since then no one has replied to my calls or emails. My tour guide was able to get through somehow. They delivered me a bag but it was not mine But with my name. It’s been 5 days since I arrived and I have called them every day and emailed them continuously. Still no reply. I had to resort to commenting in their social media to get their attention and I finally got a reply and now they are replying but even then nothing has been escalated. Definitely an airline with very bad service I would not recommend.

### "Very bad experience"
Aqaba to Larnaca via Amman. Very bad experience with Royal Jordanian. I had my return flight canceled and I've never get a refund for that. Furthermore had to book another ticket with another company by my own! They never replied to my numerous email asking for help. I've never seen that. I don't recommend the company at all.

### "impossible to contact them"
Amman to Dubai in September 2019. I was served a chicken sandwich with brown guacamole in it. I ate the sandwich and later had terrible diarrhea for 5 days which may have been caused by this, and it ruined the remaining part of my trip. Royal Jordanian made it nearly impossible to contact them or send feedback directly.

### "attitude of hostesses was horrible"
Kuwait to Amman. Both flights were  on time. However, the attitude of the air hostesses was horrible and the food was even worse. One of the cabin crew, in the middle of safety audio, stopped demonstrating and went back to her seat while the audio was still playing. Simply put, the airline needs to recruit better people and give serious training before putting them on board. We booked Hindu non-vegetarian meals and were given croissants and a muffin without even being asked by the air hostess about special meal. They also do not offer water and the passengers have to literally snatch water cups from the food tray.

### "fly with another airline"
New York to Jeddah via Amman. The worst customer service via telephone and web I have ever experienced. Every phone call made to discuss the same concern on the flight received a different answer, finally American Express had to intervene to which they also experienced hardships. The staff over the phone is rude, unapologetic and outright careless. I will never fly this airline again. The flight experience wasn’t better. Very dated aircraft. A 6 hour delayed connection with no explanation while waiting for my connection. A lack luster lounge and again very poor customer service. Do yourself a favor and fly with another airline if you have a chance.

### "attempting to trace my lost luggage"
Today is 22 Sep 19 and I have been attempting to trace my lost luggage from RJ264 Chicago to Amman dated 8 Aug 19. My ticket was purchased through American Airlines as a OneWorld codeshare. American confirmed scanning the bag delivered to RJ264 before departure. After waiting at AMM baggage claim for the 1st 45 minutes after arrival, a baggage clerk confirmed that it was back there but still processing through security. At 1½ hour after arrival, the same baggage clerk said that now he could no longer find it back there anywhere. How could my bag have “disappeared” while processing through security and never be delivered to the baggage carousel? After filing my lost luggage claim at the AMM airport (along with several other 1st class pax), I have had had no response and no contact from Royal Jordanian airlines. I have attempted to call every phone number I can find listed for customer service and they are all just looped recordings that keep transferring to another message. In the last 6 weeks I have sent more than 12 emails through your WorldTracer system that they have failed to respond to. I have sent 7 emails now to your Royal Jordanian Head Office that have not been answered. Are they just assuming that if they ignore me long enough I will go away?

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Amman. Worst airline ever. I fly at least once a month to different destinations and this time I decided to fly with RJ. A few minutes before we were supposed to board our flight from JFK to Amman, the branch manager announced a delay in our flight without any details instead of allowing us to board the plane. Later on, it turned out that there was an issue with plane and the flight was delayed 5 hours. A few hours later they announced a 21 hours delay and as all passengers got frustrated, the manager announced that they are giving us a voucher to stay in a hotel for the night. They had all passengers picking up their bags. They lost my car seat and it took 3 hours for them to find it. After so many arguments, the shuttle to the hotel finally arrived with not enough space to accommodate all passengers and luggage. Then when we arrived at the hotel, there were no rooms to stay. They had to take us to another hotel Where we spent 2 hours until we finally had our room. The next day, our flight was supposed to leave at 7PM. We ended up boarding at 8:30 PM instead. Rude customer service and the manager did not handle the situation in a professional manner as she should. No answers and rude treatment for the passengers. Also at Amman airport, my bag went through bag check without announcement. I was waiting for more that 2 hours until I started asking around were my bag was. Someone told me that it was at bag check. Even though that they opened the bag at the check, the guy at the belt had opened it again to search causing another 30 minutes delay. Poor management and communication.

### "windows locked into darkness"
Not Verified |  Amman to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok. Service and food on my flight to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok was ok. I could stay in the airplane during fuelling, which was good. The only disturbing thing was the dimmable windows. They were just locked into darkness for the whole flight. There's a reason why I chose a window seat, so please let passengers enjoy the view, sunrise and sunset!

### "The staff is reckless"
Not Verified |  Amman to London. The staff is reckless when it comes to safety of passengers. When In the plane Near to me there was a woman with 2 kids. During take off one of the kids was sleeping on the floor without fasten seat belt. The staff walked near by us saw the child and did not encourage the mother to take safety measure and protect the child. I flew with my 5 members family. They didn’t put us together, they placed all the family all over the plane. I had to ask the crew staff at least to keep the 6 years old daughter with her mum which they were hardly able to do.

### "cabins were worn and torn"
Copenhagen to Dubai via Amman 18 Aug. 2019 on A320 and A321, respectively. Check In in CPH a breeze though the attendant was junior. Got my luggage tagged for next 4 legs on my journey. They also issued 4 Boarding Passes on the spot even the last 2 sectors was on another airline and on another ticket. Well done, though it took some time. Lounge used in CPH is a 3rd party lounge, the new Carlsberg Aviator Lounge, a crowded experience but somehow acceptable though only cold foods (smoerrebroed) from buffet. Lounge in Amman fits me well, open big space and long, open views to terminal and outside, just separated by an elevated glass fender. Food substandard, only a cold sandwich was served (on both legs). Not enough food and food quality very low. Personally I ordered Special Seafood Meal which was delivered on both legs. However, it was just a cold sandwich with some canned tuna fish inside. Drink service was fine and frequent, good flow, and decent wines. IFE did not work on any of the legs. First flight delayed 60 Minutes – this was announced well in advance and on airport monitors. Second flight delayed 90 Minutes and there was chaos at the gate as the flight was overbooked. The cabins were worn and torn, but the FA staff were good and polite. Call bells answered. Airbridge embarking and disembarking.

### "fight broke out during the flight"
Amman to New York JFK. Violence on aircraft during flight, aircraft was not in the greatest condition, seat was uncomfortable it would have been better if not for the fact that a big fight broke out during the flight and crew did not really deal with it properly. Would not be my first choice.

### "need to improve flight hardware"
Tried for my first time this airline 1 August 2019 from Dubai to Copenhagen via Amman. Both aircraft were on older, worn but fairly clean A320 machines. No IFE apart from flight trip map displayed on shared monitor in front of cabin sections. Individual screens were installed but not activated. Trip went well and flights on time. Onboard, food was mediocre and no hot food were offered, only sandwiches, cakes, and drinks. They served a good red wine: Jordanian River (Shiraz 2018). Seat spacious. Ticket not cheap. Best part were the good lounges in Dubai (Ahlan lounge T1) and in Amman (Crown lounge). They were both splendid. However, lounge access was not granted from my ticket but from my elite status on another airline in Oneworld (Qatar Airways). I had a missing luggage issue from previous flight on which I was well informed while onboard prior to departure from Amman. Amman is a small and cozy airport. It could be a very good airline but need to improve flight hardware, cabin tidiness, food quality, and increase options, and include hot meals. Missing IFE also becomes an issue for the last flight which lasted almost 5 hours.

### "service is not their priority"
Chicago to Tel Aviv via Amman. I am a paraplegic and had a trip out of the country on June 2. Royal Jordanian Airline misplaced my wheelchair on the way flying to my destination which was in Jerusalem on June 3. I had filed a lost and found claim when I was at the Tel Aviv Airport. The last time I had my wheelchair was in Chicago. When I landed in Amman to connect flight to Tel Aviv they told me they will ship my wheelchair to Tel Aviv, but when I landed in Tel Aviv they said they never received my wheelchair. Either my wheelchair in Amman or Tel Aviv. Neither Royal Jordanian in Amman nor Royal Jordanian in Tel Aviv want to take responsibility for it. They blamed on each other. When I talked to Royal Jordanian baggage tracing department and gave them my file reference claim number, they told me they had shipped my wheelchair to Tel Aviv, but Tel Aviv said they never received my wheelchair. The lady flown on the same flight with me lost her walker. After brutal one and a half months they emailed me that they found it and it was in Amman. Their customer service is not their top priority. Their phone service need a major upgrade. I had to yelled in order for the representative to hear me clearly. If you have disabilities, please pay a little bit more to fly an Airline with professional staff. All their departments are unprofessional.

### "They never even said sorry"
My son and I were flying RJ 733 to Amman from Riyadh on the 27th June to attend a colleagues' wedding scheduled at 9PM on 27th June 2019. Flight original timing was 12:20PM and changed to 14:10 hours. This change was announced on the previous day itself (26th June 2019). This means that the airlines had enough time or advance notification that there was some problem with that particular flight. When we checked in on 27th, the counter did not say there was any further delay. There was never any announcement but the display board showed a departure time of 4PM, after the original time of 2PM had lapsed. When passengers started to line up and waited in the queue for over 30 minutes, the person at the gate started saying "please go and take a seat" the flight is delayed as it is "too hot" and needs to cool down. All these conversations were happening in Arabic, and I am explaining what I understood. Then later (picture attached)the display board was still showing a departure time of 19:10 hours although the time was already 19:54 hours. The airline made no effort to announce any delays or provide food or any other amenities to the passengers. The flight finally left at 9PM after a delay of 7 hours. This is unacceptable from a flagship airline from Jordan. They never even said sorry, which is appalling behavior! We missed the wedding.

### "there was smoking on the plane"
Tel Aviv to Amman. We had a short flight to connect to Amman to connect to Heathrow to connect to LAX to Fly home. Food was not an issue, but there was smoking on the plane. Stewardess spent the entire time on her cell phone texting , even when announcement had been made to put electronics away. She never once looked up for her phone.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Cairo to Tel Aviv via Amman. Terrible experience, 4 hours delay, makes us lose a connection and changing from 50 mins to 6 hours of connection. IFE does not work. Good meal. Nt compensation.

### "fine for the price"
Not Verified |  New York to Amman on Boeing 787. The cabin crew were nice and were pretty friendly. The food was my concern - for breakfast we had bread and a little container of jam and orange juice served at the end of our 11 hour flight. The seat comfort was ok and it was fine for the price. The entertainment was  good.

### "about 40% lower than average price"
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Amman. Surprisingly nice experience. Both legs leaving about 20 minutes late and arrived on time. Biz seat on the A321 very comfortable and sufficient for the 4 hours 30 minutes leg. Also the flat seat on the 787 was comfortable and I was able to sleep 6 hours. Food was served plenty and good. Not on restaurant level, but good. A pity they do not serve from the food trolley anymore. On the second leg leaving after 2 am, a snack plate (Arabian Mezze) was served. Many others writing here were disappointed with that late night snack, only. I liked its taste and how fast the service was over, so the cabin went silent and everybody sleeping. But they should change their website concerning Crown Class dining, on which they promise on medium to long haul flights 4 course meals, which is on that route not correct! The Thai staff on the second leg was very skilled and well trained, the Jordanian staff were less organized and friendly. So a good but not great experience. But I got in a sales a special, about 40% lower than the average price for that route and season. At the standard pricing there are plenty competitors with a better Biz class. I would book and fly them again if I could get an equally good offer.

### "do not pay attention to customers"
Chicago to Larnaca via Amman. First time I have flown with Royal Jordanian Airlines and I'm sure is the last time. Me and my family we went to US with an overnight stay in Amman because they had only one flight per day from Amman to Larnaca. We stayed in the airport hotel which was supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Instead is a -4star hotel. Very dirty. We complained to the airline and they promised on the way back that things will be different. Absolutely nonsense. Exactly the same thing . They do not pay any attention to their customers complains even if you send pictures and make a formal written complain. Nobody cares.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
London Heathrow to Amman with Royal Jordanian Airlines. I am dismayed that despite arriving early to the airport that we could not select our seats and as I explained I did not want to be seated over the wing, in front or behind was fine. I was then lied to by a member of the check in staff who said row 17 was in front of the wing. This was a blatant lie and I am very unhappy about being seated in this position. I don’t understand when we arrived so early why we couldn’t have a seat of choice.

### "don't expect friendliness"
Bangkok to Amman. Ok seat. Limited in-flight entertainment. Poor food. Staff (both ground staff and cabin crew) met basic expectations, but don't expect friendliness or decent service.

### "cabin staff was quite good"
I loved my Royal Jordanian experience on the leg from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok (before the aircraft went on to Amman.) I bid for an upgrade to business class and the bid was accepted. The cabin was particularly empty that night so I was able to get an entire row to myself, I chose a window seat. The ticket and gate staff were contracted out in Malaysia, and it was obvious that they had only minimal interest in keeping you happy. They were efficient, but clearly not invested in their work. The cabin staff was quite good, though, and earn high marks in service. A light snack was served with full china and cloth table covers, and drinks were free flowing. The entertainment screen was massive, and the selection was huge. The noise reducing headsets were of good quality, and come with sanitary covers so you know they're clean. The outlets worked, the space was well thought out, and I wish the flight had been a little longer. Two hours wasn't enough to really experience all the options. My only complaint was that the bar area in the back of business class (where snacks and drinks are normally on offer) wasn't stocked for this short flight. It would've been a nice touch.

### "was a very pleasant flight"
Hong Kong to Bangkok. Aside from the late scheduled departure ( 1:35) and arrival (00:30 Hong Kong) times, this was a very pleasant flight. Check-in was handled efficiently. I was given a lounge invitation for the Priority Pass lounge at HKG, but I had my heart set on visiting the QANTAS lounge instead since both airlines are One World partners. This worked out perfectly. We were about 20 minutes late in boarding and with push-back, but there is enough cushion in the schedule so that we arrived in BKK on-time. Service onboard was friendly and attentive. We were served a modest snack, but I wish I had known that the meal service would be frugal, so that I could have indulged myself more generously in the lounge. I had communicated a special request to RJ customer service, and they responded positively and courteously. My first row window seat was comfortable, but obviously there was not a lot to watch at that hour. The adjacent seat was unoccupied, which always contributes to comfort. I really enjoyed the boarding video which presented scenes of Jordanian landscape and culture, but during the flight, I only watched the in-flight map. In sum, this was a good experience, and I certainly would fly with Royal Jordanian again if the opportunity arose.

### "will not hesitate to cancel empty flights"
Royal Jordanian advertises about 5 flights a day between Amman and Cairo. However on both my outbound and inbound flight RJ cancelled the flight I purchased and put me on a later flight (9 hours delay outbound, 3 hours delay inbound) without explanation or compensation. The company clearly does not intend to operate flights as scheduled and will not hesitate to cancel empty flights to cut losses, at the expense of the passenger. Completely unreliable. Do not use.

### "Amman Airport staff was terrible"
Bangkok to Cairo via Amman. Check in counter does not count scuba equipment bag as free allowance as described on their website. Seat and plane is quite good. 1 big meal and 1 small meal (Sandwiches) for long flight (8-hour flight from Bangkok to Amman) and 1 small meal for short flight. (Amman to Cairo). It would be recommended if you do not need to go Amman Airport as staff was terrible there.

### "we do not know how to get home"
Tel Aviv to Amman via Copenhagen with Royal Jordanian Airlines. We did not get any information regarding the delayed flight, we had to look it up online ourselves. The information provided of the lady in the check-in was rude and not at all polite. She talked to us like we should know everything ourselves. The flight was 3 hours delayed and she didn't provide us with a connecting flight to Copenhagen. So at the moment, we do not know how to get home. It is the worst service I have ever received from an flight company.

### "I enjoyed my flight"
Trip from Moscow to Aqaba via Amman and back. I enjoyed my flight with Royal Jordanian. Although ground service was a bit hectic, it was friendly and efficient. The planes were not particularly new, but the seats were very comfortable. The food served onboard was delicious, cabin crew was very nice and performed their job professionally. All flights were on time. Our connection in Amman on the way back was very short, that is why one piece of our luggage was left in Amman, but it was quickly found and sent back to us with the next flight and delivered home.

### "incompetence and lack of care"
Amman to London. My one and only time I will travel with this awful airline. What a misfortune to travel by this airline who in this day and age still prefers to treat its customers with the utmost rudeness you can imagine. No courtesy, smile, welcome, plain indifference topped up with total incompetence and lack of care. Still living in the dark ages. Please take note and avoid.

### "been so frustrated"
Worst customer service I have ever experienced. My husband’s luggage was lost 6 weeks ago. I understand that this can happen, but the problem is the appalling lack of customer service following this event. We have sent over 18 emails and made more than 20 phone calls, but get limited to no reply and still have not even been able to get a link to or a compensation form to fill in for compensation. I have never been so frustrated or experienced such poor service. I will never again fly with Royal Jordanian Airlines.

### "Service rushed and not very attentive"
Well yes, they were 26 minutes late arriving at Zurich, but we also arrived just 26 minutes late at Amman airport, which is comparably small, easy and fast to navigate. We had just 8 minutes from plane to plane. Flights themselves uneventful, seated in row 8. Standard Recaro seats with personal screens and a better that nowadays pitch. Comfortable. Entertainment system not very responsive and remote control not very intuitiv at first, but you will manage. Food served in boxes with not really healthy options. This is less important, because you always have the option to buy lunch/dinner at the airports and bring it onboard. Service rushed and not very attentive. We got twice actually not really what we have ordered or only the half. Only on service on these 4.5 and 2.5 hours legs. But we brought drinks with us too. - As the tickets for two was the same price as one ticket with the cheapest competitor, quite a fair deal.

### "Insufficient cabin service"
Amman to Sulaimaniyah. Insufficient cabin service, the food was rubbish it included 3 items which were unhealthy cakes and sugary juice. The Airline office told me that they checked in for me to a seat close to my dad who purchased business class, but when we went to the airport we found out that it wasn’t like that. The seats were an absolute discomfort.

### "Good, competent performance"
London to Amman (and return) B787 Economy Good, competent performance by RJ. On time departure and arrival both legs. Catering as good as one might expect in economy. IFE limited but manageable. Sound quality a bit of a struggle. Boarding pass control at gate at AMM a bit clunky - long wait for economy while business / frequent flyer line sat empty and didn't respond until prompted.

### "well behind other carriers"
Flew Royal Jordanian crown class for the first time from Bangkok to Chicago via Amman. Overall a fair experience. The plane was clean and seats reclined fully but service was very mediocre and the food choices were more like what you would get in coach. The wines were of poor quality and the service was unattentive. After the food was served the attendants spent most of their time behind the curtain and if you wanted anything you would need to hit your button. The configuration of cabin is 2-2-2 and thus if you are in the window you have to crawl over your seatmate to get access to the bathroom. The first row has much more foot room then the other rows and I found it more comfortable on my second leg of the trip as I was in the second row on the first leg. The lounge in Amman is also fairly sparse in terms of food, drink and cleanliness. In contrast I flew Qatar Airways outbound which was fabulous. Overall this was the worst business class international flight I have been on. Additionally the IFE was of poor video quality and very limited western choices. I would certainly look to another airlines if possible as Royal Jordanian is well behind other carriers in the business class offering.

### "half the price of Emirates"
Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. I have had the pleasure to fly RJ on a number of occasions. I have flown on each occasion except one in business class and have been impressed by the professionalism and charm of the cabin crew. On the Asian regional services they use Thai based female crew who are terrific. The male Jordanian flight attendants are surly. It is a middle eastern guy thing but they are fine. RJ get bad reviews for economy class and my only time flying in economy was some 7 years ago on a regional flight which was 80% empty and the guys serving in the back were terrific bringing me champagne from Business Class in little bottles and one of them threw one of the bottles across the mainly empty cabin to his colleague who caught it which was met by both attendants laughing! I am not quite sure this would happen on Emirates or BA but the guys and the champagne were great. I think the service has likely tightened up since then. It is a 3 star airline and half the price of Emirates. The seats in Business are tight and the cabin is dated with no single seating but it is good value for money with quality food and drinks. There was one flight where the safety announcement continued being played as the plane took off on a night flight and the lights were not dimmed until after the announcement concluded and the plane was in the sky. Ground service in Bangkok is outsourced and the staff are disinterested. In Kuala Lumpur they were abrupt, work for Malaysia Airlines and their manner is bad.

### "do not fly with Royal Jordanian"
Madrid to Beirut via Amman. Do not fly with Royal Jordanian. This company used to be good. But it is going downhill. Their delays are so frequent that it is always the same scene in Amman Queen Alia Airport: RJ employees rushing customers from connecting flights. I traveled with them back in December 2018 to Spain and returned in January 2019. The departure flight was the worst flight experience of my life. Everything bad that could have happened did happen (except for a plane crash, luckily). Our flight started in Beirut, then Amman and Madrid. Due to fog in Amman airport, the airplane was delayed and delayed and delayed. Now, a respected airline could have canceled and told the passengers go home. But RJ took off and then we were stuck in the air hovering over Amman for hours. Had they acted differently, they should have rerouted those passengers destined to far away destinations and ask those who can wait for the following day to go home and sleep. So after hovering in the air for hours, they were running out of fuel and unable to land in Amman they went to Aqaba airport. Passengers were stuck in the aircraft, it was hot and we were not offered any clear answer. The staff was in complete disarray. The passengers were nagging, children were crying and the crew could not offer any clear answer. Empty looks in their eyes revealed how clueless they were. After over 3 hours wait, the plane went to Amman. We needed a new boarding pass so we can resume our flights to our final destination and enter a new wave of utter chaos, yelling, pushing, screaming, and more for over 3 hours. For the hundreds of passengers, RJ decided to put only 2 ticketing employees to solve our woes! Needless to say what a complete chaos it was. As our flight to Madrid took off, we had to stay in so RJ offered us a night stay at their Airport hotel. Again the experience was horrible. We had to wait over an hour for the employees to take us to the hotel. By then we were just exhausted and ready to sleep. The flight to Madrid goes according to plan, luckily, although with some minor delay, after all, it's not RJ is there's no delay! We arrive in Madrid, but our luggage didn't! We talk to the crew telling them about the total lack of professionalism and so on. We report the missing luggage in the hope that they will be shipped to us. Two days later, nothing arrives even though the RJ office in Amman confirmed that the luggage was shipped the day after our arrival. We call RJ office in Amman, no one answers. So we went to the airport to see if we manage to recover our suitcases. To make the story short we had to run through two terminals (T4 and T2) to get back our suitcases. On the return flight, the flight from Amman to Beirut was delayed for 4 hours with no explanation. In summary, do not, I repeat, do not fly with Royal Jordanian, even if their tickets seem fairly priced, you will pay for it by delays, lack of professionalism by their ground crews and more.

### "Flight time changed"
Amman to Jeddah. Flight time changed without enough prior notice and the airlines kept changing the flight time many times and every time flight got delayed for 30 - 45 minutes. This is not the first time, I used to have the same with earlier flights as well.

### "food onboard is basically sandwich"
Kuala Lumpur to Amman. Small seats, food onboard is basically sandwich, sandwich, sandwich topped with a bun and piece of bread. On the flight Kuala Lumpur - (Bangkok a 40 min stop without getting out) - Amman, online check in sat me in middle row, that is not changeable. On the counter was one of first after opening, changing seat not possible to any better - baggage drop is available just 3h before flight, so had to wait before immigration, and food courts - unfortunately taking into account majority of passengers traveling to and from Amman, cabin crew couldn't control the mess on board. Spend more and take something more adequate.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Cairo to Montreal via Amman, everything was perfect, friendly cabin crew, flights were all online, food was great, comfortable seats, highly recommended.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. Paid for an upgrade to Crown Class. Three hours prior to departure the flight was cancelled. By this time I was already waiting in the Business Class lounge. The lounge staff very kindly arranged for me to be moved onto a Malaysia Airlines flight at the same time. I was placed in economy class and not reimbursed for the paid upgrade. I will pursue the refund with the airline, in due course. I cannot praise Malaysian Airlines more highly. They were put in a very difficult position, at short notice, by Royal Jordanian Airlines and dealt with the situation magnificently. I shall fly with Malaysian Airlines next time. I will not choose to fly with Royal Jordanian Airlines again.

### "attendants were not straight forward"
The staff who work for this airline are awefully rude. Our flight was delayed for 10+ hours with no further information given. We were supposed to leave from Chicago to Jordan to our final destination. Our flight got delayed for 12 hours from Chicago to Jordan. We asked multiple times for information about our next flight from Jordan to Cairo. The attendants were not straight forward to inform us that there were no flights the day we would arrive leaving us up in the air. At first, they said when we arrive to Jordan the passes to Cairo would be first come first serve. Then, informed us that we may or may not catch the morning flight. All the information provided was very confused and not straight forward. I do not accept the treatment and tone of voice used to inform the passengers. One of the attendants started making jokes and comments when my mom got furious at her way of speaking. I do not appreciate the way they treat their passengers and you must modify how to plan your flights and run on time. Unbelievable.

### "staff lacked customer service"
Chicago to Amman. I flew from MSP to Chicago on American Airlines. The flight was on time and staff was great. My fight from Chicago to Amman, then Amman to Cairo is on Royal Jordanian Airlines. The flight from Chicago to Amman is scheduled to leave at 1:20 pm. I arrived to Chicago at 11:00 AM so I said that is a reasonable transit time. I went to the designated gate (M11) to find from people who are there that the flight is delayed to 3 pm, then 7 PM, then 8 pm although the moniters still say 1:20 pm. I did not get any communication from Royal Jordanian Airlines regarding the delay. I decided to go to their counter outside to understand what is going on and see if they can get me a hotel room or a voucher to first class lounge since the delay is so long. There was no apology from the agent and she was frustrated and overwhelmed. I addressed her with a very quite and calm tone. All she offered was $15 voucher for a meal. I asked to speak to a supervisor. He took about 15 minutes to come from his office (behind the counter). He did not offer any sympathy or apology for the inconvenience. He asked me if I am concerned about the amount they are offering. The manager / supervisor even lied to me saying that first class lounge is not taking any more people as they are full. I went by their door after my conversation with him and saw tens of people getting in. I have been flying from the US to Egypt for the past 20 years. This is my first time to fly Royal Jordanian and it will be the last. They will be wasting about 1 day out of my vacation as I will be missing my flight from Amman to Cairo and will have to wait for hours or possibly the second day. I just wanted to share my experience with Royal Jordanian Airlines as I felt that their staff lacked customer service.

### "seats were a little cramped"
Check in agent was quite terrible, no hello, no smile and really slow. The boarding was pretty smooth and the cabin looked clean. The seats were a little cramped for business class and fortunately it wasn’t a longer night flight. The food was a spicy Thai style curry which was lovely. Good Chablis served and topped up without asking by a friendly FA. Overall a nice flight despite a not so nice start.

### "service was generally good"
Flying New York to Amman means one gets access to American Airlines' excellent Flagship Lounge, which is, in my opinion, the best lounge by an American carrier (it is certainly much better than RJ's own Crown Lounge in Amman). Boarding was, however, chaotic as I had no idea when and which line business class passengers were supposed to board. Cabin service was generally good with a pleasant crew. Food were fine, and I particularly liked the way RJ served main courses on a trolley cart so I could view and picked my dish. Cabin had a 2-2-2 arrangement, so window seats did not have direct aisle access, and seat storage was limited. I had a bulkhead seat, which provided roomier footwell than others. The 787 was quiet and comfortable. RJ had its own priority immigration line for business class passengers upon arrival at Amman airport, which was a big plus.

### "lacking customer service"
Chicago to Amman. The flight attendants need training. They are rude and are not helpful at all in terms of performing their routine duties. Royal Jordanian Airlines seems to be lacking customer service.

### "food was all bread"
Abu Dhabi to Paris return via Amman. The flight was okay, the ground staff at cdg while checking in at the counter was no knowledge at all about my extra luggage. Inflight food was all bread in the box. Inflight entertainment was outdated, the crew on the flight from Amman to Abu Dhabi was poor.

### "Worst timing ever"
Amman to Cairo. Worst timing ever encountered. The flights from Amman to Cairo and from Cairo to Amman both were late for one hour which I didnt experience on any airline since 2011 that both flights delayed. One of the best airports with the strongest wifi ever.

### "Service was basic"
Amman to Berlin. Transit at AMM was quick in a crowded but nice terminal with lots of shopping and food outlets. Service was basic on this full flight. Flight attendant was friendly. Food was below par for business class. Seat was comfortable.

### "Expected more from RJ"
Beirut to Amman. Short flight with basic services. Food was nothing to write home about, a definite downturn compared to previous flights. Flight attendants were not very friendly! Aircraft didn't seem new nor felt fresh. Flight was delayed with lots of confusing emails and announcements. Expected more from RJ but didn't get it.

### "attendant went straight to sleep"
Berlin to Abu Dhabi via Amman. I was a bit reluctant flying RJ after reading a lot of negative reviews, but I gave it a try since I am a One World Platinum member and RJ is a member of the alliance. There was no separate boarding line for business or Premium Alliance card holders, it was basically free for all for all 4 flights and it was chaotic. What I found most annoying about the flight was the catering. They served nothing but sandwiches on those 4 flights between 3 and 4.5h. The worst was the Abu Dhabi to Amman sector. A stale piece of bread and a muffin, that’s it. Second problem were the FA‘s. Some were not interested in working, particularly on the AUH-AMM flight, which had just 36 pax. One attendant went straight to sleep after the mediocre service after take off. He occupied an entire row and had even eyeshades on. The planes were rather shabby, with broken screens, non functioning seats and not very clean toilets. And did I forget that my points were not credited and I am chasing after them now. I found it rather amusing that the new RJ CEO mentioned in the editorial of the RJ inflight magazine that RJ aims to be the new "service Champion".

### "on time departure"
London to Amman, on time departure. Very polite and cabin staff, I am impressed with Royal Jordanian, well done.

### "longest/slowest moving queue"
Amman to İstanbul. One of the longest/slowest moving queue I have ever seen to get the tickets in the airport. They have planned to many flights in the evening time but not enough desk to issue the tickets. I have waited 45 minutes but could get my tickets and deliver the luggage, only when they have started to shout the destination I go and take me to the front. Bad planning, not enough number of desk to issue the tickets. Either you should plan the flights with reasonable time between, or you should allocate enough resource to cope with all the passengers. İt had been a huge stress and run. Travelling shouldn't be that difficult and with stress.

### "flight was overbooked and dirty"
Today is day 21 where my 3rd luggage that I paid $200 extra for still hasn't arrived, and with you not responding to any of my 5 emails and having to call you every single day since ( a call per day = so far 21 calls). There is no lead about the luggage, nor is there anyone with an adequate informative response, but instead they are rude and inconsiderate and further very very very not well-trained or professional. I was asked to do your job and come down to the airport to look for the luggage at your storage units, noting its their job. I did so, and it still wasn't found. Now, they are asking me to file for compensation while they didn't even provide the initial compensation, and they are only willing to provide a fixed amount of compensation. Away from the luggage, the flight was overbooked and dirty. It was a circus of Children and loud parents. The food was nasty and inedible. The entertainment was hardly entertaining whatsoever and outdated, and to be entirely fair, almost non-existent.

### "flights always delayed"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Jeddah via Amman. I have chosen this airline 2 times - always return tickets. All 4 flights were always delayed. 2 times the delay was over 5h which I spent in the boarding hall. Of course, I missed my connecting flights from another airport and had to stay overnight in the hotel. I missed my bus (which was booked in advance) as well. No chance for a refund for anything.

### "truly enjoyable experience"
I was a little apprehensive of my flight from Abu Dhabi to London via Amman, but it was one of the more pleasurable flying experiences I have had recently. Check-in at AUH was in the premium check-in area then headed to the lounge for an hour. Boarded on time for the 07:30 departure. A319 for the 3-hour flight from AUH to AMM in a 2x2 configuration. Cradle style reclining seat was comfortable for the short journey with pull-out screens from the arm rest. Not much in English to watch. Small snack of cheese and a few pastries wasn't particularly appetising but full beverage service offered. Fell asleep for most of this sector. Two-hour stopover in AMM. Modern (five year old) airport was a surprise, very appealing and functional with RJ dedicated Crown Club occupying the the mezzanine floor with great views over the terminal below. Still serving breakfast at 10am with warm croissants, Arabic foul, cereals, cheese, hummus and full bar service. All perfectly adequate. Boarded on time for midday flight to London on a A321 again in 2x2 configuration using the similar seating of cradle seat with decent recline and retractable footrest with good pillow and blanket on the seat. Pre-take off drinks of juice or Arabic coffee were distributed. PTVS had much more choice of English and Arabic entertainment on this sector and was comparable with a long-haul service. Cabin Service Manager introduced himself, orders were taken for drinks, menus distributed along with amenity kits and sound cancelling headsets. Plenty of legroom. Lunch service began soon after take-off with linen table cloths being laid followed by drinks. Champagne was served by placing the glass on the table and pouring with warm nuts to accompany. Trays were brought with the appetiser and salad course. The main course, cheese and dessert courses were served off a beautifully laid out cart in front of you where you were encouraged to choose what you wanted from the selection. What a delight! It was like going back to the golden days of first class air travel. All elegant and unhurried. Jordanian and international wines were served. The food was delicious especially the amazing desserts. All in all, a wonderful five course meal served beautifully. Staff were always passing through the cabin to see if more drinks were wanted and then an hour before landing small glasses of 'white coffee' water infused with orange blossom were handed round. The AMM-LHR five-hour sector was a truly enjoyable experience and one I certainly hope to repeat again.

### "seat was not too comfortable"
London to Bangkok via Amman. The staff are friendly at check in and on board the aircraft. The only problems were my seat was not too comfortable and the plane was jammed packed. The food is good but not as filling as Emirates. I would rate 7 out of 10. Would have been 9 with more space on board the aircraft.

### "Don't fly with this airline"
Beirut to Montreal via Amman. There's no airline as low as Royal Jordanian. They will not tell you of any fees for preferred seating and then will claim the plane is full and you can't change your seat, even though there are empty available seats. They stamp all boarding passes SSSS which means full inspection by airport security: Body searches, bag searches, and walking barefoot. The seats are terrible, uncomfortable, and have no leg room. They made us board the plane, and immediately after said that there is a delay with transfer passengers and made us wait in the plane for 45 minutes. And this was already a flight of 11 hours and 20 minutes. They did this because otherwise they would be forced to issue vouchers to passengers to go and eat something at the airport's cafeteria. To avoid expenses, they locked us inside and then told us about the delay. Unscrupulous people! The boarding time for my 10:20 flight was marked as 8:45! Don't fly with this airline!

### "expecting a decent meal"
Amman to Paris CDG. Boarding a little bit delayed hence departed late. Cabin crew is a bit more professional and helpful compare to my previous flight with them. IFE is better compared to their Airbus fleet, I think this B787 is their flagship aircraft. But still fewer choices in their movies and audios list. I'm expecting a decent meal on this as its a 5.5 hr flight but totally disappointed. Only a sandwich in a box with a small water, pretzels and a small baklava was served. Like what I said before I don't like the way they served a set meal in a box as it doesn't look good a full-service airline. I still prefer to see meals in a small tray like the usual. After that meal, we were just given a small pack of peanuts and beverages of choice.

### "most monitors not working"
Dubai to Amman. At first, I'm not expecting much about the service of this airline as I read most of their reviews are not good. On this sector, I first notice immediately how rude the crew assigned on Economy section especially when I heard how she verbally told the lady on the bulkhead that she's not paying attention to the safety video well in fact she cant blame her cause the lady is attending the needs of her small son on her lap. I think that crew should be given a lesson on good manners and proper way of speaking for her guest with some courtesy. I also don't like the way they set the meals in a carton box instead of using a tray as it doesn't look good in a full-service airline. They should change the in-flight entertainment monitors as touch screen options are not responding and most of the monitors are not working at all like mine so I decided just to use my own gadget rather than complain to the crew as for sure they cannot offer any other seats.

### "show so little care for customers"
Amman to Cairo. We were flying to Egypt on a family holiday and were informed on our arrival at the airport that our flight had been cancelled and we would now be flying five and a half hours later (meaning that we would now be at the airport for seven and a half hours). It was known that the flight was cancelled before we left home and we were never notified despite our booking being made online. We asked the airline to either arrange for us to be transported home (our transport to the airport was 40 JOD (about 60 USD)) or for use of the Business Class lounge. We thought that these were simple and reasonable requests that Royal Jordanian could easily grant. We were not asking them to compensate us for the afternoon and evening plans we would now miss in Cairo. We just wanted to wait out the long delay at home or in the Business Lounge. The customer service staff were hopeless and cowardly. No one seemed to have any authority. No one would outright refuse our requests but they kept asking us to wait 5 minutes while they got someone else to help us and then ran away, never to return. After waiting an hour and a half, we finally we found Tamara who did try and help us but said that her top manager (whom she had to call at home) had refused to even allow us into the lounge for our 7 hour wait. What a shameful response and how embarrassing for the national airline to show so little care for their customers. We were told that our delay wasn't long enough to qualify for a hotel room because it was only 5 hours and 40 mins instead of the required 6 hours. For the record the delay was in fact six hours because the flight we were rescheduled onto was also delayed, as was our return flight from Cairo a week later. We live in Amman and fly often for business and pleasure. If we can avoid using Royal Jordanian we will.

### "disorganised and disrespectful"
Doha to Cairo via Amman. They cancelled my second flight and forced me to wait 8 hours at the airport. I will never fly with them again. Very disorganised and disrespectful. They knew the flight got cancelled when I was still in Doha and didn't tell me or give me the choice to do what I want. Horrible management.

### "One of the worst airline experiences"
Amman to Bangkok. Terrible check-in experience. My flight departs at 2:15 but the counter doesn’t allow me to check-in until 12:00 because I didn’t choose seats in advance. The counter requires me wait 1+ hour with my check-in luggage in airport lobby. To me they are punishing people not choosing seats in advance. One of the worst airline experiences I had.

### "bad customer service"
Vienna to Amman. Comfortable seats, but bad customer service. I send this complaint both to the customer service of Royal Jordanian Airlines as well as through a facebook message on their facebook account half a year ago. I received an e-mail that I could expect a response within 10 working days, but haven't had a reaction to my complaint even after sending 8 messages in the last 6 months. Truly dissapointed in this airline of which I expected good service. On the 2nd of June I was supposed to have a direct flight from Amsterdam to Amman. I choose this flight, because it was a direct flight and was willing to pay €200,- more for a direct flight compared to the flight going through Kiev. Exactly a week before I got a message from the travel agent I booked through saying: "For your information, Royal Jordanian has changed the departure date to the 3rd of June. Unfortunately, schedule changes occur quite frequently in air travel, and when they do, we offer you the airline’s most favorable alternative. We ask you to reply to this email and let us know if you would like to accept the new itinerary. If we have not heard from you before the 31st of May, we can no longer assist you with the change. In this case, we advise you to check-in in due time for the airline staff to assist you with the change, as your current ticket is no longer valid for travel due to the change. After calling the airline and telling about this, I was able to change and keep the flight on the 2nd and fly through Vienna instead, to still arrive on the same day (the 3rd of June my tour was starting). They told me to write a complaint and so here it is, two weeks after I have returned from the beautiful country Jordan. I would like to see compensation of your airline for the change of flight. I understand that it saves you a lot of money, but this goes at the expense of the quality of your customers travels. If I would have known beforehand that I would've had a transfer, I would've booked through Ukraine International Airlines. It is highly inappropriate to cancel a flight with just one week notice and without any form of compensation. This doesn't suit the reputation your airline has. Because of the situation as described above, my confidence in Royal Jordanian has been profoundly shaken.

### "Very unpleasant experience"
Amsterdam to Amman. Very unpleasant experience during check-in, I had to open twice my handbags to remove 3 extra kgs which I could simply pay for - instead they were requesting to check in the handback for 130 Euros. The bag was then 7.9 kg and still staff made me open the bag again to remove 1kg more, this is insane and so unpleasant experience. They did as such to so many other passengers which was really unpleasant to all The worst part is that at the boarding point, they weighted again my handbag (only mine!) and were looking at the bags I bought from the duty free zone, stating that the bags are extra weight! I am in shock , I have never ever experienced this in any other airlines. Very rude staff, such unpleasant experience!

### "changes translate to low cost service"
Rome to Amman. Flight took off on-time and landed early. The ground staff at FCO airport are helpful and friendly. Onboard, seats are comfortable however, the interiors are really starting to show their age and so is the inflight entertainment system. Royal Jordanian Airlines should really do some renovations across their fleet, competitors offer a far superior hard product. On to the greatest disappointment, the inflight meal offering, which consisted of a sandwich. This is outrageous and totally unacceptable. The flight is a duration of 3 hours+, and a sandwich is not enough for such a flight duration and does not at all represent the hospitality Jordan and Jordanians are proud of, not to mention that it is far less than what competitors offer. Flight attendants were okay, but a couple were rather unprofessional. To wrap up, the airline really screwed things with their new changes, and definitely lost loyal customers including me and my friends, as these changes translate to low cost service at a premium price.

### "I would not recommend"
Dubai to Vienna via Amman. I would not recommend to use this airline. The flight was delayed for 5 hours and not the first time it happens to me with this airline. Nobody can't give a proper answer why and weather the delayed time is fixed, moreover I needed to go further in Graz and I lost my ticket to there. The company doesn't want to cover it and didn't even apologized or tried to help me somehow so I spent double amount of money for that. Plus the stuff in the Amman's airport is absolutely unfriendly. It's a really bad experience, please don't reply on the "Royalty" of the company.

### "I do not recommend using RJ"
Dubai to Chicago via Amman. There was only 1:50min stay-over in Amman. I was issued Boarding passes all the way through to Chicago. However to my surprise, me and everyone else for that matter, had to go to the transfer desk first to re validate next flight at Amman airport. The staff over there did not even bother to tell us which que to go for transfers and I was in the wrong que for half and hour before finding out from other passengers that it was the wrong que. Amman airport staff did not know English and can only use gestures. After going through transfer desk, I had to be in a long que again for security check to go upstairs in the departure lounge. Again, there was a long que at the gate and we have to go through another security check to get inside the departure lounge. They did not have any X-Ray machines. So they have to open my carry on luggage and ram through every cloth and accessory. While doing so, they were just talking to each other in Arabic and laughing. It was like the passengers did not matter for them at all. Airline staff was rude. Air hostesses could hardly understand English. We were served one good and tasty meal after take-off and one cold sandwich snack before landing on a 13.5-hr flight. I do not recommend using RJ unless there is not other option available.

### "very unprofessional customer service"
Flight from Amman to Beirut was postponed from 18:40 to 23:45 without any prior notification even not at the check-in gate by the staff as apparently he didn't receive the information either. We receive poor and very unprofessional customer service with no support to accommodate. After insisting for a reasonable solution the duty manager came; the only solution offered was a flight change without charges on the next day and access to the business lounge. We were left very unhappy and with no convenient solution. We paid for a round trip Beirut-Amman 275 USD and received worst service that any cheap airline would have applied! Royal Jordanian changes it's flight schedule on a regular basis in the route Beirut-Amman. This was the worst delay but not the first one.

### "good service on board"
Berlin to Tel Aviv via Amman, flights were punctual, with good service on board and an option to choose a seat with no extra charge. Personal entertainment system can be better in terms of quality of the equipment. Lunch/dinner is cold sandwiches and hummus, good choice of drinks. Upgrade to business from Berlin is upon payment of ridiculous 798Euro for a leg - can't believe that is actually somebody will pay this price.

### "experience was appallingly bad"
We took a taxi from Petra, early in the morning, to make sure we were in the airport in a tmely manner. Without consideration to other flyers who would loose connecting flights, or to us that had a reservation at a hotel in Cairo, to take a flight at 3:00am to Madrid, (at this point was impossible to cancel reservations), our fligth was delayed and we lost a day. We were not offered a mere apology, or any inkling of anything to be done to apologize for our problem, caused by the airline. The information was very limited and no consideration given to people who speak other languages (ours are Spanish and English), information was confusing at some point the screens said "boarding, then final call) and here we where not knowing were to walk to as they restricted the entries, no explanation given, at the very least somebody from the airline to give us the most minimal information. The experience was appallingly bad, if in my hands will never take a flight with this airline again.

### "worst airline experience"
Doha to Sharm El Sheikh via Amman. Worst airline experience, highly irresponsible behavior. During all complaints and claims Royal Jordanian hides behind story that their flight are actually carried out by subsidiary Royal Wings and that their Customer Service Plan not applies. On the way the second leg flight from Amman was changed to early morning forcing first leg in day before forcing transit night over in Amman. No hotel or any other compensation was made. On arrival in Sharm El Sheikh baggage (of quite a group) was not delivered. Baggage is not delivered but needs to be collected by individual with promise that costs made are refunded. Royal Jordanian did not provide details for tracking, baggage was ready for collection only 60 hours after arrival. Costs made are not refunded. On return flight was delayed from 13:45 via 17:30 without informing passengers (many people complaint). Finally flight was delayed to 20:00 causing as to miss Royal Jordanian connection in Amman. Flight was rebooked to night flight departing Amman 2:50am with 5 hours delay waiting where Royal Jordanian did not provide access to lounge and claimed not to be responsible.

### "worst airline I have used"
Doha to Cairo via Amman, the worst airline I have used. Apart from the very costly Airline tickets, the flight should have taken off at 9:00pm from Doha where it was delayed for more than half an hour. I arrived at Amman Airport around 12:00 am and I preferred to get into Amman to stay in any hotel nearest the Airport after the officer told me I am not entitled to a hotel. I came back in the following early morning to catch my flight which was supposed to take off at 12:15pm. Unfortunately, I noticed on the flights screen that my flight will be delayed upto more than 3 hours. I tried to ask any officer there but no response. On my way to the gate where I should take my delayed flight, I found many people are gathering in the front of the company's office waiting for the boss with authority to address their concerns about their flight to Doha which is delayed for 8 hours more. I was surprised from the response that has also has no authority to address their concerns or even make available some kind of comfort to such people, noting that some of them were on business class, and he will communicate with the top management in this respect. The conclusion is such a company doesn't have any kind of policy or procedure exposed to its employees or passengers. The best answer I used to hear is 'I do not know'.

### "do not recommend at all"
It is my first trip with Royal Jordanian. It is a really bad experience. Staff does not do their job. Two bad quality meals for a trip of 10h from Montreal to Amman. Everything not heated to the right temperature. Noisy plane. I do not recommend at all.

### "never fly again with this airline"
Amman to Doha. I booked business class tickets for my family, and we received the tickets as a flight with Royal Jordanian Airlines. I was then very disappointed to get in a plane of Ukranian Airlines with business seats like economy seats - the same size and same space between seats as they look like. A low quality cold food served as lunch. It's not acceptable to charge money for business class and fly people with economy seats and level. Or you better inform passengers about this change before you let them fly.. I found a big ignorance from the RJ towards accepting my complaint. I will never fly again with this airline.

### "flight is delayed, again"
Amman to Istanbul. I am sitting in the gate waiting for my Royal Jordanian flight to Istanbul, which is delayed, again. In fact, this is the the third time in a row my Royal Jordanian flight has been delayed (within the space of two months). In fact, the last flight was not only delayed, it was replaced entirely with a Ukrainian airlines flight and crew and a cabin so dated it took me back to my childhood. On the last two delayed flights we were served some kind of salami derivative matter between bread, and a single biscuit. No choices. No entertainment either. I wonder what awaits us this time and when it will be. This is not a cheap flight. A return to Istanbul (2.5 hours) Usually costs me between 450-600 GBP. I can't speak for other routes but at least on this one if you can possibly avoid flying RJ, my advice would be do so.

### "refusing to refund the money"
Sharm El Sheikh to Dubai via Amman. The worst company I have dealt with as they have rescheduled the flight 6 hours earlier without informing lots of passengers and I was one of them. When I called them they claimed that they have informed the travel agent and they have said the same to the other passengers in the same situation but none of them was aware. They failed to find any solution or alternative flight and are refusing to refund the money and saying that they will need to deduct cancellation charges. I advise everybody to avoid dealing with this company.

### "express my dissatisfaction"
Madrid to Amman. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction from Royal Jordanian Airlines. I was travelling including my 9 months old infant. I had a buggy and 2 Bags. When I got to Amman, I was told that the 56cm bag didn't arrived yet. I filed a "Lost Baggage" Case. Until the date of writing this message, the bag didn't arrive. Even when contacting customer care office, they reply in rude and arrogant way. The cabin staff were rude, not friendly when I asked for a blanket for my 9-months daughter. Moreover, when she bring the blanket she threw it without handling gently to me. I have never seen airline staff like that. I will not travel anymore with this airline.

### "fare was substantially cheaper"
Dubai to New York via Amman in business, fare was substantially cheaper than a direct. Dubai to Amman on A320. breakfast served, all good and very efficient. Transfer in Amman smooth and lounge excellent. Amman to JFK was on a new 787, really impressed. Crew worked non stop with excellent food served from trolley and very good choice of drinks, better than competitors. Whilst it does not have the range of AVOD films and music of ICE it makes up with great aircraft, service and food, well done royal Jordanian.

### "Worst experience of my life"
❎ Unverified |  New York to Amman. Worst experience of my life. I didn't get a chance to pick out my own seat. When I tried to pick a seat, the person whom I checked in with to get a boarding passed said something along the lines of 'there are plenty of seats available in the back row just sit you'll be fine' he was wrong. I was fooled. I picked my seat maybe one time and it was on AA on my way back home. Service was mediocre. My headphones were broken, and I had to ask several attendants for a replacement which took 30-45 minutes. Their English is not quite up to par, so I could hardly understand anything that was said. Unless your desperate look elsewhere for flights.

### "service is sincere and caring"
Kuala Lumpur to Vienna via Amman. The business class product is not gimmicky but the service is sincere and caring. On my flight from Kuala Lumpur to Vienna via Amman, the crew were hard-working and personable. They kept plying us with food, snacks, hot and cold drinks as well as Arabic coffee. We were treated to many hot towels. The food was great, inflight entertainment easy to navigate, the noise-cancelling headset fantastic. The Bangkok technical stop is a bit comical as ground staff feverishly scrub and vacuum the cabin while you are in your seat, but it was done with good humour. The new Amman terminal and lounge are grand, and can compete with the best of them. Before landing, the crew in my section came to say "It was very nice to have you on this flight".

### "impressed by the Royal Jordanian service"
I was really impressed by the Royal Jordanian service! Shortly before boarding my flight from London to Amman I found out my partner (who I was meant to be meeting at the airport in Amman) had missed his flight and wouldn't be arriving until the following day. As my flight was due to land around 1am I was concerned at taking a taxi alone at night to my hotel. I spoke to the crew as I boarded and they were incredibly helpful - they rung ahead to organise an airport transfer from my hotel in Madaba and even offered to see me safely into the taxi at Amman. This was very reassuring and some of the best service I've received from any airline.

### "the most unpleasant experience"
I had the most unpleasant experience that happened to me with them while I was going from Madrid to Cairo on April 18th, 2017, as I was supposed to have a one night transit in Amman under the impression that I have a free night stay at the airport hotel. But once I arrived to Amman they refused to give me the free night and said that I have to pay USD 163 in order to get a room! They were treating me as if I'm begging and they were very rude and unwelcoming! No one helped me and I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport as if I'm a beggar. I went to their transit office and regular office at the airport and no one helped. Good service doesn't mean smiling cabin crew or good food on flight. It means helping and assisting your customers when in trouble.

### "crew chief or the pilot was smoking"
Basra to Istanbul via Amman with Royal Jordanian. The flight from Basra to Amman was 2.5 hours late. It was the first day of this new Thursday afternoon BSR flight. The aircraft was in deplorable condition. Filthy seats, trays, carpet, windows. I used my moist towelette to clean the greasy film from other people off of the window but it gets better. It smelt as if the cabin crew chief or the pilot was smoking cigarettes. I will never fly Royal Jordanian again.

### "my last time flying them"
New York to Tel Aviv via Amman. I have to say that I am utterly disappointed by these guys. We lost our luggage on our way to vacation in Tel Aviv and had to purchase new clothes and stuff. Our luggage was returned day 3 of our vacation out of 10. They have not reimbursed for anything. Upon questions, they keep giving me email addresses and I don't get any responses whatsoever. Thank God we had travel insurance and i got a reimbursement from them because Royal Jordanian still hasn't responded to anything yet! I guess they want to delay responding and hope we give up? Then on our way back we had a stay in Queen Alia airport and we were expecting the airport to provide us any accommodation. We had to pay for our own hotel because they said there was another the next day. Of course, they did not realize that we had to check out of our hotel the previous and in any case when we booked our flight, the auto system is the one who prompted that for us. Ridiculous. The aircrafts were new and the food was good though. Al though, the crew is not particularly friendly. This will be my last time flying them.

### "not a great experience"
Chicago to Beirut via Amman. Overall not a great experience. The bathrooms were not stocked with soap or toilet paper at the start of the flight, our flight attendant was extremely rude, and the flight attendants were putting their hands inside =clean cups to serve water at the same time they were clearing dirty plates (so putting dirty gloves inside of the cups they were using to give us fresh water). I would not fly with them again.

### "offered a competitive price"
Amman to Dubai return. The ground crew were efficient and helpful, the aircraft modern with IFE and seats were comfortable. Flight attendants are attentive and friendly. There were 3 options of meals (fish, chicken and meat). The cabin and toilets were clean. Royal Jordanian offered a competitive price as well as an attractive baggage policy of 2x23kg for economy class, which is more than the main competitor. Return was the same with even better flight attendants. I can see that people tend to speak out in times of disappointment and complaining, but my flights were excellent. I recommend this airline.

### "most pleasant crew"
Frankfurt to Dubai via Amman. At first I had a one hour wait in Amman airport but later was informed about two weeks before my flight that the flight would make a stop in Munich for "technical reasons" which would make me miss my connecting flight to Dubai and I had to wait for 12 hours. Anyway for what I paid I thought it was okay. I board the flight, and was welcomed by most pleasant crew, very friendly people who tried to make you feel relaxed. On landing in Amman, the transfer desk gave me a hotel accommodation.

### "getting worse and worse"
Amman to Tunis. Royal Jordanian Airlines is getting worse and worse. Usually they ask if I prefer an aisle or window seat but they just book without asking now. Most of the time the staff are unfriendly. The food is always bad. I've been flying with RJ for 25 years. They used to be good - always giving a bag with a tooth brush etc, this is now only for business. Alcohol used to be free now it's not, and last but not least the entertainment system has the worst screens and worst movies - especially the old ones. If there was another direct flight to my destinations I'll always take it over RJ. This is coming from a Jordanian who is always proud of his country but RJ keeps making things worse.

### "I cannot recommend the airline"
Second in the queue in business class check-in line, there was an issue with the pax in front of me. He was on his phone trying to sort something, the agent on hers, for 10 minutes - nothing resolved. I later saw this pax in Y on board so don’t know if he was only in the line due to OW status. At last, an agent in the Y class line said to her colleague “Will I take him?” – meaning me – and her colleague replied “Up to you.” I was being checked in and asked which lounge I used at CDG. Dunno” she said. She asked another agent - “I’ve no idea. It was so rude / bad I just laughed. I think they thought I couldn’t speak French. When I got to the AA lounge (I'd checked before which one to use) the agent said “This is not where you’re supposed to be.” When I challenged this it was only resolved when a colleague came over to him and explained OW Sapphire rules to him. A sign saying RJ pax could use the lounge was on the desk in front of him. Flight to AMM was OK-ish, but no proactive service from the crew. Meal was served and cleared away as soon as they could manage it – twice, not-finished drinks taken from my table – the crew disappeared behind curtain for the rest of flight. The food was mediocre, the in-flight entertainment limited and uninspiring. The AMM lounge a dump. Poor food, nasty toilets, birds flying inside, no one to let you in shower room. Cannot imagine its state if toilets anything to go by. Security staff at AMM incredibly rude and aggressive. Where you go?” barked, is really not good enough. Flight to BKK full. Most pax in business class appeared to be Royal Jordanian staff, behaving as though on a company outing. As we taxied two were standing in the aisles, using their phones, the woman beside me (no ideas who she was, young and pretty, very popular, both captains came out to chat to her) went into the cockpit for take-off and landing and I did not feel the FAs had proper control of the cabin. Breakfast consisted of 3 types of pastry with a bread roll on the side. No nuts with the welcome drink, no bottle of water, surely the minimum in business class. It was available if you asked for it, but you had to ask. The bar area onboard was used for a flight attendant to store her suitcase. Flights back were more of the same. The flight from BKK only better as only 9 pax in business class. In the middle of the night I pressed the bell to ask for some sparkling water. It took the flight attendant 5 minutes to come and offer to “help”. It’s not as if she was busy. I got what I asked for to the letter, a glass with water in it. No ice, no lemon, no offer of anything to go with it. Someone needs to tell Royal Jordanian that training their staff to snarl “Enjoy” at English speaking passengers whilst slamming a glass on to the tray and high-tailing it back behind the curtain before any more awkward questions can be asked does not make a premium passenger feel valued. The volume on the passenger announcements on the A321 to CDG was so loud that when the pilot made an announcement mid-flight the dozing man in front of me almost leapt out of his skin. I’ve learned my lesson. I thought as a One World airline it would be roughly on a par with other carriers in the alliance, if not necessarily as good. The ticket cost about £200 less then Qatar Airways and it allowed me to try a new aircraft type for me (the Boeing 787). However I cannot recommend the airline at all. I would sooner not fly than use them again. My main feeling is one of having been cheated out of my money.

### "attendants nice and attentive"
Vienna to Amman with Royal Jordanian. They sent me an email 2 months before my flight from Athens to Amman to inform me that it was cancelled. I called their call center and was advised to visit their sales office. The sales office was very helpful and provided options for the flight to Amman or a refund. I accepted to be re-routed through Vienna to Amman. The check-in agents at Vienna were very nice and helpful. The boarding process was efficient and the flight left on-time and arrived early. The meal consisted of three options (meat, chicken and fish). I opted for the chicken option (chicken with mustard) and it was good. The flight attendants were all very nice and attentive. Overall, I recommend RJ despite the inconvenience of having to transit at Vienna for the flight to Amman.

### "very underrated"
Amman to Madrid. I was a little nervous having read many negative reviews before flying Royal Jordanian, but I have to say, this airline is very underrated. Firstly, ground staff were okay as they processed the huge crowds in the morning rush hour. The flight attendants were all nice and helpful except one. She was unhelpful with many passengers and was very unprofessional. The inflight meal offerings were excellent. Shortly after take-off, we were given nuts and a choice of a drink, then a hot meal of three options (fish, chicken and meat), a choice of coffee or tea and then a drink before landing. The inflight entertainment although appreciated, needs a updates in my opinion. There was unfortunately no inflight wifi. The cabin was clean, but the seats although comfortable, need refurbishment / renewal. We departed later than the scheduled time but landed on time. All in all, I recommend Royal Jordanian.

### "I would not recommend"
Amman to Detroit via Montreal. I would not recommend Royal Jordanian Airlines. On a technical stop in Montreal before heading to Detroit, my luggage was offloaded in Montreal and when I waited two hours in Detroit to talk to and file a report, the Royal Jordanian rep did not want to assist me. It took 6 days for my luggage to be returned. The service in business class is awful. Asked for a champagne, was advised they didn't have any cold, no ice. Asked for a mixed drink during dinner and only got the soft drink. No ice. Asked again and wrote it down for the attendant and was served only the soft drink. No alcohol was provided for the entire trip, on both legs, Amman to Detroit and return. Headphones did not work, When on the technical stop in Montreal, we could not use the restrooms, were made to sit in our seats and if we got up to stretch were told to sit down immediately. Cabin staff did not assist a single mother with her 3 kids flying business and allowed two of the three children to cry nonstop on the 11 hour trip. Royal Jordanian Airlines inability to provide alcoholic drinks for long haul flights is inexcusable. There was no WiFi on the long haul trip. Food was average for business class. Don't eat the lamb, overcooked and stringy. I would advise to have the seafood.

### "don't recommend Royal Jordanian"
Hong Kong to Bangkok. Check in smooth, RJ lounge at Hong Kong airport is Plaza Premiun, which is not a great lounge, super crowded, poor catering, always busy. Boarding to the plane for all passengers in the same bridge, ambiance of the cabin nice, nice lighting and seats seemed to be comfortable but strangely were not reclininable. Catering below anyone exoectations, a salmon salad few chocolates as desserts and a nice arab coffee. Food actually poor. We were two, 1H first row. Entertainment system, a joke, few channels not much to watch. No priority lane card given for Bangkok. I don't recommend Royal Jordanian Airlines.

### "could have made it easier by the truth"
Going from Amman to Bangkok got delayed 3 hours, traveling from Bangkok to Amman, we were supposed to fly at 12:30 all was Ok, at 12 announcement was about the delay of 20 min, after 30 min another announcement came that it will take off at 02:00 AM, at 02:00 the manager came and gave us a blankets as we were sleeping on the ground, we kept asking when and we were not given a single accurate answer. At 04:00 people started to shout so at 04:30 they took us to a hotel although they knew it’s not working since the captain and the team left at 01:00 also the passengers from Hong Kong were taken to the hotel on spot. In the hotel we were told that we will take off at 08:30 leaving the hotel another delay were announced to 09:50, went back to the airport and nobody from RJ was there so we had to ask everyone what to do tell we found out ourselves. We entered to the plane we had to wait another 3 hours to take off explaining that some passengers didn't come! I heard the manager telling the team cancel the tea and coffee we don't have hot water, so the captain announced that due to turbulence we will not serve you coffee! No apology no respect and we complained the staff told us we have the same issue as we didn't sleep which made it even worse! I don't recommend any one to fly with RJ keeping in mind it's more expensive than most of the flight and the soft drink they try to offer didn't make it better? Sleeping for three hours on the ground and the first thing we were told once getting the blanket you must give it back! I was expecting some one senior to talk to us upon arrival or at least to apologize or to explain the situation or at least to have an accurate timing for the kick off so we can inform our family. Reaching Amman at 16:00 instead of 05:15 is not an easy thing and RJ could have made it easier by telling the truth and providing the proper service recovery from the beginning.

### "food was tasty with good portions"
Dubai to Amman on Royal Jordanian Airlines. On time departure from DXB. Aircraft was clean and really like their color combination. Seats are good in Economy and offer very good leg space and pitch. IFE has good Hollywood and regional options which can be helpful in passing time on the 3 hour leg. Food was tasty with good portions. FA's were doing their job without any fuss. Would highly recommend RJ on this sector.

### "requests were promptly fulfilled"
Amman to Dubai on Royal Jordanian Airlines A320. Aircraft was clean and seats were spacious in Economy. The FA's were not so warm but that didn't matter as requests were promptly fulfilled without any fuss. The dinner served was tasty and had huge portions, the dessert was also good. IFE had good Hollywood options so no question of getting bored on this 3 hour leg. Would highly recommend RJ.

### "appear to be most unhelpful airline"
Dubai to Amman. Royal Jordanian is a comfortable airline with good leg room and decent in flight service. But if things go wrong for example Dubai airport had an airline crash land three days before my flight via Dubai than they appear to be the most unhelpful airline. They did not inform orbitz (through whom I booked) that my flight was cancelled from Dubai. 2. Upon arrival no agent knew when the next flight would be. Finally after 7 hours, I was put on a flight and I confirmed with three different people that my luggage had been put on the flight. My luggage did not arrive. They said they would deliver next day but did not. Their staff were the least helpful over the phone. Still without luggage 35 hours later. Maybe this is just a one off experience but thought I better log it so people know that if things go wrong this airline will not have your back.

### "poor and unprofessional service"
London Heathrow to Basra via Amman. My bag has been lost in transit between Jordan and Iraq. I started my journey to Iraq on Friday, only to find the flight to Iraq from Jordan had been cancelled, and was only informed on arrival at the airport. On arriving in Jordan I was put into the Transit Hotel, but prior to leaving I requested my bags to be given to me, but staff refused to give them to me, so I went to the hotel with no clean clothes or toiletries at all, but was expected to stay there for the period of 36 hours, due to the cancellation. I was questioned on arrival at the hotel about my British Citizenship, as if it was a crime and wasn't right for me to have the passport, as they thought I was an Iraqi. They shuffled me like cattle along with all the other Iraqis, talking to them like animals. This behaviour should not be happening. On arrival in Basrah nearly 36 hours later, one of my bags had gone missing. The whole journey and episode with Royal Jordanian has been a complete nigh mare. Later I went to Royal Jordanian office to report the loss. All details were taken but so far (7 days later) there has been no sight of my luggage. On checking in at Heathrow, I was over the baggage allowance and so I was charged a further £80, which in reality is pointless as that was for the extra weight in my luggage, but the luggage has gone missing? Additional to that, RJ's baggage personnel in Jordan, wanted me to pay more money for the extra baggage, requesting me to pay cash to them on the spot, but on producing the receipt for the money I paid in London, the baggage person got stroppy and angry towards me, he was then told by one of his work colleagues I didn't need to pay more. I keep contacting the Royal Jordanian office in the UK, Amman and Basra, but there is no interest from them at all, they just don't seem to care. From the Basra office, I have heard that my bag has been found, but the Jordanians in Amman are refusing to forward it on. How can you use such services when they do this to you, beyond me. More irritating, this is not the first time this has happened. Both my husband and I have travelled before with Royal Jordanian and both times an item of ours has been lost. I will not be flying with Royal Jordanian again, as I have had my got my fill with their poor and unprofessional service.

### "cheap meals and no snacks"
New York JFK to Amman with Royal Jordanian. Bad experience. Cheap meals and no snacks or drinks offered in between. The entertainment was also poor - low quality and little variety. Hospitality is so so and it takes forever to get a flight attendant to respond and of course no smiles. No WiFi by the way, not even for money.

### "choose between three different meals"
We were doing Umrah and were flying from Vienna to Jeddah via Amman and from Medina via Amman back to Vienna. The Airbus offered 32" legspace in economy class which was very comfortable and the In-seat personal TV offered a huge entertainment programm. Food was delicious and you could choose between three different meals.

### "#1 worst of the worst experiences"
Basra to London via Amman with Royal Jordanian Airlines. In 35 years of frequent travel, my most recent trip (and first experience with RJ) becomes my #1 worst of the worst experiences. 6-Jul-16 06:30 hrs (scheduled departure 08:45 hrs) - we went to check in at RJ counter in Basra and they advised us (8 of us from several different companies), that we were booked on 8-Jul. - After first saying our travel agents made the change, they finally admitted RJ made the change the night before, with no notice to our respective travel agents - then said no seats available, then said only economy, finally at 09:30 hrs (flight was delayed for 1 hr) they booked us on our original seats! - why, because of the delay, we would miss our onward connections to London, and they would rather us stay for 2 more days in Basra than try to get us home! - flight departs +/- 09:45 hrs and arrives Amman about 11:50 hrs - in Ammam, we are unable to make our 12:00 hrs connection, RJ did not hold the plane and they refused to consider any other options than to rebook flights to 1 day later. 7-Jul-16 scheduled departure of 12:00 hrs is announced to be delayed to 12:30 hrs. We board the plane and wait until 13:15hrs for passengers arriving from a delayed flight - finally depart about 13:30 hrs local time, arrive LHR and disembark at 16:45 hrs local time. I run to my next connection and get to the BA gate at 16:55 hrs, just as boarding is announced for a 17:15 hrs departure, only to be told by BA that the boarding pass I was issued in Amman was no longer valid, and that RJ had transferred the ticket to Air Canada departing at 10:10 hrs 8-Jul-16. BA unable to get access to the ticket, so unable allow me to board the flight - RJ did not advise me nor had anyone meet me at the gate to advise me that a change was made. - I run back to the Terminal 3 RJ airline transit desk only to be greeted with a 'closed' sign - BA desk was able to phone RJ and I was instructed to go through immigration and meet a representative at Zone F for my hotel and onward flight booking - because RJ couldn't be bothered to greet me at the arrival gate, and it took me some time to track them down, I had missed the next connecting AC flights at 18:00 hrs and 18:40 hrs (via Calgary) RJ was a complete cluster job from the moment we first tried checking in at Basra, with no customer service, and no sense of passenger ownership, I now sit in a transit hotel at Heathrow, and a 22 hr journey has turned into 60+ hr journey.

### "the crew shines"
Flew Royal Jordanian Airlines, 2 May, Amman - Chicago on RJ263 - Crown Class in 787. Dedicated check-in area for Crown Class passengers which is really nice. Completely separated from the main check-in area with personalized service for a quick check-in and baggage check. Also - they have an immigration point after check-in that is exclusive to Crown class so it's very fast. The lounge upstairs is very nice - great food selection and drinks. Boarding was delayed a bit but that is typical in the middle east. Friendly welcome and shown to our seats. Given a welcome drink and menus for the flight. Smooth take-off and served a nice lunch course by course. I love that - makes me feel like the old days of flying. And you can get as much as you want. In-flight entertainment isn't the best - that is where RJ can approve - but was ok in between naps. The crew shines - taking pictures of me and my travel partner, asking about how we enjoyed the flight. Landed on-time and just took a bit of time to get our bags- but overall excellent flight. Always have enjoyed my Royal Jordanian flights

### "no smile, no greeting"
Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Amman with Royal Jordanian Airlines. No smile, no greeting, no acknowledgement from the flight crew upon boarding. Earphones were thrown to the passenger, literally if they were asleep, other airlines would have the courtesy to at least stuff it in the seat pocket. The flight crew had limited English command? Phrases like "What you want", "seat up", "NO" in harsh tones is just unacceptable. During distribution of meals, food was given to us without asking what options we wanted, my partner does not eat beef and a beef tray was just left and the staff member simply moved on. During the 9 hour flight I did not see staff complete a water run through the Y cabin. All these little gestures go a long way for passengers that are trapped especially in the middle seat.

### "very comfortable lay-flat seats"
April 20, Chicago O'Hare to Tel Aviv via Amman (RJ264) in Crown Class with Royal Jordanian Airlines. Check-in was friendly and bags tagged to TLV. Lounge access is the Air France/KLM lounge which had plenty of food and drinks. Boarding was typical for middle east flights - a mess. Turkish Airlines 773 next to us in a small boarding area so passengers were getting confused which line to get in. There were maybe 20 people in wheelchairs that boarded first after a 30 minute delay. Then Crown class and frequent fliers. Greeted at the aircraft door and walked to our seats - very comfortable lay-flat seats that would end up being perfect for the 11.5 hour flight. Welcomed by flight attendants with water/juice, headphones, menu and amenity kits. Smooth take off and service began promptly. Meals served from a cart so it really makes you feel special and like the old days of flying. You can have as much food as you want, served with a smile. AVOD was ok - this is where RJ disappoints. Not a lot of selection for movies or TV shows. If they add to this the product will be flawless. Lay-flat bed allowed for 6 hours of sleep which was great. Nice pre-arrival meal served and survey forms passed out. Our main attendant helped my mom learn some Arabic and was so friendly - taking pics for us together. Landed 30 minutes late but had 3.5 hours to connect. Transit is easy at AMM and we were in the Crown Lounge in minutes. Lots of food and drinks in the lounge - and then see the TLV flight is late. Boarded from a bus an hour late to the A320 plane. Economy full but Crown had 5 passengers and 1 RJ security man. Drinks served on the ground but nothing from take off to landing. It was a 27 minute flight so not a big deal. Landed and bags off in 30 minutes. Overall a great flight - delays seem common on RJ but would fly them as my choice to the middle east.

### "cigarette behind cockpit door"
As a frequent traveller in the Middle East I have the privilege to enjoy various Gulf carriers, which in most cases offer amazing service and safety experiences. Living in Amman I often have no other choice but to fly with Royal Jordanian. An experience that I mostly regret because of the unacceptable inflight smoking practices. I have very little else to remark about Royal Jordanian which I consider a reliable and responsible carrier, other than the smoking practices. As a non-smoker I am particular sensitive to the unpleasant smell of cigarettes. Even worse when I am trapped on an RJ flight, like in my most recent flight experience RJ610, 17/04/2016 from Amman to Dubai. It is sad that passengers are advised by law to adhere to the strictly enforced non smoking rules - except the ignorance of the flight deck, where officers allow themselves to rise above international regulations. Fact is that smoking is not permitted in the cabin and lavatories. If I discount the presence of an unknown smoking passenger hidden in an overhead compartment, the only two remaining options are: an air freshener with distinct cigarette scent or a quick cigarette behind the cockpit door? I would love to know what the Airline Regulations and Standard Operating Procedures regarding smoking at the Cockpit are?

### "attentive and very polite"
Flew Royal Jordanian Airlines from Amman to Hong Kong via Bangkok. Hardware: The seats are lie-flat that is the same model found on United's 787 and 767 BusinessFirst in a 2-2-2 layout. They are upholstered in beige colored leather. A plush pillow and duvet were provided on each seat and a Black "Aigner" branded amenity kit was given out to each passenger along with printed menus. The IFE is touch-screen with hi-def screens but average offering of international movies/TV programs. Software: The first segment from AMM to BKK were staffed by Jordanian crew, the crew proactively go around the cabin and greeted each passengers by name, they were very attentive and very polite. Upon boarding, the crew offered each passenger a small cup of Arabic Coffee as a pre-departure drink. BKK to HKG was staffed by Thai crew led by a Jordanian purser. The crew on this leg does not appear they want to be there at all. During meal service, I was told that my first choice of meal (Curry) was not available despite there were only six passengers in the business class cabin of which one was the flight engineer, one was the security guard, two were travel agents traveling on industry discounted tickets and I was one of only two who were fare paying passengers. Instead of offering the meal choices to the fare paying passengers first, the crew decided that the flight engineer and security guard were more important as they were served the curry. Asked to speak to the purser and he gave me an excuse that the meal choices were first come first serve. Apparently seat 1A was not close enough for the crew to ask first. I was also told by the purser that oneworld Emerald status does not mean anything to their airline and that he does not care if passengers bring their businesses elsewhere. Very surly and arrogant way to speak to a frequent flyer passenger traveling in premium cabin. Also no apology whatsoever was given for the 45 minutes delay in arrival. Information from the flight deck was very limited.

### "compensated with friendliness"
I booked this flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok via Amman return for its suitable departure time in Bangkok but mainly for its competitive price. For a budget airline, it was fine. Yes, there were delays. Yes the check-in took a long time. And yes the flight attendants were not so professional and smooth as with more upmarket airlines. But they compensated this with friendliness. The A320 was old, somewhat worn-out, but empty. The 787 was new but full. The fellow travelers matched the budget price point but were not too annoying. Since I was not expecting very much from the on-board meals, they were fine.

### "not very proactive on drinks"
Normally fly Qatar Airways but took advantage of the recent Royal Jordanian Airlines sub-£1k fares in business class to Bangkok out of London – so my review is using QR as a benchmark / reference. Overall, my first experience of RJ was of a good 3 star airline. Excellent new business class class seats on 787 across all 4 legs – seat 1D is a good choice as this seems to have greater foot-well space compared to the others which looked a bit tight. Food was decent but felt throughout all flights that cabin crew while pleasant enough were not very proactive on drinks, coffee etc. In fact the male crew just seemed to leave all the work to the female crew who seemed rather over-worked. Also 2 of the 3 pilots on the final leg from AMM-LHR spent most of the flight occupied in the lie-flat seats while leaving the control to a FO. Never seen this happen before and struck me as quite strange. AVOD was quite limited but very easy to navigate. Would use RJ again and one of the their key selling points at this price-point is their One World alliance membership.

### "A321 and not Boeing 787"
London Heathrow to Khartoum via Amman with Royal Jordanian. A321 and not Boeing 787 as advertised. Left Heathrow a bit late but arrived in Amman nearly on time. Cabin crew were efficient, plane was clean, and food was satisfactory. Flight was not full. A319 for onward flight to Khartoum-an older plane but on time. Again crew efficient and another reasonable meal was served. Inflight entertainment was basic. Return flight from Khartoum to Amman left on time, but only after security checks both in the airport and on the aircraft. RJ has warned that security checks have been modified. Flight to Amman an old but clean A319. Cabin crew were efficient but did not deal with screaming children who seem to run up an down the plane at will. Amman to London again no sign of the advertised 787 but another A321. Flights on time. Three hot choices for the meal and food was good. Overall a good trip. Khartoum airport is a nightmare - allow plenty of time - it has few facilities.

### "with pleasant staff"
We ended up flying Royal Jordanian from London to Hong Kong via Amman because we were travelling at Christmas time, when flights are expensive, and they had the cheapest seats we could find. I regularly travel on British Airways, and the RJ staff were equal or better than BA. The food was fine, but you don't travel economy and expect gourmet food. I think my only major issue with RJ is that on long flights such as the ones we took, it wouldn't kill them to give out free alcoholic drinks. Our tickets were well over £500 each, and a couple of glasses of wine surely wouldn't have broken the bank! Fortunately I read that they charged for drinks before leaving, so I bought a bottle of wine for the flight in duty free at Heathrow - make sure you get one with a screw top! The flights were all slightly late leaving, but not by much - we were late leaving Heathrow and Hong Kong due to airport congestion. The planes were fine, the A330 fairly new I think and the 787 very new, and feels spacious inside, with a seemingly taller ceiling. Flying to Hong Kong via Amman made it a long journey, about 18 hours going and over 24 coming home, due to a 6 hour stop in Amman, but there are many worse airports to spend a few hours in than Amman - try Addis Ababa or Nairobi. Amman airport is modern, spacious, airy and  clean with has good loo's etc. There are several bars and cafe's, McDonalds etc and good (and cheap) duty free shops. Royal Jordanian isn't going to set your world on fire, but it is a good airline with pleasant staff and modern aircraft, operating through their hub in Amman, which is not such a bad place to spend a few hours if you have a stopover there.

### "dread our return flight"
Bangkok to Tel-Aviv via Amman, and our flight with Royal Jordanian was among the worst we ever had. The crew was non-existent most of the time and when approached, less than accommodating. The food trays were distributed during the first half hour of the flight, then the crew disappeared until two hours before landing, when another food tray was given. If one required a glass of water (over a 9.5 hours flight!) we had to approach the crew in the screened-off galley and request one. No stewardesses passing by offering a drink or any other refreshments except for the very poor meals. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable, with pieces falling off and no leg-room, an ancient, unmodernised entertainment system. The only plus was that the flight arrived on time. It was a great relief stepping off the plane. I dread our return flight in a week's time.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew Royal Jordanian Airlines from Amman to Paris return. Airport staff at Amman efficient and polite, while at Paris airport was disorganized. The airplane was clean and was modern (appreciated the onboard entertainment) and the seats were comfortable. Food tasted delicious for economy class on both legs and they offered 3 main course options. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. My complaints are that before landing the toilet was dirty and required cleaning, and the ticket price is high.

### "flights on time"
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Amman with Royal Jordanian Airlines, and all 4 planes I took were pretty new with inflight entertainment and not bad leg room. Checked in online, all flights on time. The food was standard airline quality. I am rating this as 5 out of 5, basically because it is what you should expect from an airline.

### "would never recommend"
Doha to Beirut via Amman with Royal Jordanian. I would never recommend this airline. Our flight was delayed in Qatar, and that made us miss our connecting flight from Amman to Beirut. Once we reached Amman Airport the front desk staff told us that we will have to wait for 6 hours in order to connect with the available flight. When we started telling them that this is not an option since we have babies with us, they were very rude, and told us to go decide what we want to do then come back to them. What is worse is that the connection flight was delayed another time for another hour. So we ended up waiting for over 7 hours in the airport with our children. I would understand that problems may happen with flights, but the rudeness I experienced with the Royal Jordanian staff was the worst ever. Moreover, they had no control over their flight details, since it was showing on the screen that boarding started and no one was their to check the passports and tickets of the passengers. It was even showing last call on the screen, and still no one from the staff showed up.

### "never fly Royal Jordanian"
London to Bangkok via Amman. Unreliable, uncaring and unfair! No room at the Inn at Christmas for Royal Jordanian passengers who are left stranded at a full hotel after RJ cancel their onward flight, then RJ staff leave passengers to fend for themselves. The problems began when there were been 4 minor changes to my flight times over the past few months. The last change happened the day before I flew when they cancelled my 3.00am Boeing 787 flight from AMM to BKK and put me on an A330 9.30 flight to BKK on 17th December. When arriving in Amman airport, there were no staff to meet anyone to tell them what to do. We had to wait an hour before we were all bussed to the hotel at 1 am in the morning. The bus was overcrowded and had people standing in the aisles which is a safety hazard. The coach dropped the load of people off at the hotel who were unprepared, understaffed and unhelpful. It took a further 90 minutes sort out the mess and to check some people into a room, but there were not rooms for most of the passengers as the hotel was full. At around 2.30 in the morning, with no one from RJ any where around, I left to come back to the airport and slept on an airport bench. In the morning I wanted a shower in the RJ lounge. But they were extremely poor in the crown lounge at Amman airport. The sink hadn’t been cleaned, the shower door didn’t close, therefore water went everywhere and you can’t get the soap out of the dispenser because the door won’t close. Also the toilet seat was broken and you have to pay $15 for the privilege. It took nearly 2 weeks for RJ to respond to my complaint email, with a ‘sorry, but there’s nothing we can do, but we hope you fly with us again. What a joke of customer service. Dreadful airline, they change and cancel flight, treat passengers badly and then don’t even do anything when you complain. Never fly Royal Jordanian. There are plenty of choices, don’t risk it!

### "staff absolutely useless"
Medina to London via Amman. Royal Jordanian Airline is the worst airline I have ever used. The staff - as we walked in to the plane we were told you can sit wherever you would like, this meant that giving us designated seats was completely useless as people were searching for new seats because other people had taken their own. But the most shocking part was when the plane had decided to take off when they had not even allocated a couple and their 7 month old baby seats yet who were still standing in the isle. After getting off at Amman, the staff were even more disorganised - we landed at 1.45am and waited for transfer until 6am in the morning, to be taken to a hotel for only 2 hours and then bought back to the airport for our flight at 12pm. When we asked staff why it takes so long to sort out transfer, the airline had said it was the driver taking too long or we didn't have our transit forms completed. Every country I have been to before make people fill in these forms on the plane, and we weren't even given these forms till the end of the 5 hours. The Royal Jordanian Airlines staff both on and off the plane are absolutely useless.

### "can pre-book your seat"
Heathrow to Bangkok return via Amman on Royal Jordanian. Three sectors out of 4 were on a Boeing 787, very comfortable and good TV screen - Ifound plenty of watchable films. The final sector was on an A330, which seemed outdated compared to the 787 but was standard compared to other airlines. The food was adequate but be aware if you order Alcohol you will be charged for it - soft drinks are free. Transit in Amman is a joke, very chaotic and very rude Security Staff, I had goods confiscated from me, (which are not prohibited) - when I questioned them they became rude and aggressive. I am sure the goods were then shared out between them as a bonus! Check-in staff at LHR were very good, at Bangkok they were rude. As said many of the Cabin crew are surly and non smiling but some are. Whenever I pressed the call button for a drink etc they always came and I did not have to wait. My only criticism of Ground and Cabin crew (excl LHR) is that during the boarding of flights they do not board by Seat row, it gets very chaotic and the Cabin crew do not act to make the process smoother. On my Amman-LHR flight, many passengers were walking around the cabin asking other passengers to swap seats - this lead to a delay. You can pre-book your seat on RJ website in advance, so do that to ensure your party sit together. To pre-book just go to Manage booking - enter your reference number and enter few bits of extra info and then you can to it. I would have no hesitation in flying Royal Jordanian again.

### "found them excellent"
I was nervous about flying Royal Jordanian based on previous review but found them excellent. I flew from Abu Dhabi to Amman on an A320 aircraft - it was half empty in business and the service was very warm and friendly. Old style recliner seat was comfortable. A few days later I flew from Amman to Heathrow in Boeing 787 and it was excellent. The crew was excellent and food was outstanding - served on a large tray in a buffet style at your seat, and very tasty. Champagne and wine excellent and the seat was nice and lie flat. View is excellent with the larger windows. I wasn't watching the in flight PTV but it needed to be reset maybe 5 times - would have been annoying if I was watching. I may have been very lucky, but wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.

### "avoid Royal Jordanian"
Do a favor to yourself by avoiding Royal Jordanian Airlines. I flew them from Amman to Larnaca and was supposed to return and then fly to Zurich. Bad idea. Service sloppy and cold, staff look tired and overloaded with work, on board they served a cheap cheese sandwich with orange juice, for the price they charge they should do a little better. Cabin crew sloppy and uninterested. The plane needs an urgent refurbishment, on the way back they cancelled my flight and refused to book me with another carrier, I was so lucky my tickets were issued with mileage and I could change it to another airlines by phone. Never again.

### "worst airline I ever travelled"
Royal Jordanian Airlines is the worst airline I ever traveled with! I bought a flight from Abu Dhabi to Rome  via Amman and I had to change my departure and return day because both were cancelled. On my return flight (as it was delayed) I could not catch the connecting flight which was taking me home. I asked for assistance at Amman Airport and the staff told me that they could rebook it for the next day. I could not stay the night in Amman, I asked for other solution. They said that I can just run and catch the flight to Dubai that was leaving in 10 mins. As my original flight was to Abu Dhabi, I asked if they would pay for the transportation from Dubai to Abu Dhabi (around 300 AED taxi, to much money when you get back from holidays broke as me). They said that I should ask in Dubai. Conclusion: I had to spend my money and my time and getting back home and nobody compensated me for this inconvenience. Besides, my luggage of course never arrived to Dubai and I had to wait 2 days to get it back. If you can afford it, choose a serious airline to travel with.

### "corruption reigns it seems"
London to Bangkok via Amman return with Royal Jordanian Airlines. Problems started with Check in at Heathrow for a flight to Bangkok via Amman. I had booked an exit seat (I am 6’4”) but on checking in was told that I would have to pay extra for this. It was only £30, so I thought well I did not argue over that. Paid it and was given seat 25B (Boeing 787). When I boarded I noticed a dark stain on the carpet in the aisle in front of me. Being a nosey person I bent down touched it and it smelt like hydraulic fluid. I mentioned it to the Cabin Crew. A member photographed it and said it would be dealt with. The flight proceeded to Amman where we got off the plane for a 1.5 hour stay. No real issues – was shown to the Petra Lounge, very friendly and good standard of food and refreshments. Embarked for Bangkok, same aircraft, same stain – a little bigger now – asked new crew what it was – told that the cleaner had spilt some fluid and not to worry. I wasn’t placed in exit seat but after speaking with cabin crew and showing receipt I was moved back to 25. We arrived in Bangkok on time. Inflight entertainment was pretty naff and it wouldn’t have hurt for the cabin crew to crack a smile occasionally either. Return flight Check in – again told I had to pay for exit seat but not £30 - this time over £80 which they insisted in cash and were very reluctant to give a receipt. I paid it as I was too tired to argue. It was the same Dreamliner I had travelled out on, this time with a huge stain on the carpet. Cabin Crew said that engineers had been told but that the it wouldn’t be looked at until next service! Again poor catering and inflight service but landed safely in Jordan. Led to Petra Lounge where the staff had changed. Good food and drinks but you couldn’t relax as there was someone hovering over you all the time asking if you wanted more every 10 minutes and taking empty plates etc. I didn’t realise but they were clock watching too – as soon as two hours were up I was asked to leave! The flight was leaving from Gate 106 - went there and waited – no announcement but on the departure board changed to gate 116, OK an error I thought – went there. Waited till 30 minutes before departure nothing moving then an employee told us gate change to 224 (across to the other side of the Airport). Quite a rush but made it. Looked down to see an A321 crawling with engineers over the Starboard engine. Eventually we boarded and I was shown to an ordinary seat. I mentioned I had reserved and paid for an Exit seat but was told that I would have to pay in cash the Cabin Crew $100 if I wanted an exit seat. There were some free but I refused. A little later after take-off I witnessed some Arabic passengers just moving to the seats without any payment – corruption reigns it seems.

### "the worst airline experience"
I bought a Royal Jordanian Airlines return ticket for Dubai to Istanbul (with transfer in Amman), and this was the worst airline experience I've ever had. 2 days after buying the ticket I received an e-mail informing me of a change of timing - return in Dubai would be at 2:45am instead of 0:30am. No issue for me here. Talking to other passengers, they found out about the schedule change in the airport, when boarding. no email communication was sent to them. I tried to check in online for the Istanbul - Dubai flights, system error so do at the airport. Istanbul check in (as I was not able to do it online) spent over 1hr in the queue even though I got to the airport a good 2hrs before the flight. Royal Jordanian was the only airline in the airport that did not have a unique queue : each counter with it's own queue. 15 min before boarding time the lady at the counter I was queuing at announced that she would close the counter (as he had to go to the gate for boarding). She stayed after pressure from the angry passengers. I was checked in and out of passport control just in time for boarding! People who had their seats selected when buying the ticket, received different seating (initial selection was ignored) and even given seats in different rows for one leg of the flight. Boarding, no priority was given for passengers traveling with children. When leaving Amman, and just a few minutes after boarding was complete, the pilot announces that due to air traffic, we have to wait for 10 minutes - next PA announcement comes about 40 minutes later, informing us of technical issues with the plane that will be solved in another 10 minutes. Another 40 minutes (approx) pass without seeing a single crew member and without any announcement. Then one of the passengers comes from business class to inform a friend that we're changing planes. About 15 minutes later people are starting to get their luggage and leave the aircraft. The seatbelt sign was still on, nobody announced officially what was going on. We spent over 1.5 hrs in a hot plane without even being offered water, only misleading information, if any. In the terminal, again no PA announcements, only one employee informing the passengers in Arabic that in about half hour we would be given the take-off time. I had to ask for translation. In the end we boarded the same plane and we took off without so much as a 'sorry for the inconvenience' from Royal Jordanian Airlines staff and we landed in Istanbul with a 3hr delay (more than the duration of the flight). Inflight entertainment had a decent number of new movies on 2 of the 4 flights - there was some issue with the system and it either had to be restarted (takes about 20 min) or it was turned on late. Food and beverage - the food was decent but no water was offered during the delay even though the plane was really hot. Would I ever pay to fly Royal Jordanian Airlines again? No way.

### "no cabin staff to be seen for 9 hours"
Royal Jordanian Airlines from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv via Chicago and Amman. Shockingly unprofessional service at Chicago ticket counter. Longest flight leg of 14 hours from Chicago to Amman they served food twice, consisted mostly of stale bread and jam. No snacks or water in between, no cabin staff to be seen for 9 hours. Woman next to me pleaded for my water that was given with the meals, since I'd luckily brought water onto the flight. Inflight entertainment was odd. Usually I find at least two or three movies, didn't care to watch any of the ones offered, watched same few episodes of Brooklyn 99 repeatedly, can now completely reenact. Audio for another woman next to me kept going out. Lost part of my checked in luggage, have tried several times from different devices to make contact through Royal Jordanian Airlines website but has not worked. Would not consider flying with Royal Jordanian again except for very short, very cheap flights where I don't need to check in luggage.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
The plane was very noisy full of kids and crying babies. I could not go to sleep because of the noise, on the way back there was a delay of two hours with no reason or explanation from the staff or the pilot. It was so uncomfortable especially for my wife who was on a connection flight in Amman. My wife had a delay of one hour from her previous flight as well. Food is not super and I was given an expired salad dressing.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM to AMS was pleasant. My flight boarded through a collection of gates that had snack and duty-free shops. The gate area was very bland and confusing, as multiple flights were boarded over the loud speaker simultaneously. After waiting for about an hour, my bus for the plane finally boarded. I liked the design of the cabin, with nice seats in economy. All seats had PTV monitors and a selection of films, although the video quality was poor. The food resembled breakfast and tasted awful. Thhe flight attendants were courteous. The fares are far from the cheapest. Perhaps that's why there were only 16 people on my flight!

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
We were in the line for boarding line when suddenly we were told there was a 2 hour delay (no reason given). We all waited patiently until hour 2 hours later when again they delayed boarding and told us there was a technical problem. We waited 6 hours in Amman Airport, were treated like sheep, not being told anything. Finally we are boarded, when we over hear a steward mention that we have to stop in Tunisia to re-fuel. We were told this once the doors were shut and unable to get out of the plane. To top it all off when we asked for a bottle of wine, they have the nerve to charge us. It was warm too. The staff were rude.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Me and my family flew with this airline to Bangkok July of this year. For me and my family it is the worst airline we have flown with. The plane from London to Amman seemed rather new. It was clean and bright, seats were good with ok leg room. The staff were rude and to be honest looked like they would rather be elsewhere. The flight from Amman they split my family up over the plane so none of us were sat together and my daughter is only 10 years old. After a lot of complaining they got us sat together just before take off. But I did notice that many of the passangers had same problem. The plane from Amman to Bangkok (the longest part of the flight) was old and dirty and not a very pleasant flight. The food served was not very enjoyable. On the return flight the staff looked like they would like to be elsewhere. I will not fly with this airline again as I rate them as poor,

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
We were taking my 92 year old mother-in-law from Chicago to Jeddah via Amman. We brought her to the gate in Chicago in our own, personal, transport wheelchair. The attendant at the plane took the wheelchair and gave us a tag. In Amman, we asked for the wheelchair but it was not given to us. They said it would be taken to Jeddah. Instead, an airline wheelchair was used to transport her to our connecting flight. When we arrived at Jeddah, it was not there, and the Royal Jordanian staff were not helpful. We filed a claim for lost baggage as soon as we could. They have not gotten back to us, and will not answer their Chicago phone. I cannot begin to express how dangerous it was to transport a 92 year old without her chair. We are incredibly angry and disappointed with how Royal Jordanian airlines treat passenger's needed medical belongings. If I could rate them a 0.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
An extremely disappointing flight with barely edible food, no adherence to seat allocation, poor entertainment, indifferent staff service, and to cap it all they actually have the temerity to charge for a glass of wine. Bangkok-Amman leg was very poor and I have serious doubts about the quality of this airline. They need to learn about the idea of customer service.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Flight from Hong Kong to Amman via Bangkok was pretty bad. Online check-in did not work properly, had no option to choose my seat online or at the airport. The check-in staff were fine, but they worked for the airport, not the airline. The flight crew were unwelcoming and did not respond to requests or call buttons. The food was quite sub-par. The worst part, the flight left Bangkok just after midnight and for several hours the cabin flights went on and off, there were useless announcements from the crew and captain and at one point the flight attendants actually woke some people up asking if they wanted hot tea! Flight from Amman to Amsterdam was fine, much better flight crew and there were fewer than twenty people on the plane. They do charge for alcohol, even on the long haul flight, ridiculous. The in-flight entertainment was weak compared with most other airlines. In the end the flight was very cheap and the baggage policy from Asia to Europe was much better than any other airline.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-AQJ and return on Embraer, comfortable seats with excellent legroom. We were served juice on both legs, which was not really expected on a domestic 35 minute flight. Cabin crew great. No in-flight entertainment, but the inflight magazine had some interesting content. The fare was a bit on the expensive side.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Website is poor and online checkin never seems to work. Flight was full but boarding handled well and departure from AUH was on time. Meal service was average - behind the standards of EK, EY etc. Royal Jordanian has started charging for drinks in economy which is stingy. Meal trays cleared quickly then crew disappear for the rest of the 3 hour flight. Connecting flight Amman to Cairo delayed with poor communication at the gate. Onboard snack was a horrible stale sandwich and dry cake. No drinks service. A very basic 3 star service and cannot be recommended in economy class.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Amman - Dubai on A320. Check boarding and the whole pre-flight experience was really standard. To my surprise IFE was exceptional featuring new movies interesting documentaries etc. Some great options for a 3 hour flight. The seating space was tolerable for a flight of this duration (I'm nearly 2m tall). Inflight service was neutral at best. The staff were ok but were not really considerate at moments. One lady had to wait for 10 minutes with her baby in her arms while the trolley was giving out food. I suggested to the FA to move the cart back 3-4 meters so that the lady could go through but he wouldn't budge. The food was very bad I suggest eating ahead of your flight.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Flew New York JFK-Amman. Was very unimpressed by an airline with bottomless pockets. The flight was slightly late as we departed 45 minutes behind schedule. Like most people I didn't really care. After takeoff I ordered my food. My food was served room temperature and was of abysmal quality. When I tried to sleep my seat made a funny noise and then broke partially reclined. The cabin was full so I sat in an awkward position for 6 hours. The staff were indifferent and unhelpful. Will not fly again. Next time I need to go to Amman I will just connect in the UAE.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-LHR in Jan 2015 the aircraft a new B787 was more comfortable. The service was great and food delicious the plane arrived on time.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Flown AMM-KUL-AMM on the brand new 787-8. Excellent services started right from the Crown Class dedicated check-in area where they took care of my arrangements away from the airport rush then I went directly to the luxury of the crown lounge where you can enjoy a snack and a beverage in complete comfort and satisfaction then to the priority boarding (where I could be the last to board since I'm a J-Class pax) then the flight attendant wearing the traditional Jordanian robe welcomed and greeted me warmly from my first step she directed me to my fully flat bed seat equipped with state of the art IFE System and offered me a soft drink as well she granted Aigner amenity kit that contains what anyone could really need during the flight she offered headphones to start enjoying the modern intuitive IFE System shortly after take off Crown dining begins with tasty gourmet dishes of my own selection and preference then I was served a hot towel before I went to sleep I refreshed in the clean lavatory then I woke up for a healthy tasty breakfast before landing in BKK then after landing in BKK a new fresh crew joined to continue the flight directly to KUL in flight from BKK-KUL you have another full meal after landing On-time in KUL Crown Class Passengers leave the aircraft before opening the curtains of Economy Class to avoid rush. Excellent Services RJ.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
I took the KUL-BKK flight to experience the B787. This was my first time flying Royal Jordanian. My experience from check-in until arrival was excellent. Very friendly and attentive cabin crew the plane was silent and comfortable seat is very comfortable (more comfortable than Emirates seats) lavatory kept clean dining was ok and I really had an enjoyable flight. I would definitely consider flying Royal Jordanian in the future.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
VIE-AMM-BKK Business Class (4-8 Jan./2015). I was quite satisfied with all flights on RJ. The flight attendants were friendly responsive and committed. The food was very good and the inflight entertainment offered a great selection. The flight back from BKK to AMM was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather conditions. People complained however safety first! The delay was compensated with a Dreamliner aircraft (B787) that is quite comfortable (flat bed). Boarding in VIE was for all passengers (business and economy) at the same time. If you are not offered a welcome champagne don't mind to ask for it. It was served after the take off. If you are served left over drinks from other flights (e.g. wine) ask for a new bottle to please your in mouth entertainment. I have observed unfriendly passengers and RJ staff responded well.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
I would just like to state that our journey to and from Bangkok with Royal Jordanian was so disappointing. Despite the fact we didn't get the seats we had booked online as it was a different jet to the one specified when reserving online plus at the check in desk (this was mentioned to on board staff and no one cared) and that all the seats were damaged or in bad condition the staff were so rude. We boarded two flights outbound RJ112 and RJ12 17th Dec 14 and returning home 5 Jan 15 RJ183 and RJ111 (although staff on the RJ111 were slightly more polite) and the service was awful. I wouldn't use them again nor recommend RJ.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Newish planes with excellent comfort. Can supply quality meals and cater for food intolerances something other carriers like Turkish and Emirates cant (in my experience). Cabin service excellent. A flight delay on the return leg of 1 hour 45 minutes led passengers to be supplied with mineral water which is better than many European carriers who would have just left passengers with nothing.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
In all honesty I was skeptical to book with this airline but I went ahead and had absolutely no issues at all! The staff were very attentive and nice the pilot kept us up to date as to the weather and whether we would expect turbulence and he also said goodbye to all passengers when we left the food was good and the prices were incredibly fair. We went with this airline as we were relocating back from Melbourne to France and had lots of suitcases - with this airline they charge by the extra luggage item not the extra kgs. We flew to Hong Kong with another airline which and after a weeks holiday there we flew from HK to CDG in Paris with Royal Jordanian- we had no delays. All in all a very nice trip and I would definitely fly with them again!

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
DXB-AMM-BCN December 18th. The 787 experience on first leg has been the saving grace on this trip. Ground staff horrifically disorganised in Dubai nearly the same in Amman with no English and only able to respond "one minute one minute" to every single request. Cabin crew were good on both leg same to say about food and beverages. A319 equipment on AMM-BCN was a mess.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
KL-BKK-KL - new spacious dreamliner. Pretty comfy seats. However apart from this the airline served one of the worst meals - even budget airlines serve better food than RJ. Both flights from KL-BKK-KL serve the exact same lousy sandwich. Headsets no functioning and limited choices for movies. Pick this airline if you are not fancy about AVOD movies as well as food.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
As I wanted to take the opportunity to sample the 787 Dreamliner I booked a flight with RJ as our choice of travel back from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. I was very impressed with the spacious business class cabin and the clean ultra-modern interior that even my spouse (who is normally not very interested in the subject of air travel) noticed as very pleasant. The seats were of the soft-leader kind and it was hard to leave them upon arrival. The cabin crew was excellent and the Thai flight attendant did her utmost to make our flight as enjoyable as possible. But what was most noticeable above all was the fresh air during the flight. As I'm usually prone to nose and eye problems due to dry cabin air I was really surprised that I had none of these problems whatsoever during this flight. The only downpoint would be that the entire business class cabin was in 2-2-2 layout despite a trend nowadays to cater to solo travellers: in this cabin you still would have to climb over your neighbour if you end up in a window seat.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Travelled to KUL-AMM via BKK on 10 November and return 19 November on a 787 Dreamliner. Flight was almost full. Seats width and length is adequate but not comfortable for a 10 hours flight. Flight entertainment was very average headphone was poor and meals were poor too. The worst thing is the Thai nationality cabin crew (KUL-BKK) was very rude and inattentive. Magazine was boring. Lot's of room for improvement other than just new aircraft.

LHR-AMM-LHR late-October 2014. Interesting to travel on a Dreamliner but somehow I don't think nine-across in economy is exactly what Boeing had in mind with the 787. Service fine IFE quite limited would use again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
This quick 100 min flight was on an A320. Firstly I was very impressed with the RJ branding. Very modern yet true to its Arabic roots. The seats in economy were very comfortable. Lots of leg room and perhaps equally important a great recline angle. Individual IFE system was good and Jordanian food is amazing to begin with and RJ certainly didn't disappoint with its inflight meal. Impressed!

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-DXB October 26th 2014 . Maybe I gave too quickly my general conclusion. This flight has been quite horrendous: old tired A321 poor IFE toilets very dirty and smelly and rude disorganised Arabic crew with very poor to no English. Food was appalling seats were cramped and dirty. At least flight arrived on time.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Royal Jordanian Flight RJ166 Istanbul to Amman. Seats were comfortable. Limited meal choice. Quality of meal was fair not exceptional. Staff were obliging but not overly friendly. No alcohol (wine) offered with meal service.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
BCN-AMM. Pleasantly surprised by the high quality of service. Flight on-time RJ Chef d'Escale at BCN airport was friendly and efficient unlike rude ugly and dead fish-faced Groundforce check-in female staff unable to provide any reliable information. Boarding was a breeze service very diligent and food was good-quality far better than QR. A wide choice of beverages was offered as well. Black point: equipment was an A320 with cramped seats. Also crew had a very poor command of English. A nice effort to show will and sense of service however. To finish RJ offers a 4 stars hotel service with accommodation and meal for every single passenger having 8h+ transit. I just don't understand how this airline is just 3 stars rated while ridiculous Iberia has the same rating and grotty KLM or Saudia have 4 stars. Highly recommended.

Flight from Amman to New Delhi on 29th Aug. Flight was delayed 30 minutes but what was really disappointing was the in-flight services and attitude of cabin crew. Staff were not well versed in English making it difficult to communicate. When I asked for a drink air-hostess said yes but it never came. When I requested for a feedback form I was told they never carry them. However meal quality on-board was good.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Travelled from Montreal to Amman. Going to Amman wasn't as bad but the return flight was a horror. There's no legroom on the 330. The seats where so uncomfortable I felt I was sitting on wooden bench. The staff on the plane were so unfriendly not one smile. I could just feel the negative energy coming out of them. The food was pretty bad. We got served food at the beginning of the flight and just before landing. Nothing in between on the 10 hour flight. The worst experience was at Amman airport. There were only 3 counters open for all Royal Jordanian flights. They don't explain where you're supposed to go and the line ups are created as you go along. Very unorganised. All employees and officials at the airport looked like headless chickens. We got there 3 hours in advance with maybe 50 people in front of us. We ended up reaching the gate 30 mins before departure. We didn't event get a chance to go to the duty free. I previously booked my seat and it was confirmed but when we got the boarding pass I noticed it was different. It was too late to complain. When we got on the plane I found out the seat I originally chosen was assigned to 2 other people (unbelievable). As a summary I will never fly with Royal Jordanian.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Moscow to Dubai via Amman on 10 August in Business class. Flight was delayed leaving Domodedovo however flight attendant talked to us during the flight and assured us that the connection would be fine and we would be met at the airport in Oman and shown the way to the gate for the connecting flight to Dubai. Business class had only three people so we were first off the aircraft and sure enough the airline rep met us and quickly directed us to the gate all this was handled smoothly and professionally. Flight was good food was wonderful especially the middle eastern dishes. Wine and other choices was wonderful. Amenities kit was fine had all the essentials Seats were comfortable but not fully flat. On two relatively short flights of 4.5 hrs and 3.5 hrs this isn't really an issue.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Great flight from Abu Dhabi to Amman last month for a long weekend vacation. Seats were very comfortable compared to other airlines with such short duration flights. Flight was on time and crew was very attentive. Thanks for the pleasant experience RJ.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
TLV-DXB-TLV via Amman and again the same good experience with RJ. All 4 flights exactly on time no issue with service on board although the movie selection is fairly limited. Food was good and legroom on A321 more than adequate. Amman airport is a breeze to transit through and RJ crown lounge comfortable although food selection is very very basic and internet can be unpredictable. The rate was so cheap in comparison with any other choice. RJ are a good dependable airline and my first choice for travel inside the Middle East. They beat Emirates and Etihad hands down on flights to the UAE. Highly recommend.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
LHR-AMM-BKK-HKG and return in Crown Business class. Downside seats comfy but not state of the art long layover in Amman on the return. Upside the crew all were so nice on all flights welcoming personable and keen to please. Food excellent far better than BA Club World. Wine: I found wines that I liked. Jordanian red very nice. Thick hot towels that put BA to shame and so many. Amenity kits far better than BA's gym bag. Quick priority boarding at Heathrow and at Hong Kong. Boarding at Amman a little confused. Amman to London we were served non- alcoholic drinks before push then after take off drinks of choice with nuts and crudities with tangy tomato dip starter salad mains served from the trolley cheese with port and choice of desserts with cognac. Sublime.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
LHR-BKK via AMM return. British Airways lounge in T3 nice and quiet. On time departure for all legs of the journey. Service was basic food was mediocre wine service was a struggle being served after the main course on all legs and no offer of re-fills to the tiny glass . Lounge in AMM is fine but not overwhelming for a new airport. Check in in BKK was poor 1 desk for business class with 5f for economy. It was quicker to use the economy desks! Angled flat seat not very comfortable for sleeping. Overall a poor experience made worse by the struggle to get my Avios points awarded.

Mar 16 RJ183 BKK-AMM. Mar 19 RJ117 AMM-CDG. Apr 12 RJ118 CDG-AMM. Apr 13 RJ182 AMM-BKK. Flights onboard A330 A320 and A340 in crown class. Happy with seat comfort on all flights and attention of the female crew. Food on all flights was fine except it would be nice to have wine on the main meal carts rather than it arriving 10 minutes later. Could improve service. On return flight from Paris had a 4 hour stopover in Amman the lounge has a basic to say the least food selection. No call or special queue for crown class (as in Paris and BKK) which was a letdown after the long stopover.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
ORD-AUH-JFK via Amman. A340 on the long haul legs and A319 for the short ones. On all flights the crew were great lots of smiles checking to make sure everything was OK and ready to help. Food and drinks were good although wines are limited selections. Inflight entertainment was enough to kill the hours. Seats in A340 not lie flat but very comfortable. They start the 787 service to the US in June. lounge in new terminal at Amman was an oasis of calm and quiet.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
TXL-BKK-TXL via Amman. The flight to Bangkok was good. Both flights were on time. Staff on board were very unfriendly. I did not see one smile. The flight back was horror. First we had a 2.5 hours delay in Bangkok. Same unfriendly staff on that flight. In Amman we were there for 12 hours! Ground staff did not tell the truth. We were delayed from hour to hour. Our flight completely disappeared from the screens for an hour. The only information you got was: No information. The only good thing on the flight back was the flight staff from Amman to Berlin. They gave us extra warm meals and for the first time I saw a smile. We were glad to get back to Berlin.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Domestic flight with RJ from Amman to Aqaba return. A very good experience with Embraer 195 for a short flight (about 30 min) but the airport staff from Aqaba not skilled (totally different in Amman). The best legroom I've experienced.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Took long haul flights to Amman and London from Kuala Lumpur. First time on RJ and to Jordan. Both my husband and I are tall. My husband being 6 ft 2 and I being 5 ft 8. The economy class seats do not accommodate tall individuals as the seats have no legroom and are very low to the ground. Both of us had a nightmare time with seating and wound up paying extra for exit seats all through our journey. Seats are not maintained and toilets are atrocious. A very worn out out-dated airline. Will never travel on it again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
LHR-AMM-DME. Relatively cheap price for such a routing great seats especially on the new A320 on the AMM-DME sector. Excellent staff on both sectors as well.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-HKG-AMM. Loved their A330 despite the lack of individual ventilation. 3 full meals each way (snack breakfast and dinner for AMM-HKG and snack dinner and breakfast on HKG-AMM). Staff were very friendly as well. No complaints.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Another round-trip VIE to HKG via Amman price the cheapest on route Food good Seat Angled Flat Crew friendly IFE did not change - so frequent travelers run out of new movies unfortunately no priority in Boarding for Business Class guests and use of remote stands. Lounge in Amman - a real letdown - 15 dollar fee for shower unedible food slow internet. After my last trip this trip showed all weaknesses of their service. With simple measures they can improve a lot. It might depend on the crew which is servicing you.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
I have taken the Cairo-Amman round-trip flight numerous times on a few different airlines. I flew with Royal Jordanian on the last three flight segments and I would not recommend it. The interior quality of the planes were poor 2/3 times and the seats in economy class do not easily accommodate someone taller than 5'10" (too tight for the knees). The staff and crew seem unapproachable and disinterested. It is also irritating that if you book online you then have to be pulled aside at check-in so they can verify your card. I understand the concept but the fact that they force you to step out of line and then wait in line again after they finish is really frustrating. I don't understand why they cannot invest in card reader machines at the check-in kiosks particularly at the new airport where RJ is the resident airlines. Most other modern-day airlines have figured this out.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Have booked 5 separate round trips from London to Amman in business class on the wide body A330 because I like space and not being cramped on long flights like this. Every flight they have changed it to an A321 single aisle small plane. It is a waste of time complaining. They are false advertising a larger aircraft but giving you a cramped and claustrophobic ride on a small jet instead.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
VIE-AMM-HKG-AMM-VIE October 2013: very nice experience with a good price. Vienna: separate bus for Crown Class guests - but Economy passengers boarded first so had to wait on the tarmac - Business on A320s are real business class seats 2-2 config good food and inflight entertainment. Transfer in Amman very smooth long layover - lounge really nice lots of seats only downside is the food in the lounge. No priority boarding for Business class for the flight in Amman to BKK/HKG. A330 really nice angled flat seats amenity kit missing ear plugs but the rest is really nice friendly staff good food and drinks. maybe more choice of English newspapers would be nice. Stop in Bangkok you have to stay on the airplane arrived early into Hong Kong. Return also very good little longer stop in BKK. Didn't understand why parked a remote stand in the morning in Amman but separate bus transfer for business was a nice treat. Transfer smooth again again lounge food can be improved. Overall a nice experience and I will fly them again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
TLV-AMM-DXB and back and I have to say that RJ have come very far. Great clean planes with comfy seats on a combination of A321 and A330. Great entertainment system with many option and excellent sound quality. Pleasant staff especially in the air. The price was actually very competitive but I did book early. All connections were on time and my luggage arrived quickly. Transfer at the new airport in Amman was very smooth even on return with a very short connection. The new terminal definitely adds to the overall RJ experience. This airline deserves to be upgraded to 4 star and I am sure it will happen pretty soon.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
DEL-AMM-ORD on 12 October. Royal Jordanian didn't disappoint - their flights were just as good as my trip over on 11 September - see my review. Friendly check-in at Delhi Terminal 3 - got a pass to the General Lounge and a smile from the check-in agent. Lounge was awful but again it is not a RJ lounge so won't count it against them. Boarding A319 plane on time and on-time departure. Really friendly Purser and attendants - left me alone to sleep and when I woke offered me the full breakfast. Inflight video is the only letdown - just not alot of choices. Landed 30 min late into Amman due to headwinds (6 hour flight from Delhi). Quick transit at the new Amman airport - thru security and to the gate. Extra security for USA flights but that is typical. A340 from Amman to Chicago. Same plane as I flew on 11 Sept. Flight was very full - 95% in Y 90% in Crown Class. Initially flight attendant didn't come with water or a hello but then the purser saw me (I was in the last row and she was up in the forward galley) and brought me water and a smile. She made this flight great along with another flight attendant. Smiles - constant refills on drinks. The food on RJ is awesome! Flavourful and quantifies are massive. Main meal was great and the 2nd meal just as healthy and tasty. Movies the same as the outbound but did some work and watched DVDs. Arrived 40 minutes early. I am very impressed with Royal Jordanian.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
I flew several legs with RJ. Every flight departed late with no explanation or apology. On the long-haul sector of my journey with RJ (Amman to Bangkok) the seats were badly maintained the WC was dirty (pools of urine on the floor). When I raised the state of the WC with the flight attendant he merely blamed dirty passengers. Post flight I complained to the customer service unit and their responses were evasive. Then they didn't credit points across to my oneworld partner frequent flyer account. I would not recommend this airline for a long-haul flight.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Could not get better AMM-BEY-AMM. Both legs on Embraer 195 the seats are super comfortable fit for flights with a duration of up to 4 hrs. The duration is 1.55 hrs we were offered 2 sandwiches and dessert of a cupcake. The captain performed his tasks in an excellent manner the landings and takeoffs were super smooth. Recommend to all cannot compare it with Middle East Airlines- a competitor on this route.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Excellent trip - 11 Sep from Chicago to Dubai via Amman in Crown Class. Check-in quick with friendly agents - given pass to Air France/KLM lounge in Chicago. Plenty of food and drinks literally next to the departure gate. Boarding priority for Crown Class - directed to my seat on the A340 by friendly FA from Romania. She and the Purser continued excellent service from take-off to landing - friendly and personable. Only 1/3 full so lots of space - older style seat but so much room! You basically had 5 aircraft windows of space when reclined. Food service old-style - on a cart for each passenger to be serviced individually - very classy. Quality and quantity of food excellent. Entertainment was ok - they need more options for films and TV shows. Arrived 1 hour early into Amman - transit in the lounge - more high quality food. Dubai flight was full A321 - again great service and excellent food. Landed on time and bags were out relatively quickly. I look forward to my return flight back to Chicago.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
I flew from DXB to AMM and found the service to be very good. Crew was excellent and seat comfortable enough on A321. Return from AMM to DXB flight was left on time and arrival in DXB was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Asked for EMEX and check in counter were very pleased to issue the BP with EMEX seating. Overall I will fly RJ again in the near future and hope they will expand the route to the South East and Far East Asia.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Paris - Amman - Bangkok I/O. I do not recommend economy class regarding the too limited space between the seats. Uncomfortable if you are are taller than ±5.7 ft. Had to pay an extra $95 at BKK on outbound flight in order to get the first seat facing the partition wall. Crew Rather little kind and rare smiles.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
My wife and I have just returned home to Perth Western Australia from a holiday to Israel and flew on crown class from Kuala Lumpur to Tel Aviv and I will freely admit to being a little dubious after reading several reviews as to how the journey would be however I was more than pleasantly surprised at the quality level of service that we received from the seating comfort to the excellent in flight service and the gourmet meals ( served with silver service ) apart from a half hour delay of departure at Amman airport on our return journey the rest of our flights were punctual. We had a 2.5 hour transit stop over in Amman and found the business lounge to be excellent with a range of very comfortable lounge seating together with a fine complimentary variety of well prepared food and drink. We are planning a trip to the U.K. next year and will certainly consider flying with R.J. via Amman again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
BKK-KUL return on A330-300 - what a beautiful aircraft! First flight ever on RJ and looked forward to this new experience. Turned out to be a disappointment although the aircraft was modern with good IFE. The meal was bad both ways and their service by a Thai crew disappointing. The Jordanian head stewardess on KUL-BKK sector was superb though. Other reviews suggest RJ to be very good on long-haul but this intra-Asian sector turned out to be a disappointment. The hardware is there but they are way behind MH or TG.

I really like the service and the fact that you can choose the exit seat free of charge. They also have more choices on the menu than other carriers along with nice staff.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
London to Erbil good service especially considering full flight not aware of the problems of allocating families together as travelling alone but in my experience most sole travellers quite happy to move especially as family groups tend to fit best in the unpopular centre rows. Legroom my greatest consideration when flying economy was generous - 2 inches more than rivals and IFE very good. Food was fine and wine drinkable and £ at least 200 less than similar routes ie. via Turkey or Austria. Always happy with RAJ and new airport terminal at Amman improves experience.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
First time travelling RJ from London to Amman to Madinah and Jeddah to Amman to London return. Reserved seats for all four flights for me my wife and 8 year old daughter. Not one of the flights had us seated together. Had to request other kind passengers to move. Food is fish meat or veg with same sauce. Seats were average with leg room better on the short haul flights than the long haul which was irritating. A lot of the passengers were unhappy with the allocation of seats. Looks like RJ cant deal with full capacity.

Non Stop from AMM-JFK. Nice efficient service. Two full meals served 12h 30m flight time. Entertainment system a little aged. New Terminal with a very nice lounge.

YUL-AMM-BKK. Check-in counter opened 1 hour before flight. Gate number announced was wrong and they didn't bother putting the correct number. We had to go though the whole concourse to try to find a RJ staff member that just said "the flight will be 3 hours late". During the flight there were 2 babies that did not want to be quiet and staff were not doing anything about it. When a passenger pressed the call button it was very loud so was impossible to sleep. TV at my seat was broken. The staff's answer was "sorry". But the second portion of the flight and the return went without issues. Food was great. I recommend this airline overall.

Flew Chicago (ORD) to Amman round trip in May 2013. First flight was alright served a good dinner then most flight attendants disappeared for most of the flight until about one hour before landing when a very basic breakfast was served. No refreshments in between. My luggage was lost. On the flight from Amman to Chicago 13 hour flight it was more pleasant 2 main meals were served the food was great and drinks and sandwiches were served in between. Flight attendants were very good. Seat comfort was about average. In-flight entertainment was excellent in both flights Arabic English and some French and Indian movies.

Travelled last week from Ohio to JFK then JFK to Jordan. Arrived at JFK at 3pm and had to wait until 10.30pm to fly to Jordan. Arrived at the gate to find out flight delayed until 1am. After waiting nearly 10 hours they started the boarding process. When my turn came they told me my ticket was not valid and my seat sold. Told my boarding pass was not valid. Told the plane was overbooked and there were no seats available. The crew and the flight manager told us they would schedule us for the next flight. Told to call Royal Jordanian office and book our own tickets. It was 2am in the morning. After 6 hours of calling a member of staff helped us reserve a ticket. Had to wait another day to leave but this was the best we could find. They did not pay for the hotel transportation or even money for food. I do not recommend flying with RJ because they do not care about their customers.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
DXB-AMM and AMM-IST in business. A321 from DXB and E95 from AMM. Cabin was tired in both planes as leather seats in business were cracking and interior generally faded. Otherwise a comfortable experience - impeccable service and delicious food. Flights were on time and efficient. Entertainment on both flights OK but still not at standard of many other airlines. E95 had portable entertainment units and the first two provided did not work. However overall a pleasant experience and I would fly them again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
CDG-AMM-KUL. Food was delicious and plentiful on all sectors. Transit in Amman less smooth due to poor service from Airport security. Service was courteous and friendly. I did slide down the seat which although flat does have quite a slope. Transit stop at BKK (had to remain on board and the cabin was hot with doors open and rowdy with Economy passengers wandering around trying different Business Class seats) marred an otherwise pleasant journey. Arrived KUL ahead of schedule despite the slight delay at Amman.

BKK-HKG. Ground staff were rude at BKK. I'm the ruby status for Oneworld alliance and entitled check-in at business class counter. However the staff member told me "line for business class only and you have to line up for economy class". I told her I was ruby status for oneworld she did not care. In-flight was so-so! Only sandwich served. In-flight entertainment was good! A lot of the latest movies to choose from.

VIE-AMM-AUH DXB-AMM-VIE in economy. Very nice experience. Cabin was in good shape and there was above-average legroom. Aircraft's were equipped with AVOD with really good selection of movies. Cabin crew ranged from average to excellent. Finally meal was very good and in economy there was choice of 3 meals which is rather unusual although they could have run few more rounds of drinks given the length of flights. The only downside is Amman airport which is not exactly a great experience. In addition they weren't able to issue boarding pass for our connecting flight in Dubai which could have complicated our short transfer in Amman but fortunately we arrived to transfer desk as first passengers from our flight. It is noteworthy that once many people with same problem from our flight came to transfer desk they quickly opened 4 more counters so I guess they were well-prepared for this.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Flew from BKK to AMM on A330 - was disappointed. Food was very basic tiny portion and only 1 hot meal served on 11 hour flight. The seat hurt. The flight attendants did not give water throughout the flight but slept and talked at the rear of the aircraft. Toilets were filthy never cleaned throughout flight. The entertainment system was good with new movies and touch screen. My first time on RJ and I think it will be my last.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
I read about this airline before I left Australia and had some concerns however after 4 flights with them my wife and I both agree that this is a good airline. Yes food is simple but OK yes there is no alcohol openly served but I got some wine. Seats were comfortable and the fights were all on time with a modern fleet of aircraft. We had no problem with the inflight service it was all very friendly. All but one flight was not booked out and we could move and stretch our legs and get some shot eye. My wife and I said we would both be happy to fly Royal Jordan airlines anytime in fact they deserve a higher rating than they have received.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
HKG-BKK-HKG. Being in high season for Chinese new year this was one of the few biz class I could still book at short notice first time flying with them and feeling hesitant about the next time given the less than satisfactory experience. Boarding in HKG and BKK was good and orderly. The leather seat was impressive enough. Rather comfortable but angle-lie flat (i.e. feeling like sliding down) makes you think twice about flying anything longer than 5 hours with them. Service was fine friendly and efficient enough. However flying at 9pm from HKG to BKK. I was only served 3 mini open sandwiches instead of a dinner first time feeling hungry after a biz class flight! No fast track immigration card available when reaching BKK this was very disappointing. Return flight fared better but when I stepped on board they were too busy doing other chores hence no greetings! Finally was served a full lunch which was of good quality. Other than that the IFE was ok although choices a bit limited. What I most disliked was to see some of their off-duty staff (not in uniforms) occupying biz class seats. Luggage in HKG arrived last even thought marked priority bags.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-DXB-AMM. Brilliant flight as usual. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive food was delicious and abundant and the seat was very comfortable with ample legroom. A bit of delay in departure but that was due to Dubai immigrations and not RJ but we ended up arriving on-time. Very much recommended!

AMM-DXB and back flight was excellent as usual. I fly this route very regularly and RJ proved to be the best operating this route. The food was excellent and delicious (Fish with Rice) and the entertainment was even better. Would recommend RJ.

Amman to Doha. Another very good onboard experience with RJ. Food as usual was delicious flight attendants extremely attentive the Embraer 195 aircraft clean with great comfortable leather seats. However I have to admit that RJ ground staff are not so good and need to be trained to be more transparent with passengers. Our flight was delayed for 2 hours and each RJ rep at the airport gave a different story and they were all obviously clueless and kept us in the dark with no update of any kind. It's a shame that RJ has such great flight attendants and yet untrained unprofessional ground staff.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
FRA-AMM-BKK-AMM-FRA. Flights FRA-AMM and AMM-FRA operated on Airbus 320 with built-in entertainment system. Food was inexpensive but ok for the price paid. Crew members were nice and passenger caring. Crown Lounge in Amman is poor and requires major investments plenty of personnel there who are actually doing nothing for the passengers. AMM-BKK return legs on Airbus 330 aircraft were not new but still met the regular comfort standards. Entertainment system's choice is slightly wider compared with RJ medium-haul but still poor when compared to other Arab airlines flying to BKK. Crew were inattentive and responded poorly to passenger needs. Nothing to say or remember about the food average is a right word for the entire experience.

LHR to Tel Aviv via Amman return. Food was excellent including surprisingly a full hot lunch on the 40 minute Amman-TLV sector. Flight attendants on all sectors were courteous smiling and generous with food and drinks. Seats were comfortable. Transit in Amman was quick and efficient. My first time with Royal Jordanian and I'm quite a satisfied customer.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
BKK-AMM-LHR-AMM-BKK to take advantage of stop-over on outward leg to visit Petra. The TG lounge at BKK’s E concourse cannot cope when it is over-packed with late evening flyers the food selection is very poor. Last- minute gate change not announced in the lounge resulting in a long back-track. A330 angled flat seats are the most comfortable of many I have experienced and I managed sleep on the night sectors. Arrival at Amman was a huge let-down. No-one at the currency exchange and no officer at the visa on arrival desk. Bag took 45 minutes to arrive. The new terminal cannot open soon enough. At LHR there was another 45 minutes wait for the bags of about 20 passengers whilst all other bags cleared within 30 minutes. Transit in AMM en route back from LHR was as bad with lengthy waits to get near the departure gate and absolutely no organization. On the other hand meals on the AMM-LHR sectors were excellent as was the smiling service. The replacement of the A330 with an A320 for LHR-AMM was no hardship even though the seat pitch is considerably reduced. BA’s Terminal 3 lounge with excellent food and drinks was almost empty for a full 2 hours before the flight. RJ provides a very good service. It's a pity the airports let it down.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-DXB (return). RJ are really improving. Seat was very comfortable dinner of rice with fish which tasted very good. AVOD is also good but I didn't use it. Return was in business class which was even better than economy. I recommend it.

Amman to Aqaba on Embraer175. Served a full hot meal tea coffee and water on this very short 40 minute flight. The 3 flight attendants were very helpful. The leather seats were comfortable and the flight was only half full so I was lucky to have an empty seat next to me. RJ has improved tremendously lately and I really hope they stay this way.

LHR-BKK via Amman. First leg was rather packed surrounded by flight crew from a previous flight. Service was fast and polite and I was kept supplied with beer for the majority of the flight. Meal was nice as was the silver service treatment. Second leg was generally friendlier. Despite most of the passengers being asleep I didn't get the feeling that the crew were disinterested. Managed to sleep for an hour or so without falling out of my chair but I never have them in the full sleeping position anyhow. My only slight gripe was not being able to have a beer as my arrival drink which other airlines seem to allow although I was given a beer as soon as the cabin crew started moving in air. IFE had more than enough to keep me occupied throughout the flights. At LHR I made full use of the fast track immigration and the BA lounge was in tiptop shape very good selection of beers and wines spirits were so so. Good (ish) view of the runway and some parts of the terminal. Toilets were spotless too the cleaner seemed to clean after every passenger. Amman's Lounge was reasonable ample seating but very few plug sockets. Bar was somewhat limited but being a Jordan I didn't really expect it to be as overtly displaying alcohol as London.

Economy class from KL to Amman via Bangkok return last week. In-flight service lousy and slow. Cabin crew not only unfriendly but rude. They informed that that they do not take and fill water containers we need to proceed to their station to fill the containers. I proceed to the station and asked them to fill up my water container and what I got is "We are busy sit down". I proceed to another station at the back where they rudely informed me there is not enough water to go around. Bread served with the meals was not only cold but hard as rock. They do not say excuse me when pushing the cart and when they bump into you they just ignore you and push the cart away. During stopover at Bangkok no one is allowed to use the toilet. I feel that the crews only do the bear minimal throughout the flight.

Berlin to Bangkok via Amman. First sector on a very new-looking A319 with individual IFE's. Provided with a hot meal on take-off free unlimited alcoholic drinks for economy and a hot pizza slice shortly before arrival. The crew were serious but courteous. The service was quick. Our transit in Amman exceeded 6 hours and we were pleasantly surprised to be shuttled to the Golden Tulip Queen Alia Hotel. Amman to Bangkok was on a larger A330 again with individual IFE's 2 full hot meals and a snack and attentive service. The price was very cheap and I would fly them again considering the price quality and quantity of food and IFE's with lots of Western films and programs.

Amman to Paris on A321. Business class was comfortable for a single aisle plane. Served champagne and hors d'oeuvres before take-off. Flight was around 5 hours but were served 2 full hot meals during it with real china . This has never happened to me before on any airline on a similar duration flight. The choice of meals was delicious especially the Arab dishes. The drinks kept flowing. Flight attendants were courteous and friendly. We were also handed out souvenirs from Jordan on arrival which was a nice touch. RJ's business class really impressed me and I will fly them again.

Flew LHR-BKK via Amman in business class. Service was slow only offered 1 drink before dinner served food which was ok wine served after dinner was finished. Requested a further drink and got sneered at and it showed up 20 mins later. Tried to use the toilets and was accused of being in economy whilst in the toilet a steward banged on the door! We fly business class as a treat when we go on holiday - there was nothing about any of the 4 flights we took that was a treat - the service is slow surly and at times rude . We will never fly this airline again.

AMM-BEY-AMM. Amman-Beirut: on an embraer; clean leg room was ample and food okay for the trip of 45-50 minutes. Food consisted of a croissant and a cup of juice. Beirut-Amman: on an airbus A319 clean aircraft with comfortable seats and good leg-room food consisted of a cupcake and a cup of juice. Would recommend it as RJ is improving very much and I prefer it when traveling. Note: in-flight entertainment was simple it consisted of commercials and videos however there were screens for every passenger.

LHR-CMB and BKK-LHR both via AMM. London to Amman in economy both ways on a new Airbus A321. Flights originally scheduled to be operated by A330-200 type aircraft. Very long flight on A321 but seat and pitch was comfortable and offered good leg room. Food however in economy was not good and certainly did not match economy meals of other airlines in the Middle East. Crew were pleasant and helpful on both flights. Amman to Colombo on A330.and upgraded to business class. Seats impressive and offered great comfort and easy to sleep in. Food was excellent as was service. I can only echo the same on the Bangkok to Amman flight which again was in business class. My only issue would be the infight entertainment which is very poor as the movie and music channels offer little choice or variety. Amman airport is terrible to transit in. Toilets are dirty and no nice restaurants or comfortable seating. By far the worst airport I have been in transit through.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
DTW-BEY. I didn't like the comfort of the seats - not much leg room. I don't recommend the food. Entertainment was excellent. Overall staff very friendly and attend to your needs and wants.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok on Royal Jordanian. It was a transit flight so after Bangkok it went to Amman. The flight was packed and the seating was a slight issue both going and returning from Bangkok. Stewardess had to rearrange certain people and the fussy people who insisted on sitting with their family added to the problem. The seats were as comfortable as any other economy seat would be.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-LHR. By far one of the most pleasant flights of the year. I was shocked when I saw the interior of RJ's cabins. They are exactly like Virgin-America's White Leather seats with a fairly decent recline for a 3+ hour flight to LHR. Food was excellent service was excellent and friendly and the ground staff/lounge facilities were wonderful in AMM. Crown Class check-in at Queen Alia was actually a unique experience and was more like a first class experience than a business class. I would have flown RJ from NYC to AMM non-stop rather than connect with BA in LHR which was a horrible experience. Keep it up RJ!

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Mumbai-Amman-Amsterdam. At check-In in Mumbai we had to queue for more than one hour. The flight was excellent the food was great the movies weren't the best in the entertainment program but otherwise everything was great. Extra point: we could book a one day stopover and spent a nice day in Amman. On arrival to Amman we were asked if we would like to change our flight for the same day as they still had seats. Amman Airport is working well we needed twenty minutes from arriving to the airport to sitting at the gate.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-BEY on an nice clean embraer. Leg room is average cup cake was served. The trip was only 45-60 minutes. But what I really liked is RJ has a security check on board their aircraft's. FAs were okay all in all average flight.

Bangkok-Amman-Beirut on 16th of August 2012. First leg was fantastic. The flight was on time and the seats for Business on the A330 were just like those of any other airline. The meals were delicious and filling and the cabin crew were friendly Inflight entertainment was also good. Transit in Amman was easy and hassle free the new terminal that's almost finished looks very nice. Our short flight to Beirut was also spot on time. I will definitely be flying RJ again!

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Flight on time from AMM to JFK. Clean aircraft decent entertainment and legroom good food and lovely cabin crew who worked hard given the demanding passengers who each seemed to have a handful of kids. The only thing that let down the experience is the miserable Amman airport - old tired and in worse shape than the last time I went through it two years ago. The new terminal is due to open in January but I'll believe it when I see it. Overall a good experience that I would recommend.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Business Class LHR to BKK via Amman. Crew seemed rather bad tempered with each other on first leg possibly due to impact of Ramadan as this was an early evening flight before fasting had ended. Seats in need of maintenance; three personal light fittings missing on four seats in rear two rows headphones not working on first leg footrest broken on my seat on the second leg. Seats are angled flat on the A330 OK as long as footrest is working properly! Food good both flights very punctual transfer in Amman straightforward.

Doha to Amman. Embraer aircraft clean nice leather seats spacious. Flight attendants were friendly on a full flight. Pleasantly surprised with our hot lunch which was delicious and generous (3 choices of fish chicken or beef) a sandwich was also handed out before arrival. All this on a 2.5 hour flight! Price was just right. Highly recommended.

My wife travelled with our 6 month old child yesterday 7/3/2012 departing from NY JFK airline RJ 261 to Amman Jordan she was promised an infant bassinet they never gave her the bassinet. Staff informed her that there weren't any left very rudely and unprofessionally. To top it off she had to stay in her seat the whole trip time with the baby in her lap.

I travelled from Amman to Paris mid-June. Punctual operation clean interior friendly staff and a TV screen in seat. The selection of TV programs included recent movies which I did not expect. The flight was virtually effortless except for one flight attendant who I felt was a bit lazy. Overall it was a good experience. I will definitely fly Royal Jordanian again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Staff are unprofessional. Our seats were changed several times. Our flight was delayed which is expected but how they handled it was very poor.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Touring Holiday to Amman. Aircraft was fairly new however the cleanliness of the toilets left a lot to be desired. The food was very poor. You don't get cans of drink you only get one drink poured. One cup of tea or coffee with your meal. Staff were disinterested in passengers. Passengers appeared to be an unwanted distraction to the staff being able to laugh and joke with each other. We upgraded to business class going out and what a disappointment that was. The food was somewhat better than economy but not by much. Would we recommend Royal Jordanian – definitely not?

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
My husband and another couple travelled Amman to Bangkok on 12 June 2012. We had booked economy class and 15 minutes before boarding an announcement was made that there were 6 crown class seats available at an unbelievable price so we snapped them up. Everything was done in a professional manner and my husband escorted back through security after completing the payment. It was the best flight we have experienced and were all able to get a good amount of sleep. Staff were professional and attentive and the meal was good and also the entertainment system.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Business Class from Heathrow to Bangkok return. Maybe called Business Class but not world class. Bit miffed to be charged $15 for a shower in the Crown lounge at Amman and then to find that the shower was dirty ill maintained and with no selection of toiletries. I am very disappointed.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Chose to fly Hong Kong - Bangkok return as they had a good priced fare. A330 aircraft both ways was reasonably new and the interior was reasonably clean. Inflight entertainment was quite good with a choice of recent movies. The biggest let down was the food and the staff. Meal choices were identical on both journeys and were very average in quality. I didn't like the soft drinks being poured out of 1.25L plastic bottles it was quite low-rent instead of being served a can. Contracted airport staff were surly and I didn't get the seats I had chosen online both ways. Onboard staff were disinterested and rarely interacted with passengers. It was as though they were there to get the least done as possible to get through the flight. They were very unprofessional particularly the males who were laughing and joking around. For me airline staff make or break and airline. On this airline they didn't impress therefore don't recommend this airline.

Travelled Business Class from Kuala Lumpur to Amman via Bangkok. All up it was a very pleasant flight. The food and drink was very good the staff friendly and very attentive and the seat comfortable. Probably not the equal of Business Class with Qantas Singapore or BA but still very good all the same.

Travelled Tel-Aviv to Bangkok via Amman. Flight to Amman was ok but to Bangkok was not good seats need renovation food was average served only water and hot coffee/tea coke etc on request only from the crew. The quality of economy class was below average on the return flight the food was better but the crew didn't pay attention to the call button.

Frankfurt-Amman. In general I was pleased. The hot food and drinks were nice. The plane was a bit small and the aisle seem narrow. However crew were pleasant.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
TXL-AMM-BKK return in economy. All aircraft seemed modern seats comfortable. Entertainment system is sufficient. Crew responsiveness is below average. Service on TXL-AMM return was good. BKK-AMM: never seen a crew ignorant like this. One full bar (with dinner) plus 2 coffee/tea services on a 8.5 hrs flight is simply not enough. No security checks before landing in AMM: pax landed with reclined seat backs entertainment system running. The flight attendant in our section sat down during disembarkation. Avoid long stop-overs in Amman the airport is ancient.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
CDG-AMM-BKK return in economy. CDG-AMM Airbus A320 not clean fixed seat backs just like low cost airlines! VOD simple but correct. AMM-BKK like BKK-AMM A330-200 well maintained and cleaned with good VOD programs. Cabin crews not concerned by service: attendants deliver standard care to passengers. Very few smiles and rather slow response. BKK-AMM the two rear toilets were note in use. The only good point in all sectors is food: tasty natural and served in large portions while drink selection is more than correct. AMM airport is not too busy. RJ delivers an average product with average aircraft and lower than average cabin crews but higher than average food.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Amman to Hong Kong with a 1hr stop in Bangkok. I was pleasantly surprised with the new A330. A decent entertainment system but with a round trip of 11-13hrs each you would have seen all the movies and left with re-runs on your return. The food was ok on the first trip but on the return the options were limited and the food was generally too spicy out of Bangkok and no way to avoid it. The crew was still typical RJ crew some were quite nice but generally would ignore you if you called them they attended to me 45 minutes after! Plane was clean but seats not very comfortable for long trips and the headphones were not very good quality. Other than a minor delay in Bangkok the trip was actually quite good and restored my faith in RJ.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Bangkok to Hong Kong in Business Class. An otherwise superb experience ruined by the behaviour of one gate at BKK. Check-in swift and pleasant and given directions to the Thai Airways lounge. The flight was due to depart at 15.25 boarding time was 14.55. As we were coming towards the entrance to the gate lounge the lady in charge of dispatching the flight was waving her arms around and yelling at us to 'hurry up everyone else is onboard and you are keeping them waiting'. I checked the time on my watch it was 15.02. I was impressed by the Crown Class cabin on A330 aircraft. The J class cabin consisted of four rows of very comfortable sleeper seats in a 2x2x2 arrangement. The flight was only 2.45 in duration so I didn't get to test them in 'bed' mode but they were extremely comfortable to sit in. Inflight entertainment was on-demand but not as an extensive selection as some carriers. Surprised by the inflight service. The crew were very attentive and friendly and a full meal service was offered with appetizer and hot meal. Departed and arrived on time.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Flew from Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Amman. Aircraft was clean and the first flight early. My gluten free meal (fish with vegetables) was great for aircraft food. The remote control for my entertainment did not work but otherwise the entertainment was okay a reasonable selection. The negatives were the seat (very uncomfortable after only a couple of hours and staff were aloof and did not respond to my call bell. The leg to Tel Aviv takes only half an hour so nothing can really go wrong there was just a 20 minute delay that was fully explained. I would travel with them again because of the price but not eagerly.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Poor logistic in seating allocation: my daughter and I were separated all our legs totalling 34 hrs! More than 50% of passengers had to figure out their seating because all their bookings were in disarray. Air quality of flight NY to Amman is very poor it's hot and no one was responding to the numerous requests. On return leg I was sat next to a sick passenger who coughed all the way. Royal Jordanian needs to respect that when passengers book together and request to be seated together due consideration should prevail. Will never fly them again.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Booked seats only to discover those booked seats in both directions were in fact not booked at all. I asked for an explanation. None given. Disinterested check-in staff could not care less. On the aircraft the seats were in fact empty anyway! The carpet was ripped the table damaged seat a mess and the plane in need of a revamp. Unsmiling bored-looking cabin crew disinterested staff overall. This airline's standards have deteriorated I was very disappointed.

AMS-AMM-BKK-AMM-AMS Crown Class. All flights different but nice but best crew on Amman to Amsterdam in Business Class. Only 3 passengers in Crown Class on my flight to Amsterdam. Food was in a buffet style to choose from. Unlimited drinks offered throughout all flights. Seats even on mid-haul with 2-2 configuration and "real" Business Class unlike other European Airlines. Amman to Bangkok and return on Airbus 330 with lie-flat seats. Personal Entertainment system on all seats with not a lot of choice (which is no problem with overnight flights).

Amman-Bangkok on A330 in crown class. Everything was perfect from the =dedicated crown class check-in to the crown class lounge at queen Alia international airport. Excellent service and staff good food and choices with old fashion trolley service. Good AVOD. The crown class seat is 60 in separation with four rows of 2x2x2 which makes the cabin not so crowded. Leather cream and grey lie flat seats which are comfortable.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Amman to Amsterdam Jan 2012. Flight should have taken 5 hrs - took over 17 hrs. Firstly 2 hour delay in Amman due to fog - no explanation given until we were in the air and no drinks given. We tried to land in Amsterdam at midday but due to high winds we diverted to Hamburg. In Hamburg we were not allowed to leave the plane or get any food or drink. Eventually got off the plane - immigration were unaware of who we were and a further delay was caused here. Before we left the plane the crew told all passengers that a representative from the airline would meet us in Hamburg - nobody met us and nobody knew where to go. We were told food and drink would be available for the passengers - this did not happen and each passenger had to pay for their own food and drink. We eventually left Hamburg after searching for the bus and arrived in Schiphol Airport Amsterdam after midnight All in all a terrible experience that I never want to repeat.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
Hong Kong-Amman-London 27 Dec. New airbus seats and leg room comfortable food and drinks service good. Staff attentive. Only negative - not a huge choice of inflight entertainment on such a long journey if travelling both directions in the same month you would have watched it all in one direction. Amman airport is a definite let down but next door they are building a new airport. A quality product that can only get better.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
MAD-AMM-BKK return. The first leg was okay but the heating was on high and it was almost unbearable with many people complaining. Served a hot meal which wasn't bad and a good selection of beverages to choose from. Cabin crew were polite and attentive. The long haul to Bangkok was thankfully cooler and again the staff pleasant. Seating was fine and eyeshades and headphones given the AVOD had a decent choice of movies and games. All in all not bad only 2 issues would stop me from using RJ again the first being the toilets were not kept very clean and smelt of urine and secondly having to stop over in Jordan this has to be the worst airport I've ever been in. A shame for a decent airline as this will be a huge factor for a lot of its travellers.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
ORD-AMM. We were very disappointed by this experience. The flight left on time. However RJ's A340s are tired even in Crown Class. The cabin was clean but the equipment old. The TV monitor kept creeping down after raising it up which was so annoying. The food was terrible. The flight attendant presented a very nice menu with several courses. It turns out these are "old" menus and RJ has dropped some of the hors d'oeuvre soup and cheese selection. Food was served on a cart out of aluminium trays not very appealing. The crew were not friendly. So surprised as RJ's shorter flights are very good.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
JFK-AMM-JFK. We had an infant and asked for a row with access to bassinet. At check-in we were told we had a bassinet seat and when we boarded we discovered that we did not have access to one. The crew were not helpful rude and even threatened to offload me and my family and void our tickets. Very poor experience.

We flew Chicago to Amman business class Amman to Cairo coach on to Amman and return to Chicago. We loved the business class seats because they are truly 180 degrees. We found the entertainment cleanliness food and service to be very good. We were delayed in Cairo when returning to Amman because of a sand storm and didn't know the reason for the delay until we arrived in Amman. Communication could have been better. Superb lounge in Amman.

ORD-AMM-RUH in economy. The first flight was 12 hours - one service at the beginning of the flight and another before the end of this flight - an eight hour stretch with no service at all. Not a good impression. It is unusual to have breakfast before landing at 4pm. The flight to RUH was different. The service and food were outstanding. Slight delay on this flight pilot very apologetic. Cabin cleanliness comfort and inflight entertainment all respectable. Although not Qatar or Etihad overall RJ is a decent operation. But long haul can improve.

HKG-BKK-AMM in Economy Class. Check-in was swift and the flight on time. The aircraft was an A330-200 and was clean. Onboard there was AVOD with around 30 movies. The headphones could be kept and the crew pleasant. The meal was good drinks offered and a selection of juices. Seat-pitch was good at 32" and I particularly liked the cream colour of the seats. All in all good value for money.

AMM-KUL in Economy. On the BKK-KUL sector the cabin crew did not smile and most of the time they were indifferent to passengers. There was one incident where one flight steward shouted at a passenger who just came out of the lavatory to return to his seat as the seat belt sign came on. When I asked for a comment card later on one stewardess from the code share partner pretended not to hear and I had to raise my voice to get her attention. Definitely need a refresher course in dealing with passengers. A low cost carrier can do much better than this airline in my opinion.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
AMM-SSH return in Business. A319 out E195 back. Good crew both directions. Nice snack served good drinks service available outbound but no drink offered on return leg. No towels offered on return leg although we did see towels taken to coach. Upon arrival at SSH curtain left open so stampede upon arrival. Return leg much better due to astute flight manager.

TLV-AMM. Economy. Short flight on a smart Embraer aircraft. BAEC gold so allowed access to the Business lounge at TLV. Very little food bit of cake crackers etc surly staff. Prompt boarding.

Luggage off smartly and immigration cleared without a hitch.

JFK-AMM. Roundtrip flight was rather comfortable. Both flights were full and service was good. Each seat had a rather large on-demand video/audio screen. Food was adequate but nothing special. Two meals were served during this 11.5 hr flight. Although American Airlines details were in RJ's booking record after weeks with no AA credit I still needed to fax boarding passes and flight itinerary to AA to secure credit. I would take the RJ flight again since its nonstop from JFK-AMM.

CDG-AMM on A310 AMM-CDG on A321. Both cabins were fine. The A310 was pretty old but it had fully reclinable seats. Good food with several choices. Friendly flight attendants. Both flights were on time. Lounge at CDG (shared with AA) was inadequate but the one in AMM was excellent. Very good value for money. At AMM airport there are dedicated check-in and immigration counters. I was able to finish all formalities in 5min!

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
HKG-AMM-VIE: I was sceptical reading all the reviews but since I am a student and money is the deciding factor I decided to try it myself. My biggest worry after reading several reviews was the loss of my luggage but expecting nothing I was positively surprised. The stuff in HGK and on board was friendly. The food was good (it is not a 5-star restaurant but an airplane). The seat was comfortable/uncomfortable as all the airplane seats are in economy. Entertainment system was up-to-date and played many new and old movies (very good selection). The airport in Amman is small but clean and provides the necessary cafes and seating arrangements. At last my luggage arrived in Vienna. So all in all I can only report a positive experience with this airline especially for the price I paid (one way: EUR 300).

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
FCO-AMM AMM-DXB Check in was a disaster. Flights were delayed and late. Ground and in-flight staff are rude and don't know the basics of costumer service. We were not provided the seats we asked for and cabin crew refused to change us saying that the plane was full. Ordered veggie meal but was only provided in one leg of the flight. Overall will never use it again. Emirates or Etihad are much better.

Vienna-Amman-Tel Aviv return. Generous legroom adjustable headrests and A320 with IFE screens. Crews delightful. VIE-AMM-VIE on mostly empty A321 food tasty and plentiful attentive service and IFE. AMM-TLV-AMM on Embraer - 25 minutes passengers get a fruit juice.

YUL-AMM-YUL preassigned seats (exit row) were changed at check in. My wife and I were asked to sit separately even several rows apart.

Food average. Service good entertainment is average.

Muscat to Amman service on the plane good and food served a good quality in the economy class. Cabin is comfortable (Embraer 175) and the flight was not full. The minus point is the lack of entertainment onboard - maybe a negative point for people expecting entertainment.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
CAI-AMM and AMM-TLV first flight was fine. Check in boarding service and quality of meals were fine second leg was a disappointment. Upon arrival at the airport we were informed that our departure time had been changed and we had missed the last flight. For 20 minutes they looked for ways to blame me for the error yet they had all the details they had requested and yet no one informed us of any changes. In the end a manager conceded and organized a hotel and seats on the flight departing the next day. All of this could have been avoided by simply making us aware of the change.

GVA-AMM-CMB return in J-class. GVA-AMM on A319/320 seats are cradle-like 2x2. Adequate for a 4-hour flight. Outstanding catering and attention from FAs. AVOD worked fine with good selection. AMM-CMB segments on old A310 but clean looking interior. Angled flat seats. Only one meal offered on this 7 hour flight. A snack would have been nice towards the end.

LHR-AMM-LHR in Economy on new A330 - flight was on time service excellent and food was tasty. Flight back was very different - we left the gate on time but 40 mins late to depart. My partner and I had reserved seats together which was confirmed by Royal Jordanian in Amman but on check in we were given seats apart. No explanation was given by Royal Jordanian as to why the seats were changed (there was no aircraft change). Staff in the nice Crown lounge (which we used as we both have BA Exec Club Gold card) tried to help and were apologetic but they could not do anything as flight was full. Food good on flight but flight attendants were not as friendly as on outbound flight.

Five minutes later I was landside.

Hong Kong to Amman (via Bangkok ) to Amsterdam. First leg in a refurbished A330-200. Good seats in economy good personal entertainment system. Crew nice and polite. Food outstanding. Second leg alright in A321. Amman airport is worn down but brings no hassle. For only 350 Euro I was satisfied.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
HKG-AMM-LHR both legs on a new A330. The plane was clean the food was excellent and the cabin crew were polite. There are two areas I would earmark for improvement. The first is the choice of movies & entertainment. Secondly a snack box on the galley would have been a pleasant addition to the flight especially the first leg which took over nine hours.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
MUC-AMM AMM-FRA. A319 on both legs good but not excellent legroom. Ordered veg-food for my wife and myself which was provided. IFE is both standard and AVOD with a decent choice of movies and music but not as wide as with the Gulf carriers. Quality of image on video and sound is poor ear-plugs are not good. FAs friendly and efficient both flights on time. On return flight used their web check-in which was a joke as we were given boarding passes again also no possibility to change seat while checking-in online. A hassle is the airport in AMM where you have to show Your passport and boarding pass thrice before boarding but hopefully this will be better with the new terminal once in operation. AMM Airport is undergoing reconstruction with a new terminal building so bussed to and from plane on both legs.

### Royal Jordanian Airlines customer review
DTW-AMM check-in went smoothly but boarding was chaotic. Flight Attendants friendly and helpful and food was delicious. The in-flight entertainment was adequate not great though. My first complaint would be that there were lots of kids on-board and they were pushing the attendant buttons constantly which got really annoying. My second complaint would be that my seat was a little cramped. If you like to sleep on planes do not take RJ.

JFK check-in was horrible. Check-in reps unfriendly and annoyed by questions asked. Boarding ticket reflected gate that was incorrect. The food was horrendous they allow children to run up and down aisles during the flight - a lot of children. They allowed passengers to get up and take their luggage from overhead bins as the plane was taxing down runway. At Amman airport people unfriendly and not helpful directing you through numerous counters you need to visit (visa exchange counter to buy visa to their "custom" counter" back through security and on to luggage). I guess you get what you pay for.

Tel Aviv to Amman and Amman to Bangkok. First flight only 35 mins and in a modern Airbus. Landed and parked a long way from terminal bussed to terminal in pouring rain not ideal. Amman to Bangkok an ageing Airbus reasonably well appointed but entertainment system very limited only 5 radio/music channels and a cabin displayed film. Flight smooth and uneventful managed to get good rest. Cabin crew responsive and cheerful food basic but edible. Overall not too bad but for a One World group airline expected better - there are many other options into and out of middle east that might now consider.

AMM-DXB on RJ because of the unbeatable price of USD 150 one-way which was about the same or cheaper than Gulf low-cost careers. New A321 had AVOD on every seat with good selection of films. Food was good - choice of 3 selections on 3hr flight. Service could have been better specially from the Arabic female crew.

LHR-BKK return. London to Amman flight was pretty good. Food ok and inflight entertainment fair. Amman to Bangkok total disaster. Crew didnt seem to care about anybody. About 6 hours into the flight the crew were sleeping and it took them 10 min to come and serve a glass of water. One of the toilets didn't work. Amman airport security was rude and unhelpful. Never fly with them again.

VIE-AMM-BEY full plane. Clean cabin with fair service. Could choose between 2 meals. Food was good and some nice Jordanian wine was offered. The problem starts when you arrive. Royal Jordanian seem to be experts in losing bags. This is the second time it happened to me although there was plenty of time for the connection flight. Of course Royal Jordanian doesn't offer any compensation if the bags come later or never show up again. This is unacceptable for any other airline and should be changed.

Traveled Aqaba-Amman-Heathrow booking exit row seating on both flights. Food was good with plenty of choice for what to drink. Aqaba airport is badly equipped and I don't think £7/litre for Perrier is good value. The staff there were clueless. Amman airport is coming along nicely and should be very pleasant when finished. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful.

Business Class JFK-AMM-TLV returning Aqaba AMM-JFK. All flights on time transatlantic A340 had PTV screens with an adequate selection of entertainment. The service was very friendly and there was a flight attendant walking through the cabin at all times. There was a varied selection of food snacks and drinks. The legroom between seats 83" was amazing and the lie flat bed was comfortable. The change of planes in Amman was easy - it's a very small airport. The overall experience was superior to any I have had with domestic airlines in the USA better than European carriers I have flown and almost as good as Asian airlines. I would not hesitate to recommend Royal Jordanian Airlines.

Comfortable seats friendly staff and large variety of food and drink. The planes used on North American routes are quite old and no AVOD which means being forced to watch one of 5 movies being played over and over. AVOD is available on the smaller A320s on shorter European routes. The same privileges are not available in economy - seating not that comfortable with little legroom but standard of food is ok. On the plus side they serve some form of snack on the ultra short routes to Beirut and Larnaca which usually don't exceed 50 minutes. Most problems other passengers have faced seem to be with connecting flights on RJ which I cant say I have experienced.

BKK-AMM AMM-IST. Good meals clean and modern interiors (A310 BKK-AMM was recently refurbished but it's 20 years old). Embraer 190 from AMM-IST was surprisingly spacious for a smaller aircraft and this was the first time in years that I've had full meal service (as opposed to a plastic-wrap sandwich) on a two hour flight. No lost bags or anything. And I saw nothing wrong with Amman airport.

Cyprus-Amman-Bangkok return. Usually use Emirates but RJ €600 cheaper so decided to try them. All flights were on time staff polite food quite good with a choice. Have now booked for 2010 and been able to reserve extra leg-room seats at no extra cost. I booked through their office in Nicosia and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.

I have travelled with RJ 8 times each time the standard of customer service has been awful. The staff appear to be untrained and struggle with basic procedures and are rude as a rule. Luggage has gone missing so many times now that when I have no other option but to fly with RJ I will only take a carry on bag. Just as a point of interest if they lose your bag which they seem to be very good at do not accept any offer they make regarding compensation (once the decide to answer your e mails phone calls letters etc) but hand the matter to a solicitor. I did and after 2 years I eventually received an out of court settlement which covered the loss together with a hefty legal bill that was paid by the airline!

Do Not Fly Royal Jordanian. They are rude and do not care about customer service. I was travelling to Bahrain with three young children. Missed our flight in Chicago because of connecting delay - RJ's response was that it was not their fault their offer was to send us on our way 2 nights later with another night in Amman (no guarantee of hotel vouchers). Three nights in an airport are not a viable option with three young children. Now our 8 pieces of luggage apparently did not miss our flight - five have appeared in Bahrain via RJ but they say it is not their fault. It took me 4 days 3 nights and two sets of tickets (4 people) to make it to Bahrain and it looks like three suitcases full of clothing.You get what you pay for. Buyer be aware.

I am a Jordanian living in the USA. I travelled on Royal Jordanian the past 30 years many times and these are some of the worst nightmares me and my family experienced with this airlines. Flew from LAX to JFK to find out that we had no reservation to Amman on Royal Jordanian except for our three year old child even though we all had confirmed reservation and tickets. Outcome had to pay $600.00 to go to Chicago next day and take Royal Jordanian to Amman and arrived there with no luggage. Royal Jordanian deliver3d the luggage a week later with half of its content missing RJ did not address this issue or return our calls to this date. Amman to JFK. in Amman mechanical trouble two hours later we were sent to Alia hotel two persons to the room (me and a stranger!). Three hours later at the hotel around midnight we were told to get ready to go to the airport only to wait six more hours there for the flight. When we arrived at JFK almost 12 hours delay we were sent to a motel again two strangers to each room! Amman To Chicago. I arrived at Amman to find out my seats have been changed and the female employee there told me if I argued with her about the seat she would have me arrested! I now give all my business to Delta so dont have Royal Jordanian nightmares any more.

London-Amman. I have to take issue with RJs safety procedures. On this flight an off duty crew member in uniform was sitting in an emergency exit seat when he took down a large case from the overhead locker and put it in front of him. When I remonstrated with a member of the crew she asked him to remove it and he asked who had complained and she told him so we had a short conversation about safety. This is the nth time this has happened. Also people seem to be allowed to get up and empty the overhead locker before the aircraft has hardly left the runway.
