### “seats were horrific”
Not Verified | Flying to Fiji we flew with Fiji Airways and we booked to come back to Sydney on Fiji Airways. Instead we were substituted to Jetstar. First up our flight was delayed by a few hours. We boarded the plane and the seats were horrific. Headrest was hard as a brick and seats were uncomfortable. No in-flight entertainment. Crying babies and children as we took off. As we reached cruising altitude there was heavy turbulence. All the food costs money and is way too overpriced. Landing was ok and ground service was alright. We came back at around midnight. Not a good flight.

### "Worst airline I've ever experienced"
Not Verified |  I booked some extra baggage for a flight but Jetstar added it to the wrong flight then charged me excess baggage fees then would not fix it. So hard to contact them also. Worst airline I've ever experienced!

### "change all bookings previously made"
Not Verified | Problem airlines. Every time I decided to fly with them, I struggle with problems. I made a booking on July 2020 for a flight from HCM to Ha Not this September. This August, they have been bought by Vietnam Airlines and changed their name (now Pacific Airlines). They had to change all bookings previously made. By entering our booking in their new system, they made a mistake with the name of my fiancee (they forgot her 3rd name). I shown them the proof I have put the right complete name when I made the original booking and the mistake came from their end. They did not care at all and ask me to pay for another ticket. We refused to pay and it took 2h30 to bargain with them and make the name modification without paying any fees for their mistake. Fortunately, the ground service in HCM airport were fully understandable and made their best toward for us to do not pay any additional fees.

### "experience was just awful"
Auckland to Christchurch. The experience with this airline was just awful. The ground crew seem to pull out passengers rand some out of the line to grab extra surcharges for extra hand luggage in very rude way. The onboard crew was friendly. The prebooked snack we’ve ordered was tasteless and the worst sandwich we’ve ever experienced. It was definitely our last flight with this terrible airline.

### "Disappointed about Jetstar"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Auckland. Disappointed about Jetstar overall. Aircraft is old, uncomfortable, seat dirty, most terrible is about their staff service. Ground staff easily show up annoyed face. I did not order food and beverage on board, so no much comments on crew members. I will try to avoid this airline for my next journey.

### "habit of changing departure times"
Jetstar Pacific has a habit of changing departure times that is beyond funny. I do realize that there are some constraints and that things happen, but they do it every time and don't offer any alternatives. They don't even ask you if its possible or convenient for you. Our outbound flight departed 2 hours 20 minutes earlier, which was terribly inconvenient to us and our return flight departure time was changed 4 times in a week. It was silly, and we had to change our travel plans to accommodate their shenanigans. There's no legroom on their planes, either.

### "a total lack of customer service"
Not Verified |  I recently flew home to see my family in Christchurch, New Zealand. I paid for extra seating space and baggage to be carried upon the plane. Upon arriving at Christchurch Airport, I was asked to paid extra for my baggage as I had bought a few goodies to take back to the USA. This I did not mind. What I was disgusted with was that I ended up paying twice - my original payment and then another full payment at the airport. When I inquired as to being able to get a refund for the first payment, I was refused with such arrogance. There was a total lack of customer service. Further, on my trip from Auckland to Christchurch, there was a child who either cried or screamed for the entire flight. On the return flight, the woman next me was coughing non-stop. I write this at the time of the China virus spreading rapidly. The flight attendants showed no obvious concern both times. I will not fly Jetstar again and this is my choice. Buyer be Aware.

### "unable to process a full refund"
I purchased a one way flight with Jetstar Pacific at a total cost of A$519 to fly from Da Nang to Sydney on 19/12/2019 for Xmas. The first leg involved a domestic flight to HCMC where I was to connect to the international flight to Sydney. My flight was due to depart Ho Chi Minh City at 10.35pm. At 7.15pm I was advised that the flight had been delayed until 4.45am the next day. After much trouble, I managed to change my flight to the same flight departing at 10.35pm on 20/12/2019. I had to outlay for taxis and a hotel. On 20/12/2019 I checked in and was waiting to board when we were advised that the flight had been cancelled. We were subsequently advised by an ‘Information officer” (no Jetstar rep met with us) at the boarding gate that all Jetstar flights had be cancelled and that we were to find and fund our own way to Sydney. We then paid for taxis to a hotel paid for by Jetstar. I booked a flight with AirAsia to Sydney for the 21 December at a total cost of $679. Today, 21 January, I contacted Jetstar seeking a full refund and was advised that they would only refund $197 because ‘we’re really unable to process a full refund for your flight since you took the first flight (log transcript). This is how Jetstar Pacific treat their customers – absolute disgrace!

### " included free services and luggage"
Hong Kong to Hanoi. Regional flight Hong Kong toHanoi 2 January 2019 on an A321 aircraft. Ticket included free services and luggage. Hot meal given was OK. Flight full, on time. Nice, clean aircraft. Seats were good, but space to front seat was horrible and extremely tiny, small, de facto painful to knees. Check-In in Hong Kong was quick and easy though my hand-luggage was double the limit. Checked in luggage arrived smoothly, checked by customs in Hong Kong who had left a note inside the bag. Airbridge provided at both ends.

### "meagre limit which is only 7kgs"
Not Verified |  Regional flight Danang to Hong Kong before X-mas 2019 on newish A320 aircraft. Had to change ticket prior to travel and it went quite OK though had to pay another 45 USD even that I had purchased a “bundle” (convenience packet) with the ticket adding “free services and further luggage”. I got three emails prior to flight warning about excessive luggage and charges. Flight on time. Check-In was quick and easy. No hassle with luggage though my hand-luggage was 6kg over the meagre limit which is only 7kgs which is almost impossible to comply with for international travellers. I had two suitcases inscribed from Danang arrived very quickly in Hong Kong. Onboard, a prepaid hot food package turned out to be very delicious. Flight was full but staff were on top of passengers and served well. I recommend that Jetstar Pacific should decide clearly whether to go tom be legacy carrier or Low Cost as now it is between 2 chairs and overly focused on charging for luggage.

### "Cannot fault much"
Flew internally in Vietnam, Hue to Da Lat and back mid November 2019 on their A320 equipment. We were tempted from online promotional sales and made a domestic tourist trip to Dalat. Additions and charges for everything (payments, changes, additions, service charges, payment fees, taxes on every addition purchased) makes the experience so-so and completely ruins the deal of “free tickets” that ended up in a considerable amount. This route is not heavily trafficated so I was surprised to see a full plane loaded with a lot of monks. Both flights were punctual. Aircrafts were not very old and well kept (livery and décor). Check-in was a breeze, no issue with luggage though I was over clearly the limit for handluggage. Flights on time. FAs were fit and quick, started services only 4 minutes after departure seconds before the seatbelt signs were off. Inflight sales of food, drinks and souvenirs. The food is not expensive when flying domestic and easy to order from the rich illustrated “Menu Book” found seat pockets. Seats and seat environment were modern and fully functioning. No entertainment, but also not expected on short flight. Inflight magazines OK. Luggage delivered in no time and was on the belt before I could even reach there. Overall, much better than feared and better than expected. Job done well. Cannot fault much.

### "I would never recommend"
Ho Chi Minh to Buon Me Thuot. One of the worst airline I have ever experienced. This airline is trying to find more ways to make money out of their customers. I would never recommend anyone to use their services. Please save your money and fly with some other airlines

### "no room for legs at all"
Da Nang to Hanoi with Jetstar Pacific. Plane was horrible and no room for legs at all! Delays! Boarding time was listed as 13.25, we only started boarding at 14.00 when we should have lift-off at 13.55. Lift-off was at 14.40 and landed at 15.50 (instead of 15.15). Service of the flight attendants was very nice.

### "service was absolutely shocking"
Our family of 5 travelling with Jet star from Queenstown to Auckland. Online checkin system allocated our family to 5 individual seats, which mean an infant will be on her own siting between 2 males. We went in to ground service desk, the service was absolutely shocking. We were in the processing of getting seat rearrange with staff her jetstar colleague on the next counter came and stopped her, said to our her they need to paid to choose the seat when making the online checkin with a condescending tone. The staff suddenly changed the tone told us its a full flight. We offer to pay to choose the next to each other seats, the senior looking girl started raising her voice: Sir we have other passenger to serve. Later the members siting in the front find rows of empty seats, so the child was safe. We sat at the back individually till landing. Jer star will take every cent they could possibly make on their customer. Ground service personnel was telling every at the gate to weight their belongings. Hand bags was even weighted and tagged. Its a waste time exercise, over weight carrier just pull content out of the carry on and put on themselves, Jetstar personnel was allowing this happen in front the scale.

### "already expected a delay"
Ho Chi Minh City to Da Lat. Based on previous flights on this route, I had already expected a delay between 1 and 4 hours, and I was right: 2 hours delay. So I tried not to stress myself. Not much announcement from the company (like email, SMS). Even the captain did not bother to say something. The check-in staff was friendly but they weight anything that moves. Be prepared! They also retain your ticket and passport until your checked-in luggage is scanned. You can check-in online and it is nice that they assign the seats together even if you did not book seats. The plane was relatively new (2 years old).

### "recommend steering clear of Jetstar"
Ho Chi Minh City to Nah Trang. We arrive at Tan Son Nhat airport at 6.00am on the day of departure which was scheduled for departure at 7.40am. The queue was of considerable length, by the time we had reach the boarding/check in counter it was 6.45am, then was told that we needed to change our baggage weight between checked in and carry on to comply with their requirements. ( our carry on was 1kg over for each of us 2kg in total we then repacked our case to obtain the correct weight for boarding luggage) After completing that we re- waited in line to get boarding passes, once that was done then told to wait 10 minutes to ensure checked in baggage had cleared the scanner, by this time it had now got to 7.05am Then lined up to have our hand luggage scanned to pass on through to the departure lounge. This queue was of considerable length because of only two scanners at the departure entrance, only one was in operation at that time. Our boarding passes showed gate 3, so headed directly to the gate and waited. There was a few minutes and we started to think something was no right so checked the departure board to find our gate had changed to gate 2 We then went directly to gate 2 to be told we were too late for departure that closed at 7.25am. At this time it was 7.33am. We were then told to head back to the Jetstar desk, they then told us we had no choice but to wait till the next day, would we like to book a ticket for that. For very obvious reasons we were not happy with this and said as much, the reply was we had arrived at the departure gate too late, they had called our flight and gate change over the public announcement system 3 times which we had never heard, the only flight I had heard was for flight #BL366. After a few minutes of consideration and checking other available flights we asked for a refund of  which we were given & bought tickets with another airline. Have had a few issues with Jetstar over time but this is now a time that I would recommend steering clear of Jetstar if at all possible. The only thing that keeps people boarding their planes is their cheap prices but to what benefit is that if you are treated so poorly.

### "legroom was the absolute minimum"
Check in was efficient if incredibly impolite. Boarding was shambolic with travelers with children being sent down the stairs first then trampled once the way to the runway bus was opened. Passengers with huge amounts of carry on luggage then pushed up and down the aisle stowing sacks and boxes. The legroom was the absolute minimum for a 1.8m tall person - any limb protruding into the aisle was rammed by the drinks really from behind. As we came into land my child felt sick. Of the six chairs in our row there was only one sick bag. The luggage was thrown into the belt (we could watch through the window). We had one case damaged and considered ourselves lucky. Never again.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Danang to Ho Chi Minh. Without doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. They had changed the flight time 3 times before even the day of the flight. Then on arrival at the airport they had one check in clerk checking in two full flights. To put that into perspective that’s over 400 people. Then the flight was delayed by 20 mins. Which actually turned into 2 hours. The locals won’t fly with Jetstar Pacific and now I have lost all confidence with this airline. Wouldn’t recommend.

### "very uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. Delayed both ways, very uncomfortable seats. The worst is that even if the plane stops at a gate with a skybridge you can't use it and need to take an overcrowded bus to get to the terminal. And tickets are not super cheap.

### "weight above the allowed limit"
Hanoi to Danang. Terrible airline and not necessarily cheap. I assumed luggage size and weight would be acceptable since me and my wife just had a backpack and 1 suitcase combined (carry on size) at the last moment before getting aboard one of the staff pulled my back to tell me to check my weight. The weight was above the allowed limit I felt like this was a last minute cash grab. We were given the option to pay extra to have the baggage taken into checked baggage if we paid about $22 USD. Beyond this there is nothing good on the plane and no free food to eat.

### "staffs awful attitude"
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. Awful first and last experience with Jetstar Pacific. Flight was delayed by 40 mins (not bad I know). Bags were slightly over the tiny 7kg weight allowance which was fine on the way here, but made to pay to check them in on the way back. My main problem was the staffs awful attitude and the fact the plane smelt like stale urine.

### "delayed both ways"
Hanoi to Da Nang. Expect delays! Don’t expect much else. We were delayed both ways, which amounted to a wait time in the airport 3x longer than the actual flight. Delays seem to be the standard with this airline, and they seem pretty cavalier about wasting your time. Be prepared and manage your expectations/entertainment accordingly. It’s also a bare bones flight with no entertainment or beverage service. Sure, it’s a value option, but for what I got, I think it should have been half the cost.

### "told me to transfer my stuff"
Da Nang to Hong Kong. I can understand that low-cost companies have regulations on luggage but i think that the human dignity can be respected. In my case, I had 2 kg less in my checked luggage and 1 kg more in my hand luggage (8kg total, my luggage was already 4kg empty). The agent told me to transfer my stuff (which I could need for the flight) from my hand luggage to my checked luggage at the airport. This was a very stressful situation. I think the value for money isn't good. I paid my ticket 100 euros without checked luggage because the time and the day were good for me. I am not going to travel anymore with this company.

### "fine for the money"
My flight was the last one on this day at Phu Quoc Airport. Because Online Check-In wasn't available for this flight, I had to use the Check-In at the airport. No problem there, they even gave me a seat near the emergency exit without asking for it. The boarding was a bit of a problem: at the estimated boarding time the gate was closed and I didn't got informed about any delays. There were some announcements but only on Vietnamese. After like half an hour after the estimated boarding time, the boarding suddenly started and the plane take off with a three-quarter hour delay. On board every thing was fine, the cabine staff was kindly and could speak an understandable English. All in all the flight was totally fine for the money, I reached my destination and the delay wasn't big of a problem for me.

### "Overall, can't complain"
Flew Hong Kong to Da Nang with Jetstar Pacific. First off, it's a no frills airline, people need to always remember that if you only pay a little bit for your flight you're only going to get a little bit of service. If you want to be fanned with palm leaves, pay more for a full service carrier. The aircraft was newer, very clean, comfortable (although paid a bit extra for the exit row), and both to and from Da Nang were on time. At both ends of the journey the staff were pretty good, more smiles and attentiveness in Da Nang than Hong Kong, but I am not taking issue with that at all. Safe and on-time is all that matters with a low cost carrier. We didn't order any food, so can't comment first hand on that, but the couple in front of us did and they finished it all so it must not have been too bad. Overall, can't complain and further advice would be to read the T&C instead of just clicking "accept".

### "not willing to help at all"
I have never flown with a worse airline. The booking process is a mess and the itinerary most of the times never arrives by email. At the airport the checkin staff are rude and not willing to help at all. The delays of the flights are with no reason. We boarded the bus for the plane and after a while they took us off back to the boarding area because there was another delay. The staff at the boarding gates dont care about the passengers and were not giving information about the delay. On the plane the flight attendants shout if you want to use the toilet and dont even let you stand from your seat. I will never fly with Jetstar Pacific again.

### "Worst company I ever flew with"
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. Worst company I ever flew with. I booked 3 flights and all 3 flights were rescheduled more than 3 times. When we were in the airport the plane had a delay of 1 and 1/2 hours. They are not reliable at all considering that we booked 3 flights and none of them were on time! (One flight was rescheduled with 4 hours)

### "delays not uncommon"
Wellington to Auckland. I'm writing this review while waiting for my flight. My flight was delayed initially by 1 hours 30 minutes, until staff were "just" informed by engineering that they need to run tests. My flight has been delayed a further hour and half, the total delay being at least 3 hours. This is not uncommon for Jetstar at least in New Zealand. The airline often has flights delayed due to lack of preparation to comply with engineering requirements. Had I known earlier that there would be further delays than the initial 1.5 hour delay from the outset when I arrived at the airport at 7am, I could have bought a ticket with Air NZ and arrived at my destination by now.

### "never fly with them again"
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. Garbage airline, changed my flight to seven hours earlier boarding time, ruined my vacation and refused to cancel or refund my ticket. And then, failed to respond to multiple emails and phone calls. Absolute and complete failure as far as customer service. Will never fly with them again.

### "poor service and customer care"
Ho Chi Minh City to Phu Quoc. Change of flight with no prior notification. Promised 15 working days refund. No refund after 28 workings day. Second contact at Jetstar, suggested there is no guaranteed refund time. Extremely poor service and customer care. They don't seem to care the inconvenience caused by them. Never using Jetstar again.

### "boarding pass had the wrong name"
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Jetstar Pacific is the worst airline ever. My boarding pass had the wrong name on it, and they made me pay US$100 to update it so that I could get through security. They tried to charge me $50 US to bring on my carry on bag when it was just a backpack.

### "ended up very pleasantly surprised"
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. I was a little worried when I booked this flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh due to previous poor reviews. I ended up being very pleasantly surprised. I am a frequent flyer and can honestly say this was as good a flight as I have been on. Checking in was automated and faultless. The plane looked brand new, the staff were cheerful and professional. The flight took off bang on time and landed 15 minutes early. Hard to believe this was a budget flight. Absolutely no complaints here.

### "sadly always encounter the worst staff"
This is our second flight with Jetstar Pacific and sadly always encounter the worst staff. They try to squeeze the most money out of you checking every bag in the cabin and trying to charge you more to put it as checked luggage. This is the only airline I've seen with this policy and the rudeness of the staff is unacceptable! We paid for 25kg, and had 26kg for whichever they were trying to charge also. It is clear that the strategy of the company is to overcharge as much as possible and squeeze every penny. Just simply avoid it since the rates that you see are not true due to all the extra charges they force you to pay.

### "surprisingly well organised"
Jetstar Pacific from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang and return was surprisingly well organised. As usual, boarding is disrupted by passengers taking what seat they like instead of the seat allocated. Maybe a pre-departure announcement would overcome this problem as it delays the boarding procedure in several areas before passengers are re-seated. It is annoying for the other passengers and stressful for the cabin crew to sort out the confusion. Departure was 15 minutes late for the short flight. No tissues or towels in the front toilet was quickly remedied. The A320 aircraft seemed new and the cabin attendants young, friendly and efficient. I understand it’s a budget airline but charging outlets for phones and ipads would be a real passenger bonus. The return trip was also uneventful, except for passengers again opting to sit where they want instead of following their boarding pass. It was an older aircraft that the outbound trip, but still quite clean. No trolley service on this night flight, but it wasn’t missed.

### "Leg space was enormous in the exit row"
Da Nang - Hong Kong 5/9-2017 on a newer A320. Check in took hardly one minute, smooth, luggage granted was generous and hand-luggage was not assessed. Flight on time. Jet bridge in HKG but bus-run in Danang. In contrast to the domestic (Vietnam) Jetstar this was two steps up. Leg space was enormous in the exit row (no. 14) that I got without inquiring or paying extra: 3 reclining seats for myself – I could stretch, sleep and almost play football. Load less than 40%. Price promotional bought 6 months earlier. 150 USD DAD-HKG return is a gift. Staff on board friendly, generous, proactive, however, selling food more expensive like that in Danang Airport where food/drinks are more 6 times more expensive than 500 meter away!

### "what a terrible service all round"
Wow what a terrible service all round. Our first flight to Phu Quoc from Ho Chi Minh City was delayed by 30 minutes. No real problem as we didn't have to make a connecting flight. The problems came whilst on the return journey. We booked the flight at 12.30 pm to ensure that we made our connecting flight back to the UK 12 hours later with loads of time to spare. Then Jetstar Pacific changed our flight times three times within 2 hours to 11.30pm ensuring that we would miss our flight. I contacted them and the changed our flight to another one at 7.30pm. Ok not perfect but still comfortable. Then on the day of travel they changed the flight 3 times by email until finally it ended with a 9.55pm flight. Cutting it incredibly fine and ruining our last day through stress. I contacted Jetstar who were apathetically pathetic asking if a flight the next day would help? That was their best advice. I would never use this shambles of an airline again. Terrible and avoid at all costs.

### "Fly with someone else"
Hanoi to Danang. Horrible airline. I have had all 3 of my flights with Jetstar Pacific delayed with little to no explanation. Two of these flights SGN-HAN and DND-SGN were notified by email for which the call centre is unhelpful and annoying to deal with. The third flight HAN-HUI was delayed for hours due to bad weather but ground staff refused to update board to acknowledge how bad the delays were. Clueless staff proceeded to check in and threw reverse check in as they couldn't confirm if the bus was ready. Disastrous airline nothing like the Australian Jetstar. Fly with someone else.

### "not use this airline again"
Rarotonga to Auckland. We were due to Fly out of Rarotonga on Tuesday 23rd May at 5.40 am. Aircraft left early with no notification. We had to arrange for emergency accommodation at our cost, plus car, plus meals. All communication was to Australia at our cost. Next flight was 2 days later. Extremely disappointed with Jet star's attitude. No apology. Will not use this airline again.

### "work on better communication"
Hanoi to Hong Kong. An email was sent to us stating that check-in time closed 30 minutes prior to boarding time. We arrived 40 minutes before boarding. An airline representative already placed a tag on the check-in luggage then proceeded to tell us to we were too late for check-in and that we would have to book another flight for the next day. We showed them the email and they said their company policy for check-in was actually 45 minutes and the email was a mistake on their part. This took around 15 minutes. After complaining they finally allowed us on the flight. We rushed through security and to the gate only to realize that the flight was delayed for 30 minutes. Without the complaints we probably would not have been able to board this flight. Jetstar should work on better communication with passengers and providing better customer service.

### "very little room in the cabin"
Hanoi to Guangzhou. I booked this flight through Ctrip paying via my UnionPay bank (debit) card and then attempted to add luggage but was told that I could only do this using a credit card which I do not have (as foreigners are not allowed credit cards and I don't have a Mastercard or Visa). I spoke with the JetStar call centre who insisted that they could only take credit cards and fobbed me off to CTrip who the agent claimed could accept the payment (via Debit card) but in fact they struggled to even get their head around the issue (Chinese speaker) and then couldn't accept any such payment (or so they claimed). In the end I had to go to the ends of the earth to find someone who does have access to allusive visa card or pay at the counter (at which point it would be cheaper to charter my own plane home). The flight, much my surprise set off on time, and landed on time with no issues. Everything was very basic - no free drinks service and very little room in the cabin. but the announcements were understandable (in English) and their staff on the check in desk were polite and remembered me to say hello at the boarding point - which is always nice.

### "planes with Spanish speaking crews"
In the past three months I flew Jetstar Pacific six times. Combined there were about ten delays in take-offs and seven last minute changes in gates. Ground attendants wouldn't provide information and the PA was constantly spitting out very loud changes in ineligible English. I doubt that at any given time they even have track of where their aircraft are. On the plane leg room is non-existent. Two flight were on chartered planes with Spanish speaking crews. The safety cards were in Spanish, announcements were also Spanish, Needless to say no passengers understood Spanish. The flight was safe, the aircraft seemed new.

### "refund which they denied"
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. I read a similar situation in another review they did exactly the same to me. The flight was delayed from 1 pm to 6:30 pm. I did not have connecting flights, so it was not important to me to flight in time. They told me that I could buy a ticket in Vietjet which was a flight that was not even planned since I checked online if there was another flight available. I told them that I would like to receive my money first before buying and they told me that it was not possible (no reason was given for these). After that I bought my tickets for 3 million VND and when I asked they said that I had to do the check in first in the airline before giving me the money back (I can explain that just if it was a scam, I cannot complain if I had to fly in half hour). After checking-in I came back and they gave me a voucher for 1 million VND and I told them that they said that it was a full refund of the other ticket which they denied. I was not able to do anything because they cancelled the other flight and the flight that just bought was about to leave, after I arrived to Ho Chi Minh I wanted to file a complaint in the aviation authority that was not possible because it seems that there is no way to file a complain in Vietnam regarding airlines.

### "couldn't get my money back"
Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. I am submitting a negative review because I want to warn other potential customers about pitfalls with this airline. This is a budget airline, I don't expect luxury or in flight food but that does not excuse this business breaking its promises. I was removed from a booking I had made several days before, on a flight that was not cancelled, and added to a much later flight without discussion - the only reason the airline could offer was 'operational reasons'. The later flight was then delayed further by more than an hour - after much effort, the airline finally agreed to offer a refund (in an email). After I made alternative arrangements and requested the promised refund - the airline went back on it's promise and only refunded half of the ticket price and nothing would make them budge. So beware, you could get your fingers burned - I couldn't get my money back, and without being directly rude the airline representative made it very clear to me that they did not care and would keep hold of my money, which they did.

### "poor customer service"
Hanoi to Singapore via Ho Chi Minh. This is my first time take Jetstar Pacific and it will be the last. Delay, change of schedule, poor customer service, looks very cheap but you will pay a charge for baggage while it is cabin size. Not recommended.

### "delay flight for over 10 hours "
Raratonga to Auckland. Nearly left us stranded on the Cook Islands after delaying a flight for over 10 hours due to crew issues - something fully in their control. Zero communication before arriving at the airport (no SMS, no email). Nearly ruined our honeymoon, except for the fact that we could buy a ticket on New Zealand for an extra $800. JetStar did not attempt to make this right by me.

### "customer service was poor"
Auckland to Christchurch flight got cancelled 9.5 hours before the flight was supposed take off. Imagine getting an email and a text at 9pm when your flight is at 6.45am the next day. It was so frustrating. Customer service was poor and rude. Did not help the case at all. They did not give any reasons why the flight was cancelled beside typical "bad weather". They did not give any compensation whatsover and no empathy given. Definitely would not recommend this to anyone and personally would not be flying with Jetstar Pacific anymore.

### "delayed a whole 2 days"
Originally was scheduled to fly with Jetstar Pacific from Da Lat to Ho Chi Minh City and then HCM to Phu Quoc. Flight from Da Lat to HCM got delayed so we rescheduled it to a day before so we can make our HCM to Phu Quoc flight. Booked a hotel in HCM to stay the night and rescheduled flight from Da Lat to HCM. This flight got delayed a whole 2 days, costing me my hotel money. Will now take 8 hour bus ride from Da Lat to HCM to make my Phu Quoc flight, which hopefully won't be delayed either. Keeping my fingers crossed.

### "staff were in a bad mood"
Hi chi Minh City to Hanoi with Jetstar Pacific, and I take the first flight in the morning. The counters open only 1.5h before the flight and all the staff were in a bad mood. One of them ask me to return to my queue because she doesn't want to serve passengers with luggage - She said to me "why do you change your queue? Go back there, I check in only passengers without luggage". While there was no signboard or information on the screen saying that it's a special counter, and she could have said for example Sorry I serve only passengers without luggage. It would be nicer. The flight was correct, the food and beverages are more expensive than other competitors and the announcements are rough as well. Last thing, is the cabin storage bins above rows 1-2 are occupied by staff hand luggage - while you have to pay extras to get those seats.

### "authoritarian in-flight service"
My round trip flight on JetStar was pleasant until my last leg on 25 March from Ho Chi Minh back to Singapore. Upon boarding, I was not allowed to place my luggage in the opposite empty compartment (where I can keep an eye on) and can only place it above my seat as insisted by the crew (I complied). Throughout the 2 hours flight I remain seated all the time with seat belt fastened, seat upright, window blinds up, not disturbing anyone, not requiring any assistance, and even tucked away my camera in a waste punch instead of hanging it over my neck. After 1 hour in to the flight, a crew member tells me that my camera waste-pouch would get entangled in an emergency and it is JetStar’s policy to stow waist pouch in the overhead compartment. I did not comply with this second instruction as I have never heard of such instructions before. He insisted and said he had already told me so. After landing where all passengers had disembarked, I showed him that my is not a strap-on-waist pouch but a pouch that straps on to my tight-belt and any entanglement would be on my belt rather than my pouch, and this would rather amount to a no belt policy. When I said that he is the first crew to complain about my pouch, he replied that all other cabin crew had not been doing their job. When I said I will write to JetStar for clarification, he encouraged me to by offering me JetStar form to fill in and said I will get a quicker response through this form submission. As a paying customer with a choice of not having to be subjected to such authoritarian in-flight service, I would like to hear from JetStar on what is JetStar’s intention?

### "changed flight without notifying"
Da Nang to Ho chi Minh with Jetstar Pacific. Do not book this airline. They changed the flight from 10.55hrs to 20.00hr without mailing or otherwise notifying us. Vietnam Airlines ground service staff had hard work to book a lot of passengers who, like us, because absurdly late for connecting international flights in Saigon. Ground service were ok.

### "service desk staff are rude"
Horrible airline, Jetstar Pacific flight seems cheap but if you count the delays and terrible service than you are paying a high price. Had this flight from Danang to Ho chi Minh "transferred" to later flights twice as Jetstar is either overbooking or trying to fill all their flights and their motto is screw the customer. The ground staff and service desk staff are rude and speak poor english. If you are transferred you should go to the airport and demand your flight.

### "already been delayed twice"
Ho Chi Minh to Danang. We have already been delayed twice, now leaving 9 hours later than expected. We are bracing ourselves for 1-2 more delays. It is likely they keeping delaying people to a flight that will be full enough in order to save them money. Thanks for a complete absence of customer service Jetstar. I will do my best to deter anyone else from using your sorry excuse of an airline.

### "terrible if you have connecting flight"
Jetstar Pacific is a terrible airline if you have a connecting flight. Had three flights booked to tour Vietnam every one time changed by at least 3-4 hrs. My last one was to connect with international flight back to UK. The time they changed would have seen me missing a £1000 flight for two people. Had to really argue to get flight to suit eventually they got me flight that left me getting up a 5 am from my holiday resort then hanging around Ho Chi Minh airport for 7 hrs.

### "staff were friendly"
Flew Jetstar Pacific from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. Got an email a week prior to flight saying that it had been rescheduled to half an hour earlier than the original time. Check in was easy, plane took off a little late (pretty much the original booked time) and the staff were friendly. Reminded me of easyJet in the UK, no problems and cheap. Also got assigned the extra leg room seats - probably because all 4 of us were tall - and we didn't even have to ask.

### "2 hours waiting for check in"
Macau to Da Nang with Jetstar Pacific. The checkin process is a mess. In Da Nang airport they only opened one counter for checkin. It took us almost 2 hours waiting for check in, which is totally insane. And the staff didn't understand English. I tried to ask her to call someone to open a new counter but she could only say two words "please wait". Worst airline.

### "not be flying again"
I recommend avoiding Jetstar Pacific at all costs. The night before my flight, I got an e-mail informing me my flight from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh had been rescheduled from 1:10 pm to 8:40 am. Pretty major inconvenience, considering my next flight was scheduled for 5:20 pm. I got through to customer service, and they were able to move my next flight (HCM to Da Nang) up to 1:05. Great. Well, as soon as I got to HCM, and fought my way to the front of their absolutely chaotic check-in counter, I was informed my flight had been rescheduled to 3:30. So now I'm stuck waiting 4.5 hours in the airport for this next flight. Boarding time rolls around, no updates. Departure time rolls around, still no updates. 10 minutes after departure time, I find out the flight has been further delayed to 6:10. Unbelievable. What should have been a 5,5 hour trip including layovers is now going to be an 11 hour trip. I won't be surprised if this flight gets delayed again. Thank you, Jetstar Pacific for a terrible day I will never forget. I will not be flying with you again, and strongly recommend to others to do the same.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
It's Christmas day and I am waiting for a flight from Ho Chi Minh city to Hanoi. We originally booked on a flight to leave at 6.40pm tonight so that we would have time to eat christmas dinner with our family before flying and still get to Hanoi on time. However, our flight was delayed 2 hours so we decided change the time to an earlier flight at 3.50pm therefore missing Christmas dinner - something we were not happy about. So we've checked in and we are waiting for our earlier flight, which is delayed again - if we had been informed of this delay before we would've had time to have dinner with our family on this special day. I have flown with this airline many times and I can honestly say that it is the worst airline I have ever used - always delays - always some terrible excuse.

### "Thanks for nothing"
I originally booked from Australia to fly from Danang to Ho Chi Minh City on Jetstar Pacific flight BL593, scheduled to depart at 10:55am on 20 December. On 16 December we're emailed saying the flight is rescheduled to 8:10 pm. The only explanation for delaying a flight for 9 hours, "Operation requirement". OK, another day in Hoi An. Get to Danang airport at 6:00pm in plenty of time for our rescheduled, 8:10pm flight. Oh no sir, the flight is delayed until 10:30pm. No explanation. No apology. No offer of alternative arrangements. Only that I had been advised of the change sometime that afternoon by email. The implication being that it was somehow my fault that I hadnt checked my emails to discover that our inexplicably delayed flight was inexplicably delayed again. The 'explanation' for having to spend 4.5 hours in Danang airport - "Operation requirement" Well, 10:30pm came and went. No explanation. No apology. 10:55 was mentioned. That came and went. How about 11:10? Still no plane. Finally Jetstar Pacific showed that they do, in fact, have a plane and we departed at about 11:40pm. 12.5 hours after the original, scheduled departure time. Exited HCMC airport just after 1 am. Our hotel pick-up car had given up and gone home. And through the whole shoddy, tawdry episode nobody from Jetstar Pacific saw any need to explain, apologise, offer help, compensation, anything. Except, as the final insult, a small bottle of water just as the plane was about to board. Thanks for nothing.

### "I've never been so angry"
Jetstar Pacific is on a different planet when it comes to customer service and reliability. We were flying from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) to Hanoi and had our flight cancelled 4 times - not just once, but 4 times and no one said sorry, even though they spoke good English. I've never been so angry in my life. We had a tour booked which we lost our money to and we ended up wasting a whole day of our precious time in Vietnam trapped inside an airport. What angered me the most is that no one apologised, or tried to help us out. The company doesn't deserve any customers. I would advise travellers to boycott flying with Jetstar Pacific, unless you want disappointment, or to spoil your holiday.

### "I will never fly them again"
Jetstar Pacific from Saigon to Nha Trang. Arrangements were made by a Vietnamese friend so no confusion occurred over language. I knew I had an overweight bag so paid extra as required. Arrived at the airport and had to pay again even though I had the paperwork from the bank. Plane was 3 hours late when we finally got the call to board. As soon as we were seated the pilot announced that there was some paperwork he had to complete and we would be away. Half an hour later he said there were mechanical difficulties and engineers were on their way to fix them. Another wait and he came back on and told us the first engineer could fix the problem and a second one was coming. Another wait and the pilot told us the air-conditioner was broken and we would have to de-plane. We went back into the terminal and waited until they found another plane. Finally we left on our 6 pm flight at 11 pm. This airline brings a whole new meaning to the term "Mickey Mouse", it is a joke and I will never fly them again.

### "don't choose a low-budget company"
Booking on the internet I overlooked the other airlines and only saw Jetstar Pacific and booked Saigon to Hanoi flight. Trouble from the start. Purchased 2 tickets, for myself and for a friend. Paid for the luggage, 2 persons, 15kg each total €42,88, cost of emission €29,00 and cost of banking €9,04. Travelled due to circumstances alone. I myself had a little overweight (3.5 kg too much) and had to pay extra. I took out some things from my trunk and just took it in plastic bag into the plane. What is the difference - ridiculous. Jetstar Pacific changed flightplan one day before I left. Now had to leave my hotel already at 05:00am, really crazy because I still had to wait a long time at the airport. When I flew back I had problems with taking 1 bottle of alcohol in my handluggage and they removed it from me. No videosystem in the plane. Security advices are still given manually. Drinks and food are only available when you pay for it. My advice is to pay a little more and don't choose a low-budget company. You get so much more and are not annoyed by silly regulations.

### "it is too unreliable"
Jetstar Pacific cancelled our flight from Wellington to Auckland for mechanical failure (yet again!). Had to pay a premium to fly at last minute with a more reliable airline. Do not book Jetstar Pacific if you need a flight for business, it is too unreliable. Cheap flights, but not good service if they cancel a flight. It is not worth the extra expense when you have to rebook elsewhere.

### "don't understand transit"
Bangkok to Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh City. Received an email a few days before departure informing us our direct flight to HAN had no be routed through SGN (commercial reasons we are told). Got to BKK, check-in wonderful with bags processed to SGN and transit boarding cards given to us also. Arrived in SGN anticipating a smooth transition to our next flight, but this was anything but. Turns out this airline don't understand the IATA definition of a transit flight, at all. Complete mess where we had to go through immigration, queue several times and check our bags in once again. On the positive side, we did have 4 beers and a delicious airline sandwich for about €5 onboard. Crew were pleasant enough.

### "crew provided good service"
Flew this new Jetstar Pacific route late October 2015 on its 2nd flight after inauguration. New A320 Aircraft. Flights on time. Service in airport fine. On board there was a very good, proactive crew who provided good service despite flight was full. Lots of things to buy, including airline souvenirs. Food and drinks available and were not expensive, several hot meals offered and served promptly. Major drawback is the online ticket-purchase which manipulates the price up and up and eventually put on a booking and service fees, so the price more than doubles as compared to what you start out with.

### "on-board staff courteous"
Website continuously timed-out when making booking. One occasion got right down to confirm flight then message appeared that the price has increased, so had to start again, not just confirm the increased price. The increase was not much, about 100,000 VND. Check-in process and staff member serving was excellent. On-board staff courteous, polite, and speaks good english. Both at airport and on Jetstar website, lack of information about flight boarding/take-off timings. At HAN airport the departure info screens just gave us the details that were on our travel itinerary. Our flight was delayed 45 minutes. Airport flight departure screens or announcements did not tell us this. We were queuing from 7pm for 7.25pm take-off, but boarding only commenced at 7.45pm for 8.15pm take-off. Online departure times on Jetstar website gave only the info provided on itinerary. It was not updated to reflect delays. Onboard services generally good, but lack choices for hot meals. There are four options on the menu. Only one choice was available from the beginning. The pork with rice.

### "low cost for low quality"
Jetstar Pacific is a pretty bad company. Both flights from and to Ho Chi Minh were cancelled and replaced by flights hours later on the same day. Every cancelation was not announced in advance and they didn't offer any compensation (not even a bottle of water ). Low cost for low quality. Inside the flights the seats are awful.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
There is no Web check in for the flight from HCMC to Singapore return. After getting the boarding-pass, passengers were checked again with their hand-luggage strictly for 7kg at the end of the check-in counter by another agent. The hand luggage weighing more than 7kg have to be sent as check-in luggage with an additional fee of 60SGD. After check-in, all passengers were forced to depart immediately even they check-in 3 hours before the departure time of the flight. In order to assure this, the agent keep the boarding-pass of the passengers and follow the passengers to the departure gate, only give to boarding pass to the passengers at the departure gate to be sure that they will never come back?

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
I didn't know what to expect from this airline due to some mixed reviews, but the plane was clean and staff were friendly. We departed on time. The items I bought on board were relatively cheap. Can't complain really.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
BL268 Jan 30. Flying from Phu Quoc to HCMC. Booked online. Cheap price with no problems. Nice check in nice plane on time nice crew.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Hanoi to HCMC Jan 30 2015. Flight delayed due to engineering requirement sat at the airport extra 2 hrs. When I booked our tickets they had up front seating 2 seats wide thought it would be worth it to have the extra space. They must have changed the plane as we were reassigned seats when we got to the airport they did offer us exit row seats although when I got to my seat it had a notice on it "do not use "as the back of the seat was missing! I found another seat away from my wife. The seat I ended up with had slow recline without pushing the button. No entertainment system even have to buy water.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
I had no idea this was Vietnam's worst budget airline with a 100% delay rate when I booked this ticket. I had booked a flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City that was scheduled to leave at 10.45pm. The flight was delayed until 12.15am but certainly didn't leave at that time. Everything was a mess. They treated their clientele extremely rudely and really didn't see to care about them. This was true at the service desk gate and onboard the plane. I count myself extremely lucky that the plane did start to board at 12.15am but that was chaotic. They transfer you by bus and everyone was pushing and shoving probably out of frustration and fatigue. We were packed on that bust like sardines. Then you arrive to the plane with more pushing and shoving to get off the bus and then on to the plane. We finally took off about 1am and arrived to Ho Chi Minh City about 2.30am with more delays to get off the plane because apparently the ground crew was not ready for the plane's arrival. If you are desperate for a cheap flight and don't mind the 100% chance that your plane will delayed by who knows how much time then go ahead and use JetStar Pacific. I personally would rather pay double for a decent airline than fly with them again. Live and Learn.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Check in at Noi Bai airport on flight BL 791 on 29/8/14 was not good staff asked for an extra 60000 VND for a seat 4 rows in front with no extra leg room. I asked for a window seat but she did not care and put me in the middle seat even though the flight was only 60% full. Seat: Had a low degree of recline but it was still comfortable the arm rest was not in good shape. Service: Everything on board had to be bought at an extra cost but it was of good quality and rather cheap. Overall: to be recommended.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Over the last 2 weeks in Vietnam we have had 5 domestic flights with Jetstar and all of them have been delayed by 3-5 hours. Jetstar don't send updates the staff couldn't care less and as a result you are left spending hours in the uncomfortable departure lounge that has very limited food options and not enough seats. We have wasted 2 days of our precious holiday because of this airlines incompetence. This is particularly frustrating when you have young kids. One of our flights was delayed from the reasonable departure time of 4pm to 8.55pm! Their nickname in Vietnam is "Delay Star". Wish we had booked Vietnam Airlines instead. Do yourself a favour even if Jetstar is cheaper don't use them. You will be very disappointed. Do not book connecting flights as you will not make the connection.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
When booking a one way flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi I went with JetStar Pacific because I've flown with Jetstar Asia multiple times and had a satisfactory experience and it was slightly cheaper than VietJet. Let's get this straight JetStar Pacific is not JetStar Airlines. It's a partner airline that was given the JetStar name so that they could have domestic flights in Vietnam. In this case JetStar should seriously consider severing ties as this is a determent to their brand. If you check online they have flights from HCM and HAN up to 7 times a day. I thought "Wow they must be doing brisk business. I was wrong. One week before I received an email saying that my flight was cancelled and they put us a flight 2 hours before I wanted to depart. I was fine with that even thought we'd have to get up earlier for our 2 hour trek to the airport from the village. But on the way to the airport I get another email saying that our flight was delayed 6 hours. When we arrived they told us it was a "technical" issue. We were told that there were no earlier flights. While waiting at the boarding area (they only have 1 dedicated gate) we found that they were boarding a flight for HAN. My mom asked why we weren't put on that flight and they said those customers had been waiting since 6am that morning (5+) hours for their flight. We weren't offered any food or drink. My mom had to ask for food vouchers which provided us with a sandwich. As the time got closer to our supposed time of departure there were no agents at the gate no announcement made of further delays and no further emails. When flight attendants for JetStar showed up for different flight they were immediately accosted by several riled passengers. They were perfectly nice and one attendant looked up on his phone and found that we were delayed another 1 hour (this is not published on their website so it was an internal source). So by the time we boarded the plane it was past 7pm. Let's check the math. By 7pm they managed to get off the ground 2 of the 7 flights they published. Passengers that day had more than a 70% chance of their flight being delayed/cancelled. I have a real suspicion that this was really them trying to get more people on a plane to save costs. If this is their business model it's not a good one since they've lost any future business from me and anyone who flew that day.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
After reading all of the reviews warning us of delays and cancelled flights we opted to fly Jetstar Pacific from HCM to DaNang fully aware of the ramifications for our actions. The price was too good to resist and we couldn't see the point of paying triple that with Vietnam Airlines. Check in was a slight issue with flights being cancelled left right and centre. The poor staff did their best to deal with an array of angry and difficult customers - but what do you expect for the money you paid? Our flight was delayed 10 hours but staff were lovely and moved us to an earlier flight so we only had to wait 5 hours. In saying this we noticed all of the Vietnam Airlines flights were delayed as well due to weather or late aircraft's. I was happy we hadn't paid an excessive amount to still be sitting around at the airport. If you want to fly out of HCM I would recommend Jetstar for their excellent prices. However next time I would opt to get the bus and avoid delays altogether!

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City (aka Saigon). Booked online for 2 adults and one lap infant had to click a few extra smaller links to add only one checked bag for one passenger (as opposed to a package deal or the same weight bag for all passengers). Arrived 2 hours early at the check-in counter and we got served immediately. Flight wasn't full so we had the 3rd seat in our row to ourselves. Seats barely fit my 5'10" (178cm) body. Expected it though. Cost 5 times less than Vietnam Airlines. Very friendly flight crew.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Flying from HCM to DaNang on 19th April 2014 and then returning on 24th. Both sectors were late the last by an hour on the first I had no tray table it was gone and as for contact in HCM on another matter I was given 5 different phone numbers all of which passed me on to another.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
I would definitely avoid Jetstar. At the last minute the flight which was supposed to leave at 14.30 for Da Nang was rescheduled to leave at 19.05. Once the announcement had been made we were given a voucher for food and drink at one of the snack bars in the departure lounge. We took the voucher to the snack bar - only to be told that it did not include coffee. We returned to the Jetstar check in desk - only to find there was nobody from Jetstar around. We kept checking and there were no Jetstar representatives in the departure lounge from the time of the announced delay to the time of the eventual boarding time of 19.50. To make matters worse the return flight was also delayed. It was due to leave at 16.15 then an announcement was made informing us that the new departure time was 16.30. 16.30 came and went. No departure and again nobody from Jetstar around. We eventually took off around 17.00. I know this is much better than the previously mentioned delay but it's still a delay with no representatives of the company and no information. I realise that Jetstar is a budget airline but this is completely unacceptable and we will not be travelling with Jetstar again.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Tried Jetstar Pacific for the first time on a return flight between Ho Chi Minh and Nha Trang half hour late leaving Ho Chi Minh and 2 hours late returning from Nha Trang. An email was sent 1hr before check-in which I couldn't check as we had already checked out of our hotel (no wifi) so didn't find out until we reached the check-in counter. Not a very organised airline at all. But then you do get what you pay for mind you we did pay extra to choose our seats! I'll definitely be paying more if need be to avoid using this airline in the future.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
I traveled on BL795 from Hanoi to HCMC in November 2013. The bus used to transfer us to the plane was rusty. The plane itself extremely dirty with black fingerprints at the overhead compartments. The ground crew were everything but not friendly. Having the cleanliness of the plane in mind I refrained from trying the food. A good decision. Same stir sticks that couldn't resist the force of gravity have just been picked up from the cabin carpet and put back on the trolley to the clean sticks. Generally spoken I never had such a bad experience with any other airline until now. First flight with that airline and they made it directly on my personal blacklist.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Made the mistake of booking a flight with Jetstar Pacific. Never again. Schedule was changed but no information sent. Only after I asked about the schedule change did BL inform me. They claim they advise the customers in a timely manner. I think they should have that little respect and advise of changes to the schedule ASAP. And who are they to decide what a timely manner is? I booked bulk head seats row 1 and paid the fee for this. At check in we couldn't get these seats as two travelers were too old. This was not and is as of today not in the T&C's. So Jetstar took our money but denied to deliver the service paid for. The aircraft was dirty and clearly not cleaned after the previous flight. Pretty disgusting appearance in fact. Seating was extremely tight. Wouldn't have been if we had gotten the seats we had paid for! The cabin crew seemed indifferent but to be fair I think they were really busy. Next time I will avoid Jetstar pacific by all means. I'd rather pay a tiny bit extra and fly VN. It just happened to be that Jetstars original schedule suited us better. Next time I will wait and fly a real airline!

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Arrived at Ho Chi Minh Airport to be told that my flight to Hoi An was delayed from 1.10pm to 6.20pm. The reason given was 'technical'. Offered no food or drink vouchers for the delay although I later found out that somebody else had. Eventually boarded at 5.50pm and were in the buses ready to go the plane then asked to get off as there was a problem. We all had to file back into the airport where we waited for another 30 minutes before boarding again. On the plus side must say one staff member on the aircraft was kind and gave me a bottle of his own water. I should add that if there is a technical problem with a plane then I am happy to wait until it is fixed but I wonder if the original problem with this plane was technical (somebody else had been told it was 'operational') and if it was why didn't they spot the problem with the wheel earlier when carrying out technical checks? Relieved that my return trip to Ho Chi Min does not connect with an international flight. I fly out of Vietnam two days later thankfully.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City in July 13 2013. Problem started with check-in. Upon check-in there was only one staff member at the counter and there was a long line of at least 50-60 people. It took more than 40 minutes to check in one bag that was already pre-paid. After I checked in and had my bag tagged I was called back. The counter crew member told me I needed to pay extra because I appeared to have too many bags. The boarding process was horrible. No order at all. People with babies and infants did not get to board first. Not an efficient boarding process at all. Flight scheduled to depart at 3.05 pm still on the shuttle at 3.07 pm. Finally took off at 3.31 pm. I choose a "premium" type of seating to find out that I was randomly assigned a seat. Why do I have to pay extra to sit in a "premium" seat when JetStar doesn't honor that. The worst part - no smile from any crew. Overall horrible experience.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Wish I'd read this before booking or I wouldn't have bothered. Our first flight from HCMC to Da Nang was delayed from 10.35 until after 4pm so that was the first day of our resort holiday lost. The night before our flight from Da Nang to Hanoi I received an email saying our flight had been put forward to a day later which meant missing another day and the cruise ship we were to board. We went to the airport anyway and got a Vietnam air flight immediately arriving half an hour earlier than the booked Jetstar.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
People need to remember that this is a budget airline! I used them for 3 flights within Vietnam one of which was severely delayed one was actually brought forward by about 40 mins and the other went without a hitch but I have no complaints - but that's the risk you run when flying budget delays and cancellations are inevitable.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
SYD-HNL. In a word dreadful. Trip taken end of July 2012 following the 'collapse' of Air Australia. Thank goodness we were only going across to Hawaii. Aside from the price there is nothing I can recommend about this airline flying this sector. The seats were uncomfortable the food was expensive and sub-standard and the entertainment well perhaps the most entertaining thing was imagining getting off the plane in Honolulu. Finally the service was shocking. I will never fly with Jetstar again.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Arrived in Vietnam with two Jetstar Pacific flights pre-booked. Flight 592 from Ho Chi Minh city to Danang on Nov 10th and a return Flight 593 on Nov 14th. Both were cancelled. I spent 15 minutes on Nov 10th trying to get them to answer their phone. I went out to the Airport early which meant I had an entire afternoon to watch the delays postponements and lack of information. The substitute flight I was given left over an hour late so I didn't get to Danang until after dark. I heard that my 13.35 return flight to Ho Chi Minh city was also cancelled and that they had rebooked me on a much later flight which would make me miss my International Connection out of Vietnam I had to waste more time trying to change this. Eventually I was forced get up at 5 am to take an early morning flight instead meaning I had to waste 7 hours in HCMC airport. I will never fly with them again.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
SIN-SGN. Price was excellent. Check-in and boarding was easy. Flew on an A320. Flight attendants seemed in a bad mood. Seat was uncomfortable little legroom no IFE and not enough recline. Food was extremely cheap but it wasn't really filling - it was good though. Bad presentation of food looked like it was a frozen dinner.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
We found the JetStar Pacific service to be very unreliable. First flight booked HCM City-Hanoi 9:55am flight. Turned up at airport to be told flight delayed to 4:00pm so wasted whole day sitting in low standard Ho Chi Minh domestic airport. Food vouchers provided but airport restaurant would only give limited and very poor quality food selection so ended up paying for a meal. Aircraft had fixed upright seats so very uncomfortable 2hr flight. Second flight was supposed to be Hanoi - HCM City departing 15:55pm. JetStar contacted me by SMS 3 days prior to be told flight was delayed to 10:25pm - good communication but this was too late for connection flight to Australia. Rang JetStar Pacific and managed to book earlier flight at 13:55pm so all looking okay. Turned up at airport 2 hrs prior (luckily) to find out that amended flight had been cancelled. Staff provided very limited support in trying to find another flight on another airline. No economy seats available to make international connection so ended up buying 2 of the last 5 Business Class seats on another airline. JetStar Pacific airport service was very slow as they only provide one check-in counter versus multiple counters for other operators in the same departure area. Not recommended.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
AKL-HCMC cancelled the flight for no reason. Assured me that I would be on the next day's flight. The next day there was no record of me and I was told the flight was full. Spent 3 hours with many angry people trying to sort it out. On my return they cancelled my Hanoi - HCMC flight so I lost a day and both ends of my trip. Customer service was awful.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
SGN-DAD-SGN. Check in on both legs quick and easy. Boarding a little chaotic but no more so than most cheap Asia flights. Extremely old and dirty Boeing 737-400. Both flights left and arrived pretty much to time and crew were polite and friendly. The general feel of aircraft was old worn out and dirty which does not give you a good feeling. Overall the flight was very good value for money however I would not choose to fly with Jetstar again due to the state of the aircraft.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
HKG to SIN. They get the job done and that is about it. Aircraft was a well maintained A320 legroom was ok for the 3.5hrs trip. Cabin crew friendly.

Check in was quick and easy flights on time. The plane was a little scruffy and the boarding a bit chaotic but nothing that bad. Jetstar were much cheaper than other options and they did the job well. We would use them again.

Hanoi-Da Nang. Turned up at Hanoi expecting to catch an early flight to Da Nang to find our flight wasn't even on the departures board. We were told the flight had been cancelled and moved to the following day with no alternatives offered. According to staff Jetstar should have sent an earlier email notifying of the cancellation but this was not the case. Flight refunds allegedly take two weeks however I am still waiting nearly a month later. For the sake of few extra dollars book with a more reliable company.

Hanoi-Danang and Hue-HCMC. Both planes extremely old not clean duct tape holding armrests to seats. Chaotic check-in process with pre-reserved seats not available. Space to a minimum struggled with my knees touching the seat in front. Prices for inflight food and drinks acceptable. Heavily-accented English announcements were hardly understandable. The first flight was delayed by 30 mins the second one was on time. Overall nothing special but not too bad either. However on the second flight both rows of emergency exits remained completely empty. When querying this they said the crew would open the emergency exits if necessary a comment that did not reflect the answer I was hoping for. It seems that Jetstar prefers those seats to remain empty if no one is willing to pay extra for them.

We flew from Saigon to Da Nang (Vietnam). Unfriendly dirty cabin and toilets no seat space. We paid for seat reservation and did not get the seats.

My second and last flight on Jetstar Pacific - Danang to HCMC return. High-mileage aircraft dirty inside and out holes in seats and carpeting and a foul aroma in the cabin. On the return we were lining up to board and were told of a 5 hour delay. A voucher was offered but could only be redeemed on a future flight. At least the return aircraft was in much better condition. Good price but unreliable and the condition of many of the aircraft is scary.

Received a text saying that my 2000 flight from HAN-SGN would be delayed until 2310. This is common on Jetstar my house mate had his flight to Hue delayed by one day. If there are not enough customers booked the flight simply does not take off and if you do not send them your mobile phone number you wouldn't know until you turned up at the airport. If you want reliable service do not use Jetstar.

SGN to HAN. Check in was a nightmare chaotic and disorganised. One staff uttered something in Vietnamese and all hell broke loose everyone just ran up to the counter. We did not know what was going on. It was an old A320 food prices were reasonable. Good thing flight was on time.

Hanoi - Da Nang return cancelled and automatically rebooked . Advised previous evening by email which being on Holiday I had not read so arrived at airport to find 10am flight changed to 5pm. Was offered refund which I accepted. Advised that return flight had been cancelled and we had been rebooked on flight 8 hrs earlier. Decided to seek refund on this flight too and was advised that this could only be done via call centre. Had to make 3 phone calls to call centre to confirm flight was cancelled and refund was organised (last by a Vietnamese travel agent ). Still waiting for both refunds 1 month later have sent 2 emails to customer service email still no reply. Also noticed when we were leaving Danang on the later VN airlines flight that the JS flight we had been re booked on was 10 hrs late so we would have missed our connecting flight in Hanoi if we had accepted the subtsitute earlier flight. As we were given advanced notice I assume that flights were not cancelled due to exceptional circumstances rather that it was a commercial decision. Will not be travelling Jetstar again as they are unreliable.

DaNang to HCMC. On arrival in Da Nang and checking in was not reassured by the staff's statement that the baggage handlers often steal from the bags. Good start. Flight was delayed for over an hour with no explanation. No attempt made by staff to direct people to form an orderly queue. Onboard cheap meals could be purchased. Plane wasn't overly clean which wasn't helped by passengers choosing to throw rubbish on the floor. The fare was cheap but I'd probably go with Vietnam Airlines next time. I agree with the comment about Da Nang - avoid spending time here. There was one shop to buy from all the toilets were broken (ie one didn't flush the other door didn't close others didn't have seats) and it was in general a miserable place.

Danang-HCMC. Flight on time B737-400 was clean. Bought a small meal for $2 quality acceptable. The only minor snag was that luggage too forever to arrive (40 min and SGN is a small airport) but that may not be under Jetstar's control. Not checking in luggage would have made the trip twice as quick. Better than 24hrs on a Vietnamese bus.

SGN-HAN RETURN. Was delayed in HCMC for 5 hours due to operational reasons - little or no communication in terms of when we were leaving. One good thing was a cheap bus to and from Hanoi Airport.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
HCMC - Da Nang then Da Nang - Ha Noi a week later. Passengers wandered around the cabin changing seats as the plane taxied to the runway and walked in front of the engine on the tarmac as there was no roped off area under the wings talking on their mobile phones. Safety demonstrations could not be heard in English due to the heavy accent and muffled PA. When the captain asked the cabin crew to 'prepare the cabin for landing' they simply dropped what they were doing and sat down. The second the plane landed passengers were up and opening overhead lockers despite the plane still hurtling down the runway. The fares are very cheap and most flights are barely an hour so its a great choice for these short domestic hops. Warning - Da Nang airport is not the type of airport you would wish to be delayed in - it has the atmosphere of an immigration detention centre.

SGN-DAD on B737-400. Flight delayed 2 hours (advised in advance) but the airport departure board didn't display revised details - the flight simply disappeared from the board after the original departure time which was disconcerting. Aircraft in good condition but seat pitch tight - 29 inches old style bulky seats re-upholstered in grey leather wouldn't be any fun on a longer flight. Hot food ran out after 6 rows not very good considering this was now a lunchtime flight. We got from A to B in one piece but there is room for improvement.

HCMC - Da Nang and return on ageing B737s. Pleasant Vietnamese crew. First flight was delayed 30 mins return flight was cancelled and we were bumped onto another flight departing 4.5hours later. Got to the airport and realised that our new flight had been "rescheduled" to depart 5 hours later (which of course was eventually delayed for 20 min) so we were delayed 10 hours in total! There were quite a few people at the airport affected and Jetstar didn't even offer us a meal/drink. At least Virgin Blue offers a meal voucher for a flight delay. To be fair they did offer us a refund if we didn't get on the flight. We'll fly with Vietnam Airlines in future - they've got more flights and they seem to depart mostly on time.

We booked return flights between Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang in Sep 2009 which were late in both directions. 4 hours one way 1.5 hours the other. No announcement was even made until more than 2 hours past the scheduled time. On the return the check in supervisor promised the flight would definitely be on time! We missed our connection to Phnom Penh! Jetstar staff were utterly useless and unhelpful surprising as Vietnam is such a great place to travel largely due to the friendly and helpful Vietnamese. Most flights seem to leave late in Vietnam allow plenty of extra time.

We were supposed on a return flight from Hanoi to Cantho. The flight was first announced to be delayed for 1 hour due to technical reasons. An hour later it was delayed again for the same reason. An hour later (now 2 hours past its departure time) they decided to let customers walk down the stairs to board the bus heading for the aircraft. The bus never went more than 100 m past the concourse and it turned around and parked. Meanwhile customers were made waiting on the bus for about 45 minutes with no official explanation from the airlines. Some customer became agitated at the delay the lack of information and just the overall unprofessional way of handling a seemingly routine matter by Jetstar Management. There was loud and angry exchanges between Jetstar and some customers and airport security personnel had to be called in to keep the peace. Finally they came up with an explanation that one of the landing lights was out and they can't land with a broken bulb. The replacement had to be flown in from abroad and that can take 1 day or 2. Jetstar had only 1 daily flight from Hanoi to Cantho so it's not possible to put us on the next flight. They did have flights to Sai Gon (about 160 km from Cantho though) but not until later in the evening. After much frustration we decided to opt for the next available flight to Sai Gon and then take the coach bus to Cantho on our own. After elbowing other Vietnamese for about 45 minutes moving from counter to another with absolutely no sense of what's going on we got on the 7:00 pm flight to Sai Gon. We were in luck because around 6:00 pm they announced that our flight would be delayed for 1 hour. Then it was delayed again and again. Finally when the A320 lifted off on Runway 26L at Noi Bai Airport the clock showed 11:30 pm. Now we were supposed to leave at 1:00 pm so it was a 10-hour delay. We never heard a word of apology from the airlines not an offer for something to drink or a meal. And we didn't even get to our original destination as stipulated on the confirmed ticket. We got home at 3:30 in the morning angry frustrated and vowed never be on Jetstar Pacific again. We heard unconfirmed stories from other travellers that the airline cancelled the flight on purpose because there were not enough passengers on either flight (to Cantho and from Cantho back to HN). It is purely a business decision to save money. They thought it was still much cheaper to scrap the flight and make a few people angry than flying a half-empty plane both ways. We were so surprised that this airline with zero sense of customer service responsibility to the traveling public no care for its brand is still allowed to operate in Vietnam.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Due to space between rows the leg space is very cramped. Onboard service is just okay. If you cancel your flight you will be lucky to get your refundas JetStar HCM City (so called Customer Relations) will make it very difficult for you to get your money back.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
HCMC - Hanoi and Hanoi to Nha Trang. Good crew and pilots. All flights on time and arrived early. The main problem with this airline is the age if the planes. The 737-400's look old and tired with missing paint over the fuselage. I hear they are replacing all of their aircraft over the course of 2009 if this were the case I would happily fly with them again.

### Jetstar Pacific customer review
Saigon-Haiphong and Hanoi-Danang. In what I hope is a meaningful comparison Jetstar Pacific is in the middle of the pack by international standards: check-in staff friendliness baggage handling food and tidiness were far beneath the standard of Singapore Airways or Thai but vastly better than United Northwest Delta or the other major American carriers. Both flights were about 30 minutes late but these days when a delay is an honest 30 minutes and does not ratchet upwards because of the airline's inability to communicate accurately I actually feel relieved. Legroom is very tight by Western standards but that is understandable since the Vietnamese are elegantly small in stature. Considering that a typical flight on Jetstar Pacific will set you back only $50 or so overall this is pretty good - three and a half stars.
