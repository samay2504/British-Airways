### "Thanks and highly appreciated"
Much appreciation for agents & support staff on Georgetown Airport. Flight was delayed By 1 hr. In That case i would have not able to catch further flight in my short layover, But the staff communication with Bridgetown staff were manage nicely and quick arrangements were made by them while arrive in Barbados to get on flight. Also nice support shown by Cabin Crew on Caribbean Airlines. Thanks and highly appreciated

### "Pleasant short flight"
Pleasant short flight. Plane was clean and on time. Boarding was efficient. Staff cheerful. Very convenient to reach other Caribbean islands. Will fly with them again.

### “Wonderful crew”
Not Verified | Wonderful crew on this very short flight. The aircraft comfort better than the ATR which is the main BW commuter. No service on this 30 minute hop but all in all great value and on time.

### "Truly the worst airline experience"
Truly the worst airline experience I have ever had. My name is Tom, my ticket says Tom. My passport says Thomas. They refused to allow me on the plane, and I had to buy a new $450 ticket with no refund eligible. Do not fly Caribbean Airlines. Just don't do it.

### "just a horrible experience"
A horrible experience. I’ve flown on many airlines (JetBlue, Delta, Southwest, Virgin, Spirit, Avianca) and this one is definitely at the bottom of the list. I will never fly with Caribbean Airlines again. There is a long check in and drop off line because the agents can’t be bothered to work with any urgency. It took another customer in line yelling at one of the agents for them to start checking people in. I was also double charged for my checked bag. This is after I was told I couldn’t pay for my bag in the first line and was directed to another line after already waiting 45 minutes to check in. There is also no TSA pre check with this airline so please get to the airport with 3-4 hours to spare. Our gate was switched with no notification. We just happened to realize our flight number was posted at a different gate. No seats in front of the gate and the announcements were extremely hard to hear and understand. The inflight entertainment was limited to their selection. There is no in flight wifi so also be aware of that. The tray tables were stained with coffee and the garlic snacks being passed out did not help at all with odor control. Overall just a horrible experience that I will not subject myself to again.

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with. The ticket agent who checked me in was extremely rude she made me take 3 lbs out of my carry on and continued to harass me at the boarding gate told me that I could not take the rum on board which I purchased in the airport that it’s an extra piece. Also she seated me way in the back of the plane last row and it was not a full flight.

### "no refund has been made"
Not Verified |  Caribbean Airlines is not recommended! Our flight was canceled four months before departure. That flights have to be canceled for operational reasons is not nice for the passenger but understandable. However, as an alternative, we could only be offered a flight more than 24 hours later and to another destination airport. Since this would not have been compatible with our other travel plans, we had to request a refund. The airline is obligated to this, since they had canceled the flight. Four weeks ago I had phoned the airline and initiated the refund. Until today, more than four weeks later, no refund has been made. I have rarely experienced such poor customer service. The airline cancels the booking and as a customer you now have to chase your money for months.

### "the worst airline I’ve flown"
Not Verified |  Staff did not care about customer comfort. Had another passenger from the front of the plane come all the way to my seat at the back to chat with their friend while standing in the aisle for 20 mins blocking other passengers going to the toilet. Had to confront that same person to remove there elbow off my head rest one time and then again an hour later when they did the same thing. Staff passed that person multiple times and said nothing. Honestly the worst airline I’ve flown with so far

### "they are reasonable"
I went to Jamaica for a week on vacation, and I have no complaints regarding Caribbean airlines. Not the best airline on the planet but they're definitely by far not the worst - they are reasonable and if you're willing to spend a bit more, than business class definitely is substantially more comfortable. The only drawback that I can think of, but that isn't their fault, is the fact that on the return trip I had to make four stops in four different countries.

### "The service was lousy"
As a flight attendant for another airline, I was highly disappointed in this one, especially with the flight crew. This was my first time flying Caribbean Airlines & I expected way better!! My mom & I booked tickets to Trinidad to visit a friend. The ticketing agents were great! The gate agents didn't speak clear enough to hear what group was being called, from the time we stepped on to the plane and said hello, only one flight attendant out of two spoke. The service was lousy (4 hr flight and you only do service once? & On top of it just handing out a bag of chips & a cup of drink? ), Didn't see a flight attendant for trash until near the end of the flight. You could hardly hear the announcements being made, they needed to speak louder and clearer. No wifi! I was hoping they would have wifi, even if I had to pay for it, I didn't mind but no they didn't. However they have something called Caribbean View with shows & movies you can watch. Overall I wouldn't be in too much of a rush to take this airline again, I would look for someone else.

### "Staff was very welcoming"
Not Verified |  I traveled with Caribbean airlines flying out of Toronto Canada into Trinidad and Tobago. I haven't flown with this airline in about twenty years. I must say I was totally happy with the service they provided. Staff was very welcoming. The pilot was amazing with the way he took of and landed . I was very hesitant about flying with them because of what negative reviews and experiences I heard. Thanks for making my trip a great one to the team and staff at Caribbean airlines.

### "still waiting for my refund"
I canceled my reservation to fly from JFK to Port of Spain in April 2022. I am still waiting for my refund. I have sent countless emails, and received countless replies, all insisting that I'll get a response within 48 hours. That's all I have received. In short, I can't see myself getting anything other than platitudes and lies from Caribbean. Massively disappointing, and obviously I would recommend that travellers avoid this outfit at all costs.

### "Stay away from them if possible"
Not Verified |  To start off, the expectations were definitely not met when travelling with Caribbean Airlines. When I arrived at my seat the legroom and gestures were quite nice. Obviously nothing special since we were in economy but it was solid. For reference I am 5'8. I thought everything was worth the price at first but after takeoff the food service was horrible. They served a sloppy hard sandwich with a small drink of your choice. Apart from that everything was going well until we arrived at Guyana. Back in Canada when checking in we payed for 2 extra suitcases. The check-in lady didn't tell us our suitcases wouldn't be on that flight coming with us because when we arrived at Guyana we spent a 1.5 hours looking for our 2 extra suitcases, later to find out a few days later that they didn't come on the flight with us. After travelling with Caribbean Airlines twice on a flight to Guyana and a flight back home to Canada I can conclude that it is definitely not a good airline. Stay away from them if possible.

### "lucky to get your refund"
They are the worst airline ever; do not waste your money with them. If by any chance you need to cancel or reschedule, you are looking at almost a year if you are lucky to get your refund.

### "will never fly with them again"
I had to cancel my flight; it was a flex ticket. They charge you a $50 fee and the refund take at least 9 months to get your money back. This is ridiculous, I will never fly with them again.

### "cancel flights without notice"
Not Verified |  This airline cancelled my roundtrip flight that I paid almost $800 USD for and refused to reimburse me! They cancel flights without notice so you will get to the airport and that's when you know it's been cancelled. Their workers were so dismissive and did not want to help me by even putting me on the next flight like any other airline would have. They also have the oldest, slowest and most outdated systems you could ever imagine. The slowest lines, no online customer service chat, no self-check-in? They left me stranded in New York. I cried because I could not afford another ticket at the prices they were telling me. I had to buy a ticket through another airline to go home.

### "my trip exceeded expectations"
Was originally due to travel in March 2022, but, tested positive for Covid19. Caribbean Airlines differed my ticket to a later date, at no cost. When I was ready to fly in May 2022, the call centre was able to rebook quite simply. I used the opportunity to upgrade my ticket to Business Class which the agent did over the phone, simple transaction. I use the APP for all my Flight Management with regard to seats, meal requests etc.. BW600/26JUN POS/YYZ operated on-time. It was my first time using the new B737 MAX8 and was really impressed with the comfort of the cabin. The ergonomics of the seat made for a super comfortable 6hr flight. The IFE is a big improvement on this aircraft and the aesthetic of the cabin is also very mod looking. Once of the highlights of this flight was the ability to pre-order a meal. In this case, it was the Stewed Chicken with Macaroni Pie, Callaloo, Fried Plantain. A full on Sunday lunch on a Thursday night, LOL. Food was a generous amount and very tasty. Upon arrival in YYZ, I was expecting delays exiting the aircraft and getting thru Immigration and Customs. News of lengthy delays preceded my trip, but, it was actually very easy. BW607/09JUN YYZ/POS via GEO. Another on-time departure, early in fact. I opted for this flight via GEO because I preferred a daytime flight vs the red-eye which operates non-stop YYZ/POS, no regrets. Had a nice late breakfast in the lounge at Pearson and then a another delicious pre-ordered meal as we took off towards Guyana. This time, I ordered the Curry Chicken (or Chicken Curry) with Dhal and Rice. It was also a very generous amount and very tasty. Great flight down into the Southern Caribbean. The crew: On both flights, my cabin crew were amazing. They really do stand out from crews on other airlines in my opinion. They are warm and compassionate and their service is graceful. Extremely professional. Overall, my trip with Caribbean Airlines exceeded expectations and look forward to flying with them again soon. I always feel that I have already arrived home when I step aboard a Caribbean Airlines flight, no matter which gateway destination, I'm at.

### "not be using this airline ever again"
Not Verified |  
I bought a ticket to SVG and for the reason that my son lost his job, he cancelled that, and then rebook when he was told it takes 6- 9 month to get back his refund which was less than half. Caribbean Airlines takes 6-9 months to refund money but he had to pay 250$ to rebook. This is high class robbery. I will not be using this airline ever again.

### "This is disrespectful and fraudulent"
A ticket was purchased for January 2, 2021 to leave from Havana, Cuba. Unfortunately the government of Cuba shut down all flights. In May of 2021 we requested a refund since it was apparent that only flights financially benefiting the Cuban government would be leaving Cuba. Caribbean Airlines did advise it would take up to 5-6 months to process the refund. We are now almost to a year with no refund. When I contact the refund department of Caribbean Airlines they send an auto email that someone will call within 48 hours. Of course no one calls. When I call the customer service line then I get put on hold multiple times then always eventually a disconnected line every single time. This is disrespectful and fraudulent. I want my money returned!

### "went above and beyond"
Not Verified |  Staff was very helpful, did not have a acceptance pass to enter my home land of Trinidad and Tobago after traveling 200 miles from Boston MA for a funeral my mon and brothers was stuck missing one acceptance letter and not being able to board due to the letter Mr. Willcott at the ticket center went above and beyond and helped find the missing travel pass. He made things happen for us.

### "refund process will take a minimum of 9 months"
Cancelled a return flight purchased through Caribbean Airlines. It was a FLEX/economy flight which states it's 100% refundable. But of course, you must read the fine print which says there is a USD$50 processing fee. The refund process will take a minimum of 9 months. I can see other people leaving reviews are still waiting on their refunds. Basically, you are paying them to sit on your money for 9+ months. If customer service was better and explained why it was so ridiculous, this would have been a better experience but of course, it was terrible. They were extremely short and rude. Unfortunately, CAL is the only airline flying to Trinidad & Tobago. As soon as any other airlines start flying to Trinidad & Tobago, fly with them instead.

### "not yet received my refund"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly on Caribbean Airlines in October 2020 to Kingston. However Caribbean airlines cancelled my flight and wanted to put me on another flight 14 hours later. This was not convenient for the purpose of my travel so I told them that that flight would not suffice. They told me it could take “up to ninety business days for a refund”. It is now seven months since September 30, 2020 and I have not yet received my refund of $493. I have contacted the airlines at least five times now. I have contacted Expedia. I have contacted BBB and I have even written an email to the CEO of the airlines. All they are telling me is that my refund was submitted to the refund department.

### "nothing to credit or refund me"
This airline cancelled my flight due to COVID in March 2020 and is now refusing to issue me a refund or a credit. The customer service rep was incredibly rude to me over the phone. When I asked to be transferred to speak with someone else, she hung up on me. $700 on a flight and they can do absolutely nothing to credit or refund me. Very disappointing, especially because we are repeat customers.

### "one year later and still no refund and lies, lies, lies"
I paid for my ticket in February 2020 but because of Covid my flight got cancelled. I applied for a refund because my Father received a refund for the same Day returning flight. It is now February 14, 2021, a year later and all I have heard is excuses and lies! They even had the nerve to block me on Facebook rather than issue a refund. They even said a refund was issued and after 14 days said it never was and I should receive it soon, one year later and still no refund and lies, lies, lies. So disappointed in my Caribbean Airlines position in this matter.

### "would not give me a refund back"
Not Verified |  I had to cancel my flights due to COVID and they would not give me a refund back. Instead, one of their team members chose a date without letting me know and rebooked my flights. A few weeks later, my sister who was scheduled for the same flight ended up getting a full refund along with a few others I know. I'm not entirely sure why I was not getting a refund and why they kept accusing me of re-booking my tickets when I never did! Also, my last travel with them to Guyana was a horrible experience!

### "ought to be illegal!"
St Marteen to Port of Spain. I arrived at St Marteen airport to travel home via Trinidad as a layover due to the COVID issue. At the Caribbean counter, the representative was not accepting people so my flight was canceled. I asked, so that's it? I can't fly? He said, no. He said I could try another airline and that I could get a refund online, then he turned away, dismissing me. I went home, took back my apartment and rental vehicle, and made plans to just stay and deal with things, told my family to not expect me home due to the developing situation and traveling issues (we had already spent money we don't have trying to get me there and back). The next day, I went online and was told the man had lied. They told me I would have to travel, set another date and that was as good as they could manage. I'm sorry, but I did not cancel my plans. Apparently, Trinidad was closed before the ticket was ever sold. Why did you sell a ticket for a place that was closed to anyone but nationals? That ought to be illegal!

### "told I would receive a refund"
New York to Montego Bay. I will never book another Caribbean airlines flight again!! I booked the airline for my wedding in jamaica for a 7am flight on 02/26/2020 and they called me at 5 am and cancelled my flight without giving me any reason. They could not tell me why my flight was cancelled the representative on the phone was unsure. I had around 100 people meeting me for my wedding and they told me the next available flight was at 4pm and was subject to delays. The whole day would have been missed by the time i travelled after landing in jamaica. I had to cancel my reservation in which i was told i would receive a refund. I have not received any refund or notification in writing or emails that i would be getting a refund. Only to wait 21 business days. When i called the airline no person would even tell me the status of my refund. I am completely left in the dark. I can not understand how an airline could conduct business in this manner. Also the reliability of this airline is completely compromised. I had to spend an extra 700$ to book a whole new flight the morning of the cancellation.

### "I filed a dispute"
On November 15, 2019, I went to Caribbean Airline’s website to purchase three tickets to Barbados, for $223.20 per ticket. The flights were scheduled to leave around 2:40 pm, on November 15th, and arrive in Barbados around 10 pm that same night. I selected three flights with this flight information. When I received confirmation of the flights, it stated that the flights would arrive around 9 am the next morning, on November 16th. That was not the flight times that I selected. I immediately called Caribbean Airlines Customer Service and informed the representative that there was a mistake with the flight times on the confirmation. I stayed on the phone with her for about five minutes while she looked up my flight information. She instructed me to go to the Caribbean Airlines’ counter in the Miami Airport and have the Desk Agent change the flights. I waited for about 1.5 hours for this change. The Desk Agent also spoke with her Supervisor and they both worked on changing my flight. After waiting for approximately 1.5 hours at the Caribbean Airlines’ counter, the Desk Agent told me that there are no longer any seats available on the flights that I selected. I requested a full refund, at the counter, since the flights that I originally selected were not available anymore. I also requested to speak with the Supervisor that was helping her to change the flights. She denied my request and informed me that I would have to call Customer Service again because they do not issue refunds at the counter. She also stated that Customer Service would be able to issue a full  refund. I walked away from the counter and called Customer Service. I spoke to a different Customer Service Representative than before. I explained the situation. She informed me that the reason the Desk Agent instructed me to call Customer Service was because the Desk Agent knew that I would NOT be able to get a refund at all. And the Desk Agent didn’t want to have a confrontation at the counter. So, the Desk Agent passed me back to the Customer Service Department, according to the Customer Service Rep. This Customer Service Rep said that she could only issue a flight credit. I stated that I was not interested in a flight credit because it was their error on their part with booking the wrong flights. She told me that the only person able to issue a full refund was a Supervisor. I then, requested to speak with a Supervisor. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes, the phone line was suddenly disconnected. I thought it was a mistake or maybe a bad signal on my phone. I called Customer Service again and repeated the same situation regarding booking flights for a specific time and the flight confirmation coming back with a different time. I immediately asked to speak with a Supervisor after explaining the situation. This time, I waited about 15 minutes on hold and the phone line disconnected again. My phone did not have a bad signal. They purposely disconnected the line to prevent a conversation with a Supervisor, who may or may not have been able to resolve the issue. After, a second disconnection and hours of trying to have my issue resolved, I filed a dispute with American Express to receive a credit for these flights.

### "communication is less than poor"
New York to Montego Bay. Flight time was 7 am. After 9 am we were told the flight may not leave as there is a technical problem. The communication between the company and its customers is less than poor. Finally around 1130 we went from not leaving to departure soon. We don’t live near the airport, we left at 1 am to make our flight. The only thing Caribbean did was hand out $12 vouchers which most establishments would not take. Steer clear, the flight was no bargain, the plane was old and dated. We tried dealing with Caribbean but would only say they don’t take phone complaints.

### "My bag never arrived"
New York to Port of Spain. The worst customer service. My bag never arrived from JFK to Trinidad, I made a report upon my arrival and was told that they would call me once the bag was found and they would send it to me at my final destination, Antigua. Three days later, I had made more than 40 calls to the airline in New York and Trinidad, 300 USD dollars in international calls, and I received zero calls from the airline informing about the case. I was treated disrespectfully, someone hung up the phone on me when I politely insisted for assistance and information. I emailed the CEO and a director of the company asking for their help, no response, just a customer officer responded saying they would look into it. This is a disaster and I strongly advise against this airline.

### "poor customer service"
Not Verified |  I made reservations for my daughter and her husband to Tobago, however when the email arrived her name was spelt incorrectly. I then called to make the change, I was put on hold at least four times, each lasted at least 10 mins. I was told all of the times that I had to wait on a supervisor's report of the recording. I was then told I was the one who misspelt my daughter's name. I called the very next day, requesting a listen of the recording. I was then transferred to customer service I was told I can't and they had to send the recording to another supervisor again I was put on hold for at least 13mins. this time I was told that I will not be able to listen to the recording. this time someone tried to explain that the travel is between Trinidad and Tobago and sometimes if a letter is missing they can overlook it, however if they don't I will have to pay for the error. This is poor customer service, even though they are the only airline operating the bridge between T&T its highly unprofessional.

### "service representative negligence"
New York to Montego Bay. I bought a 2 way ticket on Caribbean Airlines. Before my return trip I received an email from the airline saying that my flight was cancelled and I was reaccommodated on a flight the following day. I was not able to travel on the date they gave me so I called more than a week before the given date to find out my options. The representative on the phone  was rude and unwilling to help. She said I had to pay a rebooking fee plus the difference to get on a new flight with the same airline. I was not advised that I could place that ticket on hold for future use or that I could receive a refund as my flight being cancelled happened on the airline's part, certainly not mine. I received no refund and no credit either. I had to buy a new return ticket because of Caribbean Airline's customer service representative negligence due to inadequate customer service training of the airline's staff.

### "small airline with great qualities"
Traveled from Miami to Port of Spain on a Boeing 737-800. Check in was smooth and quick. Purchased a Caribbean Plus seat, 9C. As a member of Caribbean Airlines club, check in process is via the business class counter. I proceeded to the LATAM club. This club was very clean and offered light snacks, free wifi, charging ports for electronic devices. After, I proceeded to the gate for boarding. Boarding process was very easy as Club members board after business class passengers. Upon arrival into the aircraft, I was personally greeted by the purser. He checked my boarding pass and directed me to my seat. My seat was very comfortable and very spacious. I highly recommend purchasing a Caribbean Plus seat. The advertised seat pitch is 37 inches and seat recline was great. The meal service was excellent and comprised of chicken breast, noodles and vegetables. The meal was delicious. The flight attendants were very friendly and professional. The flight left five minutes early and arrived into Trinidad 25 minutes early. The landing was the smoothest landing ever. The captain and his first officer were outstanding.This is a small airline with great qualities and I hope it continues.

### "staff very unfriendly"
Newark to Georgetown via Port of Spain. Check in staff in Newark misinformed me about my bags being checked all the way through to Georgetown, I bought duty free in EWR and it was a hassle getting it through Port of Spain. Staff at front desk made me wait until they were ready to walk me through the gates. On both outgoing and return trips I found the staff, with a couple notable exceptions, very unfriendly. Seemed they thought they were doing me a huge favor. You guys need to either retrain these staff or get rid of them as they are doing damage to your reputation. On return trip I was literally refused to be sold Duty Free because no one at the front desk told me that I had to place the duty free in my checked luggage? When I arrived in Port of Spain it seems that they had a procedure for handling it for in transit passengers. I ended up buying the Duty Free in Port of Spain at a higher price as well! Flight delays were not even explained properly. With one exception the ground staff showed little empathy with the fact that a 2 hour delay could have messed up my interconnecting flight. The agent that checked me in was rude and very curt. She signaled me to walk up to her desk then had me wait several minutes while she finished the prior task she was working on before even greeting me. Why not just leave me in the line so I could go to another agent who would be ready to do my transaction? I had zero confidence that she would have given me any useful information given her demeanor. I had to ask around ince inside the terminal building until I found someone who was able to explain that the interconnecting flight would also be delayed.

### "changed our flight 5 times"
Not Verified | New York JFK to Port of Spain. Horrible, they changed our flight 5 times before we even boarded. The result was a different date and a very inconvenient red eye. No flexibility at all, no refunds at all. Never again

### "Avoid this airline like the plague"
Not Verified |  Due to fly Trinidad to Tobago with Caribbean Airlines. Terrible airline. Flights are leaving every 30 minutes to the same destination (interisland) and instead of sending the next flight on the next plane, ours has been delayed. 2 hours and counting. 3 flights have left with later departure times than ours. Same situation both directions. Avoid this airline like the plague.

### "A wonderful experience"
Port of Spain to New York. A wonderful experience from Caribbean Airlines, the flight departed on time and arrived before scheduled on the trip up. The seats were comfortable and the food was good, in my opinion there is no competition to Caribbean's food. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive.

### "worst airline I’ve traveled"
New York JFK to Port of Spain. The worst service all around except for the one lady who gave me a smile on the way back to NY. Went to Trinidad for 2 days to attend a funeral so tickets were booked at last minute. After calling several times to their customer service line I was given a price that was higher than online. The lady was rude and of no help. Booked tickets online, of course double the usual price but that’s expected, not sure why. The planes were dirty, crew to and from were not friendly, makeup on the ladies was a mess, bathrooms are a mess, seats hard and dirty and extremely uncomfortable. My seat couldn’t recline which resulted in a backpain that lasted a day and half. Not nice especially when you have to go to work as soon as you’re out of the airport. I didn’t bother to eat the food, the carts were dirty too. By far the worst airline I’ve traveled in. Wish I had other options but they were the only one flying at that time.

### "reward system is not worth it"
Port of Spain to New York JFK. I am a very frequent flyer with Caribbean Airlines for the past 2 years I have taken approx 10 round trip flights with them which got me to their silver tier rewards status. I was supposed to be entitled to 4 upgrades to first class and free tickets based on my mileage. The most disappointing thing about this program is when you are ready to redeem your mileage they have blackout dates, your first class upgrades means you cannot buy a regular economy ticket, you would need to buy a flex or an "upgradable" ticket which is almost the exact cost of a business class ticket. This is not choosing to fly with Caribbean. Their reward system is not worth it. For frequent flyers the rewards are the deciding factor and Caribbean Airlines is not on par with international competition.

### "I do not recommend"
New York JFK to Georgetown. Miserable experience with Caribbean Airlines. The check-in agents at JFK were  disrespectful - not a single smile, didn’t want to use my credit card for my 2nd luggage because it was too many fields to enter into the AR system. The airplane is very antiquated. For example, the cloth seat covering appears dirty, tray table is dirty, windows had cracks, flight attendants are forgetful, and restroom is dirty. I do not recommend using Caribbean Airlines.

### "standards continue to drop"
Port of Spain to Kingston. I think that the menu for this airline should be revised. To have sandwiches as cold as the air conditioning unit is not the best and even if as a cold sandwich the bread is usually dry. The hot meals (breakfast) specifically the potatoes with a bun are both dry, I'm unsure if the eggs are real eggs or if its liquid or powdered eggs but these things should also be made clear as it is easy to get allergies from certain foods. I have been traveling for more than 4 yrs with this airline and its standards continue to drop.

### "Crew excellent on one hour flight"
Flew Georgetown to Port of Spain. First leg of Georgetown to Toronto was excellent. I found out someone had bumped me out of my aisle seat and I was now in a window seat but check-in staff were excellent in trying to find a solution. Boarding was early and smooth - funny how efficient things are when no rush! Crew excellent on one hour flight. Great cockpit announcements. Bar service fast and efficient. Only drawback was ancient cabin but hey, it was a short flight.

### "cabin was tired and dirty"
This should have been one review as I purchased a ticket from Georgetown through to Toronto. However on arrival in Trinidad we were told we would have to deplane and change aircraft. In any other airport it would be simple. Not in Trinidad! Zero ground staff and we waited in a queue for 30 minutes and only after I asked were we advised that the boarding pass printer was down. Finally had to issue new boarding passes. Why? Then go through security again and head to the gate. I had found out my seat was changed to a window from an aisle and Trinidad gate agent said no other aisles available but on boarding I saw the emergency exit was free. He lied. Flight left 20 minutes late and Captain said it was a mechanical issue but a pax boarded at departure so was it mechanical? Seat cushion was non-existent and cabin was tired and dirty. Also greeted in Y by a nasty flight attendant who started to harangue me for putting duty free in the overhead bin as it could fall out. A simple move of the bags already there fixed that potential issue. Flight attendant watched and scowled as I sorted out the bags and solved her stacking issue. So much better to give crap to customers than fix the problem! 75 minutes after take off "lunch" arrives. I have never seen anything so gross in my life. Just serve nothing if this is the best you can do. No pre meal beverage service, only done at the same time as the so called "meal". After meal waited over an hour for pick up of the "tray" and no after dinner beverages offered. This was a nearly 6 hour flight! No service for 2 hours and no warning that feature movie was going to start. Of course no request to lower blinds so couldn't see tiny overhead screens anyway. They say free entertainment but no headsets provided. Bar service 90 minutes from Toronto and later the ridiculous and old fashioned warning to turn off phones and Ipads as landing soon. Hello! It doesn't matter on US or Canadian aircraft why on Caribbean Airlines? To top it off took 60 minutes for bags to arrive in Toronto. I love Caribbean Airlines ad campaign in Georgetown with slogan "Demand Value". Really? As a customer, how about demanding a smile or two? Maybe crew was so miserable as they were missing Carnival?

### "worst experience ever"
New York to Montego Bay. By far the worst experience ever. Yesterday was a day just like any other. I walked in to JFK receiving notification that the terminal was flooded and it is partially closed. I walked up with my daughter 2 years old and my mother in law who was in a wheelchair. The receptionist was very unhelpful and rude with the way she handled us. We got up to the waiting area to board the airplane where you could see chattering between airline workers. We boarded the plane and after 1 hour of waiting we were told that there is a problem with a heater and that they were trying to fix it. And other hour later we were told that we had to board another plane. No apology was made. There were kids on the flight. And not even a drink was offered. No phone call nothing. I went to the desk to ask for a call and none was given and was told a manager would have to approve. I waited and received no response. We departed about 12 something for a flight that should have left at 7:15. We got to Jamaica told to make my mother in law walk to meet the wheelchair as none was waiting for her. Got down to immigration and to the baggage claim where one of my bag was not present. All the representatives were up and about trying to find stuff for people who could not find their luggage. When I finally spoke to someone they told me I would have to come back after signing a missing baggage claim and that I should call the number given or they would call me. Until this time no one has reached out to me. I call the airport and was transferred to the airline representative and was hung up on twice. After that I called back and with told by the front desk of the airport that they would have to call me and tell me what to do. I waited 2 hours after coming off the airline to be told that my bag (car seat) was maybe not here. This is an inconvenience because after having a delayed flight and a hungry child for almost the whole day. Had to let my one handed mother in law hold my child until we got to Kingston. The representatives were not at all helpful had to wait 2 hours to be told that the car seat was maybe left in New York. No reassurance or outline of how I would receive anything. And it’s almost one full day and no response. Not to mention the meal that was provided. Crackers and tea would have been better.

### "Terrible customer service"
Port of Spain to Georgetown. This is by far the worst airline ever dealt with. Up to date no compensation, I was telling myself I wouldn't take the airline ever again but I did because I needed to get to Guyana. They lost the stroller seat which was declared missing on June 27th and up to date, did not find it, would not reimburse me for damaged luggage. I did not receive any compensation for the stroller seat and no responses since October. Terrible customer service.

### "Wonderful service from the ground up"
Toronto to Port of Spain. Wonderful service from the ground up. Check in was fast and efficient at Pearson Airport. Flight was on time. The crew were warm, professional and smiling and  chatting with passengers. The head flight attendant and one of the other FA's I have encountered on previous Caribbean Airlines flights are outstanding representatives of true Trinbagonian charm and friendliness. The Captain and first officer kept us well informed during the smooth and enjoyable flight. The food was tasty although small portions and a fairly wide choice of non alcoholic drinks were readily available on board.

### "major room for improvement"
Quite a mediocre airline with a semi-good landside operation and quite a good airside one. The Good: Counter service is good. Quick and efficient check-in with friendly (enough) agents. Tickets are easy to purchase on-line or at their offices. The aircraft are in good condition. Seats are clean, if basic. Pitch is more than other carriers. Free sealed air-buds. Attendants are accommodating, well trained and efficient. Each seat has a free to take Caribbean Beat magazine, IMHO the best Caribbean publication. The meals and drinks are still complimentary and of high quality for an airline. Safety is paramount. The airline has a good compliment of flight officers and properly maintained aircraft. The Bad: The web-site is very dated. Changes cannot be made leading to: Don't try to contact the airline. Responses to e-mails take well over 5 days, sometimes months. The call centre seems to be bogged down. Seat pitch could be better. I'm 5'11" and it's comfortable until the person in front decides to recline. There is very little entertainment. A complimentary movie on those tiny drop-down screens that even Lifetime won't show and some audio channels The Ugly: It's the only airline apart from AA where one gets "grumpy" FAs. Again, communication is horrible. All in all not the worst but there is major room for improvement, particularly landside operations.

### "wonderful service they provide"
New York JFK to Montego Bay. Caribbean Airlines made arrangements for a wheelchair at the airports going and returning. At JFK, we arrived early and were checked in immediately and they had the wheelchair right as I checked in. Then we were taken to lounge followed by taking us to the gate. We sat in 3c and 3f. Very nice seats. Because of the freezing temps that morning, we had a slight delight because of possible fuel line link but the pilot played it safe. After about an hour we were cleared to leave. As I had previously ordered our meals, we enjoyed a cheese omelet and delicious fish cakes, the best rum punch and best coffee ever. The economy class had the cheese omelet also. The movie shown was Mr. Church, a relatively new movie. Excellent flight with a wheelchair waiting at the gate. Crew was just terrific. Our return flight was on March 18 and again, terrific check in, quick and easy. Wheelchair waiting for me at check in. We sat in the same seats on the returning flight. Dinner was chicken and poached salmon, although they ran out of the key lime pie, we had delicious grilled fruit with a mango salsa, a rum punch, excellent coffee and a Hennessy brandy. Ecomony had sandwiches that night, I believe it was ham and cheese but not sure . The movie shown was Dr. Strange, unfortunately the tv screen wasn't working well, this happens. Crew was good but we got spoiled by the crew on the 11th. Again the wheelchair was waiting for us at the gate and since we have global entry, we were out within 15 minutes. Luggage was out first both in Montego Bay and JFK. We have taken Caribbean Airlines for a number of years and only once had an issue with crew, which was years ago. We chose them because of the wonderful service that they provide and they still give meals whether you are in business or economy. Our recommendation is to arrive at the airports early, less stress and less people.

### "staff was excellent"
My flight from Miami to Port of Spain with Caribbean Airlines was the most comfortable, staff was excellent the attendant was brilliant. With service like that you can never ask more. I can give thumbs up to that staff. Thanks for everything.

### "customer service was terrible"
First flight was an overnight flight from Toronto to Trinidad. No air-conditioning, seats so uncomfortable and they would not turn off any of the lights, so to get any rest was impossible. When we got to Trinidad we were soaked in sweat, cranky and tired. Our flight from Trinidad to Tobago was wonderful, seats were comfortable and we had air. On our way back from Tobago to Trinidad the customer service was terrible, they took no credit for their mistakes, rude and misleading. Everyone around us had the same treatment as we did. Thankfully we had a local person to help us through it otherwise we would have missed all of our flights. Our flight from Trinidad back to Toronto was ok, food was ok. Again, no customer service. We had to place our plates and cups on the floor before anyone would pick up our trash. Thankfully we had some A/C. Even though they were direct flights I think I would take another airline with longer layovers then go with this airline again.

### "very helpful and smiley"
Port of Spain to Tobago with Caribbean Airlines and an excellent service. On time departure flight. It's one of shortest flights but service is good. Value for money. Ground staff are very helpful and smiley. No inflight entertainment or food. It's okay cause it's only 20 mins flight. Overall good service.

### "never make mistake of choosing again "
I travelled from Port of Spain to Toronto on the 29th February with my wife and son of 6 months. Our flight was at 1:35am so we arrived at the airport around 10:25pm only to find a very long line for Economy Class check-in. We later discovered that this was due to the fact that it was the only line for all international economy class passengers. My son already being in a trouble mood because he had long missed his bed time, my wife decided that we would try to check-in at the Priorty/Business Class check-in counter. We went right up to the agent who accepted to check us in but made us rearrange our bags several times to get an exact weight of 23kg even though one of our bags was only over by 800g. Then apparently there was a problem with my wife's name on her passort that didn't match the name they had in their system. I explained to her that on our out-bound flight from Toronto at no time was any mention made of this problem but she insisted that this was the case and that they had to change the name for them to allow on the flight. It took them 45 mins to change the name with us standing at the counter baby in hand. In all 1 hour 30 mins to check-in, a first for me! Once on board the plane things weren't much better. The flight was full and with there only being 6 abreast seating, my wife was stuck between me a another guy with the baby on her lap in a row with not much leg room or seat width. We were not comfortable at all and to make matters worse the heat was turned up to 25° it felt like. When we mentioned it to the flight attendant she simply made some excuse about it being normally hotter in the front of the plane. Never heard of such a thing! Our meal on this 6 hour red-eye flight, consisted of a very small croissant with cheese and pack 4 chocolate biscuits. Pitiful! Inflight entertainment from the 1980's with overhead screens, poor image quality and sound. All in all, a very bad experience that we will never make the mistake of choosing again even if we have take several connecting fights get to Trinidad. Flyer beware!

### "attendants very accommodating"
Trinidad to New York return. Check in was quick with the flight leaving on time. The cabin attendants were very accommodating, food was very tasty. The return trip was also excellent, dinner onboard was excellent. I recommend anyone to try Caribbean Airlines.

### "highly recommend them"
New York JFK to Port of Spain. This was my first flight with Caribbean Airlines and I have to say it was one of the best flight experiences. The staff was courteous and informative, there was a meal which we did not anticipate, and no problems at all. I highly recommend them.

### "not worth flying"
Fort Lauderdale to Montego Bay with Caribbean Airlines. It is not worth flying this airline. We lost a whole day in Jamaica due to delays, and all they gave us was a $15 each voucher for food. We ended up spending $100 in food for the day (airports are expensive), plus gas to drive around and do nothing while we waited for our flight. When you rarely get a vacation, missing a whole day of a week is worth a lot - a hell of a lot more than $15 each. I sent a letter to the airline, and received no response.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
My Caribbean Airlines flight to Kingston was on November 26th at 1am. I got to JFK Airport around 10pm. On the screen, it said my flight was cancelled. I asked one of the staff what was going on, all she said was I had to stand in line and speak with the staff in the counter. Standing in line took about 2 hours. I was already pissed off because they could have informed me beforehand via email or phone that my flight was cancelled instead of me having to rush to the airport and stand in line in the middle of the night. As I understand from other people standing in line, they were trying to book the passengers to different flights that evening as chance passengers. When it was finally my turn, the only flight available that they offered me was at 9am or 1am the following day (Nov 27th), it was 12 midnight already. They didn't offer complimentary room to stay for the night. If I chose the 9am flight, I'll have to sleep in the airport for 9hours until my flight. The staff was very rude. He acted like I was stupid for asking questions. Not a single apology from any of them for the fact that I was inconvenienced. The staff was acting like I was the one inconveniencing him. No reason was given on why the flight was cancelled. The next evening, I was at the airport again at 10pm for my 1am flight (Nov 27th), It was good news for me when I saw that the flight will be leaving on time. When it was my turn in, the lady at the front charged me an extra $25 for my 2nd luggage. I complained because I know I was allowed 2 luggages to check in at 50lbs each. She reviewed their policy and said okay I didn't have to pay anymore. This same lady took a long time checking me in, because she was busy gossiping with fellow staff members. It's such a disappointment seeing unprofessional and rude employees. Long story short, worst airline I have ever experienced.

### "I felt helpless and conned"
Caribbean Airlines from Kingston to Ft Lauderdale. For the first time in my life I felt helpless and conned. I was called at 3:30 in the morning of November 26, 2015 to say my flight was delayed that should be leaving at 6:10 same morning until 12 noon. I sat and waited at the airport. I checked in at 9am started boarding at 11:45 which should be since 11:30. 12 noon no passengers were on the plane as they placed us in an area to sit after they took our boarding passes. About 1/2 hour to 45 mins. when passengers started to ask questions and was irated they sent someone to lie to us - when that wasn't accepted the head of engineer came to tell us they were having a mechanical problem with the engine. I was at the airport since 4:10am, didn't sleep all night, haven't eaten and was being talked to as if I was begging a plane ride. I asked to be rebooked as I was going away for only four days and they kept my bags until there were no flights out. They started boarding sometime after 2pm and the plane was still not fixed as they were awaiting a part to come from New York at 4pm. With all this happening the customer service was poor as it seemed we were being avoided like a plague. I missed thanksgiving dinner with my family and a business meeting. I didn't leave until the Friday morning as I opted not to go again. Then this flight was delayed too and on coming back my flight was delayed for over an hour without explanation. What a joke!

### "no one can give an explanation"
Ft Lauderdale to Montego Bay. Thanksgiving day was a disaster, flight schedule to leave at 9:40am was cancelled. They said delayed 3:45pm, then 4:45, then 5:45, now 6:45. Very frustrating and no one can give an explanation. The workers at the podium said no one is giving them any information so they dont know what is going on. This is unacceptable and not good service. They will be my last resort for travelling if need be.

### "a bait and switch"
We booked our Caribbean Airlines flight because it was the earliest one leaving New York at 6am, and latest leaving Montego Bay at 7pm. A week later we get an email saying our flight there is now scheduled for 7:15 and a day later they send another saying our flight home is now scheduled for 5:30. Talk about a bait and switch. Now we're at the airport and at check in they tell us the flight is delayed and we won't be boarding until 8:30. A great start to the vacation!

### "no entertainment system at all"
We flew Caribbean Airlines from New York JFK to Port of Spain and back. Both flights were delayed by about 1.5 hrs without good reasons. JFK-POS had no entertainment system at all, return flight had some but a lot of control units didn't work at all or sound was awful - six of us were flying plus I tried some other available seats, so I can say with certainty that a lot of units were defective. Food was very mediocre but acceptable, so were the crews. Bottom line: if it is much cheaper than competition, then it is worth it, otherwise - stay away.

### "good value for money"
My wife and I travelled with Caribbean Airlines in August 2015 from Port of Spain to New York JFK Airport. We did not experience any problems with check in (having previously used the web check in service), the flight was on time and the staff were friendly and professional. The flight was on time. The flight experience was mostly comfortable and staff very polite. The complimentary meal was tasty and the entertainment being offered was satisfying even though, with one screen located above for every few seats, one has to strain one's neck and eyes to view it. The seating space was also a bit small and I felt there should have been a few extra inches of space between myself and the seat in front of me. Nevertheless, the flight overall was enjoyable and there were no major issues. I would definitely fly with this airline again as the cost was reasonable and the experience was good value for money.

### "the worst experience I have had"
I have been flying to Jamaica for years and this flight has been the worst experience I have had. My flight from Kingston back to New York was supposed to take off at 7:30p.m on September 02. I checked in around 5p.m and I was told the flight was delayed. I sat in my seat for another two hours only to hear from a vendor in airport that my flight was canceled. It was not announced to us and, I sat there thinking I was going home that night. I went to the information desk and then they finally told me that the flight was canceled and I have a choice of going to a hotel or going back to where I was staying. They didn't have any information about when the next flight would be, or what was the cause for it to be canceled. Around after one the next morning I received a call letting me know that they have a flight at 6:30a.m. I checked in around 5am and once again my flight was delayed. I board the plane after 7am and my plane did not take off till 9am that morning. My overall experience with Caribbean Airlines was a disgrace. This is not an experience that I would like to deal with again.

### "service was polite and understated"
Before boarding the plane we arrived at Port of Spain airport early from our transfers and we were delighted to be allowed to check in early, breeze through security and spend a few hours in the delightful Caribbean Airlines lounge - nice and relaxed in there and pretty good selection of food available. Strangely though while spirits were readily available wine and beer were on request which I found a little odd. Boarding was a free for all with passengers ignoring the boarding staff completely much to the annoyance of the gate staff. Upon boarding the plane was amazed to be on a wide bodied 767 which I didn't know flew this route. We were in 2J and 2K and having experienced a slightly cramped 737 flight on the outward leg were delighted with the idea of flat beds and tons of leg room. The flight departed on time and the jovial captain detailed our route. About 20 minutes into service drinks and nuts were served including a perfectly chilled Moët and Chandon before dinner service We had preselected our meals, and our thoughts that Carribean serve some of the best inflight meals we have ever tasted were confirmed with a superbly spicy Thai Green Chicken Curry for me, and a equally nice Thai Green Tofu Curry for my partner which were served after salads and bread. Salmon and a Beef Pepperpot were also available. Impressive meals that were this months signature dishes, Sadly my seat didn't work much so had little chance to enjoy the flat bed, however my partners worked fine. Inflight entertainment was equally limited to 5 channels which did work in some seats and didn't work in others which was disappointing. However the legroom and comfort was far superior obviously to the outward journey. Service was polite and understated which I liked, from a pleasant crew, and we landed on time in JFK. Pleasantly surprised with our Carribean Airlines experience and will definitely use them again on these routes.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
The lounge at JFK Terminal 4 is well appointed and nicely laid out with a decent selection of drinks and food. Boarding was punctual, we were seated in 1A and 1C. A soft drink was offered before takeoff. Seats were leather and old style first class with adequate leg room. Shortly after takeoff we were offered drinks - Moët and Chandon champagne and nuts. Caribbean Airlines now offer you the chance to preorder your meal and I had chosen a Tiger Prawn Masala with a Vegetarian Biryani for my partner. Without a doubt these were two of the best airline meals we have tasted. Drinks were topped up throughout the flight by crew who were delightful - chatty, pleasant and a pleasant change from the norm. Our Saturday night flight landed 30 minutes early and we left relaxed and pleased with our choice

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Took this flight (BW 474) to Orlando international airport on the 11th June 2015, check in was very quick and efficient, so to was the boarding procedure. The flight departed on-time (9.10am), service on the flight was excellent with the in-flight meal extremely tasty. We were served sausages with an omelette. The layover in Kingston, Jamacia was interesting with beautiful views of the ocean (there was a non stop flight to Orlando the next day but I needed to arrive one day early so I had to make a stop). Once again we were on our way to Orlando, this time there was only a beverage service due to the short flight, we arrived in Orlando on-time 3.15pm. On the return leg (BW 485) back to Trinidad and Tobago (POS) on the 22nd June 2015, check in and the boarding process was once again quick and efficient, this time I came back on a non-stop flight, the flight departed on time 3.15pm. The meal was once again delicious with lasagne being offered. The flight arrived 20 minutes before time! 7.00pm as has been all my flights with this airline. This trip in itself was a vacation, would recommend anyone to give them a try.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Packed lines for check in. We were sent through checkpoints and to a gate number. Then told to go to another one for some reason or another. So we had to pick up our stuff and walk to the other gate. We waited for the plane past the boarding time only to be told the plane had not arrived. This was 12.55 and the plane was schedule to leave at 1.45, needless to say it would be a delayed flight. When It was my turn to board they said I had to put my carry-on luggage in the hold because they had no more space. The flight was crowded and disorganized. The flight attendant used her hands to scoop up ice to give to my daughter. I will never travel this airlines again. The whole trip was just a mess.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Flew from Trinidad to St. Lucia and back in two days. Service friendly and on time. Bags came ok. Cabin Staff friendly and helpful but no on board catering. Very new and comfy ATR-72-600 and overall good service!

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Flew from Barbados to Kingston last week. All in all it was a fine trip. Web check-in was efficient and baggage drop-off was smooth. Flight was perfectly on time the 737-800 cabin was in good condition and clean legroom was surprising good considering I measure 189 cm. Only slight complaint was although an announcement was made regarding in-flight entertainment and headsets were given out nothing was ever shown. Additionally it was announced that two options were available for the meal one being vegetarian. Once my row was reached there were no more vegetarian meals. The flight attendant was apologetic. Otherwise a rather "normal" flight!

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
I flew from Trinidad to Fort Lauderdale return in November 2014 in Business Class. The flight left on time and the return was also on time with a little hiccup in Fort Lauderdale airport (shared terminal means that boarding of the aircraft could be interrupted for an incoming aircraft disembarking passengers). The food on board was fantastic I had a lovely steak meal and cod meal for both going and returning. The Moet never stopped for the entire flight and the flight attendants were very attentive and polite. Would recommend Caribbean Airlines Business Class.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Took this flight from POS to JFK via GND on 24th December 2014 BW420 flight departed on time and arrived early to GND 15 minutes early with a departure from GND another 15 minutes early. We arrived at JFK half an hour before schedule! The food was excellent along with the professional service from the flight attendants made this an excellent flight which I would recommend to anyone planning to travel in the future.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Travelled from LGW to POS return over Dec-Jan 2014/5. It was my first time travelling with Caribbean and it was recommended due to the non-stop service from the UK. The aircraft used is functional but a bit dated but the seat pitch was good and both flights were comfortable. The food provided was good and the cabin crew were pleasant both ways. Although there are seat back screens the IFE cannot compete with either BA or Virgin and there is no route map to give you an idea of where you are or when you will arrive. I know this is not essential but I suppose passengers may expect it. Overall a good service which is a valid option if you want to cut down travelling time on the route.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Flew on this airline on the 16th August 2014 POS-TAB and TAB-POS. At check-in counter at Piarco their main operational hub check-in was 2 hours before flight. I got there 1.5 hours before flight and no one from CAL was at counter so there were long lines of irate passengers. Flight crew very cold and unfriendly. Return flight even though it was touted as new ATR aircraft's was not cleaned and maintained inside and the air conditioning wasn't working.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
BW 903 on 09/07/2014 From London Gatwick to Trinidad. I usually have a good experience when flying with Caribbean Airlines. However the BW903 had a couple of unprofessional flight attendants. They were rude had no sympathy for passengers with children. This together with a generally poor service made it a difficult flight!

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
POS-JFK in economy. Flight went right on time and the crew members were professional. The meal wasn't very impressive but it was definitely nice to have free food on this route. I would fly them again.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
I've been travelling with CAL for years and I've had little to no complaints. Check-in was always fast customer service is pretty good and the food is good and the majority of flights are very smooth. My only discomfort was sort of my fault - when I checked in late and I got a seat with the emergency exit directly behind me - those seats can't recline and I was a bit uncomfortable while trying to sleep on a 2-hour flight. I don't pay much attention to in-flight entertainment during flights less than 5 hours but I'd say it can be a hit and miss which depends on what movies they show. They choose the movies not you. I wish they had bigger screens or those right in front of me though. Apart from that I'll recommend them.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Great professional staff internal decor good but almost 50% of the TV sets didn't work! A very long and boring 9 hour flight from POS-LGW.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
POS-GEO on 3/28/14 - Quick 50 minute flight from Port of Spain to Georgetown. Check in ladies very friendly and fun. Boarding area not much to do - one food shop near the gates. Plane came from Miami and was a branded Air Jamaica plane (737). Flight attendants well dressed and friendly. Boarding was quick and plane was about 70% full. Quick take off and serviced a snack and drink. Landing in Georgetown was smooth and bags were delivered quickly. Overall a nice flight.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Flights from London to Port of Spain and return. The plane on both flights was an old Boeing 767 a very noisy machine probably purchased second hand with lots of malfunctioning items. For example in both flights the in- flight entertainment system was broken and entire rows could not either listen or watch the movies or both. Seats very dirty and one toilet ran out of water. Whilst on the flight from LGW to POS the cabin crew were professional and kind most of the return staff were rude cold and not professional. Food was in both flights below any good standard quality the breakfast was the worst ever. In Port of Spain thanks to the mistakes of the check in our small group who specifically asked to stay together and was reassured on that was scattered all over the plane.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Non stop from LGW to POS on one of the ex LAN 767s. The flight was full but check in and then the boarding process felt orderly. Service onboard was friendly and efficient. There were PTVs but I spent most of the flight reading. The food was great much nicer than BA. The captain kept us updated throughout. Overall I enjoyed it and particularly appreciated that it was a proper non stop flight. Having been a regular user of the old BW Tristar service from LHR this felt like like a return to form for CAL. Hope they keep it up.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
We left Barbados at 7.15am this morning 18/12/2013 flight 30 mins late no explanation. Arrived in Trinidad. Awful service on the ground after the cancellation at the very last minute of our flight BW 526 from Trinidad to Guyana. No apologies just that the plane had mechanical problems which had just been discovered even though the plane had come in yesterday. Told that we were going to be taken by bus to a hotel in Port of Spain and that if we were lucky nothing certain we would have a flight at 10 pm this flight is now showing as departure 12.35am. We refused the transport offer and after a long argument have been very ungraciously put on a flight at 8.35pm. A flight was showing as departing at 4.35 but we were told that we could not get on it as it was a fuel stop even though it has been showing on the departure board since our arrival at 8.15 this morning. We watched passengers get off crew change and still we were refused seats. No exception could be made even in circumstances caused by the airline. This is a two and a half day trip for us and CA through their own incompetence and complete lack of customer service have taken half and made it an unpleasant trying and tedious experience. There was no consistency in the story being told and most of all no apologies. Fingers crossed that our flight BW483 will be maintained at 8.35 this evening 18/12/2013.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Travelled Port of Spain to New York JFK on 1st October 2013 Economy class and returned on 7th October 2013 on Business Class. I have travelled with them before but they seem to have improved. Flights were on time both ways. Food and drinks were complementary and was reasonable for the class each time for this 5 hour flight. On the outbound which was economy class it was a sandwich and a pack of biscuits and on the way back which was a breakfast service it was blueberry pancakes and turkey sausages (which was my selection from a menu from three choices). FAs were courteous and helpful in both classes of service.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Business class July 8th from JFK to Port of Spain. The seats were dirty with crumbs all over. When it came time for the meals no hot towels and the food was horrible and cold like some of the flight attendants. The entertainment was the worst the quality of the picture may as well have been in black and white.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Had to connect via Trinidad to a flight to Toronto. Flight delayed and they did not even have the courtesy to make an announcement that the flight was delayed - when a passenger goes up to ask the status of the flight she gets told "It leaves when it leaves"! These flight attendants need a major attitude adjustment.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
18th June 2013 BW902 POS-LGW. 1st July 2013 BW903 LGW-POS. Check in at POS was fast. Flight was scheduled to depart 7.40pm but boarding began at 7.30pm. Departed 45 minutes late. Once airborne food was nice and multiple drink runs. Personal screens for InFlight Entertainment were not working. Nice 767 with comfy seats. However the return was a nightmare. Scheduled to depart London at 12.50pm on 30th June BW 903. Got to the airport on the 30th June at 10am to be told by another passenger that the flight was cancelled. A long line with frustrated passengers for 2 hours as no information from Caribbean Airlines. After 3 hours I was told that it was due to the A/C not working and they will be putting us up in a hotel overnight and was booked for a 4.50am departure the next day (1st July). At the hotel told that the flight was delayed until 9.50am and to head back to the check in counter at 7am. Finally got to the gate and we boarded on time. Did not leave on time left 3 hours later. Flight attendants were less than helpful and sour. Flight was wonderful with fair IFE and a hot meal and 3 drink runs. Afternoon tea as well. Arrived after 5pm on 1st July.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
LGW-POS 2 June 2013 BW903 Economy B767. Check in at LGW North Terminal was effortless having checked-in online. Had the added benefit of "Priority Access" as a "Club Caribbean" member as well as an invitation to the "No.1 Lounge". Lounge situated at the far end of the Duty Free shops and relatively near to the CAL gate. Lounge greeting pleasant and the facility seems adequate. There will be no announcements which we were told at check in and so you need to be aware of the time. Crew were warm and welcoming as you entered the aircraft. Seating configuration is 2-3-2 and I would suggest any aisle seat in the middle 3 section. 2 toilets between row 15 and 19 and also at the rear of the aircraft. Crew were warm and friendly. Within the first 2 hours a hot lunch was served followed by a beverage service and a coffee and tea service. Later in the flight they passed around with some bottles of water and 2 hours prior to landing tea was served. Evident that IFE is from an older framework and the films play on a loop. TV's at every seat with a remote control. Heard many passengers complaining in both in both directions that TVs did not work at their seat. There is power at the seat near the floor and I was able to watch my own media. Flight left on time was smooth and arrived on time. Overall pleasant experience. Looking forward to this service in the future.

Business/First from JFK-POS POS POS-GEO-JFK. Their lounges are basic. Flight left on time. Their 737-800 business class is pretty standard. Leg room in Business is just alright but considering the size of the plane acceptable. Food and service was good as usual FA's are personable and professional. It has always been my experience that CA tends to run out of popular dishes very quickly kind of sad when business class is not that big. Return flight on their brand new 767-300er departed 90 minutes late the reason why is still a mystery to me. On board nice roomy plane no complaints on leg room here. The seats were nice enough they did lay flat however they did seem to go for very basic business class e.g. inflight entertainment was there but not usable and power at seat didn't work. I ran into a really big issue with my seat tray - during food service it completely fell apart and separated from the swing arm and could not be reattached. It was a very full flight but fortunately there was one empty seat the FA's quickly made accommodations for me. Overall I would say it was sufficient.

Flew Business Class from YYZ to POS. Flight left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Inflight service was okay - nothing out of the ordinary.

Flight from Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale was pretty routine. Flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said about our return trip. Check-in staff were barely civil and one woman in particular gives new meaning to the word 'rude'. Their fees for overweight and/or extra bag is outrageous. Onboard the cabin staff were friendly and helpful but we couldn't get extra creamer for our hot beverages. The attendant came with evaporated milk and proceeded to add it to my friend's coffee resulting in her having to get another one and another package of creamer and sugar. The little TV was loud and there was no way to block it out. The only blessing here is that the flight is short so escape wasn't too long in coming. They will not be getting my money again.

Round trip from JFK-KIN on 02/10/13 - 2/18/13. Customer service in New York was very poor on boarding. Flight Co-ordinator was rude - instead of explaining to passengers that the flight was fully booked and all the carry-on luggage would not fit they were just taking people's bags and giving reasons that did not make sense. Coming from Jamaica you were normally allowed to take a box of rum with your carry-on on the plane I was stopped and told that was considered 2 pieces of luggage. My suitcase was taken tagged and put under the plane. I will never travel this airline again.

Port of Spain to London Gatwick. Customer service onboard and the warm hospitality of the flight attendants make this superior service. In addition to the edible onboard food (unlike BA) and the fact that the their plane does not make a one hour pit-stop in Barbados makes this airline the choice of selective passengers like myself.

Toronto (YYZ) - Trinidad (POS) - Guyana (GEO) - Caribbean Airlines: Flight was quite "old school". No individual TV's had to stare at a TV from an angle. Once the movie was done you had to go to sleep because there was nothing else to do. Crew we're quite nice but didn't walk down the aisle frequently. Usually only when someone pressed the Attendant Button. Food was okay. Return flight was the same.

POS-TAB. Very quick shuttle flight between Trinidad and Tobago. Check in immediate in POS and passed through into separate 'domestic' departure area for the shuttle. Went through to find absolutely nothing other than seats so were allowed back through to get drinks etc. Boarded on time polite and professional crew. Brand new turboprop with comfy leather seats and very generous legroom. Such a short hop so no drinks etc. Bags for the 20 or so passengers did seems to take an age to come from the aircraft but other than that excellent and cheap.

POS-MIA MCO-KIN-POS. Online check-in for POS-MIA segment. Agents at counter in POS were average but check-in fast. Onboard snack was okay only one pass for the drink service. Flight was a bit late and lines at passport control in MIA were long. On my return from Orlando even though we had pre-booked seats we were told we would be sitting apart and we would have had to pay for seats together. A/C on the aircraft was not working. No meal service on this segment just a drink and a biscuit. KIN-POS leg had the same problems no A/C and engine problems. Mediocre service on this leg. Arrival into POS was 40 mins behind schedule. Overall the service was below what I am accustomed to at AA however if your expectations are very low then this can be your choice of airline.

CCS-POS-PAR-POS-TBO-POS-GEO-POS mix of twinprops and 737-800s. Every flight departed on time and arrived early. Tidy planes with good legroom in Y. No food service and drinks service policy similar to US airlines (alcohol not free). Friendly crews efficient ground staff and a nice base airport at POS.

POS-MIA. Everything was smooth from check-in to boarding but the flight left 1hr late due to connecting pax. Flight Attendants were friendly and the coconut bake and fish was lovely. Luggage allowance was good and crew informative.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Agents at the ticket counter are rude. From FFL-KIN they were delayed for 1 hr and didn't bother to announce it. Upon return they were overbooked and were asking everyone if they wanted to reschedule. The return flight was no better another delay without announcement.

Philadelphia to Montego Bay Jamaica. Crew was friendly seats spacious. Hot inflight meals and beverage service great flights were on time. Great baggage allowances (allow you to check 2 bags total of 50 lbs free of charge plus allow you to take on one carry-on not exceeding 22 lbs). Wait time for baggage at airports were minimal. No inflight entertainment but not a problem.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
It was the Holiday week and tickets were very expensive. Not to mention the impending snow storm. We arrived at the airport 6am to find out flights were delayed for 2 hrs. At 8am flights were still delayed as well as dealing with long lines. Caribbean airlines were making no announcements as to where we should head. I was travelling with my 6 month old son and husband. Needless to say everyone was frustrated. After waiting until 1pm to get on the flight we were then kicked off because the flight was over booked. Very disorganized. We were then let on the same flight because of no shows. We arrived into Trinidad at 4pm with no formula for the baby as well as no luggage.

Port of Spain - New York return. Check-in at POS nice. Flight was on time and B737 was clean however a bit cramped. Friendly crew. Snack was a banana nut muffin which was quite a disappointment. Return staff at JFK were quite unfriendly. However the flight was nice and hot sandwich and cold drinks. Nice movie and friendly crew in a clean but cramped plane.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
POS-TAB-POS disappointed with the service aircraft is ok but crew seem to be on a rush and wanting to get out of the plane as soon as possible. Delays are the norm and no excuses - it's cheap though but service nonexistent on short flights Will fly them again as a last option or if they come up with very good price they say they want to be back in the european market - good luck for them.

Economy class JFK-GEO return. Outbound on the overnight flight the service was quite warm yet basic compared to airlines such as United or BA - the B737-800 quite cramped for a six hour flight meal service poor drink service quite generous. The 90 minute layover at Port of Spain was quite off putting. Return flight was annoying as the stopover in Port of Spain was changed to a change of air craft. All in all for a six hour flight inflight entertainment extremely dated to a shared screen no choice of film meals poor and constant Caribbean Airlines footage of routes etc a larger wide bodied aircraft would be better on this route. I'd use this airline as a last resort and would seek an alternative.

Toronto to Trinidad return. Inflight food is provided free and of excellent quality. Flights on-time. The decor of the planes appears dated to somewhere in the mid-1980's No seatback screens or powerjacks in Business or Economy.

JFK-POS-GEO return. Service good but stopover in Piarco was not we were asked to remain on the aircraft while it was cleaned and prepped for the ongoing flight.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
BGI-KIN-BGI web checkin disabled. Airport checkin efficient. Planes clean comfortable for short haul. BGI-KIN food and beverage run staff efficient and friendly; food decent for short haul. Return flight had stop at Antigua - exit row so plenty of room. Food and beverage from KIN to Antigua - impressive for 1:55 flight. Antigua to BGI less than hour so no run however staff present in cabin and providing beverages to passengers who asked.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
JFK-POS-GEO return. Cabin was okay staff unfriendly and no entertainment. Not allowed to exit Piarco despite a 6 hour wait and they changed the gate number 10 mins before departure time meaning everyone had to go through security check again.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
Port-Of-Spain - Miami return. Service at Piarco atrocious and sloppy. In the early morning people should be vibrant and happy not sloppy and rude which was the case. Flight attendants nice and hot meals on both legs. IFE started with Caribbean essence with no audio then all screens went blank for the rest of the trip. No one even bothered to explain the technical difficulty. On return meal was mashed potatoes and BBQ chicken - with the amount of gravy in the meal it turned out to be a soup. IFE audio and video were not working properly so it was difficult to understand the movie. Again no explanation to even apologize for the inconvenience. Clean planes with comfortable seating. I am only using this airline because American Airlines is no better!

Travelled to Fort Lauderdale from Port of Spain. A full flight but wonderful crew. The aircraft was clean and seats comfortable with a seat pitch of 32 inches. I received a snack and drinks which were tasty. On my return I departed Miami - served a hot meal and again the aircraft was clean.

POS-BGI-POS on a 737. Long line at POS check in though this is normal at 8am in the morning. I opted for web check in from home and that worked well. The return check in was very quick. In-flight service on both short flights was very professional and warm. No complaints

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
YYZ-POS. Check in was smooth. Wish I had done web check in because the line up was rather long as it was a full flight. The aircraft was operated by Transavia but with full Caribbean Airlines service. We left the gate on time but due to the weather the aircraft needed to be de iced. Dinner was very tasty and service was very warm and professional. We managed to arrive early into Port of Spain to cap off a very enjoyable flight.

Port-of-Spain to Bridgetown. Peleasant experience. After a terrible experience with LIAT this airline was a breath of fresh air. Modern aircraft with reasonably comfortable seating and efficient procedures all round.

### Caribbean Airlines customer review
BGI to KIN. Flight had started in POS and arrived in BGI 10 mins late. There was some confusion as to seat assignments on boarding as people from POS had moved. But the two very pleasant crew members at the rear of the cabin that met us at the door were on hand to make sure everyone was in the seats that had been assigned. Because of the routing of the aircraft you do get the feel that it is a glorified bus service with nothing being served between BGI and SXM. However although the crew passed through with no service as such they were happy to get you canned drinks tea coffee and other such items. We landed in SXM (stunning views and landing) and had about 50 mins on the ground to pick up passengers before we continued on to KIN. We took off on the 2 hour 15 min flight and a full meal service was conducted with a choice of 2 entrees. Alcohol is available for a charge of $5 but all other drinks are free. The only down side is the very frustrating drop down screens that play the company promo video over the loud speaker. You really cant get away from it unless you have your head sets ready to play some music to drown it out. But be aware they only let you check in one item of baggage for the hold. even if you have a really big bag they let you take it in the cabin as there is as charge of around $25 US to check in a second bag.

My wife and I have just returned from our trip POS-MIA-POS It was a most enjoyable and pleasant one. The flight attendants were courteous and caring. They went the extra mile to make everyone comfortable. Thank you for making us want to travel again with Caribbean Airlines.
