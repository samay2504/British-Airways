### "delayed for 26 hours"
On our way to Iceland, our flight was 12 hours delayed, with the 6 hours advance notice. However, our flight back we received a notice 3 hours before our departure that the flight is delayed for 26 hours. No other option flights, no help.

### "never, ever use Play"
Unbelievable airline. I was stranded in Iceland for 3 days. I submitted my claim for costs on the 1/06/2024. It is now 04/09/2024 and I have received absolutely nothing from the claims team. Not one reply directly from them. Contacting anyone else from Play, even the complaints team, is fruitless as they just refer to the fact they are not the claims team. No update is given. I also had submitted a subject access request under GDPR on the 31/07/2024. Legally, they have to respond within one month. Have they? Nope. This is in direct contradiction to GDPR law. I am at a complete impasse and am down over £500+, also down the time I was stranded in Iceland. I will never, ever use Play and would not recommend them.

### "refused any compensation"
The flying experience with PLAY is as good as you would expect from a low-cost airline, no more, no less. There is one little nuance though, as their commercial model is based on being a hub between North America and Europe, they would rather wait for a connecting flight than stick to the schedule. Our flight was delayed for 2 hours at Keflavik waiting for passengers from the USA. Of course we missed our connection train in Paris CDG and as it was less than 3 hours, PLAY refused any compensation. Check the records and you will see that this is not so uncommon.

### "no effort to make things right"
I added a carry on and paid for that. Then it still said it had not been paid even though I had the invoice for it. It took a day and a half to start many conversations until I finally got connected to an Icelandic agent who understood what happened. Then at the airport they tried to charge me 18 thousand isk for the stroller even though it had been no problem on the way there. They ended up making me split it up into parts and were very rude about it. Then on the plane my toddlers seat had broken and kept sliding onto the floor making the seat completly unsafe. The airline declines the seat was unsafe and makes no effort to make things right.

### “a very nice experience”
It was my first time flying with PLAY, and I have no complaints whatsoever. I booked a roundtrip flight from Hamilton, CA, to Berlin, Germany, for $770 (US), PLAY Flex with seat choice in the front of the plane, and one 23 kilo piece of checked luggage included. What more can you ask for at this price!! The crews were friendly, the seats have plenty of leg room, the plane was clean. There are no screens, free movies etc., and you have to pay for drinks, i.e. 3 Euros for a cup of coffee, that's less than at the airport. I was happy to pay for my coffee, and to read a book instead of watching a movie, because I saved about $1200, compared to a flight on a US airline out of Buffalo, NY, where I live! To all those writing bad reviews regarding carry-on luggage: I've seen people carrying large duffle bags onto the plane, or a rather large suitcase, a backpack, AND a stuffed shopping bag type of bag, and the crews were very helpful finding room for those bags in the cabin! What are these people complaining about? My personal opinion: Pay a little more when making your reservation, check your luggage, and quit complaining. I don't understand the "I have to take my entire household into the cabin" mentality at all... And remember, if there are issues at the airport with carry-on luggage, or a long wait for your checked luggage, it's not on the airline, it's on the airport employees. And that is the only complaint I have, the check in people at BER are very unfriendly! But those are Swissport employees, not PLAY employees! Thank you, PLAY, for a very nice experience!

### “customer service is terrible”
Sometime ago, I booked a flight to Iceland at the end of this month. A week ago I broke my knee and the duration of recovery extends past my proposed trip. While I neglected to purchase the trip insurance originally, I shared a doctors note restricting my travel during recovery, a detailed explanation of events, and a simple request to this airline to change my flight without the associated fees that will amount to over $400 US. I complained to their customer service dept, their CRO department, and have only gotten the same response - that I should have gotten trip insurance and they will not offer a trip change without the fees associated with a change. I feel as though this is any undue hardship upon me especially considering my documented injury. I will never fly with PLAY again, and hold them in low esteem. Their customer service is terrible and I do not recommend them.

### "offers little to no discount"
Consumer beware! Icelandic Airline “PLAY” really ought to be called “PAY” airlines, with the missing “L” standing for “LIES.” The strategy behind this company’s low fares is to upcharge on everything possible. Couples buying tickets together will be placed at opposite ends of the plane and then charged over $100US to change seats to sit together. In terms of luggage, only a carryon backpack to be kept under the seat is free; a carry-on bag is between $80-130 and checked bags are up to $190/piece. Everything onboard during the flight is also upcharged—even water. There's no wifi, video screens, radio channels, blankets or pillows. On the airline’s website, the measurements of permissible carry-on luggage is inaccurate, likely to force customers to check more luggage. Contrary to the website, rollerboards that are 9.5”X13”X23” fit in PLAY’s Airbus A320 overhead bins perfectly well. Once all the upcharges are taken into account, “PLAY” airlines offers little to no discount from “basic economy” on major international carriers.

### "wrongly denied boarding"
After having completed the first leg of my flight from Boston to Reykjavik, I was wrongly denied boarding on my onward flight to Berlin. I was pulled out of the regular waiting line to have the dimensions of my carry-on luggage checked. The person checking the lines before the check-in station told me to put it into a special box for checking the dimensions of pieces of luggage. This had been the third time in a row that Play intercepted me and other passengers in Reykjavik en route to their final destinations to check the dimensions of my luggage. On the previous two occasions, I had passed this test without problems with the same carry-on roller that I had used on all my flights for several years. However, this time Play had apparently changed the box for luggage measurements, as one of the people at check-in confirmed. Another lady who checked in passengers at the check-in station demanded immediate payment of 80 Euros. I noted that other passengers were also distressed, and one fellow passenger left her little suitcase roller behind, leaving the airport employees from security and at check-in in a state of disarray as they did not know what to do with the pieces of luggage that people had left behind because they were unable or unwilling to pay. The situation was chaotic and felt unsafe. I pointed out to the lady at the check-in station that the same piece of luggage had passed inspection by Play Airlines twice before and that this must be some kind of mistake. She refused to hear my argument and insisted on immediate payment with credit card. I told her that I wanted to talk to her supervisor. She told me she was the supervisor. I then told her that I wanted to complain about her decision to Play Airlines and wanted to write down her name. She turned around her ID tag so that I could not see or record her name. She claimed I had been rude to her. I offered to pay the 80 Euros to let me board the airplane and I would follow up with Play Airlines later. However, she denied me boarding despite my repeated assurances that I was willing to pay the 80 Euros in front of security personnel, who were also present at the counter. While boarding was ongoing, I contacted Airport Police around 5:50 am, who said that this incident was outside of their authority since it was a private contract between me and the airline. I then was able to locate another Play representative at the service desk in the same terminal (I think it was D). She told me to write a WhatsApp message to Play Airlines. I wrote the message but received no timely response. Since I had urgent business to do in Germany, and since there were no other Play Airlines flights going out to Berlin, I booked a flight with Iceland Air and was able to continue with my journey with a delay of 11⁄2 hours but was forced to pay for the ticket. Play Airlines did not reply to me until a few hours later by WhatsApp (see WhatsApp protocol) and refused to reimburse me for the ticket. They claimed that complaining to the airline constitutes rude behavior and therefore the lady was within her rights to deny my boarding. Beware of ground personnel and complaints. Inexperienced staff, random selection of people from the lines at check- in who are squeezed for $.Possibly profiling passengers based on accent and nationality and take out their frustrations. Low-cost airline - good start but getting greedy and quality deteriorating.

### “crew was eager to help”
Boarded by bus on an distant location, A320N on a very good condition, crew was young people friendly and eager to help passengers to place carry-ons to the bins. Legroom was tight, I was lucky my next seat was left empty and the flight was barer able. We departed on time. 20 min after departure they served coffee (no free) and 3 hours within the flight, they served lunch from Buy on board Menu. Flight was 95% full and almost all passengers transferring to North American destinations.

### "demanded us to pay 80 Euros"
Flight OG700 from Keflavik (Iceland) to Berlin (Germany). When boarding, (a group consisting of 6, thereof several minors) the service desk person (attendant) asked us to show our boarding cards. This turned out to be tedious because we had more than one booking reference. And because we had done the check-in procedure online, we had the boarding cards in our email (not printed). The attendant ordered us to get off the queue and to gather together as a group. She then requested my wife to check whether her personal item would fit in the corresponding metal frame. Though I had measured this cabin suitcase at home (thought it would fit), the wheels would not fit by less than 1 cm. She demanded us to pay 80 Euros at the boarding gate, otherwise she would refuse us to board the plane. I think that this behaviour speaks for itself. 1. We had obviously not intention to betray the flight company (since actually the body of the case would have fit) 2. The percentage of the violation of the flyplay regulation does not correspond to the amount demanded. 3. Obviously it was the personal decision of the attendant to ask for this amount, therefore the decision came from her arbitrary mood at this point of time. I will remember this incident as an arbitrary abuse of "power by authority" and the absence of tolerance. My guess is that I will rather book our next flights with Icelandair instead. Cabin staff were very friendly, but this could not make up for the enlightening occurance which we had at the gate.

### "Will fly them again"
flight with snacks and coffee. Check in easy. Communication very good on flight. Seats recline and are okay. Toilets were kept clean. Will fly them again.

### “shouldn't be called customer support”
Not Verified |  I flew with them in Dec 2023, I was stuck in Reykjavík because I missed my connecting flight to Washington. They sent me an email saying I  can book stay and rescheduled me on a flight next day. Long story short they were supposed to refund me the money, now the interesting part is their customer service team responds to me (I have 5 emails) saying they cannot contact their own claims team and that they cannot help me. The best part is when you force them to respond they keep coming up with terms like "Several weeks", then when you stress further they start responding "8 weeks" then they start telling you from which point they count "8 weeks" and the clock to 8 weeks is reset every time your claim is shifted to a new department. To be honest now I have started enjoying this, you should try them, haven't had such mind boggling replies from any customer support team ever. They keep responding whatever they want, it shouldn't even be called customer support.

### “All flights on time and problem-free”
This is a fairly new airline from Iceland. It's a low-cost model meaning that you pay for everything, either in a bundle, or separately. They have no in-flight entertainment so bring your own. Some planes don't have phone/device chargers. What they do have is a friendly crew and comfortable seats. I've used them twice now, once in 2023 and again in 2024. All flights were on time and problem-free. Some reviewers slam them for the low-cost model but if you understand what you're getting and plan ahead, this is a great airline that will get you where they fly at a significantly lower cost than other airlines. On the segment from KEF to BWI we were in the front third of seats that had extra leg room and a table strapped into the middle seat to make it unusable and allow for the aisle and window passenger to have extra room. I hadn't expected that but it was a nice surprise. Some planes have phone chargers and so don't so be prepared.

### “we are still waiting for our refund”
In December 2023 we booked a return flight for the whole family from Germany to Iceland for our planned family vacation in August 2024. On March 3rd we were informed that all our flights were canceled. So we could choose between “an alternative flight” or “full refund”. However, since no alternative flight was available, we opted for a “refund”. PLAY promised a refund within 3-5 business days. Now 10 days later we are still waiting for our refund. Conclusion: This airline does not work and is not reliable. They are neither able to fly a plane nor able to issue the refund with an acceptable delay. I strongly advise against using this airline.

### "very happy with their service"
I made a trip from Boston to London Stansted with a short layover at their hub in Keflavik, Iceland. I was very happy with their service and everything went well. For my round trip, I took a total of four flights with them: two in each direction, connecting in Keflavik. Every flight took off close to on-time and landed on-time or early. The crew seems organized, efficient, pleasant and friendly. I was worried my luggage would be mislaid in Keflavik, but it connected with me in both directions and arrived safe and sound, as did I. There is no in-flight entertainment provided. You need to bring your own entertainment. Food is available for a modest cost on the plane, but in my opinion, the food was not very appealing and not very healthy. I recommend bringing food and water with you if you don't like junk food. My planes between London and Iceland both had USB ports that would allow you to charge a device. The planes between Iceland and Boston did not. I was glad that I brought my external backup battery. The airline does charge for both checked and carry-on luggage, but I didn't find the charges excessive. If you pay for a carry-on, you get priority boarding. At one point before my trip, I had some questions for the airline. They do not offer customer service by phone. However, they do offer it via WhatsApp chat. The chat agent was immediately responsive and helpful. He or she was clearly a live human being, not a bot or AI. The communication was at least as satisfying to me as any phone conversation with an airline rep. Bottom line: PLAY offers cheap and efficient no-frills service across the Atlantic. If you just want transportation to your destination, they offer a cost-effective service. If you want extra attention, tasty food, and other frills, you may be disappointed. I don't need those things and was very satisfied.

### “no customer service”
Flying with Play was an absolute disaster. Had a flight on 22nd Dec from BWI scheduled to arrive in FRA on 23rd at noon (via KEF). Flight from BWI was somewhat delayed, but made it just at “Last Call” to my connecting flight. Play, however, denied boading and unilaterally rebooked all passengers with that connection to 24th December. There was no customer service, no one informed us about accommodation. Just an email asking you to look for accommodation yourself and they will reimburse up to 150 euros. Flight on the 24th was delayed by 3 hours of course. Also my reserved and paid seat in front was gone and they didn’t even think about apologizing whatsoever. Now the worst part: I handed in all receipts in early January, but Play is - contrary to their email - refusing to reimburse me for the costs for the hotel, taxi and food, because I also filed a claim for compensation a third party (which has been denied anyways). These are two different things under EU law, but I have the feeling they don’t even read the emails you send to customer service. Play’s customer service is horrendous and non-existent at KEF airport.

### "the stress, they don't care"
I purchased a seat online, then they changed the airplane, so they transferred me to a seat occupied by others. So I have no choice but to seat somewhere and I am asking for a refund but they have this rules. The hassle, the stress, they don't care. Wont be flying with this horrible airline. Imagine paying 800 dollars for a no entertainment, delayed, no food airline.

### “Crew were friendly and professional”
I booked same day to travel for a family emergency and was a bit nervous of any delay/cancellations. All four flights were fantastic. All left on time and arrived on time. Crew were friendly and professional on all four flights. Buy on board food was reasonably priced considering you are trapped and it's actually cheaper than the food at KEF on the connection (aside from the hot dog stand I always visit). I had the ham and cheese which was cooked to perfection and an Appelsin drink. I pre-booked the extra legroom seats and had tonnes of room. There was a USB port, the seat reclined and I was very comfortable. The only glitch I had was on KEF-YHM where my extra legroom seat wasn't actually any better than a regular seat - this was due to an alternate aircraft subbed in. I sent a photo to Play and they refunded me immediately. Look, you get what you pay for using a low cost airline. If they get you there and back safely and with minimal issues and you have paid way less than a legacy airline, then you're good. Too many complain at "no food, no service, no IFE"...do your research. It's like someone taking a $700 all inclusive to Cuba and moaning that the food and choices are not as good as Mexico. You get what you pay for, folks. Meanwhile I just booked for Dublin in May for CAD418 return basic fare and am shopping for a Europe trip in October-also around $440 to Amsterdam. Less than half of Icelandair or others from YYZ. Oh and YHM airport is phenomenal!! Two gates, lots of seating and a bar selling local craft beer and wine 30m from the two gates! Check in took 5 minutes, security 1 minute and none of the hassle. Park 100m from the terminal too. Love Play, love YHM. Happy customer!

### “customer service is deplorable”
Not Verified | I had booked a flight from Frankfurt to Baltimore, there was a stopover at Rejkyavik. Play delayed the first flight so we missed our connection, they sent us emails to book out stay and also gave us budget for food, it's been more than a month that I have claimed this (pre-approved claim), nobody from their team is even acknowledging my email. The customer service is deplorable. Not only are they not responding to my claim, they never have any staff at Rejkyavik airport when a flight is delayed, we were helped by security to track a guy and drag him out of whatever hole he was hiding in to come and give us some guidance when our flight was delayed, we were helped by other airline staff also but play was completely missing from the picture.

### "What a horrible experience"
Great airline to fly with until a problem arises. I flew with PLAY 5 times in 2023 and the last time, back in July 2023, they lost my suitcase. It's now January 2024, I have still not been compensated for it and they have stopped all communication with me since November, when I provided the receipts for all my items. My travel insurance got fed up of waiting on documents from them and closed my claim. What a horrible experience.

### “Deeply regret booking a flight with them”
Do not fly this airline. Deeply regret booking a flight with them which has ruined a fantastic holiday in Iceland. Absolute nightmare dealing with them. You get what you pay for. No customer service. Just sat at the airport in Iceland with many people in tears after they cancelled the flight because of no air crew, Cost me more than $1500 to get home. Claiming back from them is upto three months. Worst experience ever after travelling for over 40 years. Owned by an investment fund out to make money only and dont have about customers.

### "Will never fly with Play again"
Not Verified |  No customer service at all. If something goes wrong then screw you I guess. Charge for everything they can hook you for Avoid at all cost. Will never fly with Play again.

### "$36 for 1 overweight kilo"
Not Verified |  $36 for 1 overweight kilo (kg) is something I have never came across in my whole life. We better take another airline with screens and dinner during the flight…

### "pleased with the overall experience"
Flew from Baltimore to Paris via Reykjavík. one leg on a A320 the remaining three legs on an A321. The final leg of the trip was on a newer A321, only this leg has USB chargers. There were two USB-A and two USB-C charging ports that were shared for all three seats on one side of the row. The newer A321 also had slightly more padding on the seat though, all legs of the flight the seats were pretty uncomfortable and cramped (I 'm 6'2" / 188cm). As expected, there is no real inflight entertainment - the newer A321 did have an option to connect to Wi-Fi and a webpage that provided an online menu, a few games, and a moving map Boarding was easy and timely, though one leg we did delay departing while waiting on a passengers from a connecting flight. Staff were courteous and efficient. For a low cost carrier, I was pleased with the overall experience.

### “Not impressed at all”
Not impressed with their policy at all! I usually don’t get the cancellation policy but life taught me that for longer flights or more expensive trips it might be a good idea so imagine my disappointment when it turns out it doesn’t matter in the end as apparently earthquakes and an erupting volcano isn’t a good enough reason to cancel my flights to Iceland. Only a doctor's note, covid or death is included in their policy. So now I’m down 400 euro plus extra money for a cancellation insurance that is genuinely useless!

### "system was not working"
Disappointed because I tried several times to check in and pay for my baggage online before going to the airport the morning of flight, but I was not able because their system was not working, they double the price of the bags if you pay in the airport, and they were not able to make an accommodation for me, despite the fact that it was the fault of their website, they forced me to pay the double fee. Be careful!

### “Always friendly flight crews”
Always on time. For us budget travelers who need them to get from point A to point B, efficiently! Stay away you snobby travelers. Yes, with them everything is charged extra. Who cares. Bring you own food and a backpack only and realize you can get a flight to europe for $300 bucks or there about if you like. Think of it as a bus ticket in the sky. I love them. Don’t change. If you want extra comfort take your snob and fly Delta. Other notes: impeccably quick boarding, always seem to be on time. Weather in Iceland though can affect things, that’s the biggest potential mess. Not their fault though. Always friendly flight crews.

### "all of the flights were on time"
Went for vacation with PLAY airline from Toronto to Glasgow (via Reykjavik) on September 4, 2023 and back on September 15, 2023. That was the first and so far the only experience with Play. 1) Purchasing tickets online and the website: The whole process is quite easy and straightforward. There are several fares to choose from. However, even if you choose the cheapest one, you can always add other services needed like reserving a seat, purchasing check-in/carry-on luggage, booking transfers, etc. The website looks nice, didn't have any issues. However, I've seen people complaining about it, citing system breakdowns, slow responses, etc. I had an unpleasant event after purchasing the tickets: one leg of my flight (KEF to GLA) had gotten cancelled and I was presented with 3 options: get a refund, reschedule the flight or convert it to a voucher for future trips. Luckily, I rebooked myself on a flight one or 2 days earlier that initial date and there were no cancellations afterwards. 2) Boarding and airplanes: The airline lets you check-in and get your boarding pass 24 hr before the departure time. I checked-in maybe 1-2 hours after check-in got available and to my surprise I got window seats for both legs of the flight. Moreover, the seats were just the same for my return flight. I was flying from Hamilton Airport (ON, Canada) and can say that the airport is tiny. Yes, there are poor shopping and food selection, but you quickly pass all the security and controls. Also, lines up are really short (especially, compared to Toronto Pearson Airport). I was flying A320neo to Reykjavik and A321neo to Glasgow and vice-versa. The A320 seemed older and in worse condition than A321. The interior of the latter was really good and looked brand new. It had a "holder" for your phone embedded in or on the top of an eating tray. Also, only A321 had power outlets. The legroom at both airplanes is small. I needed to stand in the rear of the plane for while to survive almost 6 hr flight. 3) The flights and transfer: During the flight, you can't access Internet (no Wi-Fi onboard is available) and there's no in-flight entertainment, so make sure to charge your electronics and have movies and series downloaded on your devices and you should be fine. Fortunately, all of the flights were on time and I didn't miss any connections. The flight were good and smooth. The seatbelt indicator was usually off. The Reykjavik flight was almost fully occupied, but the occupancy for the Glasgow flight was low. I'd say, maybe 60%. Once I had landed in Reykjavik, I was a bit confused as you don't pass any border officers, but quickly get to airport lounge/boarding area. It would be nice to see airline's representative not only while they put a sticker (for the flights to Canada) on your passport during daytime, but also when you take an European leg/flight during night/morning time. The good thing about the Reykjavik airport is that it has a smoking area on the premises. Landings were smooth and easy. Pilots are doing a great job. 4) Summary: Flying with PLAY can actually be a bit cheaper than with other "regular" airline. However, it requires an extensive planning and calculations as only a random seat is included in the cheapest fare. You have to pay extra for anything else, including seats, baggage, flight changes, special requests, etc. Also, the food on board is very limited and extremely expensive. So, make sure to bring yours or have a meal before.

### “their website is impossible to navigate”
My flight back home (Amsterdam to Iceland to New York) was canceled by the airline on 10/19/23. They offered to put me on a later flight, but their website is impossible to navigate. I finally picked the flight option for 10/22/23 (3 days later tha my original flight!) At that point, my wife and I already had the blood pressure thru the roof! 12 hours later, the airline emailed that there were no seats available on the selection they had already approved so I was asked to pick a later day. I tried for several hours to speak to a live person, but Play Airlines does not even have a desk at Amsterdam Airport! They do not have a telephone to call. They only communicate via email or social media and, even the, we only got automated replies. After all of that frustration, I decided to book a flight with another airline, which cost me $800 one-way ticket for each person ($1600.) I also had to pay $450 for 2 nights at a hotel near the airport. Plus meals, transportation, etc. By choosing another airline, I would not get any compensation for hotels, meals, or other expenses. I would only get refunded for the flight that was canceled. I was forced to make the above decision because PLAY could not be reached in any manner and I was afraid I would be stranded in Amsterdam for at least one week. So, I was forced to spend about $2500 (non-reimbursable) because PLAY canceled a flight and it does not have live customer service.

### "we will never take PLAY again"
Not Verified |  It's very bad experience to fly with PLAY. PLAY plane was delayed that day so that we missed the connection plane and in order to catch up our trip, we purchased the different airline ticket to Paris (since PLAY didn't provide airplane for the same day). After our whole trip we requested refund from PLAY. The Claims Team of PLAY were so horrible. They never paid attention for what you had to say and not provided you any details of refund items. After back forth more than 20 emails, we finally knew what part we got refunded. In a word, we will never take PLAY again.

### "won't be using ever again"
Interacting with PLAY wasn't a pleasant experience, which began in June 2023 for a July 2023 flight to Paris, when I needed to speak with a customer service rep concerning a ticket issue and could only communicate with someone via Facebook messenger. And then my departure at BWI wasn't the best experience either. The PLAY staff members who checked the luggage and who took the boarding passes was very unprofessional, yelling on the intercom to tell passengers that they better give her the correct boarding pass to KEF Reykjavik, the connecting flight. The flight was delayed for no apparent reason; it wasn't raining on July 12th. The seats were cramped, and there was no air conditioning on the plane. Because it is a no-frills flight, water, food, and snacks were for purchase. There was no Wi-Fi, not even for purchase. Family members who I traveled with were shocked to have to pay $100 for luggage on the return flight, when it was the same exact luggage they came with, fulfilling the weight requirements. And again, for the flight returning to BWI, via KEF Reykjavik, was notoriously late, which meant rushing to get on the connecting flight to BWI. There was no type of organization for passengers to board the flight ... just a bunch of people crowded around each other. And it was hot on the plane, again. I shared a review on PLAY's Facebook page and it was deleted. This is an airline that I won't be using ever again. I prefer to pay more for professionalism, superb customer service, and comfort on a plane.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified | Flight was good. Wasn't expecting a lot of frills and wasn't disappointed. The thing I do take exception to is the handling of my luggage. They smashed off three of the four wheels off my luggage and took a chunk out of one of the corners. Now they say it'll take 3-4 weeks to hear anything. Very poor customer service. Spirit of Iceland.

### "first time I ever missed a flight"
I missed my flight, that was the first time I ever missed a flight. This was the worst airline for that to happen. They don't have any services at the IAD, and I had to do everything online. They don't reschedule your trip. You have to buy another ticket. They only refund taxes, not the whole ticket. The next day I was trying to check-in and the website was down. If you are trying to be online only, your website must be bulletproof, like aa.com or delta. I was looking for a overhead space and asked the flight attendant for help, she screamed at me to put my bag in front of me. Any other airline, the attendant would have started opening bins to help me. I can't believe you are online airline with no APP.

### "refused to refund the value of the seats"
Due to my anxiety and panic issues, I always choose to buy seats that ensure I'll be sitting next to the person I'm traveling with; it's a way for me to feel secure. However, upon boarding the plane, I discovered that the seat I had purchased did not exist –  it simply didn't exist. PLAY, without consulting me, arbitrarily changed my seat to some random location, separating me from the person I was traveling with. As expected, I had an anxiety attack and had to take an anxiety medication to calm down, which ended up ruining a day of my vacation as I had to recover. Anticipating a similar scenario, I checked the seat assignments for my return flight and once again, contrary to the layout presented, the seats I had purchased were not next to each other. In this case, I had to buy new seats again to achieve my initial goal. In response to my complaint, PLAY referred to their terms and conditions, where they reserve the right to "assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boarding of the aircraft. This may be necessary for operational, safety, or security reasons. They refused to refund the value of the outbound seats, claiming that they had been changed to seats of higher value (completely ignoring the fact that they separated me from the person in my reservation). They only refunded the value of the return seats but claimed an exception. If PLAY can't guarantee the seats they sell, then why do they sell them in the first place? Let's imagine it was a minor child and a parent; would they also be separated? To what extent is what PLAY claims legitimate when they disregard personal well-being?

### "no public facing customer service at Reykavik"
I purchased a ticket to fly roundtrip from Washington to Paris, through Reykavik in September 2023. My flight leaving Washington was delayed due to weather and I missed my connection to Paris. I was auto rebooked to fly the next day to Amsterdam, instead of Paris. So, I was left to my own devices for finding a hotel, and getting transportation to and from the airport to my hotel. Play airlines does not have a human providing customer service or guidance for these situations in Reykavik airport. Upon submitting my receipts for reimbursement, I was informed that I would only be reimbursed for the cost of public transportation to my hotel. I used a private group bus service which was around 60 euros. When researching a train from Amsterdam airport to Paris, the first two trains available were sold out, and I had to wait 3-4 hours for a train with seats, which cost 169 euros. Similarly I was informed I would not be reimbursed for the full cost of the train. In the end, I was informed that I would be reimbursed 256 Euros. Of that, by law 150 euros would be attributed to my $220 hotel. When I asked for a breakdown of how they arrived at the full figure, I did not receive a response. When I decided accepting 250 euros reimbursement, might be the prudent course of action, I still have yet to receive a response, or a refund on my credit card after a week of follow up emails. PLAy provides bare minimum style transportation to and from Europe. They have next to no public facing customer service at Reykavik airport. The non-responses to my reimbursement claim makes me think that there is a ponzi scheme lurking underneath the bright red planes they fly.

### "a great flight and value"
I had a great flight and value on Play Airlines. The young energetic flight crew was great and the everyone from the captain or the flight crew spoke English. My wife and I 6 hour flight went fast both ways across the ocean because we downloaded movies from Netflix. Both Play aircraft were A320 and looked like new planes. I loves that the plane had USB chargers at the seat. Life saver on watching a movie or charging my iPhone. We had the right size bookbag and 1 proper size luggage to carry on and a 1 proper sized bad for stowaway luggage. Play weighed our luggage and glanced at the size of our carryon, personal and stowed luggage and never said a word about any of our things. I did see some people that were unprepared, cost them plenty of money and didn't follow the rules. $100 charge Bag oversized so avoidable, was expensive also. I can't wait to go back to Europe on Play again at so much cheaper of a price than the other airlines. My experience on Play was great because I followed the Play Airline rules.

### PLAY customer review
Booking budget airines has become absolute bs. You think you're saving money and then boom, you have to spend 50 bucks in the airport to bring snacks on the plane because they don't serve you anything on the plane (for free), even a 6 hour flight. No water or coffee or anything, and obviously the food and drinks are expensive as shit on the plane. 5 euro for a shitty coffee. I had nothing but a backpack and they charged me 90 euros at the gate to carry it on, even though it fit in the box they told me to put it in. Some straps went over a blue line... straps. But so did the girls hard sided suitcase behind me, yet they didn't charge her. 90 euros, are you f-cking kidding me? Its a soft sided backpack and could have easily fit under the seat in front of me. Might as well spend the extra money on a flight so you don't get smacked with bogus extra charges. $300 for a 6 hour flight plus extra 90 euro for having a packback, where you receive nothing except a sore neck. Doesn't seem worth it. Just pay a little extra for a better flight.

### "do not fly this airline"
Not Verified |  At Keflavik airport for flight back to NY, flight showed delayed. Passengers for a full plane were waiting at the gate, the Play employees had no idea what was going on. The security people were  rude and intimidating. The plane we were waiting for hadn’t even arrived yet, and we were told to line up for boarding! Why? We stood and waited for almost 2 hours before boarding started!!! Planes were cheap inside, no leg room. Do yourself a favor, pay a higher fare and do not fly this airline!

### "airline has no customer service"
This airline has no customer service worth speaking about. Its web site is a disaster and contacting them with any kind of problem is something out of the 19th century. They have no telephone number - none. Speaking with a person is impossible. They only have virtual representatives that take complaints and respond via email several days later. Changing or correcting anything through their web site is a veil of tears. It's hard to gauge what management at the airline envisions for its future. The basic fares are cheap, but everything else - seats, baggage, food, drinks, flight changes - costs money. I think I spent $30 dollars or so on my one flight for a drink or two. But this is the strategy they are pursuing: cutting costs means no margin for error. Save yourself some grief and go elsewhere.

### "I'll never fly play again"
Flew home yesterday from Paris to Boston, because I didn't get my boarding pass emailed to me until after the flight left, AGAIN, I was forced to wait in line at CDG for well over and hour. I went through the security check only to stand in a line to wait for a bus, the bus brought us to the plane and we had to wait on a hot bus, we got to a hot plane with no air conditioning only to wait again for the plane to be refueled. The flight attendant had to open the middle door in order to get air into the plane. Leaving Reykjavik we had to wait going to the runway for some reason unknow to us, the explanation was given but it make no sense what the pilot told us. Then off to Boston. We had trouble hooking up to the jetway, the plane lost total power with no air conditioning running and only emergency lighting. The people asking for boarding passes at Reykjavik were ridiculous, four of them standing beside each other all wanting to look at our boarding passes, and everyone of them had to look. Carry on baggage had to be measured every time I passed the counter. Just by looking at my bag and the tag from the previous flight should tell you it would fit. It's all too much! No entertainment on the flight, no WiFi, and water at 3 euros a bottle is ridiculous. I'm safe to say I'll never fly play again.

### "Underhanded and dishonest"
Never ever again. Terrible airline. They don't give couples seats together even when booked at the same time months in advance. It's a money grabbing scheme to get you to pay hundreds more when you check-in and discover you are not seated together. Very despicable treatment. Even when it was explained that I have a severe fear of flying and needed to be with my husband for safety reasons. The no frills, no wifi, etc was expected but not this. Not a good approach for an airline new to Canada. Underhanded and dishonest to take advantage of seniors.

### "Terrible flight"
Terrible flight of all the time! It is now 1:05pm in Paris, the departure time to Iceland was 12:30pm, we are still waiting, my connection flight to Washington is 35 min after the initial arrival, I already missed it! Same thing happened when I was coming, I had to stay in a hotel gor 2 days paying for my own lunch and dinner. Same thing is going to happen again.

### "the most family-friendly airline"
I just wanted to thank Play for being one of the most family-friendly airlines I have seen. We travelled with twin toddlers (& 2yr old) to Europe (two flights, 12 hours total with about 2-hr connection). The crew was unbelievably helpful. Few examples: they allowed us hang out at the back space - service prep area. They arranged to use empty seats (the tickets were booked in same row, but seating of two infants with 3 adults is not allowed due to oxygen mask limitations in any airplane). The flight attendants even offered to hold/rock the babies for a while during the inevitable melt downs and they offered tips on how to deal with them. All other aspects were as expected: on time planes, easy check-in, no problem with bags (we had paid online). We also checked car seats and a stroller and the stroller can be checked at the gate. Everyone was super-polite and very nice. The airplanes were clean and everything was great. Obviously the lack of entertainment (e.g., screens) and not having free food and drinks are not issues when one travels with babies on lap, as there is no time for any of this and the babies need a lot of work when not sleeping. As a matter of fact, it is much better to bring own entertainment when traveling with kids. We ordered food, beverages, coffee etc and the prices were reasonable. I recommend Play definitely for families with infants or toddlers, and for everyone else. I understand the comments that one needs to be prepared (in terms of screen/electronics needs etc), but again the food and drink choices are great and inexpensive. Quite frankly, it is way cheaper to buy food on the plane than anything from the post-security stores at Boston Logan and take with you on plane. Finally, I recommend to add bags online before the flight (along with car seats, strollers etc). We did that and the check-in process was so easy and the agents were so friendly. We also had to ask a couple of questions before the flight and the Facebook-Messenger platform responses were so fast. Keflavik airport is beautiful and people are so friendly. Passport check etc was very fast, which is very important when traveling with little ones. There was a security guard who informed us that there are free strollers available, which we used and our toddlers had so much fun with. Fellow passengers were mostly understanding and would even try to engage the little ones from time to time. Definitely there were people who felt annoyed and gave us some stares, but overall these reactions (both positive and somewhat negative) are expected. Overall, the experience was really great despite the challenges associated with traveling with toddlers, we will fly Play again and I definitely recommend Play especially to families with kids.

### "I will never use use PLAY again"
Not Verified |  My family of 4 booked a trip to Paris on June 22, 2022 via eDreams. Unfortunately my husband and I had COVID and had to cancel the trip on 04/14/2023 via eDreams. The total cost of the airfare including bags and seats were: $2,789.16 for all 4 of us. I received a response from eDreams on June 8,2023 saying that PLAY has refunded me the amount of $1975.97 directly via my Credit Card on 04/15/2023. With that in mind, I went online and checked all my credit card statements. I did not see any refunds with the amount of $1975.97. I called my credit card company to confirm and spoke to a representative and the representative confirmed that they have not received any refunds from PLAY nor eDreams. At this point, I decided to send a customer complaint to PLAY stating that I have not received any refunds from their company. I received an automatic reply from PLAY on June 11, stating the following: Due to a high volume of requests, we may take up to 6 business days to respond to a regular service request and up to 6 weeks to respond to a claim request. If you have an urgent inquiry, you can contact us on Facebook Messenger, and we’ll assist you from there. As I was asking for a claim request; 6 weeks from June 11th is July 16th. I did not receive any email communications from PLAY on June 16th till today August 09,2023. I also tried reaching out via PLAY's Facebook Messenger on 08/07/2023. The rep wanted to confirm my credit card number. Which I did. It has been a total of 1 month and 4 weeks of business days since June 11, 2023 and no response from PLAY. If you are reading this review and you have another option for another plane company to reach your destination, use the other company. You'll be thankful in case you have to cancel your trip. I will never use use PLAY again.

### "do not expect a helpful response"
My boyfriend and I recently flew from Europe to Washington DC with a stop in Reykjavik. We had never heard of PLAY before but decided to give them a try because they were cheap and new. When we arrived at Reykjavik for a 1.5 hours stopover, we were told that the flight to DC had been replaced and we had to get new boarding passes. We (and many other passengers) ran to the service desk only to find out that they had separated us. I told them that we had paid extra in advance to choose our seats so that we would be sure to sit together in the long haul flight but they said too bad. After boarding several people had the same seats and people were standing up trying to find anywhere to sit. Looking through the other reviews on this platform, I can see that this seems to be a recurring problem for PLAY. When we got to DC they had lost our luggage in Reykjavik. We waited 2 days without any word and then on the third day luckily the luggage was suddenly delivered to our hotel. We had to shop for replacement clothing and toiletries and when we made a claim after they told us you can only claim USD 100 per person. In their response they said that we could have rented clothes instead of buying. I don't know where you go and rent normal clothes and shoes so I replied to their customer service representative that perhaps they should give this advice in advance and also on where to go a rent clothes in a strange city. Moreover, they said that we should have brought necessary extra clothing in our hand luggage - bearing in mind that you also have to pay extra for carry on luggage! This response is so absurd and the only really positive side to it is that I now get to show this email to friends who can then have a good laugh. All in all, PLAY feels like a discount airline with no on air entertainment or even water and we will most likely not be flying with them again. I do not expect a helpful response from PLAY as I have read their comments to the other reviews on here which seem to be very standard and insincere. I am writing this review because this is a new airline that I had not heard about before and I want to warn other potential passengers.

### "the most painful experience"
Horrible. My plane was one of several delayed due to a rainstorm. There were at least 2 other flights from Baltimore and Washington that also missed their connecting flights. Most of us missed our flight but less than ten minutes. I’m not complaining about that, I get it missing a connection sucks, what happened after though is the most painful experience of my life. We were told by the staff to go out and wait for a representative by baggage claim. That they would help us with new flights. There is no one. We realize this pretty quick and try to connect to PLAY. They have no phone number. There is no way to get a response. We even tried DMing them on Instagram. Nothing. Not from email, not from Facebook messenger not from their AI service bot. And we wait for 4 hours before someone finally comes and tells us that no one actually work at this airport from PLAY. Of the 250 people waiting half got an email that their flight had been rebooked. We never got a email to this day saying our flight was rebooked. We had to pay 700$ for a new one. We had to go on to rebook a new flight, stay the night and pay travel expenses( it’s about 80$ for a taxi in Iceland). In total about 1,200 spent because of this. Now here I am a week later no refund and I just got an email response asking if anyone had reached out to me yet.

### "Unprofessional airline"
Our Play had about 30 passengers trying to make a connection in Reykjavík. The flight was delayed over an hour, out of anyone’s control, but the way this was handled afterwards is atrocious. No communication between our Play flight and the flight taking off occurred while in air, our flight attendants were all clueless, no one knew what gate the next flight would be taking off from or if it was still there. I was able to look up all of this and tell people in the seats around me. We sprinted to our gate but unfortunately it was already closed, even though the aircraft was still parked right outside. Half that flight was standing by the gate wondering why they couldn’t let us on. Zero communication happened between the delayed flight and the missed connection, even though several enquiries were made and both were Play aircrafts. Play made everybody exit the airport, shuttled us to hotels without telling us the location of our hotel or if a new flight was booked. Several unaccompanied minors were involved in this. Currently still waiting to hear on the details of our reimbursement if we’re even getting one. Unprofessional airline.

### "Play is a terrible airline"
Not Verified | Play is a terrible airline to travel with. The travel conditions are miserable, there is NO TV, NO Wi-Fi, No way to charge phone or any electronic devices, food IS NOT provided, food is sold, they have few options being sold is COSTLY, all food items are charged in Euro, NO dollars. The play does not give travelers baggage, even though tickets note that travelers are allowed a package. They have HIGH charges in baggage. When travelling recently, we were charged to pay for carriers' baggage to take inside the cabin. Things that do not exist with other airlines companies. THERE ARE NO BAGS ALLOWED in the cabin, except for very small backpacks. We had a terrible experience with PLAY, this has been our first and last time traveling with PLAY, and WILL NEVER RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO TRAVEL WITH PLAY based on the conditions highlighted above. Play staff will say that they are a low-cost traveling airline agency, but when you add up the money spent with BAGGAGE, FOOD and also traveling in such miserable conditions, especially when traveling with kids, you will spend more money. This leads to experiencing HIGH STRESS. It is better to use another AIRLINE agency that is more organized and more reliable than PLAY WHEN LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE FACTORS. PLAY as a company on its whole is disorganized, there is LACK OF COMMUNICATION between staff from one airport to another airport. We had an issue in ICELAND when we were requested to double pay carriers' baggage that was taken in the cabin that we already paid for in the departure location. Staff at this Iceland airport WASN'T Knowledgeable, did not have a better understanding of their system, and COULD NOT COMPREHEND despite telling them that carriers' baggage was already paid at the departure location. We had this issue resolved after requesting to speak to the airport SUPERVISOR who was nice, professional and understandable. Supervisor easily controlled the matter and informed its staff that all was okay with us. Although I was very upset at the time, I appreciated the assistance from the Iceland Airport evening supervisor. Please, supervisor to continue to provide good customer service to your clients.

### "I will not be flying them again"
Play airlines is a low budget airline so I expected the flight to not be super comfortable. What I did not expect was how terrible their customer service is or how antiquated their system is. I booked a round trip flight to Berlin from New York and opted for the basic economy rate on the outbound flight but upgraded to the FLEX rate on the return trip. Amongst other things it included, there was a free one time date change. A flight price difference could apply but there would be $0 charge for changing dates. I knew there was a possibility of needing to change dates so I upgraded. When going to change my flight, it had been saying $0 for weeks. The day I went to officially change it, one day before the original flight departure and within the allowable timeframe, there was all of a sudden a $289 date change charge. It was impossible to speak with anyone on the phone as they only have online chat support. The online representative dismissed it saying oh it must just be a fare difference nothing I can do. How is your system that bad that things just show up wrong. I also looked at the price of the flight now versus what I initially paid and it was not a $289 difference, so I have no idea where that number came from. I had to pay the amount because I had no other option. So I essentially paid $289 more than I should have plus paying the additional for the FLEX rate that did not matter in the end. The return flight plane was actually nice and comfortable, especially if you upgrade to the front of the plane. I considered flying with them again but after multiple attempts to reach out and no one able to give me a real answer or refund the incorrect amount, I will not be flying them again.

### "I had a great experience"
I had a great experience with PLAY. Flying out of Hamilton to Stockholm via Keflavik was an experience I would recommend, from the speedy check in with my personal item and paid for carry on bag, to the passenger loading, to the flight itself I had not one bad thing to say. All of my flights arrived on time or ahead of schedule. On all flights I was either in a row by myself or had the middle seat empty while I shared the row with another solo traveler. I had downloaded movies and Documentaries on my Ipad and was able to watch them comfortably on seats that I had no issues with. There were options for food and drink on the plane, but I brought my own drinks and snacks.

### "could not have ask for anything more"
We needed to make an impromptu visit to family in the UK, and we had recently heard about this new airline, Play. Normally, we fly high-end airlines with all the alcohol, food, entertainment, pillows, blankets, and ear buds. For a sudden visit in mid-July, this was going to be a costly trip. Therefore, although we were full of much trepidation, we booked round trip flights from Washington DC to Glasgow via Reykjavik on this new game changing airline. Then, we read the reviews and fear struck. After reading the reviews we were full of doubts. We were just hoping to get there. Four flights total. All flights were on time arriving ahead of schedule. The staff from initial check in to flight attendants and the pilot were all very enthusiastic, professional, and responsive to passengers. We could not have ask for anything more and will definitely fly Play again. And I must comment on the legroom and the comfort level of the seats. The planes are new and well designed with much more comfort and space than others. Plus we saved some money and had a great experience. My only advice is be prepared. Food and beverages are available for purchase in flight. Although the prices aren’t horrid, you can save some money by bringing your own food and snacks on the plane. Also bring a water bottle and fill it up before take off. I saw many people with pre downloaded movies on their devices. I just enjoyed a book.

### "Apologies simply does not cover it"
Not Verified | Our flights were booked four weeks in advance for a family wedding. We are working professionals and took the time off of work and paid the necessary fees for so called "service". We were at the airport nearly five hours in advance of this flight. We were the first people to speak with the Play airline check in. We were not able to board because a "green check mark” on our ticket because their site timed out when we tried to online check in on multiple occasions. This is clearly an administrative issue. 1. They did not have a plane available with the correct amount of seats. 2. They were unable to rebook us. 3 . Their site timed out, not allowing us to check in 4. Their customer service “representatives” were incompetent and did not have a functional computer or clearly the cognitive ability to direct 30 passengers in the same scenario and scoffed at our concerns. We and 30 other passengers were told to go home. There was no apology, no rebooking, and no assistance at the airport from any of the PLAY representatives. This is unacceptable. A 400$ compensation package was offered. Additional costs for flights on another airline are close to double what we initially paid. Apologies" simply does not cover it. Also nearly one month later, we are still pending a refund for the second flights. $1746. I have never paid more money for less service in my life. 0/10.

### "reduced our chances of boarding the flight"
I am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the travel experience we encountered with Fly Play on flight OG102. I must acknowledge our own contribution to the problem as we were running just a little bit late for the flight and we fully understand and accept that responsibility. However, what followed left us perplexed and disheartened. Upon realizing that the flight was delayed by approximately 50 minutes, my husband and I, experienced travelers, considered this a fortunate turn of events. We proceeded to the check baggage counter, which was unmanned – understandable given our tardiness. We decided to get through TSA and inquire about gate checking our baggage at the gate. To our surprise, we encountered an extremely rude and unreasonable gate attendant. We politely requested if we could gate check our bag. Unfortunately, her response was an immediate refusal without providing any explanation. This was particularly disheartening as gate check had been a feasible option in the past, including with Play in September. Our attempts to seek clarification or speak to someone else were met with further hostility. The gate attendant claimed to be the sole authority and refused any further assistance, which left us feeling unheard and disrespected. The situation escalated when the gate attendant intentionally covered her name tag and displayed an offensive gesture towards us. We were unable to board the flight and learned from the chat bot that we were labeled as "did not fly due to inappropriate behavior. This statement is categorically false, and we were relieved when Play ultimately offered discounted tickets as compensation after hours of pleading via chat and trying to come to some resolution. Nonetheless, we firmly believe that the entire situation could and should have been handled more professionally and with greater courtesy by your employee, who represents your company's values and image. While we understand that being late reduced our chances of boarding the flight, we firmly believe that every passenger deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. We would have gladly accepted any reasonable explanation for not being able to gate check our bag. Instead, the encounter left us with a sense of shock and disappointment that overshadowed the entire travel experience. We sincerely hope that this matter will be taken seriously and addressed appropriately to prevent similar incidents in the future. As loyal customers, we believe in the value of constructive feedback, and we trust that Fly Play will endeavor to ensure a more positive and respectful experience for all passengers.

### "Fantastic experience for the money"
Not Verified | NY-Stewart (SWF)- Keflavik (KEF) round trip. Fantastic experience for the money. Yes, there isn't any WiFi nor any kind of IFE, and I do have to knock off points for that, but it's also a budget airline. You get what you pay for. The seats are very comfy, which is not a given in economy class for 6,1 figure like mine. The service was very good, with attendants at my beck and call. The planes were very new too. The food items were very top notch quality, actually worth the prices. But best of all, it's very very cheap. One round trip cost me exactly what a one-way on other airlines would have. Will be using this again for my next Iceland or trans-Atlantic sojourn.

### "I will not recommend this airline"
I booked a flight which was 16 hours transit by mistake. I wanted to change, but the customer service was horrible and did not help. I took it anyways, I asked them iIf they were going to take me to a hotel since the flight is more than 8 hrs transit. They said It’s not their responsibility. I stayed In Iceland in 16 hours and when It was the time to check in I had to pay extra money for my carry on. This airline supposed to be cheap but It isn’t, they charge everything even water. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "most miserable experience of my life"
Flying with Play was the most miserable experience of my life. The booking was easy, as was the check in. There were no delays and everything went smoothly. There is a massive issue however with the fact that they don't have a phone number. Never deal with a company that can't be contacted by phone. If anything goes wrong, you're on your own. While everything outside the craft was fine, inside the plane is a different story altogether. Firstly, getting seated was an absolute farce. The lack of organisation by the cabin crew seemed to rub off on the passengers. Several people switched seats, meaning some found another person sat in their seat. I've never seen this before on such a scale and I can therefore only attribute it to the fact that the cabin crew were not checking boarding passes or directing anyone. Getting seated took longer than I've ever seen on an aircraft and at no time were the crew trying to speed things along. The plane started taxiing with passengers still stood up. The main issue with the flight was the seats. I have never seen this many rows on this type of aircraft. There is no way on earth these things should be in the air for more than an hour. I am 5ft6 and I had so little leg room that I could not physically reach down to pull my bag up. If you are 6ft+ you realistically cannot fly this airline. As if this could not be any worse, the seats recline. Yes. They recline. The room in front of me was reduced to level where I could not put my tray table down. It was 6 hours of absolute torture. Some passengers spent the entire flight stood in the aisle as they could not sit for that long. Everything on this flight is paid for separately. Fine. It's a budget airline. I get it. But water? Surely this is a basic human necessity. It was 3 Euros for the smallest bottle of water I've ever seen in my life. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Not only is it torture but it makes no financial sense. After adding in the extra legroom seat costs (you will need it), water and food, you are likely to be saving little to nothing. Take a real airline. You'll thank me. I'm sure Play will reply with their "hi thanks we're a budget airline as such" spiel, but it's not good enough. These planes should not exist. And if they do they should be flying one hour domestic, not transatlantic.

### "A terrible experience"
A terrible experience from start to finish. I flew connecting flights both times and multiple planes left late (the first one by 3 hours!). The check-in employees are unfriendly and unhelpful, and seem to prefer gossiping and sitting on their phones rather than taking care of the line. Their system experienced a shut down on the day we left for vacation and flew back home. On top of that, they lost my luggage on our return home and I was traveling with multiple people that did receive their luggage. Will never fly this airline again, and I highly recommend that others do not as well. I took my chances flying with this airline and I wish that I had not.

### "supposed to be a cheap airline"
It's supposed to be a cheap airline but with everything they charge it really isn't. Not only do they not have TV on long flights, but also outlets to charge phones. They also charge for both check in and carry on bags that are ridiculous high. 250 for a check in bag and my carry ok another 70. Oh also irs 26 for every extra pound/kilo. So the 700 plus I paid for the ticket was for the oxygen I was gracefully allowed to breath while on their aircraft. Hope you don't need to use the bathroom I'm sure there will be fee for that as well.

### "It was a total nightmare"
Never again. The short story is that they left us and our two small children stranded in NY at night with no plans, support or communication when our tickets were round trip to Baltimore. We are still fighting to get reimbursed for the cost of renting a car and driving to our actual destination. It was a total nightmare. Our flight home from Dub-Kef was delayed by over 3 hrs. Causing the 1 flight a day from Kef-bwi to be missed. We were given very little communication but eventually told that all missed connections were rebooked for the next day and passengers would be taken to a hotel. We went to the hotel and eventually late that night received an email with new flight info. So far, we kept a good attitude and considered it an adventure. However when we tried to check in for the flight we couldn’t and just got error messages. So we went to the airport the next day and we’re told that the new flight was overbooked! They offered us €700 to get bumped but said it could take up to 4 days to get rebooked and there weren’t any hotels available in town anyhow! So we declined and they finally said they put us on an Iceland air flight home. But when we got the booking email it was NOT to Baltimore it was to New York! The email said they were working on flights from New York to Baltimore and would email us when it was finished. The exact time the flight finished boarding, we received emails stating that they were unable to find connecting flights and we should “kindly find our own accommodations.” Upon landing in New York (where PLAY doesn’t have any agents) we were given no further help and told to file a claim on their web site. We had to pay our own way home. Now we are trying to get reimbursed but the communication doesn’t even make sense when they bother to reply at all. It’s like starting over every time someone replies. Such a nightmare.

### "worst part of the flight was the seats"
My wife and I just had our first experience with Play Airlines. I’m pretty certain it will be our last. First the cost: This “budget airline” tagged us for nearly $2400 r/t from Boston to Dublin in late June. (We booked months in advance.) That was less confiscatory than the other airlines, but hardly a bargain. That $2400 got us a checked bag and carry on per person. It didn’t buy us even a package of peanuts during the 9-10 hours we spent in the air. At one point I asked the flight attendant if I could have a cup of tap water. She said she could sell me a small bottle for three euro. Play is a hub and spoke airline, so all flights go through Iceland. That turns 5.5-6.5 hour nonstop flight into a 10-12 hour affair, with layover. On the long transatlantic flight, there is no seatback entertainment, not even any WiFi for purchase—which is odd since Play tries to make money off of virtually every other aspect of the flight. If it could charge for a trip to the bathroom, I’m pretty sure it would. The worst part of the flight, however, was the seats. I’m six feet tall. I accept that I’ll never get any sleep in coach. This was the first time, however, that neither my wife nor I could sit comfortably for even an hour—at least on the trip from Boston to Iceland. (The trip from Iceland to Dublin was more comfortable.) The seat cushions were wafer thin. There was little lumbar support. It goes without saying that there was no legroom, but the pitch—the distance between my seat and the one in front—was the smallest I’ve ever experienced. My wife and I had to switch seats when the chap in front reclined even a bit. Play’s penny-pinching apparently extends to its airport staff as well. We showed up at Dublin airport at 835 am on July 1 to check in for our return flight home. The queue was already packed. To deal with it, Play had one poor beleaguered attendant at the counter. (After about 75 mins of this they did bring in a second attendant.) We spent about 90 minutes in line waiting just to check our bags. To be fair, our trip off season would cost about half what we paid for peak travel. Honestly, I wouldn’t fly Play again if it gave me a free ticket. This isn’t “no frills.” It’s factory farming disguised as airline travel, with passengers penned in like chickens, valuable only for the dollar signs on our heads. Pay the extra money and get treated like a human being. We will.

### "my advice is to be prepared"
My experience flying to Dublin with Play was a positive experience. I had flown with a similar airline in the past and knew that I had to be prepared to follow the guidelines for baggage precisely and bring any food/drink that I wanted onboard to avoid additional costs. My return flight was not a positive experience. It was very stressful and there was almost no communication from Play during this stressful time. Our flight had been delayed and the communication about that delay was confusing or silent. The plane was not there at the time we were expected to board and there was no communication between that boarding time and the actual time we would be able to board. My group had a connecting flight in Reykjavík for 3pm that we realized we would miss, but when we asked flight attendants, they were unable to answer any questions. We did miss our connections flight and the only information we were told was to exit the airport to attend a meeting where we would find out more information. This is the situation I am most unsatisfied with. Exiting the airport felt like a bad idea, but that was the direction that was given if you wanted to receive more information. When we got to the meeting, there was no representative from Play. Only a man from the hotel shuttle service that told us Play was going to provide a room for us to stay overnight. No other options were presented. Due to a flight I had to catch in Boston for my friends wedding, I knew I had to fly out that day. So, I had to purchase a flight with a different airline and just hope to be refunded. Since Play had told us to exit the airport, I missed the next flight to Boston because there wasn’t enough time to gather my boarding pass and go through TSA. Luckily, I was able to catch the last flight out of Reykjavík and everything eventually worked out. I received an email that said my flight would be fully refunded and provided with some compensation, which I appreciate. I would still recommend Play because the flight is one of the most affordable options. However, my advice to anyone choosing this airlines is to be prepared. Do your research and read the policies closely because you will not be able to communicate with Play directly. After rebooking the flight with a different airline I spent the next hour or two researching Play airlines policies and that helped me feel better about receiving a refund for my flight. Play did not ever provide the option to rebook a flight with a different airline, or that in some cases they will rebook a flight and transport you to the rear by airport. The website I used to research policies is here: https://airlinespolicy.com/cancellation-policy/play-airlines-cancellation-policy/ I do not recommend calling them, customer service hung up twice.

### "Ice cold customer service"
Ice cold customer service. Charge heavily for regular baggage, even for the standard carry on bag that is ok with all international airlines. They are just here to take your money. Worst experience ever! Never ever flying with them! No flight meals and no movies. They just want to reach you from point A to B after taking all your money for every little thing they can find. Flight was purchased on kiwi and was supposed to be United but they had a tie up with Play Airlines. Flight went back to the gate after boarding and delayed by 1 hour so missed connecting flight!

### "booked without cancellation insurance"
Not Verified |  Do not use this airline! Terrible customer service! I am 19 years old and planned a once in a lifetime trip with friends. My friend booked the tickets and unknowingly they were booked without cancellation insurance. I was the only person in my group that did not receive my passport in time for the trip. Did all the things I could do in order to secure it in time (paid to have it expedited, contacted my local congressman, drove to wait on line to another state without an appointment to a passport agency, and called daily). The company only communicates through social media apps and a 3 minute conversation turned into days of back and forth since you have to wait for a representative to get back to you. They will not refund my money of $700 even though I was unaware that we did not have non-refundable tickets. My only option was to change to another trip which included paying a change of ticket fee and any difference in the cost of the new ticket (which would have been at least $1,000.) I stated that I could not do that since I wasn’t sure if my passport would come in time for this newly booked trip. If I didn’t receive it, I would have to pay another change of flight fee, along with another ticket. This could have gone on until I received my passport, which I have not received yet. The company is not willing to budge and do the right thing. I would never use this airline again.

### "flight was very comfortable"
Not Verified |  I flew for the first time with this airline in June 2023. The flight was great and one thing that stood out to me is that they were extremely accommodating to people with peanut allergies. I don't have a peanut allergy, but I do have someone in my family with one (although he wasn't on the flight with us). The airline made more than one announcement asking people to refrain from eating peanuts. I really appreciated knowing that. Besides that, the flight was very comfortable, lots of leg room, and affordable.

### "All round good value for money"
This was the first time I flew Play and I was happy with all aspects of their product. I flew out of Stansted and had to get from Gatwick by bus which was a bit of a struggle. Seats were nice and flight personnel were pleasant. We flew to Stewart, USA via Keflavik. We had a two hour stopover and I just sat in transit area and waited. Play is a low cost carrier so you pay for what you need. I usually travel with an under the seat bag so I bought no extras. At Stewart there is a bus that meets the plane and takes you to Manhattan for 25 dollars. I had a friend meet me though. All round good value for money.

### "No empathy, no apology"
I arrived 3 hours before boarding time at the airport so I can do some work. I made sure that I paid my luggage fees ahead of time and I checked in with a boarding pass already issued. Not to mention that the online check-in process was painful. It took me almost 90 minute to drop off my luggage. The check in process is very slow, inefficient. Customer service employee were inconsiderate of peoples time. Not to mention that the terminal where PLAY is located the AC was turned off. When I asked the check in desk person, what’s the advantage of checking in online if I have to wait 90 minutes to just drop the luggage. She was rude and disrespectful. She was like go complain to the company. No empathy, no apology. When asked for the email contact to file a complaint her answer was go find it online. I paid for the flight and I'm expecting a fair respectful and decent service. Check in process is inefficient and workers are unprofessional and rude. First and last time I use this terrible airline. I would pay double the money and fly with different airline than to use play airline. I am sure if this continues it will be an historical airline such as wow airline.

### "got to have the worst customer service"
This airline has got to have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I purchased cancellation protection. We decided to go to Paris as well which we booked on IcelandAir. I made the mistake of booking a flight on Play going back to Keflavik to catch my original flight on Play back to Stewart. I purchased insurance as well. Ì assumed I would be able to get the bookings merged into one or have both flights turned into a credit to rebook as one booking but at every turn I was told we cannot do that. I decided to use a different airline to get to Iceland and Paris. Play has no customer service number to speak of to contact with problems and the contact via email or chat feels scripted or worse an AI. At the end of the day once you pay for luggage and everything you will only wind up saving a few dollars. Save yourself a headache and fly with anyone else even a cargo shipment. I would give them a zero if I was allowed

### "send you in circles from their Chat Bot"
This airline is not "budget" or "economic". The extra cost comes in on long flights and depends on how fast you dehydrate and get hungry. Not even tap water is complimentary but you may ask for a cup of ice and if the attendant you ask is nice, they'll put hot water in it. Otherwise you best bring a huge water bottle. No WiFi, No entertainment, period. As for leg room, if you're 6' or over, expect none. DO NOT EXPECT ANY NORMAL INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT COMFORTS. Customer service is atrocious. In my case, I was told my flight would be delayed or canceled approximately 1hr 30 min before their customer service hours ended. They fail to realize that some people want to enjoy their vacation instead of check their phone. When you do need help, They will send you in circles from their Chat Bot, to the check in desk, to an airport info kiosk, back to the chat bot. I do not yell at anyone, especially not workers trying to do their jobs. Not before, or even after they take my picture and threaten to call the cops on me for wanting to speak to somebody that can explain the circular policy of their airline and it's misleading practices. I will never fly with this company again.

### "Very, very no-frills"
It was fine. Very, very no-frills, and when the person in front of me put his seat all the way back I had mere inches between my nose and the seatback. I was really grateful to be able to make it to Dublin from New York/Newburgh for less than $300 as someone with a lot of family in Ireland and not a lot of money. I downloaded a few hours of shows on Netflix, brought snacks, a reusable water bottle, and a portable charger (although all four of my flights had USB chargers available). I had a very good experience with PLAY traveling solo in my 20s without checked baggage. I probably wouldn't recommend this for families, if you might need to rebook, or people who think they're the main character of each plane they board. No, there's no Wi-Fi, but I downloaded and watched most of season 3 of Seinfeld and had a nice Tanqueray gin and tonic onboard with the money I saved.

### "The worst airline ever flown"
It would have been better taking Ryanair or Easyjet to USA. The worst airline ever flown and I travel every month for work all over the world. No in flight entertainment for long haul flight. No water, no snacks. You pay for everything except the air in the cabin. I will definitely not be repeating the experience.

### "have never been so frustrated in my entire life"
My flight from Paris CBG was delayed due to a medical issue, which I understand was not preventable. However, all passengers were told to get our baggage back only at KEF, and we would make our connecting flights once at KEF. 10 minutes before landing, we were informed that all connecting flights had departed. Upon landing at the airport, not a single representative was available to speak to passengers. Half got emails with hotel accommodations/buses. I did not receive a single communication from Play. Not one message. I did not have a hotel room or ride from the airport. I could not contact anyone as the customer service was 'overwhelmed. Passengers from the flight were wandering around the airport with nowhere to go. Many passengers went to hotels which were already overbooked. I ran out of my medication and was in physical pain for over 24 hours as I was already on my last additional dosage. I could not contact a single person and could not afford to get a different flight or hotel or accommodations, as I am still negative on my credit card bill. This entire issue could have been preventable if we were not A) told we would make our connections (despite an email saying we 'may' miss our flight, B) we were told we could only get our bags once at KEF (half the bags did not even show up) C) received some sort of direction or accommodation (I received not a single message.) D) were informed what flight we would be on the following day (I had to guess and went to the airport hoping I could get on the next flight.) I have screenshots and recordings for every piece of information stated. I have sent over 12 service requests through your portal. I have commented on every social media site and will continue. I have never been so frustrated in my entire life. I am a college student who cannot be out of hundreds of dollars for '6 weeks. Furthermore, I just want a response, with some form of information. This is beyond upsetting and continues to get worse each passing day.

### "staff friendly and kind"
Play is a low-cost airline so the tickets are fairly cheap, BUT the only thing included in the price is one personal item, like backpack which have to fit under the seat in front of you. When you have added extra luggage, the price is not so low anymore. We were a couple traveling to Tenerife from Keflavik with three kids from 5 to 11 years old. I had heard from others that even though all the tickets were bought together, you couldn't be sure that you would be seated together. So I added extra cost by buying seats. The check in process in Keflavik is great! You can choose self-check-in, and then you can also check in your luggage and don't have to wait in line at the desks. The aircraft is pretty basic (and low-cost). There is no tv's or entertainment, WiFi or anything, there are also no USB-ports for charging. Which I knew before, so I fully charged 3 travel chargers and had downloaded some movies on Netflix for the kids. The seats are comfortable and I really liked the foot space compared to other low-cost airlines. The menu on board is pretty basic, I recommend the baguette. The staff was friendly and kind. Overall, the flight experience was good - but Play being a low-cost airline, might reconsider their high prices for any extra luggage. It has been constantly going higher, and if the price in the end is at the same level of other airlines (not low-cost), people will rather go there and get a little extra on board etc. for the same money in the end.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. I’ll never fly with PLAY again. Our return flight on 11 February 2023 from Paris to Baltimore was to have a brief layover in Keflavik, but weather caused a delay. The delay then became a cancellation, which then became a delay again. Our departure went from 1130 to 2230 on Saturday 11 February 2023 as a result. After navigating the options provided to us we decided to accept the delayed departure, but because of the earlier cancellation, we had already booked with PLAY to depart on Sunday 12 February 2023 at 1130. We cancelled our taxi, had begun looking for a hotel near the airport, made arrangements for the care of our minor child who was at home in America, contacted our employers of the change and requested extra time off from work. All of this was for naught when the flight was merely delayed 11 hours. This required us to check out of our hotel, arrange for our luggage to be secured by them, schedule another taxi and spend extra time and money in Paris until the 2230 departure. At no point was an updated itinerary sent with the new time, nor were we sent an electronic boarding pass. Upon checking into CDG airport in Paris we were given our boarding passes to Keflavik, but no information regarding our next flight from Keflavik to Baltimore. No boarding pass, no explanation or departure time, no information from any employee at the PLAY terminal or from the flight crew while in flight or on the ground. We weren’t advised of where to go or what to do next. After landing in Keflavik at approximately 0300, we determined through a search that there is only one flight daily from Keflavik to BWI and the departure time was 1515 hours; an unplanned layover of approximately 12 hours. With no hotel availability, my wife and I spent 12 hours trying to sleep on hard wooden benches with all of our luggage piled around us. After showering, dressing and departing our hotel on Saturday we would now be faced with wearing the same clothes and no chance to shower till we arrived home over 36 hours later. We could not check into our flight from Keflavik to BWI until 1215; so we stayed close to the terminal that airport employees told us would be opened by PLAY personnel eventually. Passengers filled a “roped” off section near the kiosks where the PLAY check-in would take place. An employee told everyone inside the “roped” off area that they would need to move to a different “roped” off section which chicaned to 4-5 PLAY check-in counters. Passengers asked why they couldn’t just stay in the line and go to the counters. Her response was, This is not the line. The line is here, so you’ll have to go to the other line (not quoting, but words to that affect). This caused people to start ducking under the “ropes”, dashing around cordoned off areas into the other area or those of us who were outside to make our way into the designated area. There was no thought or consideration given to those who had been standing patiently waiting for the customer service counters to be opened. The bond female, then left and there we only two booking agents to deal with the throng of passengers waiting to check in. With 4-5 available “counters” there were only two customer service agents working. We were fourth in line and it took us 45 minutes to check in for our flight. Terrible experience, but no I know to never fly with PLAY again.

### "I will never fly them again"
PLAY delayed my luggage for two days. The clothing and incidentals I had to purchase they are trying to kick back as further use. In other words, I was supposed to wear the same underwear, socks, shirt, pants, not brush, my teeth, etc. etc. for 36 hours. They also suggested I should have rented my clothing. Are you kidding me? Additionally, they blamed me for not carrying on a bag (which they would have charged me $50) even though I was checking an empty bag for work I was performing in Iceland the next morning. Are you kidding me? Blame me for checking a bag two hours in advance of a nonstop international flight? They also charge you for water in flight. I will never fly them again. I take pity on anyone who flies them.

### "They kicked us into middle seats"
Not Verified |  Unethical practice, and worst 'customer service' (if you can call it that) ever! We booked tickets to Paris via Iceland, and specifically purchased two aisle seats across from each other. Neither of us wanted to get stuck with a middle seat on a long flight. Play Air switched out the aircraft on the KEF-CDG and CDG-KEF legs, but didn't bother to tell anybody. They kicked us into middle seats, and declined (after several pleas) to refund the money that we paid for the original/specific seats that we had been bumped from. It was near impossible to reach them, as there are no contact phone numbers and/or emails. In addition, though the price seems to be low, they charge a fortune for carry-on bags each way...and even more for checked baggage. Higher than any other airline out there. There was absolutely no way to access any in-flight entertainment whatsoever. No movies, no wi-fi...nothing! Will never fly this airline again.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever. No phone number to call. My flight got cancelled, no help, no refund. Unbelievable

### "passive aggressive and sarcastic"
Not Verified |  Bought 2 tickets. One person couldn’t make it so I changed the name of the passenger for £190. The second passenger couldn’t make it for the same ticket so the ticket was cancelled. PLAY kept the ticket fare for the cancelled ticket however refused to refund the name change fee for a ticket nobody used. When complained they stated this is their terms and conditions, refused to give rationale for their costs and the person dealing with it was passive aggressive and sarcastic. When you insure your tickets read the small print, there aren’t many circumstances when you’ll get your money back.

### "The staff are superb"
Not Verified |  It is a pleasure to fly on Play! This is our second time using this airline to go to Europe. We love it. For me, who is used to U.S. carriers, I find Play a “drama free” airline. We get in line, board, and take off. No unnecessary announcements. Simply a safety demo and some updates from the pilot. The customer has the choice of paying for the upgrades she wants, be it luggage, a seat of her choice, or food onboard. Simple! The staff are superb. I love their red/grey uniforms which look so comfortable. I love that they wear comfortable shoes. They are always friendly and helpful. I don’t need the awful airline meals served by other carriers; I don’t need movies; I don’t need alcohol. I simply want a safe and calm way to travel. That is what Play provides.

### "I will never fly Play again"
One of the most horrible experiences ever. We bought our tickets from Baltimore to Reykjavik in November, picked the seats, bought carryon, paid for priority boarding, etc. we received our confirmation and we went on with our lives. In February I checked our reservation and just on a whim checked the plane and looked at our seats. Turned out they changed the plane and instead of moving our seats they left them. I had to contact play via Facebook messenger (they have no telephones) and asked about the seats. They first answered we had 36e and 36f and 20a and 20b. I had to tell them that 36f and 20a did not exist. They said we can move your seats. So we ended up getting separated. That was problem #1. Problem #2- most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. We had bought the XL leg room. So so so uncomfortable. There are no power charging plugs for the phone. No wifi. No entertainment. The cabin lights are always on so don’t expect to sleep. Everything is a fee, even water. Loading In Reykjavik was a pleasure, they put everyone on a bus (priority boarding and regular boarding) drop you off in front of the plane and make you carry up the baggage with you. All in a single mass. Older and feeble people struggled and had to get help from other passengers because there was not a single Play employee helping all while dealing with 20 degree temperatures with winds. Good times. I will never fly Play again.

### "I’d recommend this airline"
A great flight and value for money as long as you come prepared — buy a carry on or checked bag with your ticket as it is significantly cheaper, bring water and food on board as it isn’t provided for free, download movies to your phone as there is no in flight entertainment, and bring a backup battery as some planes with no charge points. Leg room was excellent without purchasing a seat with extra legroom. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the layover in Iceland was easy and comfortable. Overall, I’d recommend this airline.

### "I will not choose Play again"
Not Verified |  Nickle and dime policy is lame. Charge for water, coffee, to pick a a seat. A carry on bag is a terrible policy. Had I known, I would not have chosen Play to fly. The checked bag prices is excessive. All in all, I spent $250 per person more than the posted price. No in flight tv, no charge ports .. smallest legroom of any airline I’ve flown. Uncomfortable seats. All of this is short sighted business. I will not choose Play again.

### "had an amazing trip"
We had an amazing trip with PLAY for our trip to Reykjavík. The flight was early both ways. The cabin attendants were prompt and nice. The ham and cheese baguette was incredible and white wine was surprisingly very good.

### "We would not fly this airline again"
Economy only flight. Nothing included, not even water on a 5 hour flight. we paid $1000 return for not so economy pricing. Stewardesses had their own supply of liter water bottles which they partook in in front of passengers. They offered a 10% discount when booking but it wouldn’t apply - after a week of emails I was told they’d “run out of offers”. During the flight both ways the stewardesses hang out in front of plane with curtains closed. They block the aisle with a cart so if you need a bathroom you must pull curtain aside and ask them to use facilities. They look very annoyed every time this happens. There were chargers going but not on the return. No WiFi either way in this day and age? Really? You pay for everything other than a purse or back pack. We would not fly this airline again.

### "Excellent price performer"
Excellent price performer. Reclinable seats. New, quiet aircraft. Reasonable baggage fees (just don’t go overweight). No power. Must pay for snacks. No app. No inflight entertainment or power, but that’s fine for the price paid. Crew was friendly and efficient. I would like to see an app for the airline for easier access to tickets.

### "Staff were very attentive"
Wonderful value for the amount paid for ticket. Staff were very attentive. Airplane was immaculate, and everything ran on time. We landed twenty minutes ahead of time.

### "No frills, but friendly"
No frills, but friendly, and on time. Layover in Reykjavik is easy and has great services. Flying our of Newburgh is much more relaxed than other airports in New York. The downside of the Newburgh airport is that there a few good options for food, so pack a sandwich. Plan to fly with Play again.

### "pleased with the airline"
We found Play to be a friendly airline with mainly modern aircraft, crewed by very friendly and laid back personnel. The service was good (Icelandic hot chocolate must be the best), the seating was a bit tight for taller than average flyers,  the check in arrangements were efficient. Overall we were pleased with the airline.

### "horrible in-flight experience"
Just horrible in-flight experience, and not even that cheap. By the time you’re done paying for bags and seats I’m not sure it’s any cheaper, particularly when you consider how much longer it is to fly through Iceland. The planes are so basic - genuinely had better amenities on a greyhound bus. 6 hour flight without even a free glass of water. No power outlets. No in flight entertainment of any type. Boarding is a hot mess - all 4 times. It’s unclear where priority lines are, or who should be boarding and when. And then everyone just boards all at once, with people at the bag putting their bags at the front, which screws up the deplaning. Very poorly organized. Only positive thing I can say is all the flights were on time.

### "happy with all aspects"
This was our first time flying with Play and we are very happy with all aspects of the experience. We will definitely be using Play to fly to some other destinations.

### "seats are too close together"
Not Verified | Staff was great. We landed early on both legs of the trip. The seats are too close together. I am somewhat over weight and could not but the tray table down since it poked me in the belly. You have to pay for all food and water but I was aware of this and planned ahead

### "The seats are not comfortable"
Not Verified |  The trip was okay and the flight on time. They need to service food or at least soda or water in the plane. The seats are not comfortable.

### "too little space between seats"
Not Verified |  Great service and overall experience good, but too little space between seats when the table is down. The flight was shorter then announced so that was a bonus.

### "Everything is by social media"
The flight was on time, the plane appeared new and clean. A lot of space even in economy. Service was courteous and attentive. Overall, a very pleasant surprise. They charge for every single item, but the total price was about 30% cheaper than the alternative. The only negative is that they are not hooked into the TSA-Pre system, fairly minor point in Baltimore. Somehow strange experience in that you have very little interaction with human employees in the process. In Keflavik, you check in your own case, scan it and put it on the conveyor belt yourself. No telephone number to call - Everything is by social media. They do not have in-flight entertainment or wi-fi.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. We would not have missed our flight if online check-in was available the day before but the website kept giving me an error and no one was available at the airport when we got there to check us in so we missed the flight. Most airlines put you on the next available flight but not PLAY! They had nothing to offer but sorry. Had to buy another ticket after spending an extra night in a foreign country. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t have a customer service phone number to call if something goes wrong!

### "customer service was very poor"
Overall PLAY assistance and customer service was very poor. In Boston the assistance at the Boarding Gate was unprofessional. PLAY needed to arrive earlier. They needed to announce what the expectations more clearly, before all the confusion began. Passengers who did not have a red tag on their personal item and carryon needed to bring them up to the desk. Then people were charged $90 for bags that they normally can bring on other airlines as a carryon. The PLAY personnel kept leaving the desk. Passenger became anxious and kept cutting in line to be the next person served. No orderly process. Getting a boarding pass on MyPlay was extremely difficult. Several people asked us if we had as much trouble as they did. The site would need to be accessed several times. It finally worked for the trip from Boston to Keflavik, but not visa versa. I was confused when it asked if I had a check in bag, etc. I paid for it already. Fortunately, I was able to go back on the site and confirm my bag status. The boarding pass final step didn't provide a pass. A popup was shown, but I didn't get to read it. One person should have been available at the PLAY desk in Keflavik. We were not even sure it was the service desk, until security helped us. People want to move on and get through security. Also, at Keflavik we took a bus to the airplane. The priority people didn't get bused separately, so they were just mixed in with the crowd entering the plane. Again, unorganized. In general, the other parts of the trip were good. We left on time and arrived early. The plane staffs was good and Icelandic staff. The checked bags arrived quickly.

### "crew professional and helpful"
Thank you for the cabin crew for making my trip so lovely, I dreaded the layover but both flights were so smooth. The cabin crew was very professional and helpful.

### "planes are as clean as can be"
Brand new Airbus planes that are as clean as can be. Friendly cabin crew and ground staff. The departure time out of Iceland is not the best, but it's understandable that they are given the worst timing slots as being the newcomer on the market.

### "I was harassed several times"
I have a personal item and it fit perfectly into the size. However I was harassed several times about it. One at the check in and then at the boarding. I was the one only being called out in the whole long line.

### "The seats are small"
Online check in is opened 24hr before the flight. The personal baggage is included in the ticket and carry-on luggage requires extra fee. The carry-on luggage would be charged if you didn't pay in advance. The seats are small, even though I am only 170cm tall and I got low back pain after I took a 3 hours flight.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Poor customer service and misleading information regarding baggage carry on. They had us pay 130 usd extra for checkin luggage and made us pay another 60 usd for carry on because you can only carry backpacks!! Very misleading and the airline counter is not even helpful!

### "crew very accommodating"
Not Verified | The crew was very accommodating. Never had to ask for anything. It was nice having drinks and food on board and the food was pretty good.

### "The plane smelled of fish"
We were charged EUR 182 extra for 7 kg over weight luggage. The plane smelled of fish on the way home because the plane was in cargo flight with fish the day before. Our luggage got lost at Keflavik airport for 80 minutes.

### "hope not to fly again with this company"
Not Verified |  The policy in a company should be the same from the beginning. We flew last year with the same cabin luggage and I didn't pay, now from our flight on 20Th February, they charge us 80 euros for the same cabin luggage, and we did pay for the big one. I do hope not to fly again with this company.

### "crew was professional"
The convenience of using New York Stewart was greatly appreciated. Both outbound and inbound flights were on time. The crew was professional and the cabin service was good. Getting an exit row seat on the return was an additional bonus for my 6’4” frame.

### "just too uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Never again will I fly this airline. The seats are uncomfortable and the cabin was so hot I was nauseous. Also, the lack of Wi-Fi on such a long flight is untenable- especially when flying with young children. The staff was lovely but it was just too uncomfortable and expensive for what was offered.

### "very good experience"
Booking and flying with PLAY was very easy and confortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and planes were spot on. Transfer time in Reykjavik was fine and the boarding process smooth. I flew to New York Stewart  which is approx. 90 min. from Manhattan. This is a very small airport and passport control was fast and very friendly. Good connection to Manhattan with a bus service from the airport to Port Authority Bus Terminal. All together very good experience.

### "landed 30 min ahead of schedule which was great"
Not Verified |  Flight on time, even landed 30 min ahead of schedule which was great. One thing to improve - there was no priority boarding from Reykjavik, we are paying for this and basically were boarded last.

### "convenient departure from Paris T3"
Recent plane, friendly staff, convenient departure from Paris T3. Low cost company but fair price. Baggage allowance 20 kg is a bit short when travelling to Iceland in winter with mountain shoes, ice grips.

### "Check in seemed a little confusing"
Not Verified |  Check in seemed a little confusing. I had bought a seat in advance but did not get any priority boarding on either flight. I had to show my passport multiple times to different attendants while standing in line to board. Not very organized. Right before boarding in Boston they announced everyone without a seat number had to line up at the counter to get one. That caused a huge line of people at the same time of boarding. So it delayed our flight. Usually this type of seat assignment happens during initial check in to avoid this delay Outside of the unorganized boarding process, the plane seemed clean, the attendants were friendly. They were sometimes unprofessional flirting and giggling with one another, just not what seems normal from more established airlines.

### "over an hour to check in again"
No way to contact them on short notice. Sent an email over two weeks ago after I was charged 80 euros for my 7 months old trolley. On their website it says clearly that a pram or trolley is included in the babies ticket. They haven't answered even though I sent the email again. Self check in didn't work so we had to wait in line for over an hour to check in again.

### "Play Airlines is truly a budget ride"
Play Airlines is truly a budget ride. The seats are unpadded and thin. Everything has a charge, carry on roller board or checked luggage, etc. The legroom is slightly more than an American carrier. Air is not exchanged very frequently and cabin pressure is not ideal. My ears stayed tight for several days and I had difficulty hearing, not what one wants when they are a musician. Baggage handling isn’t good, so don’t take pricey luggage! On the plus side, the flights arrive either ahead of schedule or on time. If you are looking for the cheapest travel option possible, this is for you.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Very affordable, great cabin crew and smooth flight. Comfortable seat. For a no frills airline they exceeded my expectations.

### "Staff was friendly"
Great service. Our flight had to leave 5 hours before scheduled take-off from Keflavik due to severe winter storms in Iceland. The information and updates from the airline were excellent. The flights went smoothly both from and back to Iceland despite terrible weather conditions. Staff was friendly.

### "crew could use additional training"
Plane was in newer condition but was a stripped down version of any other airbus I’ve flown. No power outlets, screens etc. I understand it’s a budget carrier but power outlets in this day and age seems to be a requirement given no onboard entertainment. I paid the extra $$ to have one of their premium seats with more room but felt it was a waste of money. Overhead bins up front were overtaken by the crew which detracts from paying for a premium seat. Crew was happy and upbeat, but felt they were over staffed with crew standing around and gossiping like high school kids. Another thing to note was the crew was moving around during takeoff and just after takeoff for no obvious reason, which led to several other passengers getting up or going to the restroom, not even 5 minutes after wheels up. I feel the crew could use additional training possibly. I didn’t purchase any food onboard to review. I’m on the fence if I’d ever use them for travel to Europe again.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. There is no legitimate phone number. You can only chat over email and it takes days for a response. My flight was canceled due to weather and I went to pay and confirm my new flight after my first flight was canceled and I was never refunded for my canceled flight. Instead of the customer service being helpful they keep telling me their records are showing me paying for my updated flight before my first flight was cancelled. I sent them documentation and proof that I paid for my new flight after my flight was canceled. Still no reasonable response or investigation on their side. I will never fly with Play again!

### "capable staff"
On time, capable staff, typical fare for a low budget airline. As good as can be expected when flying on a low budget airline.

### "paying for a normal airline in the future"
Not Verified |  I give the overall experience a 4 out of 10. There was no communication between the crew and the guests. Flew a low budget airline and that is exactly how I felt. With all the extra costs, I will be paying for a normal airline in the future.

### "unexplained waiting time in baggage claim"
Not Verified |  OG605, 10.02.2023 Flight on time off gate ALC, ahead of schedule in KEF. Payed for extra leg space, turned out excellent seating. Onboard service normal. At baggage claim in KEF, no passengers from other flights waiting in baggage area, not a single piece of luggage on belt for over one hour. Waiting for luggage is one thing, but receiving no information or explanation can become extremely irritating. The unexplained waiting time in baggage claim definitely affected the value of the excellent experience during flight.

### "I would avoid PLAY if possible"
I would avoid PLAY if possible. The flights are slightly cheaper, but have no backup. We were flying from Boston to Paris and within hours of takeoff (we were at the airport), PLAY delayed our flight by 1 hour, then 3 hours, then emailed saying there was no food aboard for our flight, then cancelled our connecting flight. The delay was due to their crew/planes, not weather. They gave us the option of arriving over 24 hours later (missing out on a chunk of vacation, car rental, AirBNB, etc). Customer service has no phone number and your options are messaging through WhatsApp/Messenger (took 20+ minutes to respond) or a non-urgent email reply. There was no one at the gate and the check-in people said they had no access to the system to change anything and had no supervisor. For the flight back, online check-in was not functioning, so they had a line of hundreds of people and two clerks trying to get boarding passes. If you want to get somewhere as cheaply as possible and have incredibly flexible travel schedule and easily refundable activities/lodging, I could see this as an option for you. I don't intend to fly it again

### "I enjoyed the flights"
Good leg room. Good space under seat for personal item. Better space than TAP or Vueling. I like that the seats recline. The attendants were very good. The pilot gave good information. My only problem was that one male flight attendant unlocked the toilet door at the front of the airplane while I was in it. I think that he was concerned, but I wasn't in there very long. Overall I enjoyed the flights with Play.

### "This company is a joke"
Not Verified |  Where to start? The entirety of the customer service and stewardess crew are completely incompetent. When asked if a visa was needed, we were told no. We scanned our passports in Boston, was told to board and so we did. Wouldn't you now it? My wife was denied access to the country and we were forced onto the next flight back into the US. We waited around the service desk for 3 hours before being "helped" by the rudest customer service associate I've ever dealt with, and I worked in retail for many years. We were told the flight was full and that we could not sit together. That was a lie. We were told we didn't need a visa and allowed to board. That was a lie. We were told the food and drinks were out on the flight. That was a lie. I saw multiple people served and they never came back out again to finish up after turbulence had started. When I asked for some water they replied "we will be landing soon, just wait. Soon was 90 minutes. No legroom, no service, impossible to get in touch with customer service as there is no number. Attempts to chat online had my chats prematurely disconnected and then berated because I needed to be patient. I asked 4 questions that took 45 minutes to be answered. Avoid this airline like the plague. Honestly unfathomable that they can even will be in business. Don't forget! It might seem cheap! But then you pay for every single piece of baggage, including carry on, have to pay for every seat selection, etc. You're better off spending a bit more money and flying Icelandair. This company is a joke and should be treated like one.

### "crew were very friendly"
As good as it gets at the price. Captain and the crew were very friendly and helpful during our flight. My second time flying with Play and will recommend this airline to everyone.

### "30hr delay"
Not Verified |  30hr delay, followed by a gate change after everyone already started to enter the gate. Then after we landed their was a 30 min wait on the ground due to miscommunication with air traffic control.

### "wide seats and ample leg room"
The plane was quite comfortable with wide seats and ample leg room. I prefer Play’s planes that I’ve flown 6 times so far over the more compact seating. The overhead compartment is also nice and large. I would like a hard cider on the menu but I have had canned soda and a canned vodka seltzer drink. The soda was flat but the vodka seltzer was really good. The crew is very pleasant. Our flight back to BWI was moved up due to weather and it was very windy. There was a minor maintenance item that held us up for 10-15 minutes and then we rocked our way into the sky. I don’t mind that there are no seat screens or power outlets. I downloaded my own movies and used my phone and own headphones on the plane.

### "a pleasant experience*
Not Verified |  I flew Play in December 22 to Paris from Boston. What a pleasant experience. No delays friendly staff and ahead of time arrival in Iceland and Paris. No issues with luggage. The best part for me was clearing customs in Iceland so I avoided the long lines at major hubs. I will definitely fly Play again.

### "what a great new airline"
Not Verified |  What a great airline! Very spartan, no free amenities, you pay for anything humble that you eat or drink. No blankets, no pillows, no movies, no mini screen just for you, no wifi. (Very comfortable seats though). No nothing you are used to (and pay through the nose for) on regular airlines. But wow, what a great new airline. First time I have had young, attractive, friendly, helpful flight attendants (males and females). They wear red. They are cheerful. Not one unpleasant self-centred passengers on my trips. The airline is based in Iceland and the PLAY planes are red. Bright red all over. $404 dollars for a roundtrip ticket to Spain. For that kind of cost I have no problem bringing my own sandwiches and soft drinks into the plane. We had a lot of heavy turbulence in January flying over the Atlantic but the captain explained about the wind and current flows and assured us we were not going to die. I can't say enough good things about this airline and I have travelled all over the world for years and years. I used to fly Pan Am a lot so you can assume I am no spring chicken when it comes to flying. I hope PLAY stays a guarded secret (but successful) by those of us who have experienced it. In other airlines we would all have been treated like riff-raff in the back of the plane. Thank you PLAY and see you again soon. My flight number was MOY45B, but I am home now and certainly didn't SAVE my boarding passes or any other ephemera of the journey. I am sending this review anyway because this is a great new airline.

### "Would definitely fly again"
Pros: great price, comfortable plane, nice staff, great flight (safe + on time). Cons: Online check-in unavailable for certain flights. Ground organization can be a bit flaky, must get there in time: last minute terminal change at CDG, last minute gate change at Keflavik. Would definitely fly again.

### "not extra Legroom seats"
Not Verified |  Mostly favourable. However I have now on three occasions booked and paid for extra legroom seats but when seats have been allocated they are not extra Legroom seats. As neither the confirmation 'mail nor booking summary show extra legroom seats paid for, it has been difficult to prove such to cabin crew. Likewise, online check in seems to be somewhat fraught as I receive instructions to do Online check in etc and then get a message to say this passenger is unable to undertake online check in but to present myself with ALL documents (including ESTA) to Airport check-in. Upon doing just that, present myself to Airport check-in, ALL that I am asked for is my passport as they already have all of my information detail. etc.

### "Everything good apart from seat comfort"
Everything good apart from seat comfort (too thin/hard). Generous seat pitch and reclining seats, unlike some other low cost carriers. Only one delay, from BWI to KEF, but still arrived on time.

### "all the flights were on time"
Not Verified |  Everything was good, all the flights were on time, the space in the plane was very good. The service on board also good. The bags came out unharmed and the pilot handled the plane very well.

### "customer service re lost luggage was very poor"
19 Jan 2023: The outbound flight to Iceland was as expected. On time with no delays. However, my luggage did not arrive. Airport staff in Iceland were friendly, helpful and courteous. It was extremely difficult to get updates on missing luggage after leaving airport and this was frustrating. I had all my belongings in the checked in bag and didn't know if I could purchase some new essentials. I didn't want to pay for extra luggage allowance on return trip if my luggage did arrive and no communications were received from the airline in relation to this. After 3 days, my luggage still had not arrived so I had to purchase essentials. 23 Jan 2023: Return flight was delayed by 4 hours, but we did receive notification the night before of this possible delay. 25 Jan 2023: I am now back in Ireland and I received notification that my luggage has arrived in Iceland even though it was clearly stated on the lost luggage report that I was returning home on 23 Jan 2023. Overall Flights were ok, but customer service re lost luggage was very poor. When packing for Iceland, I really needed the contents that were in my luggage.

### "Very spacious for a budget airline"
Lovely staff, lovely aircraft. Very spacious for a budget airline, really enjoyed my flight. Cabin crew were very polite and the airport staff very efficient and quick.

### "Rated highly, especially for value"
Rated highly, especially for value. Flew twice, Boston to Reykjavik then return in January 2023. No issues with plane, weather, delays, staff. Inconsistencies to note: 1) on flight into KEF the seat/legroom was uncomfortable in middle seat (I am of above average height/weight), but return flight to BOS appeared to have more legroom and was very comfortable. 2) arrival into KEF disembarked into a climate-controlled gangway attached to the terminal, but departure from KEF included a bus ride on tarmac and onboarding outside to include climbing stairs into plane.

### "miserable, robotic and cold"
These cheap fools don't offer anything to passengers; no charging outlets, no behind the seat entertainment centers, no flight progression. Not even paid wifi. They didn't provide complementary water or snacks. Such a basic, garbage plane for a ridiculously expensive ticket price tag. The flight attendants were miserable, robotic and cold; not friendly whatsoever. One of them seemed to get her kicks from being a power trip. Also, regarding my luggage- they left my luggage outside, in the pouring rain, and the contents were soggy and smelly. I've flown a lot of different airlines and this one is, by far, the worst.

### "This airline is a nightmare"
This airline is a nightmare. My brother booked a flight, paid for it, got an email the morning of to check in and then got to the airport and there was no flight and no one to help him. We were unable to do anything other than Whatsapp the airline help desk (no phone number no email) which was a bot. Never using play again. I recommend staying far far away from them.

### "they assigned us row 30"
Everything was fine, except that we paid for the seat and they assigned us row 30, I wanted to change the seat to have him in front and if I did, they would charge me money again. What's the point of paying for the seat and not being able to change it? Todo bien, excepto que pagamos por el asiento y nos asignaron fila 30, quise cambiar el asiento para tenerlo delante y si lo hacía volvían a cobrarme dinero. Que sentido tiene pagar por el asiento y no poder cambiarlo?

### "simply haughty and cold"
The hostesses are simply haughty and cold, I've never seen that. At the checkin point, at Keflavik airport, they don't say hello, look me up and down, I said hello to her twice, she didn't answer me. I find that unacceptable.

### "Unpleasant check in process"
Not Verified |  Unpleasant check in process, waited in line for about an hour without telling us anything, after updating their boarding terminal very last minute so everyone had to run to the other terminal in Paris. And I've never needed to check in again for a connecting flight in such a short connecting time, not sure why Play had everyone do that.

### "Very frustrating experience"
The check in terminal shown on the website was wrong and in a large airport such as CDG, this took us extra 20 minutes to get to the correct terminal, almost making us miss our flight. Very frustrating experience.

### "unhappy about the mix up with seats"
Happy with the flight and service on board but super unhappy about the mix up with seats that I paid for and just realised myself that we were spread all over the plain although I paid 42.000 isk for the seats. They did not give me any refund for the hassle although I had to be the one contacting them for fixing it, I did not sit with the person I wanted on the way back and I was unhappy about that because I paid all this amount for it. Not well done.

### "Bad customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline is about taking as much money as they can from customers and not about providing a pleasant experience for customers. I'd rather pay more money with regular airline companies such as Delta, United, Emirates, British Airways and get entertainment, food, the ability to charge my phone. While in Iceland, we de-planed onto a very icy tarmac and a female passenger fell. No consideration for the elderly traveling who are unable to climb steps to enter plane. Bad customer service.

### "streamlined and no-frills airline"
PLAY is a great value and I would fly with them again if the price was still quite a bit lower than other options. It is streamlined and no-frills airline. Don't expect wifi, in seat outlets, or free drinks. Do expect a safe and efficient experience. All four of my flights departed on time and arrived early. There was ample overhead storage, comfortable seats, and friendly crew. KEF is a pleasure to connect through; I had an extremely fast customs experience and there is a delightful mini-market style food option. There seemed to be a hitch with boarding in BOS with getting the jetway connected but the crew got everyone boarded in minutes. One thing that I wish I had known was that it is difficult to look out the emergency exit row window, so don't expect to enjoy the view.

### "Check-in at both airports was very bad"
Not Verified |  Everything excellent except the attention at the counters. Check-in at both airports was very bad. In Madrid the flight was delayed and they made us stand in line for almost an hour among the people who circulated through the airport. In Reykjavík we arrived 65 minutes before the departure time and in a very bad way they told us that they had closed the check-in and they did not want to check our suitcase. Finally they did it reluctantly. Todo excelente menos la atención en mostradores. En ambos aeropuertos el check in fue muy malo. En Madrid se demoró el vuelo y nos hicieron hacer una cola de casi una hora entre medio de la gente que circulaba por el aeropuerto. En Reykjavík llegamos 65 minutos antes del horario de salida y de muy mal modo nos dijeron que habían cerrado el check in y no nos querían despachar la maleta. Finalmente lo hicieron a desgano.

### "offered hotel for those in need"
Fantastic experience. Inbound flight got cancelled due to crazy weather in Iceland. Within 60 minutes, Play had organised a new flight 2 days later to get all stranded passengers to Iceland in time for Christmas. Plus, offered hotel for those in need - and you could choose yourself via Play hotel booking system. On travel day, flight was on time. And flight back was even 50min early landing. I will continue my frequent travels with you.

### "boarding was extremely unorganized"
Not Verified |  The boarding experience was extremely unorganized and unpleasant. It took way too long. We were treated like cattle like in a coral with no regard to Covid.

### "Good airline for the price"
Good airline for the price. No cancellations, good space on the flight- however there is no usb outlets and I wish that water was included on flights. However, for a budget friendly airline, it’s a great choice.

### "I must pay for my hand bag"
Not Verified |  From Dublin the flight was very good, the crew since the check-in was kind and friendly. I could not make my check-in on line, and they were very helpful. However, in Keflavik the staff checking passports asked in very rude way that I must pay for my hand bag. I was very surprised because no one in Dublin asked me for it. How after one flight I should pay for that. Never happened to me even in Ryanair. It was shame, he was very rude. (22nd Dec Dublin - Iceland - New York)

### "the worst airline experience"
We had the worst airline experience we’ve ever had on Play - false advertising of “free” lap infants, websites that don’t work, a bag lost for our whole trip, and no real staff to speak with - only “handling agents” who work for other companies and robot chat auto responses. I assumed I could add my infant at in-person check-in but it took a whole hour and we had to pay fees equivalent to 1/3 of our adult ticket price. When sent the payment link, it was asking me to log in and didn’t have an option to create an account. It finally worked when I used a different internet browser - only to find when I got home that we were charged twice! We made our flight just in time (only because they boarded late and the ticketing agent escorted us through security) but our checked bag never made it to our destination. Upon arrival, we and 2 other families from our flight were missing bags and there was no one at the London Stansted airport to help us. Another airline’s agent tried and directed us to the online lost baggage form, which was not accepting any of our flight numbers. Finally, mine worked but the other 2 families had to fill out a paper form. A few days after arrival I received a text that my bag was found and being sent to the airport - and that status remained unchanged until I got to the airport to go home a week later. I got useless responses from a WhatsApp bot and never heard back on the email I sent, until after I had returned from my trip. My brand new bag (now damaged) had been at the arrival airport for a few days but the online status system was never updated to reflect that and I never received the email that the manager said she sent me. And the bag was certainly not delivered to my local address as the form said it would. Even after we collected the bag for the return flight, the status of the lost bag (on route but not yet delivered to the airport) was unchanged. For a week my toddler and I went without any of our clothes and without his medicines. It was incredibly frustrating to not have any real person to speak with. I don’t know how an airline can operate without staff in their airports and rely on robot communication and websites that don’t work. This airline has not invested the human and technology resources they need to support their customers. The in-flight experience also sucks. I don’t expect the world from a budget airline but £3 for a tiny bottle of water and row screens that only show the flight status (that I could never interpret) was a huge bummer. The only positive were the flight attendants, who were very accommodating of our toddler.

### "roomy seats for most of the flights"
Wonderful service, roomy seats for most of the flights, love the flight attendants’ outfits! It would be helpful to at least offer water for free and a way to plug in our phones. Wifi would be helpful.

### "you definitely get what you pay for"
Cheapest ticket like half the price of other airlines but you definitely get what you pay for. For an international flight, no food or beverage offered except with purchase and obviously onboard pricing is 3x normal. A couple delays and thankfully connections were with them too so it wasn't a problem. So if you don't mind a little discomfort and being nickelled and dimed for the small conveniences that are courtesy in other airlines, then go for it.

### "Great airport assistance"
Not Verified | A wonderful flight to Iceland! The flight crew were friendly and experienced! The flight departed and arrived on time. Great airport assistance was provided for my disabled son by assisting us through the airport all the way to the aircraft! Would certainly fly with Play in the future!

### "all went smoothly"
My trip from the day I bought the tickets online, checked on line, and flew, all went smoothly. The flight reached Dublin 30 mins ahead of schedule! I would fly again with Play.

### "Totally not enjoyable"
Not Verified | Totally not enjoyable. Having to walk out into the rain and cold to board a plane is ridiculous. And first having to take a bus out to the plane is even more ridiculous. Stand a hallway packed for 10. Minutes did not add any enjoyment! The bus packed with people body to body was a thrilling experience as well. How could anyone enjoy that! There is plenty more criticism but I think you got to idea.

### "definitely fly with them again"
The trip was great and the crew on the plane was very good they were friendly and they were really nice to us the whole trip with the airline was great. We will definitely fly with them again.

### "I won’t be using you again"
Boston to Keflavik return. Check in was easy at Boston, typically not the case for Logan. Flight was on time, boarding was average as it’s busy. Landed early in Iceland, the big issue was that our checked Delsy spinner suitcase had 2 of its 4 wheels broken off, and a hole in the bottom corner where the wheel was. No one in the airport from play to log a claim for the suitcase, and trying customer service via e messenger resulted in me getting an apology for the slow response on January 1, I logged the message on 27 December. Return flight I tried to contact PLAY  but no personnel till boarding and I had checked the broken bag via your automated system. No one in Boston from PLAY to report further damage to the suitcase. The flights were fine, you need new baggage handlers. I won’t be using you again, useless customer service, bad ground services.

### "nightmare of the booking process"
Given the nightmare of the booking process, I fully expected to show up at the Baltimore Airport to find I'd been "Played. Thankfully, all my flights went without a hitch. Not so with the booking process and some of the fee practices are borderline deceptive. I'm writing so others can make an informed decision on whether or not to use this airline. For some, it will be worth it; others, definitely not. Despite my frustrating experience, I actually want Play to thrive, so I hope they sort the kinks out! I'm a frequent international traveler and found Play's booking process an exasperating experience, beginning with the cancellation insurance. It only applies to medical emergencies which isn't readily disclosed. In addition, I only selected it for the outgoing flight, but it charged me for both and there was no way to reverse it. My carryon bag was somehow misapplied to the wrong flight and when it was fixed, I was double charged. IF you need to work with customer service, gird your loins. There simply isn't a way to communicate directly with a person. They do have a "Bot" where you communicate your issue and you get a subsequent email reply. (For me, it was always the next day (invariably "Beth," most likely A.I. as well, with the typical "no" response). An example of the seemingly deceptive fees: The cancellation insurance, you can't add it after you make the booking, but you can't get the details while you're making the booking. Per "Beth," you can read about the details of the insurance "by going to our website before booking your flights. How is the customer supposed to know something that specific in advance? And if you go to the Play website, there isn't an obvious category to research the details. When I needed to change my flight (which is why I bought the cancellation insurance in the first place), I was informed of a change fee, but when I received the new statement, the itemized charges including the change fee didn't add up to the statement total, which was $122 higher than the itemized charges directly above it! (These are probably the "hidden fees" mentioned in a previous review. Bottom line, I ended up paying $815 roundtrip for my flight from Baltimore to Paris with a base fee of $372. This was with a checked bag, a carryon and an upgraded seat for one leg of the flights. This sounds expensive and it might not be worth it for many. However, the reason I was excited about this airline was the fact that, if you're older or have physical issues that make long distance travel difficult, it can be extremely expensive booking an upgraded seat on a major carrier. With Play, a seat with extra legroom can cost as little as $36 per flight. Plus, the short stopover in Iceland allows one to stretch their legs for a bit. If you have a very basic booking and there aren't any issues requiring customer service, you'll probably be happy with this discount airline. If you need anything beyond the standard scenario, you might want to save yourself the headache and go elsewhere. As for me, I decided to work with my credit card company and dispute the double charges. Trying to get anything resolved with Play is a total waste of time, so save yourself the frustration. (And yes, the seats are a bit hard, but I bought a small thermarest type cushion at the Rejkavik airport and that did the trick!)

### "Perfectly fine for a budget airline"
Perfectly fine for a budget airline, with friendly staff and a okay selection of snacks and drinks. One thing I do wish is if they had plant milk (preferably Oatly) when ordering a hot drink, most budget airlines offer this now and was a bit disappointed when they didn’t have any.

### "plane was relatively new"
Keflavik to Paris. Very good overall service - outbound flight on time, return flight delayed due to snow storm but very good communication. The plane was relatively new and comfortable - I purchased seats in the first 10 rows and had a lot of leg room. Food choices not that wide but most people buy food before. Crew attentive.

### "We loved our experience"
The crew was warm and accommodating and so pleasant to be around. My wife and I brought our two young kids with us, our 2 year old was not thrilled about being forced to sit for take off and landing. The crew went above and beyond and had more patience for our kids than we expected. We loved our experience with PLAY and we would certainly fly with them again.

### "I would fly PLAY again"
My family and I flew roundtrip on Play from Boston to Paris on 12/20 and 12/29. Play's performance exceeded my expectations, given what I have read about air travel of late. The preflight check-in process was easy and quick, including adding and paying for a couple of carry-on items that I had not included when I first bought our tickets. The check-in and in-flight staff were friendly and efficient. Every leg of our trip was on time, and switching from one plane to another in Reykjavik was simple and stress-free. The best part of the experience was that our last leg home to Boston arrived 40 minutes early, allowing us to walk out of the airport, having gone through customs and grabbing a checked-in bag five minutes before our scheduled landing! I would fly PLAY again without hesitation.

### "I will not recommend"
Not Verified |  I have not yet traveled but had to pick a date of travel. My Feb 15th 2023 outbound flight was canceled by Play on 11/29, via email sent to me. I requested the full trip refund option following Play's process, and have had no response to this, which is rather alarming given the cost of the flight and the fact that the airline caused the cancelation. On the Play website, there is no information about a canceled flight - all appears on schedule. Very poor customer service from an airline I had hoped to take advantage of for the first time. I will not recommend and will need to take more aggressive action if I do not receive a prompt response.

### "offers everything one needs"
Great airline, offers everything one needs. Very efficient and friendly staff and service on board is great. Very good quality food and drinks onboard. Kevlavik airport is easy to navigate because of its size. Can recommend all aspects of the trip.

### "why ask for proof and then ignore it?"
Not Verified | Their on the ground rep in Iceland bullied to us and forced us to pay for personal items, insisted it was carry on baggage. An extra 120 euro charge for something we didn't need, we were permitted to fly out with the same bags but charged on the way back! and we weren't the only people. We contacted Play regarding this and they asked for proof my bags were within their guidelines. I sent photos with a measuring tape against the bags which showed I wasn't wrong. They completely ignored the evidence provided and told me that they trust their staff to carry out checks. If this was the case, why ask for proof and then ignore it? I've since filed a chargeback!

### "not an airline worth booking with"
We arrived 6 hours early and was told that all flights were cancelled and that they would try for the next day, but all of the flights were booked for the rest of the week so it wasn't possible for us to get it rebooked or to get to our destination without spending an extra $2000 on top of the refund we are now getting. We didn't get any notifications, was told that if we book by third party they would notify the third party. We called the third party, the third party had no idea of what we were talking about. We even checked the flight schedule as we went to the airport as well, and it showed that it was on time. Had we been notified before, it would have all been fine, we wouldn't have to currently scramble for what we are doing the next week. There was no communication, we wasted a car rental, an additional hotel room on top of the other hotels we already had reserved in Iceland that could have been cancelled with refunds had we been notified. The lack of communication coupled with the fact you can't even get a real representative without going through the weird puffin AI agent is enough to tell me that this is not an airline worth booking with, and if anything, it is better spent at another airline where actual people work at, and can talk with you, is worth whatever extra cost it may be (and let me assure you I highly doubt the price differential will be as much as it has been for us to make sure that we have a place to stay especially since it is Christmas.

### "completely unreliable"
Not Verified | Canceled the flight 12h before take-off and 4 days before Christmas. Did not offer any alternatives apart from a full refund. Do not book / travel with them, completely unreliable. No cabin luggage, no food, no entertainment. Fly with united or any other but not with them!

### "completely abandoned us in Paris"
Not Verified |  Never ever again. They completely abandoned us in Paris with no options and no one from the airline to talk to. Luckily I know my way around France and secured another flight on an amazing airline French Bee to Newark and had my husband drive 6 hrs to pick me up. I felt terrible for those that didn’t have other options. It is not worth the savings unless you have total flexibility and don’t care if you have no one to help you during a cancellation.

### "This airline did me wrong"
I was stranded at the airport in Berlin because Play simply canceled my Dec 18th 2022 flight to Reykjavik and on to Boston, as I was standing in front of their ticketing office on the 18th, two hours before the flight was to leave. They said "Sorry, we will reimburse you the price of the ticket. This is simply unprofessional. A decent airline would have rerouted me on another of their own or another airline's flights to get me to Boston. Because of this unprofessional airline, I am stranded in Germany and unable to return home for Christmas. The alternative would be to book a last minute flight on another airline for a huge cost. It is this kind of selfish and stingy behavior that leads to fly-by-night operations like Play Airlines developing a bad reputation. You might think you are saving money by flying a cheapo airline, but they are cheap in all senses. They do not care about you at all. You cannot even call them and talk to a human being. You get stuck talking to a chatbot. This airline did me wrong, and I am angry at them. I booked my ticket in May 2022 to fly back in December for Christmas. You get what you pay for. That is for sure.

### "about as bare-bones as it gets"
Not Verified |  The most disorganized airplane experience I’ve ever been on. The first flight (Stewart to Keflavik) was delayed two hours, and when we asked if we would be able to make our connecting flight to Berlin, they said that it was a domino effect that would delay that flight too. Well little did we know our flight would be delayed 5 hours due to Keflavik’s inept handling of de-icing. The lady at the gate said that she was receiving “wrong information all day”. The in-flight experience on Play is about as bare-bones as it gets. No outlets to charge phones, no in-flight wifi, cramped seats. The flight attendants on the connecting flight had the gall to charge passengers for refreshments even after having us packed like sardines on a bus on the tarmac while waiting to board the plane for hours. Would strongly advise against ever flying on this dogshit airline.

### "Terrible airline"
Terrible airline, canceled our flight without a notice. At the airport the person didn't know what was going on. Never will use this airline again. Please be aware of bad airline, and bad service.

### "This is a bare bones airline"
Not Verified |  Not a great airline. It needs a lot of improvement. At its hub of Keflavik, their ground staff service is negligible. As a deaf passenger, I could not get help while my flight was delayed. It changes gates twice so I had to scramble looking for a ground staff to assist me. Also ground staff didn’t wear uniforms including the security personnel air KEF airline which made my experience with PLAY airline really uncomfortable and confusing. I got mistreated by the PLAY security personnel - I couldn’t understand their questions so I asked them to write their questions on paper. Guess what - they refused and sent me to a secondary security in a small room farther away from the gate D15. It was so disrespectful of PLAY to approach like that to a person with hearing loss being sent somewhere in the airport only just because they didn’t want to write questions. The food menu is limited and have to pay for food. I would prefer complimentary meals and alcohol drinks so better to go for Icelandair. No flight entertainment. No Wi-Fi. No power outlets. This is a bare bones airline. Add a few things and hire more staff and put them on uniforms - it shall improve or else, this airline will face a demise like its predecessor, WOW airline. As a disability advocate from the United States, it gets a grade F for lack of consideration and sensitivity to a deaf person like me.

### "the new meals are really bad"
The service is good. The plane was older than the one that we flew into Tenerife. The one to Tenerife had better seats and space but the one returning to KEF was very uncomfortable even though we were in the same seats. We have flown with Play 4 or 5 times and the new meals are really bad (in the red boxes) compared to the previous ones (grilled ham and cheese used to be in a plastic bag or different container). The ones in the red box taste like they are freezer burned or like the cardboard box. We ate both the ham and cheese and pizza and it was not good.

### "Flight eventually cancelled with no explanation"
Not Verified |  Awful service. Flight eventually cancelled with no explanation, after waiting for more than an hour. Before cancellation, I asked their ground staff what the problem was but he said we’d address any concerns for connecting flights when we arrived in Iceland. He said he didn’t know anything about any sort of delay or cancellation policy and said he didn’t have a manager. Later, when the flight was confirmed cancelled, I asked him another question and he directed me to his manager. So, a liar.

### "not even given a water to drink"
We sat in the plane for 2 hours after 2 hours delay and not much information. And were not even given a water to drink. There was not enough water for everybody.

### "There was plenty of room"
Flight departed and arrived according to schedule. There was plenty of room in front of the seats although we did not pay for it extra. Stewards were helpful and positive. In the end of the flight captain even announced results of World Cup football games that finished while we were in the air. The plane cabin looked clean and neat, toilets were in a good condition.

### "charged an extra $61 to have my luggage"
Not Verified |  The flights were cheap and the stewardesses were very polite, no issues there. But no meals on the flight and having to be charged for a coffee. Not good. Plus on the return home I was charged an extra $61 to have my luggage included. This was not charged to me on the outbound flights. And no one had said anything to me about this extra charge. The 9nly thing that would make me even think about booking another flight with this airline is a courtesy refund of that charge. Even then with no meals or refreshments offered I'd still be reluctant.

### "stewards were pleasant and professional"
Not Verified |  We never would have gone to Ireland were it not for the fantastic prices at PLAY Airlines. Expecting to be crammed into the aircraft, we were surprised by the roomy legroom in rows 6 and 7. The stewards were pleasant and professional. In fact, everyone we encountered was doing their best to make our trip wonderful! Our connection to Dublin was delayed three times (8 hours total layover) due to illness. We weren’t left in the dark, but were contacted several times to keep us informed. We appreciated the updates. My only complaint is that I bought our return tickets without paying for our third carry on bag. I thought saying we had 3 bags going to Ireland meant I would have 3 bags coming back. We were hit with a huge charge at the airport on our way home. My mistake, but I will be more careful next time! By the way, the planes looked brand new, and the pilots were skilled!

### "icy cold cabin temperature"
Not Verified |  In general, the two connecting flights were OK. The plane for the second flight was roomier; both planes were clean and minimally equipped. What was notable and unfortunate, a first for me, was the icy cold cabin temperature, especially for the Iceland-Boston stretch. The cabin was very cold, the floor still colder. I just returned from Boston to Berlin, the same airline and route, and I did not freeze. The temps were moderate and comfortable. There is something about that journey over.

### "my flight to and from was smooth"
Not Verified |  Overall my flight to and from was smooth. My only dislike was that my return flight was cancelled and caused me to cut my trip short. I asked for other times for the same day or the day before and I was emailed a new itinerary leaving a day early and no other info/conversation. I wish I could have spoken with someone to iron out the details but customer service is only by email. Unfortunately, it seems like it was only one return flight a day so I had to stick with leaving early. Also no wifi on the way plane

### "Nice, comfy, on time"
Not Verified | Nice, comfy, on time. Food can be purchased onboard. Would suggest to supply passengers at least a one bottle of water per customer since it’s a long overseas flight.

### "pay €60 for carrying a small bag"
I am writing to you because of my anger and disappointment with PLAY. Yesterday, December 5th, I took a flight to Madrid (Spain) from Keflavík (Iceland). When boarding, they force me to pay €60 for carrying a small bag with souvenirs that I had bought in the country and at the airport, in addition to my 10Kg carry-on bag. It seems to me an abusive charge that if they do not discount me I will proceed with legal measures to solve this joke. I should not have proceeded with the payment, but I had no choice but to do so, otherwise they would not let me fly. Other passengers, like me, suffered from this deception. It seems to me a shame the excessive amount that they made us pay. It was the first time I had flown with this company and I won't do it again. I find it embarrassing. Les escribo dado mi enfado y decepción con la compañía aérea flyplay. Ayer día 5 de diciembre tome un vuelo dirección Madrid (España) desde Keflavík (Islandia). A la hora de embarcar me obligan a pagar 60€ por llevar una bolsa de pequeñas dimensiones con souvenir que había comprado en el país y aeropuerto a parte de mi maleta de mano de 10Kg. No debí proceder con el pago, pero no me quedo más remedio que hacerlo, sino no me dejaban volar. Otros pasajeros al igual que yo, sufrieron este engaño. Me parece una vergüenza el importe tan excesivo que nos hicieron pagar. Era la primera ver que volaba con esta compañía y no lo volveré a hacer. Me parece vergonzoso.

### "Very kind and professional"
Great service, I wasn’t feeling well (dehydrated because I had been traveling all day) - flight attendant immediately knew what was wrong and took care of the problem, offering a soda and sugar. Very kind and professional. November 23, 2022 6:15 pm flight from Boston to Iceland

### "Would definitely fly again with Play2"
Not Verified | Was skeptical at first but decided to try Play Airlines as we were not checking luggage. All reservations are done on line and a little disconcerting not to have the ability to talk to a real person. Completed booking, check in was a bit strange as both times they requested more information but if start over, it went through. Airport personnel were friendly and efficient. The flights were comfortable and crew very helpful. Would definitely fly again with Play! Love their red coats and jackets!

### "told to pay extra for my personal luggage"
Not much leg room, you can't tilt the seats stuffy. I was scammed when boarding the plane and told to pay extra for my personal luggage. I didn't receive the bill.

### "good leg space, seats comfortable"
This was a good flight. I had good leg space, seats comfortable and the airplane was clean. Service was good and we was on time. The drawback was that I was not able to check in online and that you have a huge additional cost from advertised price, (choosing seat, hand luggage etc.)

### "didn’t need to be as rude as she was"
One of the stewardess was visibly stressed because the flight was leaving late. However she didn’t need to be as rude as she was, talking to passengers who couldn’t get to our seats because of other passengers and lack of overhead storage space quite rudely and insisting in us doing things that weren’t possible, like storing a big bag under the seats and then getting angry when told it didn’t fit. Unnecessary behavior even if she was stressed out.

### "They dont help in anything"
Be careful with the luggage, we paid per 12kg carry on by mistake, we tried to change it and just add 1000kr to pay the 20kg checked, and they didn't help us, so we need to pay again for the 20kg. They dont help in anything, with something very simple, just pay 1000kr more and change the product. I understand other situations that people blame the company and they cant do anything, I respect and understand that. But something so simple and they just ignored. Very disappointed with customer service online and at  the desk. Workers aren't guilty, but the company must help with simple things which have simple solutions.

### "Quite frankly, shocking behavior from Play employees"
Horrible experience! I tried to check in online the night before, but it wouldn't let me. It repeatedly said I'd have to check in at the airport. It was a connection flight, so I tried to do so at a Play desk in the airport I was in before. They said they couldn't. I flew to the London Airport I was supposed to fly from on Play. My plane got in about 10 minutes late but I still had almost an hour before the next flight. I ran to the Check in desk and was met with a girl who was on a personal phone call and gave me the one moment sign. She continued talking for almost 5 minutes before I had to interrupt her. I told her my situation and she said it was too bad and I was too late. The plane was still at the gate. I had no bags. I told her I was initially only 5ish mins late before her conversation. She insulted me on the phone to her friend and basically ignores me. When I told a chat rep this story they basically shrugged and told me too bad. They wouldn't even help me find another flight! Or put me on their next one the next day. I missed my cousins funeral because of this. I've never had a bad experience with an airline before. Quite frankly, shocking behavior from Play employees.

### "Everything fine and smooth"
Everything fine and smooth. Normal plane. Kind crew. Not many PA announces (not one annoying). We arrived nearly an hour ahead of time in one of the flights.

### "highly organized and extremely efficient"
This was a low-budget trip, highly organized and extremely efficient. The only downside was the PLAY website where you could not add seats (if you had not already chosen them) or add a cancellation fee.

### "staff were very courteous"
I really enjoyed flying PLAY because of its punctuality and customer satisfaction. The staff were very courteous and professional. Although the seats in the airplane were not too comfortable, we did enjoy the extra leg rooms. I just wish they would add more cushion to the seats. PLAY  offers great value.

### "it’s very comfortable"
For being a low cost airline it’s very comfortable, the aircrew is very friendly, everything in general was really good, the only thing I had a problem with was I bought a extra luggage that I did not use I was only asking to use that credit to instead buy a seat and they refused too. I think that after expending extra money they should be more flexible and help their passengers, not let them feel you are stealing from us and the only thing that matters is get more money from us, that made me mad and prefer other airlines with less restrictions not caring they are more expensive, they will treat me good.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service, had enough space. Flight attendants gave great customer service. Pilots gave smooth flight. Very satisfied with new airline, thank you. The only suggestion would be maybe to offer complimentary beverage for longer flights.

### "I would fly with PLAY again without a doubt"
Es la primera vez que viajo con esta compañía y la experiencia ha sido muy satisfactoria. El vuelo salió con una hora de retraso, pero llegamos puntuales al destino, y la vuelta todo como se preveía, sin ningún contratiempo. Volvería a volar con PLAY sin ninguna duda. - It is the first time that I travel with this company and the experience has been very satisfactory. The flight left an hour late, but we arrived at the destination on time, and everything returned as planned, without any setbacks. I would fly with PLAY again without a doubt.

### "seats are a bit uncomfortable"
Really modern, quite spacious and nice cabin crew. The worst part has been the seats which are a bit uncomfortable specially the top part.

### "Play did a fantastic job"
Play did a fantastic job. The website was flawless. The pricing was clear and logical - not to mention cheap. Customer service answers the phone in short order. All of our flights landed early. Short wait times between connections. Great flights all around. And the airports - at least in Iceland and in New York - were so convenient and easy to use. I really am astounded that such an airline exists. Great model - with flights from America landing early, then several connections a day to various European cities.

### "The whole experience was appalling"
Incredibly disappointed in this airline. I was made to pay €80 at Stansted for my carry on. They charge you at the airport gate for any luggage bigger than a tiny handbag even though tickets state you are allowed a personal item. Furthermore, I had 2 flights and we were not given a drink of water - for an almost 7 hour journey. I don’t expect food on a budget airline, but water at least should be offered for a flight that long. The whole experience was appalling. Long story short, I won’t be flying with this airline again.

### "charge us for everything"
The staff was pleasant and the plane was clean. The price it was advertised as cheap but then you charge us for everything. Bags, carry on, food, drink. Then you don’t provide any entertainment. So you charge about $800 for a flight that you can’t even get a glass of water or a snack included. Then because of a layover you charge double for bags. The only nice thing was leaving from Stewart airport.

### "ultimately, it’s not worth it"
Not Verified | I am not satisfied with Play. There are no self-service kiosks. I could not add my known traveler number. Play does not have an app for customers to receive real-time updates. Certainly, the inexpensive flights are attractive, but the airline is too inconvenient. So, ultimately, it’s not worth it.

### "Not enough time between transfers"
Not enough time between transfers. They failed to take "Boarding" off the roster and I did not make it in time. This was because I was directed by an airport worker to go all the way to "Arrivals" between flights which was incorrect. By the time I got back the gate had closed 5 min before and they turned me and others away, telling us to go elsewhere and buy another ticket out. Ours were worthless and they were not willing to allow us on the plane, which was still being boarded on the tarmac. 40 min between two long international flights isn't practical. When I went to the help desk for Play, I was told I should have been able to make the flight and that all others had made it. When I told her that wasn't true, she stated again that I was. I reminded her I'm not deaf or blind, and that the very last person she had at her counter was there because she too missed this flight for the same reason. She told me she wasn't able to credit my ticket, so I moved ten feet down the line and bought one from Icelandic Air (way better than the other three flights I had on Play). I did the wrong thing by trying to go with an economical, new airline. It ended up costing me over $1,000 to correct this. Other things to mention is that they don't offer long layovers or open jaw flights. Too new for me, and I suggest you let them work out all their growing pains prior to flying with them. Pack some beverages because they don't even offer water. No gluten free food options, just candy so pack hard if you have dietary needs because there is NO TIME to eat between flights. No in-flight entertainment .

### "didn't smile nor wished us a nice flight"
Not Verified |  Plane and crew on board were really good, seats are comfortable. But I wonder if the crew at the airport knows about smiling, the 3 ladies we had to talk to (check in, and at the boarding door) didn't smile nor wished us a nice flight.

### "This has been very discouraging to me "
Not Verified |  I packed one personal belonging that was a backpack with wheels and a handle. The airline marked it as carry on charging me an extra fee. The same size bag from another person was marked as personal with no fee. I am very disappointed and disheartened by the discrimination. If you pack one bag for personal item then it should remain that way. I had no other items with me. This has been very discouraging to me and I will not use them again. I suggest you choose another airline!

### "I will use them again"
It's a low cost company really efficient. Airplane clean, cabin crew agreeable. Check in process clear and easy, self drop bags options practical. To sum up, I will use them again.

### "all the extra fees added"
The website was difficult to use for checking in. After I previously set up my account and input all of the required information for me and my family, I got a green checkmark for all 3 of us indicating our profile and information was complete. When I accessed my account later to check in, it said the information was incomplete! It took a long time to figure out that our country of residence (USA) that was previously entered was now missing and we had to enter it again after we thought we were cleared earlier when the reservation was made. The staff at the check in counter in Stuart Airport was unacceptably rude. Every single member of your flight attendant staff on your airplanes in both directions was outstanding. Both aircraft were spotlessly clean. The seats on both flights lacked enough cushioning for a 5 to 6 hour flight. They were very uncomfortable compared to your competition. The low cost of your ticket prices initially caused us to select PLAY Airlines for our travel to Iceland. In the end when I checked out and paid for the tickets, I was surprised to see all the extra fees added to the ticket price. I suggest you include all of these extra fees in the ticket price so your customers know exactly what they are paying and don't feel swindled. I have flown over 1 million miles on United Airlines and I always receive a complimentary upgrade to Economy Plus, I can select my seat assignment free of charge, I am entitled to 1 free carry on in addition to my Personal item and I can check 2 bags that weigh up to 70lbs. each free of charge. These benefits are extended to anyone traveling with me on the same reservation. After paying for these things on PLAY including all the taxes, departure fees, etc, the price I ended up paying for each ticket was slightly less than I would have paid on United. Since I would have a movie screen with free movies, music at my seat and I would have received valuable mileage on my frequent flyer account on United, the slight savings for the PLAY tickets definitely was not the bargain I was expecting and not worthwhile. I realize that due to my extensive travel giving me my special privileges with United and Star Alliance partners, I am not a typical passenger. Having said that, unfortunately it is unlikely I will consider PLAY Airlines for any future travel to Iceland or Europe in the future for the above reasons.

### "flight was very comfortable"
The flight was very comfortable. Seats were separated properly, and it had enough space to stretch my legs. Cabin crew was nice and helpful. Food and beverages prices onboard were more or less similar to other airlines. A compelling balance between quality and price.

### "great flight and friendly staff"
No issues with delays, cancellations, got to Iceland quicker than expected. Reasonably priced and reasonably priced snacks/drinks for purchase. Overall great flight and friendly staff.

### "crew attended to everyone's needs and were extremely pleasant"
Not Verified |  This was my wife and I's first time flying abroad. The cabin was roomy. I am 6'3 and had enough leg room to remain seated for the entire 6 hour flight. The pilot was very informative and advised us to bad weather and turbulence. The crew attended to everyone's needs and were extremely pleasant. They made my wife and I feel comfortable and relaxed throughout the flight. I recommend PLAY Airlines if you're traveling abroad.

### "impressed with this airline"
I was impressed with this airline. For a low cost carrier, their planes were new, clean, seats weren’t bad for a low cost carrier, couldn’t complain),. Leg room was good and the staff were super friendly. The food price wasn’t crazy and the options were good. Honestly will fly them again happily.

### "Very good flight"
Very good flight. Fast check inn. Helpful flight attendents. Good seat, enough legroom and space. Down sides: no flight entertainment and expensive luggage fee.

### "Extremely small and tight plane"
Extremely small and tight plane. Sat with my knees pushed in the seat in front of me and had a hard time freeing myself every time I wanted to stand up. The seats are barely cushioned and you cant even move the headrest at all! The corridor is also really narrow, I noticed a lot of people that sat by the corridor got hit again and again by the staff, the staff trolley and other passengers. Would definitely not recommend.

### "I can highly recommend it"
This was my first time with play air and I can highly recommend it. The cabin crew was warm and welcoming and the service on board was very good. And I can understand what the captain is saying.

### "This is a bare-bones flight"
Very uncomfortable seating for an international flight. I would take a Play flight on a shorter trip but nothing over a couple of hours. This is a bare-bones flight, passengers will pay for everything including water and coffee. The flight going to KEF from BMI was roomier, but the return flight was fairly miserable - I could barely squeeze my backpack under the seat and getting up to use the lavatory was difficult (I am only 135 lbs). One the plus side, the pilot very kindly announced beautiful views over Greenland which briefly distracted me from the numbness in my legs and lower back due to the cramped conditions.

### "the cost is great for the quality"
Fabulous easy check-in online, good service and legroom. Low cost - will use again as the cost is great for the quality. Good cabin bag size as well so able to travel with small case and small rucksack - happy days.

### "I had to throw away my carry on"
Not Verified |  I had no issue with this company until my last of 4 flights coming back home, I had to throw away my carry on and wear multiple layers of clothes just so I could bring my clothes home. Even though I paid for the carry on they said I had not even while showing the receipt. Worst part is I wasn't the only one on this flight dealing with this issue. The crew on board were nice and do the best they can do on the job. The seats are very uncomfortable. But at the same time, it was a cheap flight so I didn't expect to travel in the best of conditions. In all honesty I had no issues with this airline until my last connecting flight and I don't think I will be flying with PLAY again.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I am shocked that there isn’t an outlet on a plane, especially one that flys over 5 hours. The food isn’t complimentary which makes for the worst international experience ever. This is the cheapest company I have ever witness. They claim they are cheap but I paid 600 dollars one way. They couldn’t even let you print a boarding pass for a connected flight or have access to one electronically. They also waited 45 minutes for several late passengers putting everyone else’s connected flights at risk. Will never fly with them again.

### "undisclosed additional fees"
Their website does not work and online checking would not allow me to check in without selecting seats at an additional charge for each plane. Checking in to my return flight was impossible online and had to be done in person. I like to find low cost deals to travel, but at the last moment-at check in 24 hours before my flight- I was forced to pay an additional $236. Their customer service is poor and consists of Facebook chats and the chat regarding my return flight wasn’t answered for hours. They have no customer service phone number. Their website was under construction and had constant error messages. The flight itself was a nightmare. A super hot, brightly lit plane on the red eye. Absolutely no amenities, no wifi, no tv, not even a travel magazine or sharper image catalog. You also have to pay for everything including water ($1) and tiny cup of coffee ($3). The seats cost an additional $32 for each plane at check in (there was no option to have the airline select your seat for free) and a checked bag cost $86 each direction. Only after my flight and after speaking to several reps was I informed of an additional vague “service fee” (of an undisclosed amount) that I could have been charged by the agent I was chatting with on Facebook. All of these undisclosed additional fees that I was slammed with 24 hours before my flight nearly doubled the cost of my ticket. Had I initially known I would be paying that amount for my flight I would have booked a better airline and probably saved money in the long run.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. I flew from Baltimore to Paris. What was supposed to be dream trip turned into a nightmare. PLAY lost my luggage, and the only response I got was a link to file a report. There is no telephone number. You have to communicate via DMs on Instagram, Facebook, and Whatsapp. I sent multiple messages on Facebook. They responded by blocking me there. Horrible airline and customer service. Very unorganized company. Do not fly with this company.

### "I felt like I was sitting on a rock"
An ok (very) low-cost airline, which mainly connects Iceland to the neighbouring European countries (and the East USA cost. All the food is charged inside the flight, but the price is quite fair (at least the coffee and water costs less than in a regular supermarket in Sweden. The sandwiches costs about the same). The only con was about the seating: I felt like I was sitting on a rock, I know the flight lasted only 3:30 hours, but come on. When we came back to Sweden, we bought a roomier seat, which was a bit more comfy, but still hard as rock! They need to take a bit more of care with the airplanes. When we were about to leave Iceland back home, the airplane stopped seconds after leaving the finger, and I never seen so many mechanics and engineers entering in a airplane. According to an employee later, the airplane had a technical problem with a onboard computer. Our flight left Reykjavik 1 hour late. The crew was amazing, though! Keep up the good job!

### "nothing but good things to say"
Not Verified |  I've flown with PLAY a few times now and for the most part I have nothing but good things to say. PLAY is of course a low cost airline. Baggage costs a fair bit extra, the leg room is not the best, there is no in-flight entertainment or Wi-fi and the selection of food and drinks on board is pricey and limited. But you get what you pay for, and in comparison to Icelandair (who is taking more and more a low cost approach of their own anyway) I'd argue the value for money is far better with PLAY and gives us Icelanders a chance to travel abroad for much less than a similar Icelandair ticket. The service and crew have always been excellent and I expect I'll be flying a bit more often with PLAY in the future.

### "I'd fly with them again"
I was a bit skeptical about this low cost carrier that I've never heard about. I tried PLAY since the fees were considerably cheaper for my schedule. As a low cost carrier they don't provide food or drinks for free. The seats are quite spacious considering it is a low cost. I'd fly with them again if I ever have to fly back to Iceland.

### "we cannot help you further"
I made a one way reservation from Brussels to Boston for my cousin and her son. The flight was supposed to be on August 10. Yesterday, I registered to pay for their luggage and seats. I clicked on the link provided in email and attempted to input my reservation number and my cousins last name, I received an error. I tried reaching out to the airlines via messenger, email, what’s up app and online chat. Every time they would say we don’t understand what you want here is confirmation email. I clicked on red button (see images below) and would receive same exact message, in response the company said well it’s under the same account I was using, I said that’s the account using to what I got response we cannot help you further. I attempted it few more times, every time receiving the same response. This company does not have phone number or registration desk at the airport, people who are unable to check in 24 hour prior to the flight are left behind. I spent 1000 on tickets and they don’t have a flight to take as the company refuses to troubleshoot their website issues.

### "This is unacceptable"
I flew to Paris with my boyfriend and I didn't have my luggage when I arrived in France. I had to rebuy some stuff I needed and started to wear my boyfriend's clothes! On our way back last Saturday, my boyfriend didn't get his luggage. It has been 3 days now and we don't even have the option to speak with someone. Customers service is pretty much no existent. We have been missing our luggage 2 times in 1 trip! This is unacceptable. I will never fly with them ever.

### "The low price is absolutely not worth it"
The low price is absolutely not worth it. Plane was fine. Long delay with missed connections, which is understandable and the staff for the most part did the best they could, but the absolutely abysmal communication and support regarding how we were supposed to get a new flight and the confusion that surrounded it was the worst I've ever encountered on any airline, not even a close contest. Can't meet the bare minimum standard for how an airline should function with regards to communication, clarity, and standards.

### "crew onboard are friendly"
I had never heard of this airline before so I thought let's risk this $395.00 round trip. Just remember this is a budget airline. No Movies, no internet, no inflight service as standard food is available for sale and its limited. The crew onboard are friendly, and the trip Boston to Reykjavik went by fast. This airline runs on time too! I'm 6.2 so the seats are tight but not uncomfortable. I would do this trip and with this airline again.

### "What a great airline"
What a great airline. Inexpensive tickets, great service, excellent food to purchase on board, and amazingly comfortable seats. Economy leg room was better than United or Delta’s business class. Way beyond my expectation for a discount airline. You just have to realize that you need to pay for carry on and food on board.

### "Do not be sucked in by the low prices"
Do not be sucked in by the low prices — nothing was worth the stress of the round trip I took with Play. By the end I had paid nearly an additional $250 for various catches, screw ups, and obstacles from this sin of an airline. This isn’t counting food or drinks — I packed my own — and bought my carry on luggage ahead of time. I flew from Baltimore to Reykjavik and hours before I arrived at the airport I tried several times to check in online. Each time the website was broken and I could not get a digital boarding pass. I arrived at the Baltimore airport, but the counter had closed an entire HOUR before the flight boarded, so there was no one to print a boarding pass and no kiosks. I ended up missing my flight because of this. I did not want to cancel my entire trip, so I paid for another ticket (an additional $110). I measured my suitcase in advance to be sure it fit the airline’s carry on requirements, and boarded my second attempt at getting to Iceland with no problem. Following these catastrophes I arrived at the airport 3 hours early in Reykjavik (KEF) for my return trip. I was told my suitcase (which I had measured and compared with Play’s online standards) was too large to go through security and was told to check it. I went back to the counters and explained the problem, and the attendants informed me I needed to show a negative COVID result to fly. I brought three rapid (antigen) tests with me, which the US accepts for re-entry, and said no problem, I was happy to take one. They said I needed a “certificate,” and apparently the only way to accomplish this was to take a cab to a nearby testing center ($35 round trip and pay for one of their antigen tests (same tests I had) which cost $54. None of this information was available on the airline’s website or any of the emails I received from them. At this point I was cutting it close, and the attendants made me wait another 25 min when I was back before I got my negative result. Finally, I was allowed in line to check my bag. I explained the issue with the carry on again, and that it fit their measurements, but they told me I had to purchase a checked bag instead. ($60) This was an addition to the carry on I had already purchased for this bag ($39) which they did not refund. I made it to the gate by just a few minutes. I cannot recommend visiting Iceland enough, but I would rather swim than take Play airline again.

### "Warm friendly crew"
I was pleasantly surprised by PLAY, who were great. Warm friendly crew, great legroom and a new, modern stylish aircraft. The cherry on the cake was the fact that I booked close to departure and got a great deal on my airfare. Food and drink is for purchase on board. Not a huge selection. I would happily fly with PLAY again. One suggestion for PLAY would be to install Wi-Fi on board as there is no in flight entertainment currently.

### "amazingly kind and helpful airline"
I have never been so appreciative of the airline staff. Play was amazing from the start to the finish. My sister and I were unaware of the need for an antigen test before entering Iceland. It was of course our fault for not looking and we had no idea what to do in order to make our flight and check in our bags before the deadline in 20 min. The gentleman checking in our bags kindly let us know about a pharmacy in the airport that may be able to get the test in time to make the flight. He not only gave us directions and quickly checked in our bags ( with a minute to spare), but he also escorted us through security in order to ensure we made our flight to Reykjavik. Because we had been sprinting with two suitcases all around the airport, we were both so thirsty and dehydrated but we did not have time to get water before boarding. Although usually you are only allowed to get any food or drink once in the air for ten minutes, the kind flight attendant let us get water before take off and pay later on in the flight. If this was any other airline we would have missed our flight or have been extremely nauseous for the first thirty minuets but we ended up having such a great flight and great rest of our day in Reykjavik! Such an amazingly kind and helpful airline even with the way they ask you to put your seatbelt on or help you with your overhead bags. Could not recommend Play more! So to the gentleman working in Charles De Gaulle airport for the 11:35 am flight to Keflavik on November 18th, 2021 you are a life saver!
