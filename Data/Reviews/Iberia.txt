### “lacked professionalism and empathy”
Complaint for poor service provision on the Madrid–Miami flight and loss of luggage. 1. Outbound flight (IB 0333, April 30, Madrid–Miami). The original ticket included a connection to San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a later flight. On April 29, we called to cancel the Miami-San Juan flight and leave our two suitcases only as far as Miami, given the massive communications outage affecting Spain and neighboring countries. Upon our arrival at the airport, the check-in staff lacked clear training on how to check in one piece of luggage with a single destination (Miami) and another canceled destination (San Juan). After contacting a colleague several times, the employee issued a ticket for the first suitcase and manually issued one for the second, verbally confirming that both would travel only to Miami. He made this statement twice after my persistent question. Upon arrival in Miami, one of the two suitcases had disappeared. To date, Iberia has not provided reliable information on its location or delivery date. 2. Special Food Service. I am a celiac patient and I requested a gluten-free meal in advance for both flights (Madrid–Miami and Miami–Madrid). On the outbound flight, the local supervisor temporarily resolved the issue with a leftover meal from another celiac passenger, after telling me I should complete my profile on the Iberia website, which I did upon arrival in Spain. On the return flight (April 28, 2025), the cabin crew treated me rudely and inconsiderately, claiming that "if I didn't ask for it, they couldn't serve it to me. I spent nine hours without a single meal suitable for me, and the resulting humiliation from the staff, who asked me, despite knowing I have celiac disease, if I would like an ice cream bar, a ham sandwich, and gluten-containing Kit Kat cookies. 3. Customer Service and Negligence. The telephone and in-person handling lacked professionalism and empathy. Not only did they not locate my suitcase, but the way I responded to my inquiries was evasive and lacking in commitment to customer satisfaction, as, like me, I pay for an international ticket and associated services. It was a disgrace and a disrespectful experience!

### "I have to collect my bag"
Barcelona to Madrid under one reservation and Mad-Mex under another. Agent telling me it is impossible to check a bag all the way. Now I have to collect my bag and recheck it.

### "very attentive and good service"
Service provided at Orly airport ok. Lounge very basic but does the job. Boarding ok and on time. Cabin comfort ok, nothing special, just middle seat empty. Crew was great, very attentive and good service provided. Full meal with 2 choices for main course, full bar and drinks during all fligth. Departure on time, arrival 20 min early. Great job. Wifi available.

### "Really nice flight and crew"
Really nice flight and crew. Madrid airport very busy for easter monday, but fast track worked perfect, just one minute to get thru. Lounge great as usual. Boarding on time, by groups. Business class on the 330 it's just great for this 2,45h flight: Provided with headsets, IFE availeable. Hot breakfast served, crew was really nice and attentive and made sure we had enough drinks and coffee during the flight. Arrival on time.

### "lost luggage department is atrocious"
Iberia lost luggage department is atrocious. I booked with Iberia to fly from Seattle to Mallorca for a bike trip. I had to change planes in Chicago and Madrid. When I arrived in Mallorca early afternoon on 29th March, neither my bike case nor my suitcase were there. The lost luggage subcontractor created a report and said I would hear from Iberia when my luggage would be delivered. Iberia has a tool on its website for checking the status of lost bags, but I continually got a message that they were having technical difficulties whenever I checked it. By the next morning I had heard nothing, so I called the numbers for Iberia’s lost baggage department. I was told the bags were in the Madrid airport and would be delivered by 1:40 pm (13:40). I went to the airport but my bags were not there. The lost luggage subcontractor had no information at all. I called the lost baggage department back and was told they had not yet received “confirmation” from the Madrid airport’s “lost and found” so could not put the bags on a flight to Mallorca. They refused to tell me why they needed a confirmation from lost and found or when that would be forthcoming. They gave me a number to call the lost and found at Madrid airport. I called Madrid lost and found and they told me they had nothing to do with lost luggage. I called the lost baggage department back and they told me they had no idea where the bags were, that they were waiting to hear from the airports involved and knew nothing about when I would get my bags. I asked them if they had contacted the airports to get information about my bags, and they would not tell me. When I pressed them about what they were doing to get my luggage to me, the representative hung up on me. I have no idea when I will get my luggage - or if I ever will.

### "a misleading of clients"
Me and my family (4 adults) went on 7th of March 2025 on a vacation to Dakar from Wien through Madrid. Flight from Wien to Madrid was very comfortable, the crew was polite and helpful. When we arrived to Madrid I wanted to upgrade the seats to Business in the flight number IB0921 from Madrid to Dakar. At the counter of Iberia, located at Madrid Airport (T4S) I paid for this upgrade and our seats were modified from 12F,12C,12D to 5A,5C,5D. Unfortunately, we were very upset with the service, since we were seated in business chairs which were exactly as tourist and we were informed that no meals were left and the 3 upgraded persons got a meal similar to tourist class. We were not told that such thing will happen. We are very upset and thought it is a misleading of clients. When we approach the airline we were instructed to a link with "small words" that gives the airline a right to do so. What a shame! !

### “they are forgetting about customers”
I wasn’t aware Iberia was a low cost airline or act like it in Certain situations. The flight from London via Madrid to Lima in January was actually better than I expected; however the experience with Iberia was lowered considerably when checking in at Quito, us 2 passengers who are entitled to 2 x checked bags weighing 23kg each, one of us had a bag weighing 20kg the other 25kg. The check-in attendant was adamant we needed to pay $120 for the overweight bag, she or process/Iberia needing to extort from customers wherever they can - could not see that the 2 bags together would be under the required weight - instead again she was insistent that both bags separately needed to weigh under 23kg. I haven’t seen this kind of behaviour for a long time and even then only on low cost airlines. This then meant us having to unload our bags across the check in area and move items around - I really don’t understand the need for this inflexibility other than as said previously the requirement for Iberia to extort from customers wherever they can. Next time I have a flight and Iberia pops up as an option, I will remember this experience - I know Iberia couldn’t care less, but ultimately this inflexibility will likely cost them lost revenue at least from me. Our second flight IB717 the immediate row after the upgraded front most seats have the smallest amount of leg room we’ve ever experienced, knees wedged right up to and digging into the seats in front whereby of course those individual(s) kept trying to smash their seats in recliner mode against our knees; what an absolute shambles, yet further back lots of seats empty with much more leg room - in conclusion Iberia seems so intent on generating extra revenue wherever they can they are forgetting about making a good experience for their customers who don’t want to pay above and beyond for every little upgrade which then means those customers highly likely like me will avoid Iberia if there are other options.

### “warm welcome by crew”
Madrid airport really easy to manage. Security really fast for premium passangers, a breeze. Then on to the lounge, good selection of food and beverages. Lots of space. Boarding ok, by buses, not the best. Once on board warm welcome by crew by my name, welcome drinks, and really comfy seats. All amenities, blanket and pillow are ok compared to other carriers, but the best for me is the food and wine selection. Good service. Manage a good sleep before served 2nd meal before arrival. IFE really good, headsets could improve, not the best. Arrival T8 at JFK, short on taxi after landing, so great job.

### “Tremendous time waste”
Not Verified | Iberia downgraded from business class ticket to economy for entire flight without notification. They also changed my dates and eliminated stopover in Madrid / Hola Madrid! for 2 days. Multiple attempts with "customer service" did not fix the issue caused by Iberia. Tremendous time waste. Incompetent "customer service" and ancient software booking system. Poor management.

### "meals were supremely mediocre"
My luggage didn't make it to my connecting flight in Madrid. The meals were supremely mediocre (2 of them were literally a small sandwich), and the cabin crew was visibly annoyed when I returned the cheese & ham sandwich she placed on my table, despite having requested a vegetarian meal, and asked whether they had a vegetarian alternative. She did come around a few minutes later with a different sandwich at my table while saying "vegan" and walking away.

### "Flight was good and bad"
Flight was good and bad. The plane was dirty and our seat trays didn’t work. Seats were old not enough cushion on them. The flight attendants were nice and very attentive. The food were good as well. They made me wait all that time waiting for my bag when they knew it was still in Madrid. They told me it was going to arrive the next day and will be delivered same day. It didn’t arrive till the second day. My new luggage came back with two missing wheels and beat up. I can’t seem to file a claim online it kept giving me errors and took forever to speak to someone on customer service line. When we finally got someone they barely spoke English and after all that explaining the call drops. By the way when they called for us to get my bag we had to go to the car and we had to ask the man to open the trunk for us. He didn’t even get out of the vehicle.

### “Very disappointing”
My husband and I did an upgrade to business class, but according to check in assistant we did not have the same luggage allowance as if I had bought a business class ticket. We also did not have lounge access. What is the point of doing upgrades if we do not have the same amenities as if we had bought a Business Ticket? My husband had to pay an additional luggage after spending an hour at check in. Very disappointing, false propaganda from Iberia to do upgrades. Very bad ground service at Austrian Airport also.

### “Service was great”
Madrid-Rome return over the weekend. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Boarding priority worked well, seat comfort ok, but nothing special, just middle seat empty, and a bit more legroom than economy. Service was great, the food service is tasty. Pre lunch/dinner drinks served then a full meal. Open bar during the flight. Lounge in Madrid is great, not the one in Fuimucino, but it does the job. Overall it was a great experience.

### "far from satisfactory"
Not Verified |  I recently flew with Iberia from Madrid to New York and back, and my experience was far from satisfactory. From the start, the service was disappointing. The staff were neither polite nor well-trained, and their approach felt rushed and indifferent. It seemed as though they were just trying to get through the flight rather than attending to passengers’ needs. Adding to this, there was a significant delay with the flight. No clear or timely communication was provided about the reasons for the delay. Once we finally arrived it took an unusually long time for the baggage to arrive, and there was no apology from the airline for the delay. Throughout the flight, the crew’s attitude was unaccommodating and unsympathetic. When I had concerns, their responses were curt and dismissive, which made the journey even more stressful. Simple requests seemed to be a burden, and any sense of hospitality was noticeably absent. Add to this that the WiFi would not work with any of my functioning credit cards. Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. Iberia needs to improve not only their in-flight service but also their handling of delays and baggage delivery. Better communication, more efficient operations, and well-trained, empathetic staff would go a long way in enhancing the passenger experience. Based on this trip, I would be hesitant to fly with Iberia again unless significant improvements are made.

### "their service was rushed"
During my recent business class flight from Madrid to Bogota, I was disappointed to find my seat in an unacceptable condition. There were several used tissues next to my seat, which I had to clean myself using wet wipes. The seat was extremely dirty requiring multiple wipes to clean. I observed that cabin crew in business class were female and their overall conduct was unprofessional. Their hair was not tied back properly, which is a safety hazard when handling food for passengers. They lacked smiles and friendliness, and their service was rushed, as if they were eager to return to the galley to chat and rest. The rest of the time, they were seated and chatting. This was a different experience from when I flew from Bogota to Madrid, where the cabin crew seemed happy to work and were not rushing with the service.

### “a terrible experience with customer service”
I had a terrible experience with customer service. They damaged one of my checked bags and its contents but refused to compensate me. Additionally, my connecting flight was canceled while I was in Dallas, which isn't my home city. They rebooked me on another flight three days later and denied my request for hotel compensation during the wait.

### "they should pay me to fly them"
Not Verified | On my latest flight with Iberia (always from Latin America) I paid for one sector to premium economy. When I checked in online it was economy. 3 calls to customer service and this wasn't resolved. They said work it out at the airport. At the airport they said I was in economy and PE was full and to write to Iberia after my flight for a refund. The airport staff put me in a bulkhead seat though, but Onboard two random people sat in the empty seats next to me from the back and crew did nothing. Needless to say it was an uncomfortable 10h flight. Then after arrival I could not get anyone from Iberia to honour a compensation. To the point I took to complaining on their social media and got targetted by a scammer! I guess lots of people like me frustrated with Iberia take to their social media. Never again with the level of incompetence, and disinterested crew service in economy. Iberia makes me feel like they should pay me to fly them.

### "Worst customer service experience"
Worst customer service experience I have had - very aggressive poorly trained check in staff. The airline has lost its perspective on customer service and loyalty. Very long check in queue in business as only two agents for business check in for all Iberia flights from Madrid. Very unfriendly agent demanded payment for additional bag weight even though well within limits of loyalty scheme. She insisted I was a grade lower than I am - even though it was printed on the ticket and boarding pass - meaning I had to pay or repack into an additional bag (as I was only checking in a fraction of total allowance anyway - which begs the question why bother when it will only effect loyalty and increase the queue of other business class passengers). She refused to look at the ticket or website when I tried to show her and then refused to give her name when said I wanted to complain. She said I could go to customer services and miss the flight unless I obeyed her. All I can do is never travel with them again.

### "Very good business class"
MAD-JMK return. Both flights departed on time, arrival on time too. Nice business class cabin. Seats ok, nothing special, only middle one left empty, but comfortable for a 3+ hours flight. Headreast and recline ok. Service was great on both flights. Full dinner, with tasty food, hot bread, few rounds of drinks, and great attentive crew. Very good business class short haul product. On our return flight they showed for free the final match of the Eurocupa by connecting your device to the onboard wifi, well done!

### "Iberia rejected the claim"
Not Verified |  Traveled from Zurich via Madrid to Marrakech and yes it’s summer so delays are part of flying in the European skies! Left Zurich slightly late but no big issues and flight was fine, but has we went to transfer it all started to go south. As part of the transfer we were required to change terminal and for some unknown reason Spanish immigration force people to go through immigration even though we are not leaving the airport……and as a non European the queue was huge and only a few immigration officers making journey extremely stressful! We made the plane, just, along with another 30 passengers who were stuck in immigration, then arrived into Marrakech to only find out the suitcases had missed the connection! Again no major problems but the real challenge is next day when suitcases turn up and locks have been broken and the luggage has been opened and rummaged through and items stolen. A complaint was made but Iberia rejected the claim.

### "luggage was not put on the plane"
Not Verified |  Flew with them twice and both times the same issue occurred, my luggage was not put on the plane and left at the previous airport. The customer service when calling to receive my luggage back was slow. There was no contact back when more issues happened, they stuffed around with delivering the luggage once it arrived in the country delaying the process even more, ended up having to pick up the luggage myself. The lovely assistant at the airport (does not work for Iberia) mentioned this airline is known for taking bags off the flight due to weight restrictions, despite the fact I paid for checked luggage. I am extremely disappointed and exhausted from the lack of care from customer service! Not worth flying again.

### “Absolutely horrible”
Not Verified | Worst airline in the world. I have flown with them two weeks ago and lived a literal tragedy and my parents ended up rebooking with them by mistake: flight was canceled twice, no compensation WHATSOEVER, change of airport at the last minute, no accommodation no food no nothing … worst airline to exist, please do not make the same mistake I did and book this catastrophe! Absolutely horrible, please watch out.

### "Iberia lost my bag"
A short flight from Alicante to Madrid, and Iberia lost my bag. I have been 1 week in the Philippines without medication or clothes which was inmy bag. It is almost impossible to call Iberia, and their support is terrible. One person said there was no trace of my bag The next day I was told that it was sent from Doha to Manila The next person said they have no idea where the bag is We have contacted the support daily, and it seems they have no idea where the bag is, no organisation, no tracking, and no sign that they care about where my bag is. They said they sent the bag to Manila, but have no tracking number or way of identifying the bag. It seems they shipped it there with no plan how to deliver it to me, and this could well be the cause they they lost it the second time.

### "we were downgraded to economy"
Not Verified |   I bought tickets from Iberia on January 29, 2024 for two round trip tickets to Barcelona. Both tickets were for premium economy. Our first flight was on July 11, 2024 and at the gate we were told that we were downgraded to economy. We were given a copy of Iberia passenger rights which had a highlighted section saying that we were subject to a 75% refund on our original payment. On our returning flight (July 23, 2024) we were downgraded once again. I was told to file a claim in order to get a refund. When I got a response back I was given les than half of my original payment. Iberia has single handedly ruined my vacation and is willfully withholding my compensation.

### "still trying to get a refund"
Not Verified |   My wife and I had a flight home from Barcelona to Boston on Saturday, June 22nd at 6:45pm. The flight was delayed in 20-minute increments for over four hours with very few updates or explanation from the Iberia terminal desk employees. Once canceled they did not immediate rebook passengers on new flights but after waiting hours in line stated you will receive an email later with your new flight booking. The hotel they provided was an hour and a half outside of Barcelona with no ability to receive a cash payment to use elsewhere. My wife and I ended up paying for our own hotel closer to the airport. The email we received later that evening informed us that our return flight would not depart until Monday, June 24th with a layover in Heathrow (UK) which we would have to spend the night with the return flight from Heathrow to Boston not occurring until to the Tuesday evening, June 25th! So, the expectation is we would have to pay for three nights of hotel rooms (2 nights in Barcelona and one in night in London) as well as miss work Monday and Tuesday resulting in even more loss of money. I stayed up all night calling other airlines and fortunately was able to get my wife and I on a Lufthansa flight from Barcelona to Frankfurt and then to Boston getting us home Sunday night June 23rd. Upon return I had hoped Iberia would not only refund us for the flight, which we had paid more for reserved seats, but also the hotel stay and taxi cost - that wasn't the case. Iberia agreed to pay us $600 each but provided us a refund form that only supported European banks. After several calls, note every call I made was doubled as I had to handle one case for my wife's ticket and another for myself, they sent me an email requesting I send all my financial information through an unsecured email for my US bank - which I was unwilling to do. Given the privacy laws and all the issues with data theft you would think they would understand why I'm requesting either a secure form or an operator that I can provide the information over the phone. Needless to say, it's been over a month and I'm still trying to get a refund. I get the sense they intentional make the process difficult hoping passengers will give up, so they don't lose money. They may be cheaper, but as the saying goes you get what you pay for!

### "ongoing fight for our money back"
Not Verified |   Worst customer service and worst online platform. Took us forever to buy seats online, multiple calls to customer service and nobody would help but kept telling us to use a different computer or to go to the airport. When we finally got seats we got a confirmation the day before our flight that the airplane changed and that they just assigned us seats randomly now. They separated my family and put the children ages 11 and 8 with strangers. At the airport they wouldn’t refund me my money even though we never got the seats we paid for. It’s been an ongoing fight for our money back for seats we never got.

### "empathetic, generous and professional"
Not Verified |   I want to congratulate the airline for the Ground staff at London Airport (Heathrow), specifically those who were there on July 17, 2024, between 6 am and 10 am. The staff was very empathetic, generous and professional. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to take your names, but I would like to thank everyone who was present at that time and tell you that people like you make a difference.

### “Iberia refuses to respond”
Iberia Airlines lost our bags and was completely unresponsive in helping us find them. After six days we decided to travel 8 hours to search the airport ourselves. We found the bags and then requested reimbursement of $291 from Iberia for our travel expenses. Iberia refuses to respond to this completely reasonable request. Throughout this ordeal, Iberia has behaved with complete indifference to the issues it caused. I've never experienced worse customer service from any organization I have ever dealt with. My advice to anyone considering flying with Iberia is to choose another airline.

### “Seats really comfortable and wide”
IBERIA business does the job. At the airport check in easy and no lines. Fast track for security and then to the lounge. Terminal 8 has really nices business facilities. Boarding on time and by groups. Welcome by crew member, she introduced herself, and offered a welcome drink. Seats really comfortable and wide on the 350 aircrafts. Plane departed on time, short after take off dinner was offered. The menu is really good and all felt fresh and tasty. Wines list really nice spanish touch on both red and withe. Managed 4 hrs sleep on an 6.5hr flight. Can´t comment on breakfast. Arrival on time and short 30 min after landing already left the airport. Highly recommended.

### "luggage was nowhere to be found"
Not Verified |   I traveled with them 7 days ago, and upon arrival, my luggage was nowhere to be found. Despite multiple attempts to reach out to their customer service team, I have yet to receive any response or update regarding the whereabouts of my belongings. The lack of communication and transparency is frustrating and unacceptable. I entrusted Iberia Airlines with my luggage, and they have failed to deliver on their responsibility. I still have no idea where my things are or if I will ever get them back. This experience has been incredibly stressful and has greatly impacted my travel plans. I hope Iberia Airlines takes action to improve their customer service and baggage handling procedures, as this level of service is far below what should be expected from a reputable airline.

### "disappointing and stressful"
I recently had a deeply frustrating experience with Iberia Airlines regarding a change to my return flight reservation. Originally, my flight was scheduled to return from Rome to Santiago via Madrid. I attempted to change the origin of my return flight to Milan instead of Rome but faced significant difficulties on the company's website, which redirected me to a phone operator. After spending several minutes on the phone, I was informed that I could change the origin of my return flight for an additional cost of approximately $500 per passenger. I accepted the charge for myself and my two children, assuming the matter was resolved. However, upon arrival at the airport, I was shocked to be told that I could not board the flight, though my children could. This situation was absurd and highly stressful. At the check-in counter, I was instructed to call customer service because the staff at the counter could not assist me, causing further delays and frustration as other passengers waited to check in. During the phone call, I was informed that I needed to pay extra to secure my place on the flight from Milan, despite having already paid for the change. This made no sense, especially since my children and I were on the same reservation. After an hour on the phone, I was finally offered a seat on the flight, but my return flight issue remained unresolved. As the departure time approached, I feared missing the flight altogether. Although I eventually boarded, I spent the entire journey anxious about not having a confirmed return flight. From Spain, I had to make multiple calls to ensure that my return flight was confirmed. Despite assurances over the phone, I only received the tickets and reservation confirmation for my youngest child, not for myself or my older child. The stress and unpleasantness of this situation were overwhelming, especially when traveling with two young children. I urge Iberia to revise their policies to empower check-in counter staff to resolve such issues. Up until now, I was a satisfied customer who recommended Iberia to friends and family. However, after this experience, I will seriously reconsider flying with them again. I specifically chose a flexible flight option, which did not prove to be flexible in this case. This experience was deeply disappointing and stressful. Iberia, please take note and improve your customer service and policies to prevent others from going through similar ordeals.

### "does not help its customers"
We booked flight with Iberia from Munich to Panama with 1 change in Madrid. For some unknown reasons (non of the stuff could tell us why) the flight was delayed 2h. We arrived in Madrid with 20 min before the Gates to be closed, we ran through the whole airport ( from Terminal 4 to Terminal 1) to catch the 2nd flight. Sweating and hardly breathing we communicate our names and showed the passports. As an answer, the person at the counter apologized and told us that even if we are in front of the gates, and they are still open (in that moment, the status: boarding), she can't let us pass because we were relocated for the flight to Panama of the next day - we were very disappointed to see the airplane in front of us and no support from the company to get us in, when we did everything we could. She directed us to the info place where only 1 employee was handling a line with over 50 people (which lost their connecting flight because of other delays). During the first 30min the line increased, and only after 35-40 min other 2 employees came to help. In the end we spent 4,5h only in the line in front of the info point to be told that new boarding passes were generated for tomorrow flight (information we knew already) and that the company does not book accommodation or offer us any kind of support in actual situation, and we were redirected to the Iberia website to read 'what to do in such situations'. We were very disappointed to see how such a big company does not care about people's time (staying 4,5h in line for 2 min in which we were told to check the website?!) and does not help its customers.

### "seats were quite uncomfortable"
I flew Iberia from IAD to MAD and home from SCQ via MAD to IAD. On the positive side, the flights were punctual and the food on the transatlantic leg was excellent by economy class standards, with metal cutlery. On the way home they passed out full size ice cream bars halfway through the flight, which was a nice touch. But the seats were quite uncomfortable. The legroom on the transatlantic flights was tight, but functional. The legroom on the SCQ to MAD leg, however, was so bad that my legs were pressed up against the seat in front of me. It reminded me of when I flew Vueling a few years prior, but unlike Vueling Iberia is a full service airline that should provide a nicer service. They also charged for soft drinks on the SCQ to MAD leg, which again is not consistent with a full service airline. While Iberia succeeded on many fronts, I might consider a different airline next time so that I can travel in more comfort.

### "communications were in Spanish"
I booked the tickets through their English website but all further communications were in Spanish which I couldn’t easily translate through my iPhone email app while travelling. They were impossible to communicate with by email and their WhatsApp number.

### “We won't be flying Iberia again”
Crew is pleasant, but the "XL" seat at the front of economy is smaller than a regular economy seat on any other airline. Also, only 3 juices and water are free. No meals and no soft drinks or coffee for free on a 4 hour flight which seems a bit stingy to say the least. We've traveled for 7 weeks on 5 different airlines in 3 continents and this is the lowest value we've received so far on the trip. We won't be flying Iberia again. No in seat entertainment and the WiFi was intermittent.

### "Cabin crew good"
Boarding quite reasonable, per groups and people following the rules Food&beverages: good, breakfast could still be improved: mini sandwich and chocolate bar. Dinner did not have the names of the food, so crew had to open the dish to discover if it was risotto or salmon. A sticker with the name would sort this mild inconvenience. Selection of movies and multimedia: decent and updated. Cabin crew good. Flight on time. To be improved: Since you already pay extra for economy plus, I do not like to pay extra for seat assignment. I guess that is why i got a middle seat, which is not comfy as you have to bother next seat customers to go to the restroom in the middle of the nigh, but most companies charge for that as well, so I wouldn´t blame Iberia. Still, a better choice than main economy for red-eye flights.

### "improving the level of service"
The seating was the standard European economy but with an empty seat in the middle which is never very comfortable. Fortunately, business was largely empty. The aircraft appeared new and was clean and the cabin crew were excellent – polite, efficient and responsive. Although the food choice was limited, the chicken was tasty and the cabin crew were more than happy to provide us with as much wine as we requested. The landing was smooth, and although there was a slight delay in getting off the aircraft, the terminal was easy to exit. Having flown with Iberia in the past, and been less than impressed, they are definitely improving the level of service based on my experience with this flight as well as the previous connection from London Heathrow which was very similar in all respects.

### "not so low cost price"
Two flights in a row plane overbooked, several people booked in the same seats, chaos. despite early check in our seats were changed several times until we both sat in middle seat in different sections of the plane, but at least we got inside. Plane was late, did not catch connecting train. Small leg room,  no free food. Its a low cost airline experience for a not so low cost price.

### “breakfast was really poor”
Nice aircraft, good seats and entertainment. Staff were a little standoffish, meal was ok but breakfast was really poor. On a 13 hour flight had to pay for snack. Fit the first time ever, people were allowed to sit in the seats normally dedicated for the crew, never seen that before. Check in was absolutely chaotic.

### "I was downgraded"
I bought Premium Economy and a seat-reservation for twice as much as in Economy. However, I was downgraded because they had sold the seat twice. I was promised a 75% compensation but only got 25%. After 5 weeks of complaints they will not explain why they refuse to compensate according to EU-regulations.

### "Friendly crew on both flights"
Iberia to Madrid and then Iberia Express to Gran Canaria. Friendly crew on both flights. The food was tasty and nice wines. The seats are a little cramped even though the middle seat is empty. Very satisfied anyway.

### “horrible experience with customer service”
Not Verified | I had a horrible experience with the customer service at Iberia. Their employees are not adequately trained to handle customer requests. I wanted to upgrade my seat or ticket, but they could not assist me. I called them to upgrade, and they informed me that online upgrades were only possible within 24 hours of the flight. When I called back within the given timeframe, I requested an upgrade because the online option was not working on their website. They told me that the airport ticket counter could help me with that. However, the airport ticket counter informed me that the flight was fully booked and they could not do anything about it. But when I boarded the plane, I discovered it was not fully booked. When I asked the flight attendant why the ticket counter had said that, they were also unaware. This shows that Iberia's employees are not trained well enough to handle such situations.

### "been the worst experience"
Iberia has by far been the worst experience since ages and being a frequent traveller using many different airlines. The app is a nightmare. The crew arrived late, so that a technical issue could not be detected on time but only after boarding of all passengers. We landed with a delay of roughly 1 hour and there were no apologies, neither from the flight deck or the crew. To complete the whole story, the baggage got lost despite a stopover of more than 1h at MAD . I strongly recommend avoiding this airline if possible.

### "Well done, Iberia"
I bought a last minute ticket in Economy and went for a paid upgrade at the airport for a reasonable price. Only hand baggage as this was a short trip. There were two male attendants really friendly and competent. Service started soon. Marinated sardines were just ok, but pork tenderloin and profiteroles were really tasty. The only drawback was that there was no wifi available during the flight. Never mind, I could still work on my laptop, and leave Instagram for when I disembark. I would repeat the experience without hesitation. Well done, Iberia.

### "good and comfortable flight"
A good and comfortable flight on Iberia's Business Class from Madrid to Zurich. Excellent food, squids with black rice and a very good and attentive service for beverages as well. Unfortunately, the connectivity with wifi was not available. I recommend this airline on this route.

### “Poor service”
Poor service. Flight delayed, made me board in last group having a pet (stressing out in the boarding area). Very dirty seats, no one had cleaned. Poor crew cabin service. Also, most options in the paying menu during the flight were unavailable. I asked for three different products that they had run off at the very beginning of the flight. Made us wait 1 hour for the luggage.

### "Nice seats and clean aircraft"
Day flight to Brazil. Quick check-in Good and healthy food. Nice seats and clean aircraft. On time all the way. Empty seats were occupied during the flight by some friends of the crew coming from Economy class. It was common in the 80s and 90's.

### “a reasonable experience”
This review is for a flight I took with Iberia from London Heathrow to Madrid in early January 2024. I want to first focus on the positives! Iberia were superb in communicating with me via text messages for checking-in and information about a strike in Spain. Check-in was efficient and a friendly uniformed staff member was at hand to assist passengers. It was however, disappointing to encounter a staff member who would not check my bag through to the final destination. I had two tickets and gained the impression that the agent just could not be bothered, alas. The flight was on an A330, I noted that some Business passengers were annoyed as boarding was not well regulated and as such there was something of a scrum! Some passengers were allowed to take far too much luggage into the cabin. The cabin-crew were neatly dressed but kept a very low-key profile during the flight. One gripe for me was that seats were available to select for an extra fee online just like a budget airline. The ticket was expensive enough without being fleeced to pay for a seat. No I come to the major flaw. NO EMERGENCY Procedure took place! No demonstration at all not even a recorded video. I liked the inflight entertainment and found the seat on the A330 to be spacious for a 2 hour flight. Disembarkation was orderly and well managed and it was nice to see the crew being proactive. Overall, a reasonable experience! My bag was delivered efficiently and quickly after landing.

### "tried online check in, we were separated"
Even though with the tickets I bought I was supposed to choose my seat and the seats of my family (and I did so when I purchased them so as we could seat altogether as a family) when we tried online check in, we were separated. And the online help from the company, did not help as at all with this. Also when we checked our luggage the lady at the counter was extremely rude, even though we had a 4 year old child with us.

### "wait 2 days for the next flight"
Iberia is the worst company to fly with. I needed a method to travel to and from the UK with a dog and I called Iberia several times to confirm that I can travel with my dog in cabin to which they confirmed. On the way to Spain the first plane was delayed by 3 hours due to a fault with the plane and the tow trucks and it only got worse from there. We missed our flight and had to wait 3 hours in a queue to get to a customer service desk with only 2 people working, for a queue of at least 700 people. I ended up at my destination 10 hours late. On the way back it was far worse. After waiting 2 hours for the check-in to open and another hour to be seen by one of the 3 clerks (one of which was for the express queue) we finally got through 45 minutes before the flight. while waiting for the flight the gates changed several times (i believe 6 changes in total but it could have been more) and the flight departed over an hour late. Admittedly this was due to something that was beyond their control but once we arrived in Madrid we had to wait 4 hours in a queue to talk to the customer service team who ended up sending us to the customer service desk in the departure lounge. After another 2 hours we got to the desk and explained the situation to which the service rep refused to believe I didn't know that the dog had to go into cargo. Only after I began playing the recording of my conversations with their sales team did she realise I wasn't lying and tried her best to get me on a flight to as close to my final destination, but she had no clue and I had to come up with suggestions. Eventually her colleague suggested Manchester airport but I would have to wait 2 days for the next flight and had to stay at a hotel. I arrived at Madrid Airport at 13:35 and arrived at my hotel at 22:10. On the day of my final flight everything did go smoothly but I did have to spend an extra £77 just to get to my original airport. Also they only offered me £77.60 as compensation.

### “Excellent experience”
Not Verified |   After reading reviews here I wa very apprehensive to travel on Iberia. From check in to baggage collection the flight was great! No waiting at check in, easy boarding, left on time, arrived early, easy baggage collection. Excellent experience.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Iberia changed only the 2nd leg of a 3 leg flight by 24 hours. Did not attempt to change the connecting flights. They had me flying out of Dallas before I arrived in Dallas. Customer service was no help. I finally had to work with American Airlines (partner airline) to resolve the issue. Additionally, Iberia refuses to refund money I paid for seat upgrades on the original flight. I have called them multiple times and a refund is always promised, but never delivered. It seems they just tell me that I will receive a refund to get me off the phone, but never really intend to follow through. Partnership with American Airlines is a joke. The answer is always call American, or call Iberia. It appears no shared data, at all. Cumbersome website. I will not fly Iberia again.

### "customer service is a mess"
I paid for extra legroom and my flight was changed three times, and each time my extra legroom was dropped. I called the day before the flight to get a boarding pass with extra legroom seats, but the next day they had changed my seats again and there was no extra legroom. I filed for a refund, which they screwed up and refunded $8 for incidentals rather than the $165 I paid. App is broken, web site is extremely buggy, and customer service is a mess. I will never fly Iberia again.

### "all the other amenities were poor"
My wife and I paid a great deal to fly Premium Economy on Iberia. The only aspect of the flight that was worth the extra fee was the seat. We were able to reline and sleep during the flight. However, all the other amenities were poor. First, my wife and I have TSA Pre, but Iberia does not pay the TSA fee, so we had to go through the 'regular' line. Our seats were between Business and Economy. We could hear and smell the crew preparing the meals for Business, but our food came after economy had been served their dinner. We were not allowed to use the nearby Business class toilets but instead go to the end of the aircraft (passing all economy seats) to use the toilet. Before we arrived at our destination in the morning, we received our breakfast, which was a box with a small roll and a juice/fruit container with no spoon with which to eat it. After we had eaten, they came around with a thermos container of coffee which was poured halfway into a paper cup. This was not the premium economy for which we had paid! I will not fly Iberia again and I am disappointed that American Airlines, which we normally use, uses Iberia as a partner.

### "bumped you out of your seat"
Tried to use their website to book the seats end up in an error that required a call to their support. Finally was able to get all the seats and boarding pass. Got to the airport, check the luggage and my wife was bumped to the other side of the aircraft, leaving my daughter alone in a middle seat. They told us someone with a higher status just bumped you out of your seat and there is nothing we can do, So one rule don’t fly Iberia and please BA &AA get an airline in your alliance that is showing minimal customer experience.

### "I normally request assistance"
Not Verified |   I am a passenger with disabilities and I normally request assistance for long distances. This could be done directly online. Now Iberia has removed this option from its page an refer me to a form. I completed the form and I get a reply saying it cannot be done through this page and provide a number in the UK. I am currently in Lima Peru. When and why this has changed? Why making it more difficult for people with disabilities? This is not making any sense to me.

### "Seat is not comfortable"
Premium economy of Iberia is akin to economy in a middle Eastern airline. Seat is not comfortable, food is miserable. The staff in-flight cannot be ruder. What is good: inflight entertainment, the other passengers experiencing the same, value for money.

### "Never again Iberia"
Bought a ticket in April 2023 for a 06/10/2023 flight. After receiving boarding pass another passenger attended me I was on standby for the flight, several other passengers as well. Flight was overbooked. Staff just told us you wait or find another way to Madrid. After 30 grueling minutes waiting I received a new boarding pass with seat number. Aware it is a budget airline and you cannot expect to much but this is shocking. On arriving in Madrid we were not able to leave plane as jet bridge was not working, had to wait another 15 minutes. Never again Iberia

### "my Luggage got lost"
Not Verified |  I flew from London to Madrid and my Luggage got lost. After opening a claim in the airport and a week of calls no update were given but actually the customer service staff is quite rude and seems not to care and to take no action after calling them. I am not able to get an update via email and every time I call every person tell a different story. It is unreal to see 3 luggage lost considering that the flight was direct.

### "Will never be flying with Iberia again"
Not Verified |  I flew on Iberia from Miami to Amsterdam with a stop in Madrid. Iberia left my luggage in Madrid. After numerous calls they sent the luggage to Amsterdam, but never to my hotel. I had to go the airport and pick it up, which incurred an additional cost in taxi and time lost from my vacation. When I finally got my luggage they had cut the luggage and removed the lock, ruining my brand new luggage. They also went through my luggage and opened my personal items. There was no one from Iberia at the airport. I called to report my damaged luggage and was repeatedly placed on hold. I filed written report on their website when I got home and they told me the incident needs to reported within 7 days. Are they serious? What lack of professionalism and ethic. Not only did they lose and ruin my luggage but will not take responsibility. Last year they also lost my husband's luggage. Clearly this airline has an issue handling luggage. Very unprofessional and unethical. Will never be flying with Iberia again.

### "They lost my hand luggage"
They lost my hand luggage after asking me to check it in because the flight was fully (or over) booked. In a 3 hour flight we got nothing to drink or eat. Just terrible!

### "you can't actually talk to anyone"
Iberia lost my luggage. To date, I have not received compensation for the essential items I bought in June/July 2023, nor have I received any communication regarding the matter. When I call, they first say that I need to provide documentation. I then inform them that I have already provided everything they have asked for. Then they say that an "agent" will resolve my case. It is now three months later and I have received nothing. What is most disturbing is that you can't actually talk to anyone about it. The call center says that all I can do is wait for the "agent" to contact me. They also say that it will be done via email or message and that there is no number I can call to talk to someone to give me more information. The least they can do is have a number one can call and an actual person who is assigned the case.

### "berating me before looking for my paid bag"
San Sebastián to Madrid. I have been notified due to the full flight I have complementary check in bags for free. But night prior to this flight I already paid for 1 check in bag as I am aware of bag policy. I was told that I can have only hand carry and roll away bag. But the Iberia representative repeatedly point to our bag and held us up. I told her that we paid for one checked in bag. She said I check. Yes, check because I got the receipt. I don’t know how you trained people but berating me before looking for my paid bag is one reason I would not fly out on a small airport where personnel does not understand that your customer deserves respect.

### "still trying to get our money back"
I don’t understand how Iberia stays in business! We paid for a business class ticket and was told by the agent that we didn’t have business class. She was very rude. We then showed her the receipt. She sent us over to customer service who pointed us out in line and said, ”Economy is over there. This is for business class.” We told her that we are aware that this was business class. Once we got up to the front of the line, she told us that business class was full and she could not refund us. This was unbelievable. They gave us economy seats! We are still trying to get our money back. I cannot believe this!

### "the worst possible treatment"
I received the worst possible treatment from a flight attendant. On that flight I paid additionally for seats near my husband and son. When boarding the plane I found my seat occupied by a person. The flight attendant gave it to him and he didn't want to change it. She told me to sit somewhere else and I explained that I had paid for them and that it was important to be close to my children for personal reasons. Still, she insisted that the man was taking my place to be close to some teenagers (note that there was a space available between the teens and in the middle section Right next to it, so I don't understand the need to take my place when there are more spaces available and appropriate for the care of people in their late teens). I did not accept giving up my place and the flight attendant cursed me saying that I am inflexible and that life was going to give it back to me and that she hoped everyone is inflexible with me (in front of all the passengers) which was insuring and made my daughter cry and made us have a very difficult, awkward and unpleasant trip. I filed a complaint of which there was only an acknowledgment of receipt by the airline and they never communicated anything to me again, closing the file without any notification or report. The plane has very small spaces, it is uncomfortable and the dining table cannot be extended or placed. It was very Unfortunate what happened. Why is the point of this airline selling seats when their flight attendants take them away and curse and insult the client in front of the rest of passengers when the experience they supposedly sell is nice? Why charge extra money?

### "Iberia refused to refund me"
I booked an economy ticket LAX-Madrid and paid for exit row seats on both flights. At the airport, I was informed that my paid seats were taken, even though I had a confirmed seats email from Iberia. On the outbound flight, they put us on the plane's last row (from my booked and paid row 23). After we sat, other passengers came claiming the same seats and we had to be separated and moved to middle seats. On the returning flight, I confirmed the seats over the phone the day before the flight and still, they separated us and assigned us in middle seats. During check-in, the agent lied saying that they had changed the aircraft (not true) and that I had allocated seats but not confirmed seats - when I showed her the email from Iberia showing confirmed seats, she became hostile. During the 12 hours flight, the entertainment service and Wi-Fi crashed. I applied for a refund for the almost $400 I paid for the exit row seats and Iberia refused to refund me. The whole situation is so absurd that it is almost unbelievable that an airline can be this callous. Customer service was unhelpful and condescending. From customer service (or complete lack of) check-in and onboard crew - everything is just terrible and extremely unprofessional on Iberia. If you have plans to travel on this airline, for the sake of your vacation, find another airline and you can thank me later.

### "received a unusable broken stroller"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew with Iberia to Barcelona with our 2 toddlers and a high end sturdy 3-parts stroller (Uppababy) which have flown 50+ times with us (we fly a lot, with the kids). Our Stroller was not broken once in any of these flights. We have delivered the 3 pieces of the stroller to the Iberia team, each well-folded as we always do. We received a unusable broken stroller, broken in 5 separate locations over each of the 3 pieces. We complained and after having our time wasted in the airport, without any alternative solution offered (it’s not their problem our week long trip to Barcelona is ruined, where we have 2 toddlers and no stroller), were asked to also file a complain digitally. That led to an endless game where Iberia refused to pay for the damage. They made up a “broken beyond repair” certificate which “every store has” and “if only we got it we will be paid back”. We have gone to several stores, both dedicated kids/stroller stores and large chains who sell strollers like Walmart and Target. No one has heard of that certificate. When explained to Iberia they insisted it exists and will only pay if we get it. When we asked for “just one example of one store that has these certificate in Texas” they refused to provide one example, and repeated the mantra. This is beyond poor customer services.

### "could not attach the gate to the door"
The de boarding experience for this flight was unforgivable. Everything leading to that point was as expected: nether good or bad, just the usual international flight and average entertainment. However, the flight was on time, even a little early and I was convinced that I’ll catch my next flight which was scheduled for 2 hours later. The ground crew could not attach the gate to the door and it kept passengers on the plane for over an hour, enough to cause many passengers, including me to miss their next flights. The stunning part was the passive attitude of the flight crew which did nothing to communicate the situation, and when they finally did it was only in Spanish. No offer for support whatsoever, and a wait and see attitude. The usual follow up after the flight with an email to request feedback also missing. An incredible demonstration of incompetence from the flight and ground crews, which could not de board passengers for over an hour.

### "Crew first, passengers perhaps later"
In three days they lost three bags and wasted days of our trip. They lost my wife’s bag on the way to San Sebastián and both her and my bag on the way to Rome. The staff could not care less and in Rome the queue for missing bags was about 70m long. All correspondence was in Spanish which I don’t know and my names suggest that! Onboard rubbish service. The crew rush you to buy expensive food and drinks before rushing to the back of the place to enjoy 3 course meals themselves. This airline is seriously mucked up. Crew first, passengers perhaps later. My advice, take the bus. Truly awful. Never, ever again. And as I write my bags are missing and I’ve had to buy clothes and toiletries. Iberia you are special...I add a photo of the queue for lost baggage in the early stages. A great way to enjoy a trip. Never again.

### "our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours"
We booked a flight from Madrid to Los Angeles with American Airlines, from MAD to London Heathrow with IB, and from there a flight to LAX with AA. We only had 90 minutes to catch the connecting flight, so when our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours, we knew that we weren't going to make our connecting flight. I spoke with an IB employee while we were still in Madrid, and asked them if we should still fly to LHR since we're missing the connecting flight (or at the very least, start making accommodations for an alternate connecting flight). The IB employee said that there's nothing they can do at MAD, so we should take the flight to LHR and that they would figure it out once we arrive to London. We arrive at London 3 hours late (2 hrs from the delay at MAD, and another hour at the gate at LHR because the door was jammed and they couldn't get it open). Once we finally got out, there were no IB employees at LHR (they leave at 8pm), so we went to AA's customer service. Well, AA can't help us because it's IB who was delayed. Only problem is that all IB employees are gone for the night (they won't return until 6am), and their 24-hour customer service is trash. The IB customer service reps that I spoke with said that since I bought the tickets from AA, that it's AA and not IB who have to book me a new flight home. After 4 different phone calls totalling 90+ minutes on the phone, IB was able to book us a flight to Paris, and from Paris take a 13-hour flight to LAX. Also, not once did they mention that we can get a hotel for the night and that they would have to reimburse us. However, we know our rights as airline passengers, and when I mentioned this, the IB reps were vague as to how I can get reimbursed, or what my allowance was.

### "on Level we had no meal"
Flight was on time, the service was OK, not the best. Food was below average. Checking in online was frustrating. My return flight was operated by level, but it was not very clear. We had food available on our flight to Madrid. However, on the way back on Level, we had no meal and only water, no other drinks. There was food and drink, available for purchase, but expensive. The the check in process at the airport for Level was terrible. I was upset that the return leg was on this budget airline.

### "entire stay in Madrid without our luggage"
Without a doubt, this has been the worst flight experience I have ever had. On April 5th, my wife and I traveled from Mexico City to Madrid (Flight IB 6402). Upon arriving at Barajas Airport, we proceeded to the baggage claim area, and after waiting for approximately an hour and a half, we went to the Iberia counter to file a complaint. The airline provided us with a receipt that had no logo or much information that could identify them. It should be noted that none of the passengers on this flight received their luggage, so the airline should easily identify what happened. The luggage was finally delivered on the eve of our departure to Rome, which means that we spent our entire stay in Madrid without our luggage. Upon my return to Mexico City, I initiated the process of filing a complaint regarding the inconveniences caused by this airline, and initially, Iberia showed a willingness to provide a refund. They requested my bank account information and copies of the expenses incurred. However, after I sent them all the required information, they stopped responding to my emails, and my calls went unanswered.

### "we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing"
My wife and I had spent 8 months planning a trip for our family of five. We had flight confirmation for all of us with American Airlines and were flying out of Boston to Barcelona with Iberia which was part of the booking. When we arrived in Boston for our flights to Barcelona, we were told by the Iberia agent that four of our family members had boarding passes but one of our daughters did not have a confirmed pass. I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia). We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston. The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss. We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point. The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal. All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter. It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave. So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter. I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we all did not have boarding passes. I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen. The agent said that "Yes, there is room on the flight" but that we need to book the flight with American. At this point, we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing with them and it was getting close to the time that they were shutting the doors for the flight. Another Iberia agent was calling American for us and we were told that there was now someone waiting for us at American Airlines counter at the other terminal. We ran back again to the American Airlines counter and talked with an agent who, within three minutes, pulled up the information showing - Here is my flight information with all five family members showing each was "ticketed" and confirmed for all of the flights.

### "Denied Boarding at Check-in counter"
Denied Boarding at Check-in counter. Reason given, the return flight was beyond 90-day stay limit. It didn't matter that I had a flexible schedule and was planning on booking a return flight when my plans were finalized during the trip. This has been my practice over the past 7 years. In this instance, a trainee informed me I couldn't board. When I asked the supervisor why Iberia sold me a ticket she would not honor, she repeated herself several times citing the 90-day rule and exasperated that I questioned her authority, took our boarding passes and with a flourish, hands high over her head, tore them to pieces proclaiming loudly that "You are not flying today! When I asked to talk to her supervisor, she climbed on the baggage scale, so she could look down on me and with arms held high, triumphantly shouted, "I AM THE BOSS! My wife was traveling with me but had a different return date within the 90-day window. I got out my phone to document the incident with a video recording. That spooked her and she went back to her seat and said she didn't remember her name, etc.. Filing complaints with Iberia, Massport, FAA, Congress.

### "they tell me I’m on standby"
Issues started with online check-in. The website had an error and I was unable to check in. I show up at the counter and they tell me I’m on standby, because they overbooked the flight by 20 people, and apparently seats are first come first serve even for a confirmed ticket. Agents tried to rebook, but the next available flight was 2 days away, which was after the event that I was traveling for. To top it off, I have to call for a refund, they won’t automatically refund unless you request it.

### "I'll never fly Iberia again"
One of the worst experiences I've had with an airline. The flight was overbooked by 20-30 people but Iberia choose not to fill up business class, and people were bumped involuntarily. Customer service was at the other end of the airport, and no extra staff was called. Waited in line for 1.5-2 hours, ensuring that nobody could make alternative flights. CS agent was extremely dismissive and couldn't be bothered to explain anything, including that some of us couldn't get EU compensation in the airport. Stood in line for about 5.5 hours, waiting for luggage, vouchers that didn't work, shuttle that didn't come, call center who hung up on me etc. The hotel Iberia took us to was 2 stars, in the middle of nowhere. Exciting to see how long it'll take to get compensation. I'll never fly Iberia again.

### "delayed by two days"
Not Verified |  Flight from Santiago to Madrid delayed by two days, connection flight from Madrid to Toulouse lost, had to spend two days looking for urgent accommodation to stay until next flight. What a loss of money and time.

### "no customer service here"
From start to finish, I have had a terrible experience with Iberia. Last month, when making a booking I was unable to use Iberia's website because it was not working and made a reservation with an agent over the phone. The agent assured me that everything was confirmed and that I was good to go. I asked him at least 3 times before ending the call if there was anything else that I needed and he assured me that the email I had received with my booking number was sufficient. Fast forward to the day before my flight (today). I went to check-in and I was unable to do so online. I thought this was strange so called the airline directly and was told that my credit card information must not have gone through. I am currently still on the phone with a second customer service agent (the first one hung up on me and refused to listen or support me). This has now been going on for over 12 hours and I have been hung up on, I have been told to call different numbers; all 8 agents I’ve spoken with have been incompetent. I even went to the airport in person and they don’t open until 4pm when the primary Spain office is closed. There is absolutely no customer service here, potentially not even real people. Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra to fly with a competent airline that knows how to properly book flights for their customers and provide correct information.

### "a very good value for money"
The flight was 33 minutes late but arrived only 5 minutes late that was a good surprise for such a late flight. The boarding was speedy, the crew was very nice and the plane was new so in all a very good value for money.

### "a satisfying flight"
Overall a satisfying flight. Departed late but recovered for on time arrival. All ground services efficient, crew was nice and professional. The aircraft interior is modern and clean. No Inflight Entertainment, but for a short flight it makes no difference.

### "I was denied boarding passes"
I had booked flights under different companies, the one that traveled from Erie to Boston was American Airlines, and the one that travels from Boston to Venice was under Iberia. The airline that arrived in Boston was a bit delayed so I rushed over to check in for the trip. The attendants at the podium for boarding asked for completely useless information while withholding boarding passes. They asked for the return trip of when I return to the United States and the names under the booking which I provided fully. I attempted to show the record locator multiple times to which I was shut down and ignored. Eventually after 30 minutes of bickering, after I provided all information required of me and explained how I had multiple layovers, they told me that the flight was completely booked and that the seats were full. I had purchased the ticket in February for a seat, there was absolutely no way that the flight was full. I was denied boarding passes and ultimately entry to the flight.

### "waiting for a resolution"
I booked a business class ticket with Iberia for a holiday trip to my home country. At first, I was overjoyed to find such a good deal. However, my joy quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that I had been double charged for the same flight. I contacted Iberia, and they claimed it was a mistake from their end. Despite this, fixing the issue proved to be a daunting task. Every time I called them, I received different responses, and the problem persisted. Eventually, I contacted my bank to dispute the transaction, and only then did Iberia respond. They canceled both of my tickets, even though the mistake was theirs. They claimed both charges were legitimate, despite providing proof that the tickets were suspended. After making numerous phone calls to Iberia, I was told that the flight might be canceled. However, if I did not ask, I would not have received a refund. I was also informed that the two tickets were valid and non-refundable, which was not the case. It is unacceptable for a large airline like Iberia to charge a customer for two non-existent tickets. To make matters worse, I am still waiting for a resolution to my problem. It has been a never-ending cycle of claims, phone calls, and false promises. I was originally supposed to receive an email about my claim, but after a week and four phone calls, I was informed that Iberia does not send emails about claims.

### "cramped seats made it uncomfortable"
The state of the aircraft being dirty is unacceptable and reflects poorly on maintenance and hygiene standards. The cramped seats made it uncomfortable to move or eat without squeezing yourself, which is not ideal for a long-haul flight. The quality of the food served to me on the flight was disappointing, with the breakfast roll being inedible, and a lack of choice of juices was also inconvenient. The fact that only red wine and beer were available as beverages is surprising, and not having any other options is a major letdown.

### "I'd recommend not purchasing anything extra"
Not Verified |  Flight was fine. Made good time. Annoying captain interruptions. Every 30 mins unnecessarily. Fasten seatbelts for first 2-3 hrs, again very little turbulence for 20 mins after take-off. That would give it 4 stars out of 5. But I paid for extra leg room. And my seat wasn't saved. I had a normal seat. My return trip had the correct seat, this happened to another women beside me as well. Even though I had already paid 200 approximately for the leg room. They try to sell it to you again once you have your boarding pass the night before. I'm sure they'd gladly take your money 3-5xs and not give you the services. They don't care about you. When you call they agree they messed up and they tell you to fill out a complaint form. Why so it can sit there in cyber space. I'm sure they'd get right on getting your money back to you. Yeah right. I told the lady on the phone to get lost. My credit card will get it back for me. I'd recommend not purchasing anything extra. You probably won't get it.

### "most uncomfortable"
This has to be the most uncomfortable travel experience. No free catering and a seat pitch that resulted in me being unable to sit without hitting the seat in front. Not possible to pick a seat without payment.

### "finally agreed to put us in a taxi"
Extremely disappointed with Iberia’s customer service. Our flight from Valencia to Malaga was cancelled after we had already boarded, I’m assuming for mechanical issues. We were making a connection in Malaga to go on to Casablanca. They offered limited options to us, none of which would have happened until the next day! They finally agreed to put us in a taxi for 3.5 hours to Madrid, arriving about 4:30 am, and then departing about 11:30 am. We asked for a place to rest for a few hours. The customer service personnel instead thought they were being generous by giving us vouchers to use for breakfast “at any of the food places in the airport” which proved to be untrue as most places wouldn’t accept them. I understand the mechanical problem was not their fault but they could have accommodated us with access to the VIP lounge at no cost to them.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Not Verified | Iberia is somewhere between average and budget airline. Seats were comfortable in economy. Entertainment was great with movies and games. There was plenty of overhead space for carry on luggage. I saw the crew come through the cabin twice, once for each meal. The airline cancelled seat assignments at some point, but did not refund my $120. I requested kid meals at check in but they did not provide them.

### "I experienced 45 mins delay"
I experienced 45 mins delay with no communication given to passengers before boarding. No water was offered while passengers were waiting onboard for the airplane to get clearance to take off. Trolleys are regularly boarded as luggage due to lack of space - creating additional delays. I will try to avoid it in the future.

### "improving year after year"
Everything went smooth on first leg. Check-in in RIO, lounge in RIO (American Airlines), boarding, cleanliness of aircraft, large choice of movies, very friendly crew. As usual Iberia only offers Spanish wines, no Champagne (only CAVA), but it is a detail. Lounge in MAD was excellent, with fabulous showers. Short flight to MRS was 40 mn delayed due to traffic. Nice food on board again. Iberia Business Class is improving year after year, being better than BA and matching with LH one; however AF/KL are a level above (prices also).

### "I asked her to make an exception"
Not Verified | My flight from Geneva to Madrid got delayed and only left me 55 minutes to make my connection in Madrid to Miami. I called customer support the day before to have them change my flight to make it back to Miami on Saturday night because I had to work on Sunday. They refused to change my flight because the minimum connection time was 55 minutes. I asked her to make an exception and she said she was texting her supervisor and he said no. She then hung up on me. My flight from Geneva to Madrid got delayed 25 minutes leaving me only 30 minutes for the connection. I called support again and asked them to put me on another flight as I have to make it back to Miami on Saturday and I was once again met with a representative that was not helpful at all.

### "rather take another airline"
Buying this as a codeshare from American was the first of many mistakes. Premium Economy on American allows you to pick a seat but as a codeshare, Iberia prevents seat selection, except for a price, not disclosed when buying on American. American tried their best to help but to no avail. Even OneWorld HQ in London could get no response from Iberia. I was told repeatedly by Iberia just to go to the airport on the day of the flight. On the flight, I was offered a dinner choice of beef or pasta, my beef was the toughest I have tried cutting. The crew seemed happy among themselves but otherwise dispirited. A sad change from the days when one boarded an Iberia flight and felt that one was instantly transported to Spain. Despite the non-stop convenience from Boston to Madrid, I would rather take another airline and have a better experience for the money.

### "I was sorely disappointed"
Hoping for better on the return leg of this roundtrip, I was sorely disappointed. The boarding process was chaotic - everyone lined up in the jetway and then delayed as wheelchairs were wheeled slowly past us. My outbound experience with being unable to reserve a seat (the American codeshare should have entitled me to American premium economy options which Iberia ignores and wants to charge for) was repeated. Fortunately I arrived at the airport so early that I was given an aisle. As I had waited for boarding, I heard from several other travelers who had booked directly on Iberia in coach and premium economy with the same seat selection complaints and even worse: they had been assigned seats well before but were changed at the airport for no reason, even having paid the assignment fee. The food from Madrid was just as bad as from Boston. My choices were beef and pasta. I was seated in the second row of premium economy and there was only pasta after the first row of 7 people had made selections. The pasta contained some pasta and a wilted indeterminate vegetable with sauce, lots of sauce. The end-of-flight snack was equally poor - a soft roll with pressed white something in it, probably turkey but certainly not Serrano or Iberico ham. What I can say is that the flight arrived ahead of schedule, non-stop, and I was thrilled to be back home. Next time no codeshare and no Iberia.

### "Big inconvenience"
We flew Business class on Iberia from Lisbon to Madrid. The only thing great was priority line at check-in and boarding. Nothing else. Upon arrival in Madrid, all my family's bags arrived. EXCEPT MINE. They couldn't locate it for the entirety of my holiday. I had to purchase clothes and toiletries - day by day! Big inconvenience. Unnecessary expenses.

### "my suitcase did not arrive"
I flew from Madrid to Alicante on 19th February, my suitcase did not arrive. After 5 days they have not been able to get my suitcase. I have spent hours on the phone,  I have lost tons of money buying clothes for work, wasted countless hours and 5 days later same situation. Tomorrow i go back to Dubai and I have no idea if this airline will ever deliver my suitcase.

### "assistance is really poor"
Not Verified | They lost my luggage 5 days ago, the assistance is really poor, every time I reach out I get different information, they cant even tell me if they know if it lost or not, they provide no solution.

### "told me that I need a mask"
I was denied boarding to flight number IB3673 this morning from Berlin-Madrid. The lady at the gate told me that I need a mask but I had none with me, I only had it in my checked in luggage, so i went to buy one at the cafe. When I arrived back to the gate I waited there to board and they told me that they closed the gate already and my checked in luggage is being transported back from the aircraft. I find this outrageous. I was in time at the airport I checked in at 5:30 so I was not late at all! The staff was unorganized so now I had to book another flight for 110€ with a stop in London and I also lost 60€ for my accomodation in Madrid.

### "hung up on even while I was still speaking"
I have not flown with Iberia yet so I can't speak for the cabin experience but had a horrible experience with their customer service agents. Calling them incompetent is an understatement. I have been hung up on even while I was still speaking more than three times. It took over an hour each with three different agents (including being disconnected while speaking and being on hold) so totalling over three hours for a simple date change request, and they couldn't even get that done. I made a reservation on 6/3 online and called to request a date change since it couldn't be done online. As stated prior, it took me more than three hours with three different agents to get it done, at least I thought it was done. However, when I called to request an updated e-ticket, I was told that the date change hasn't been made so I had to go through another several hours to get that done and received an updated email with reissued e-ticket. But when I called them last November, they told me all my reservations have been cancelled and I had to choose a new date withouth even an explanation on why it was cancelled in the first place. I have written to Iberia's customer relations for a resolution and they simply responded two weeks later that it had been forwarded to the respective department. Now it's January and I haven't heard anything from Iberia. Don't think about getting any assistance or help from their customer service call center because you won't get any.

### "honors its contract with passengers"
Overall the airline honors its contract with the passengers. The seats are not comfortable and space and room falls short of expectations. Flight attendants do the necessary to accommodate passenger needs, but they will not go out of their way to help you more that the square in which they are trained. Food is decent. Hydration also. Movie menu is good. They keep to their schedule.

### "their policy is cheques only"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Iberia again. They lost my luggage and acknowledged it but the only way they will pay compensation is via a cheque which cannot be banked in our country. I tried to get them to pay by bank transfer but their ‘policy’ is cheques only and New Zealand and Australia are cheque free for the past two years. Insurance will only cover once payment received from Airline. Iberia get with this decade and change your policy.

### "a very positive experience"
Not Verified |  Came back home from TLV to Chicago via Madrid. It was a surprising experience, which was mixed. Queue at Bengurion airport for pre check-in security screening was insane, almost 2 hours. Then at check-in they let us know we needed a mask and we were downgraded to premium economy due to an aircraft switch from Iberia to Level. Bearing in mind Lufthansa and KLM have A320 on this route, I do not see that as an issue, especially since I was travelling on mileage. She apologized. Had to stop at the duty free to buy a mask. Skipped the lounge as I went straight to gate for boarding. The seat was not that bad, pre-departure drink. Staff really courteous. Meal ok. The staff was available for request, and the in flight entertainment was ok. Remote stand. Off boarding was delayed, because there was a passenger who was extradited to Spain who had to be off boarded first, which caused delays. Security screening in Madrid efficient. Getting to the S gates was ok got into the lounge. Very good lounge, better than Lufthansa with good food selection decent drink choices. Crowded but not too bad. Boarding efficient. Staff on board excellent. The purser was really lovely very friendly. He was originally from Britain and he really cared. The crew with him was a mix of senior and less senior and they were professional. Not over intrusive. Excellent meal service. Excellent wine list. Sleeping and resting was comfortable. Landing at O'Hare long walk to immigration. Not long queue, one of the luggage did not make it. For Iberia's defence there was a lady from Iberia at the baggage carousel who gave me a form to fill. Got notified 2 days later that my bag will arrive to Chicago and on Monday 1/1 received the bag at home. Not sure why it took 5 days to deliver, but that was really the spoiler in otherwise a very positive experience. Would give them a try again.

### "last time I am flying with Iberia"
The trip from LAX to Madrid (11 hours) was so uncomfortable, the crew was not attentive and very rude tome. I asked one of the crew for water to take my medication first she ignored me and after I insisted that I have to take my medication and need water, finally she gave me small cup of water with a bad attitude. The bathrooms were very dirty, no paper. This was my first and most certainly the last time I am flying with Iberia.

### "Any kind of service was painfully slow"
Not Verified |  The aisle space was so tiny I believe it could be dangerous in an emergency situation. I couldn't even drag my small, carry-on suitcase through the normal way; I had to turn it on its side. The seats were arranged 3-4-3, a setup I haven't even seen on larger planes. It's greedy and ridiculous. In an emergency situation it's probably downright dangerous. We were packed in so tightly that we couldn't even get out without the person in the aisle seat having to move, or bend over to pick up items on the floor. My mom had pain and cramps the whole time from being jammed in so tightly. The PA barely worked so no one could properly hear what the captain was saying, and free wifi was advertised, but only actually given to people in business and first class. Everyone else had to pay extra if they wanted it. Any kind of service was painfully slow, probably due to the small aisles. However, the food was actually very good and the entertainment selection wasn't bad. We also weren't sent our boarding passes until a few hours before the flight, causing unnecessary anxiety. Additionally, we were forced to wear our masks for an 8-hour transatlantic flight. According to the CDC, wearing a mask while sleeping can be hazardous to your health and that's just what most people like to do on airplanes, especially long flights. If you want to feel like a human being and not a rat in a sewer, don't fly Iberia unless you're getting business or first class.

### "Iberia provided a good flight"
Iberia provided a good flight, on time, clean airplanes, did not miss the connecting flight despite short time. The boarding on the bombardiers is a bit messy, all the people just standing on the Tarmac, leaving the suitcases unattended. It is a nice carrier but it tends to overbook, meet a few costumers that has that problem

### "Very nice staff"
Porto to Turin via Madrid. Nice airplane, flights on Time. Very nice staff people, was a good flight and was very well impressed with the timing and the amount of effort to make customer feel ok.

### "Iberia is an absolute nightmare"
Never ever again! After having 2 bad experiences I was giving it another chance after years. That was a huge mistake. I’m travelling a lot and Iberia is an absolute nightmare.

### "no one has taken responsibility"
My flight was with a connection from Tel Aviv via Madrid to Bogota. When I arrived in Bogota, I waited for my suitcase, and after seeing it was not coming, I went to their counter. Their representative told me my suitcase did not board the plane in Madrid due to lack of space and he guaranteed that it would arrive at the address I will provide them. I told them that my final destination was going to be in another city, and the representative promised they would deliver it to the address that I'm providing them. I should note that beyond that, they didn't give me any information about what to do during this time, and they didn't provide me with essential hygienic equipment to get by until my suitcase arrived. They only promised the suitcase would arrive at my house in 3 days. When I got home, I realized that I needed to purchase underwear, shoes, and basic hygiene products at this time in order to have something to wear, and I didn't know how much they covered. The next day I called customer service. I waited a long time in line until their representative answered me. I explained the situation to her, and when I asked her what the amount of expenses they participate in, and she literally told me the following thing: "I don't know what to tell you. You can Google it. The next day I called again because it had already been three days and my suitcase still hadn't arrived as promised. I got another agent, and she didn't know what to say either. She only apologized and couldn't transfer the call to the manager! It wasn't until the fourth day that an independent delivery company reached out to me and told me that they had my suitcase and that I had to get to the airport to pick it up physically! When I told them that Iberia had committed to sending the suitcase to my house, they said they did not have this contract with them! And again, no response from Iberia customer service! To Iberia customer service department - luggage department - zero empathy and no customer service to find a solution. Angry, disappointed, and exhausted, I had to leave the city and take a long drive to the airport, go and back! And to pay with my own money for the ride! And if all this is not enough, I received the suitcase damaged. I came out of this experience disappointed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service from any company. I tried to contact them through all channels, but there is no answer, and no one has taken responsibility and tried to correct this injustice.

### "issue is with their baggage service"
Iberia’s flight and service were great. The issue is with their baggage service. They delivered over 1.5 hours after landing leading to missing a connecting flight. The next available flight was the next day. Had to pay for one night at a hotel and breakfast. Iberia would not reimburse the cost.

### "no safety demos"
Typical unimpressive inter-European business class seating starts it off. Attendants chatting amongst themselves the whole time. Biggest issue was no safety demos or pre landing announcements were made, no seat belt checks. Food was good, definitely an upgrade from previous times.

### "changed my flight unilaterally"
Not Verified | Terrible experience with Iberia, they have changed my flight unilaterally and the company has not been charged for the expenses generated by their cause, I will never fly with Iberia again due to their terrible work and poor resolution of the problems that they themselves they generated. | Pésima experiencia con Iberia Airline, , me han cambiado el vuelo de forma unilateral y la compañía no se ha cargado de los gastos generados por su causa, nunca más volveré a volar con Iberia por su pésimo trabajo y poca resolución de los problemas que ellos mismo generaron.

### "I was mistreated by the counter personnel"
Not Verified |  I planned my trip to Spain on the first week of September traveling with American Airlines and Iberia (Miami-NY-Madrid-Alicante Sep 3-4th). I've even paid to Iberia for seats that were not honored. The trip from NY to Madrid (9 hours) was so uncomfortable that short distance buses are way more comfy, the crew was not attentive, the food was surprisingly good (or I was so hungry at that point). On September 11th for my return trip I was mistreated by the counter personnel, a lady who sent me with very bad attitude to the end of a wrong line. When I got to the counter, she angrily told me that the flight was closed and I was standing in the wrong line, the attitude was supported by the Supervisor. Even though I had to pay for a return ticket (1,200 dls) I was relieved to not be traveling by Iberia, awful experience!

### "rudest, most abrasive staff"
Worst airline we've ever flown! And that's saying something after having travelled to over 35 countries, flying thousands of miles on dozens of airlines. Both this flight and the other Iberia flight saw us encounter what were quite possibly the rudest, most abrasive airline staff since the Wright Brothers first imagined themselves taking flight. Customer service? Forget it. To be fair, the Spanish seem to have zero concept of "hospitality" even within the tourism sector yet somehow Iberia's (in particular) ground staff even managed to surpass our lowest expectations. Legitimate medical exemptions are completely disregarded even after being told by check-in staff to present said exemption at the boarding gate. You will be treated with arrogance, indifference, hostility and then denied boarding while some lackey on a power trip asks the captain of the plane if you're allowed to board. Given the airline's own policy states that you are, of course the captain has the good sense to say 'yes'. Complete and utter fail in every facet of customer service. If 0/10 was possible, it would be too high a score.

### "seem to not be super competent"
Munich to Talara via Madrid, Lima. I flew with Iberia from Munich via Madrid and Lima to Talara (Peru). The last stint was operated by Latam. The flights itself were fine and on time, the food was decent, there could have been more service during the long haul flight. The customer service however is an absolute nightmare. It started with their agent at Munich airport. He assured me multiple times during the checking that my bags were checked all the way to Talara and as proof gave me the bag tags with destination “TY”. I asked multiple times whether I had to take out the bags in Lima to clear customs and he declined. In Talara my bags weren’t there. I filed the form with the staff at the small local airport and ever since (3 days now) am waiting for my bags. Since Latam operated the last flight it is their responsibility to retrieve the luggage according to Iberia. That has been their standpoint during all calls I made. Latam however says they are only retrieving the bags out of curtesy since they were supposed to clear customs in Lima - hence not their fault that they weren’t on the flight. After I saw Talara airport I was sure that the information given to me in Munich was false. Talara is a small domestic airport with no customs. If international baggage could be checked all the way here smuggling would be super easy. I still have no idea how this fact was not known by the agent in Munich. As a customer you feel helplessly lost between two companies which both blame each other for being responsible. I would have expected more from Iberia's customer service than stubbornly repeating that it is Latam's responsibility. Especially since right now the baggage seems to be stuck in Lima with Iberia and the Talara airport stuff says that there are problems receiving the luggage from them for transport. In summary: fly with them but triple check any information their agents give you - it might be plainly false and you have no proof or anything if you simply rely on their spoken advice. Funny sidenote: only after the third call to their customer service they admitted the baggage should have been retrieved in Lima. They overall seem to not be super competent regarding their core business.

### "Waiting for my baggage for 4 days"
Tel Aviv to Mexico City via Madrid. Iberia you are the worst airline company ever. I don't know how you still have people who fly with you. Waiting for my baggage for 4 days and still no answer after I gave the location of the baggage. I am in surf trip without my surfboard, I even spoke with the flight staff to let them know that my baggage isn't on the flight, they tell "when you arrived to Mexico City check it".

### "everything went very smooth"
Read the reviews before I travel with Iberia airline and prepare my family of 4 for the unexpected. Surprisingly everything went very smooth for my family both was. My family will fly with them again next Spain holiday.

### "2 days before the flight they denied the dog"
If anyone ever wants or needs to transport a pet with Iberia airlines don’t do it! T I verified the day I booked with them that the dog was good to come back and have multiple emails regarding the dog and 2 days before the flight they denied the dog. They changed the reasoning several times. Different responses each time. So long story short I had to repurchase new tickets to return home. They refused to help me at all. I even got hung up on 2 times once by a supervisor.

### "placed in random seats on the back"
Be cautious when booking. I paid in advance $40 per ticket to choose my seats (two window and two aisle on the same row 28) and was placed in random seats on the back. There were no excuses, no compensation and they would not issue me a refund. The excuse via email was that when the plane configuration changes the seat assignments may change as well. The plane had not changed and I was seated in a middle seat, first row. The tray table was broken, the screen would slide down continuously and I had no room for my personal belongings. Avoid flying Iberia and if you must, be very cautious because they are sneaky without shame.

### "been waiting 3 days for our bags"
We used flight credits from their previous stuff ups to fly to Morocco. Flights were changed and canceled. 2 hour delays at the airport when we finally got to fly. We had to rearrange our accommodations which of course cost $$$ to take new flights and pay more for these. Then when we left Marrakesh the attendant at the checkin counter forced me to check in my carry on. Told me I could not board if I didn’t as it was a full flight. I told her we had a 40 minute transfer in Madrid and that I was worried our bags would not come with us. She assured me they would, now we are in Croatia and have been waiting 3 days for our bags. Totally ruined our time here as we have to stay at our accommodations in case they show up. No answering phones, no replies to messages, no response to lost baggage claims. Thank you so much Iberia for your pathetic attitude to the customers that keep you in the air. Never ever ever again will I fly with you.

### "unhelpful and not service oriented"
Where to begin, I guess at the beginning. At check-in their computers were down, so it took a long time to check our luggage in and get boarding passes. Very unhelpful and not service oriented - I pulled up the health screener of my final destination, TLV, but it was not in a format they wanted so they said I would not fly if I couldn't pull it up. 3. Poor customer service. My seats from Madrid to TLV could not be assigned in DFW because they have subcontracted employees without full rights. Our first flight from DFW to Madrid got delayed, which is not a huge deal, but it got delayed even further because they could not match the passenger list with the amount of people on board. The flight crew could not understand the delay either, which they expressed to the passengers. Madrid to TLV was ok. TLV to Madrid 8/12 flight got moved up, I had to change my itinerary, customer service number would hang up on me. I could not find Iberia employees at the airport. Flight delayed and unprofessional - We were told the computers were down, they used a different airplane, and that we could sit anywhere. Then the "musical chairs game began. They started moving passengers left and right to balance the plane, just during take off and landing, then we could go back to our seats. The crew looked confused and dumb, like they didn't know what they were doing (because they didn't). Uncaring and very poor customer service - At Madrid they would not even consider putting me in an earlier flight, after disrupting my schedule, that was operated by AA on Iberia’s behalf because according to the Iberia agent: “They won’t give money to AA for taking you back.” At my arrival in DFW my luggage never arrived, despite being there way early, and the agent they had was again a subcontracted employee without access to their system, very young and untrained. He provided me with a handwritten form to fill out, no reference number was given to me. I did that and left because I was exhausted. 9a. Went to the airport the next day, Iberia’s counter was nowhere to be found, no employee available, nothing, just a ghost airline! The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.” She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself. Granted the airport has no available personnel if there is not a flight they are working, they don’t have a local office or nothing like that.

### "lack of communication"
After boarding and taxying at Quito  we were stuck for two hours before the pilot said we had an engine failure and had to disembark. They then proceeded to make us go through immigration and wait another two hours for luggage. We had to wait for two hours for information on which hotel we were at and another two hours for a bus. No information on when our flight was and if it was even going to leave for nearly 20 hours. Finally we heard from hotel reception that our flight was scheduled for 10 pm at night (29 hours late). We boarded a bus to the airport. The flight was not live on the airport’s departures. When at the airport the check-in for business took 1 hour as the check-in was severely understaffed. The check-in  put the wrong date so we were delayed 30 minutes at immigration while they confirmed the flight even existed. After taking off at 11:30 pm late, the pilot had the audacity to say “we were extremely lucky to be on this flight and that we should thank the technical staff” as we would have had to stay three extra days in Quito had it not been for them as other flights were full”,, merely stating “thank you for your patience”. The lack of communication by the airline was nothing short of abysmal. They lost our luggage on the way to Quito and we had to wait for four days to receive them in the Galapagos one hour before our boat left for 8 days.

### "atrocious customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline has atrocious customer service. Their representatives confidently tell you incorrect information. We called weeks prior to our flight to change from our planned Porto -> Madrid-> Washington to Madrid -> Washington and the customer service person said no problem just get on in Madrid. We asked are you sure because it wasn’t coming through with a cancellation of Porto to Madrid they said no it’s fine, it obviously was not. Today we came to the airport in Madrid and they put us on standby because we were not on the flight from Porto and now stuck waiting in endless lines to just get help in Madrid to go home.

### "shortage of cabin space for suitcases"
Boarding the plane was slow compared to other airlines I have flown with. Once inside the aircraft, it obviously became very, very hot since it's summer and packed with passengers, but the ac unit blew very soft wind, so soft that it was barely enough to cooldown. There was a shortage of cabin space for suitcases and bags in so my nephew was forced to had put his suitcase in the cabin space 20 seats in front of him? The staff didn't even politely ask him or even apologize for the inconvenience. It's either this or you can leave your luggage behind, that's how it felt like. The seats were very small and  were also kind of hard. Luckily the flight was just three hours.

### "arrived at the airport 2 hours before boarding"
Worst airline experience I have had. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before boarding time. Check in took over 2 hours to get to the attendant, and they would not let us through or help in any way even though the flight hadn’t yet closed the gates. She would not help us get another flight. The manager was extremely rude and told us nothing would be done. Customer service was not helpful and we lost all of our money. There is no Iberia help desk in Paris. I have never been treated so disrespectfully. Never again.

### "not credit any more miles with partner airlines"
I have just realised that Iberia will not credit any more miles with partner airlines, or at least not with the AAdvantage program of American Airlines, In the last 3 or 4 flights that I have done with Iberia, the only way I got my miles credited was by requesting the missing miles through AAdvantage, because Iberia never credits them by itself (in contrast with Qatar or British Airways which credit them in a matter of days). Finally, after requesting missing miles once again, AAdvantage sent me a mail denying my request on grounds of "Airline unable to validate". This is despite that I sent the boarding pass issued by Iberia and that my AAdvantage number is printed on the boarding pass itself. It really is disappointing. I believe this is becoming a generalized policy, given the rough times that airlines have gone through since the pandemic.

### "do not fly Iberia"
Not Verified | Madrid to Paris. Booked flight to Europe with American Airlines using miles, they made us use Iberia. I never heard of them before this trip. They lost my luggage and my wife's. Mine somehow made it the connection in Madrid. Hers was still at DFW after take off. I had air tags in each to track the luggage in case they were lost. I had to call the airline everyday to tell them where it was. They were clueless. Absolutely do not fly Iberia, ever. All the bad reviews are true. The customer service agents tell you lies and hang up on you on every call.

### "good experience with this airline"
My latest return trip from Santo Domingo to London via Madrid with Iberia in Row 4 was another good experience with this airline. The business class seats are very comfortable with rows 2 and 4 offering seats next to the window. A mattress of reasonable quality, a good size pillow and a blanket are offered with decent headphones and easy to manage controls for the seat and screen. The food is nothing special but it is not bad but the wines are all from Spain and lack a little delicacy. The crew have always been very efficient but never particularly friendly. Lavatories need cleaning a bit more during the flight, Best of all is the simple transit in Terminal 4S, I have never taken longer than 15 minutes from the arrival gate, through security and to the departure gate .. much longer if you do not continue with planes flying out of other terminals. Never a problem with baggage and my arrival at Heathrow terminal 5 was a good experience with the new scanners in place. Out in about 20 minutes. I am definitely an Iberia fan and a fan on Madrid airport.

### "I find it very annoying being forced to check my carry on luggage"
I find it very annoying spending substantial amounts of money and then being forced, both ways (round trip flight), to check my carry on luggage because of a lack of space on the aircraft. On the outbound, I did not complain as I thought this was an exceptional circumstance. When the same situation presented again on the return flight, I turned upset and I asked how possibly space for carry on luggage are not granted for each passenger, especially considering no mention of this situation is detectable anywhere at the moment of the flight reservation. The response I received was unbelievable: for short and medium distance routes (like mine) Iberia uses probably older aircrafts where space of the above head lockers is calculated as: 1 carry on every 3 seats, I therefore wonder: is it normal or professional avoiding to mention this to the customer at the time of reservation, in light of the fact we are talking about the official air Company of Spain whose tickets are substantially expensive? Wouldn’t be better adapting the aircraft and its space to the current customer needs?

### "The airline has lost our bags"
The airline has lost our bags on the start of a 4 week trip. We were given phone numbers for Havana where no one picks up, twitter response was sarcastic and implied we double check we flew with Iberia, we tried whatsapp and that apparently doesn't deal with baggage issues. The website says our bags can't be found and we tried the UK number with no information available and to be told that our contact details were not even attached to our ticket profile or claim (despite being an Iberia member and long time One World member so details are on everything). Understand that issues happen so not annoyed about that but the appalling customer service and total lack of information is infuriating.

### "come to the airport and hunt them down"
There are no actual live people to take care of any issue. We went in person to the airport to claim our property and no one available. They have a third party company for their check in and even they don’t know any Iberia managers or employees. We apparently have to come to the airport and hunt them down maybe around 3 to 4 to get back our luggage. Unheard of to actually be able to contact someone on the phone. Please stay clear of Iberia.

### "the airline lost our suitcase"
I’m not in the habit of leaving reviews but my husband and I flew back from our honeymoon with Iberia and we are both extremely disappointed with the experience. Primarily because the airline lost our suitcase. This was a shared suitcase so contained most of his clothes, most of my nicest clothes, a lot of which were purchased specifically for the holiday. It also contained other items of both monetary and sentimental value which we are unlikely to ever be able to replace if we don’t get the bag back. We reported it missing at Heathrow and were told we would likely hear something within 24 hours. It’s now been a week and every time we call the phone number we were given, after waiting typically 1 hour on hold, we are just told “there is no information” and no one in the company, no matter how senior, can give us any information about where our case if or if we will ever get it back. This is completely unacceptable to me. We have to wait 21 days before the airline will confirm our bag is lost, meaning we are unsure what we ought to replace and what we should wait for. In addition to this, the flights home (we had a transfer) were very uncomfortable, there was minimal food, no option to buy additional food or drink, and the Wi-Fi didn’t work. The toilets were also all filthy.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified | San Juan to Madrid. The staff are terrible. The treatment is horrible and when you file a complaint nothing happens. Not even an I'm sorry. Worst experience on an airline that I have had ever and I fly a lot. The most disrespectful service ever. Avoid this airline at all cost pay more on another airline to get to Spain if your have to, but please avoid Iberia. Terrible customer service.

### "Still no refund given"
This airline cancelled three flights in a row. They made us go to a terrible resort overnight, then come back to the airport just for the flight to be cancelled and service say they don't open until 7am and they couldn't get us on any flights that day. After this, trying to get our money back has been a nightmare. Still no refund given.

### "so much time and trouble"
Miami to Madrid. If your company wants COVID tests, check them! I went through so much time and trouble and no one even checked them! What a joke. Just remove this requirement.

### "damaged my luggage 22 days ago"
Iberia damaged my luggage 22 days ago and I was told I get a call back the next day! I am in US and their customer service here sucks, knowing I am here they have given me a direct number to their baggage complaints in Spain. Had to call several time to be told to go back on line, costing me $72 for the phone calls. I doubt if anyone is going to call me soon. Beside my luggage their economy seats are so tight. I was trying to get a one way ticket from Malaga to Madrid and went on Iberia site to purchase one. Their system had technical difficulties and wouldn't give me a confirmation code so I logged out from their system and got my ticket from another carrier. The next day I see them sending me a confirmation number. I told the Iberia customer service rep that I was on hold for over 1 hour and nobody picked up the phone for their English language line she still did not give me a full refund and penalized me for asking for a refund $30.

### "I will never fly Iberia again"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service, the airline lost our luggage, I had to call multiple times daily to try and find it. I was sent to a voice mail to leave a message which were never returned. When I did get a customer service agent, I would be redirected multiple times and no answers. This process took 5 days, yes 5 days without luggage. The customer service/baggage claim was no help at all. I finally got help from the airport that did not have any association with Iberia but they took the time to look, and guess what my bag was sitting in their holding area (no-one at Iberia ever called). If it was up to Iberia, I still would not have my luggage. When I arrived home I noticed that my bag was damaged, I call customer service again after 20 minutes on the phone, I got "Sorry, there's nothing we can do". I will never fly Iberia again.

### "really good experience"
I was really looking forward to this flight as I do fly between Madrid and London a lot and Iberia flies also their A330s and even A350 on this route so picking up time to try their A350 was no brainer, Iberia also offers upgrade to business class at check in, you won't get extra miles or extra baggage allowance, but you get full experience, fast track, lounge and of course on board experience. This time it cost 52 Euros, which is a pretty good price and worth paying. I got to airport only 2 hours before as I was busy during the day, checked in my carry on (you can for free) as I was filming this experience as well and went through fast track, which was close at London Heathrow, you only got to skip most of the line. The flight was leaving from Gates C, but there is no lounge there, so I went to BA lounge right after security, which was a bit crowded, but managed to get a seat, got some snack and drink, for hot food you have to use QR code and order online, but didn't have much time as boarding started already. Took me like 15 minutes to get there, but you can board any time using priority lane, unfortunately everyone boarded through one jet bridge, even though there were more doors and it could have been done differently. On board I had seat 3L which was really wide, comfortable and I like that its 1-2-1 so everyone has aisle access which is great, unfortunately my IFE wasn't working so I was moved to 8A which is exactly the same type of seat, most private one which is exactly what I wanted so all good. There is no pillow or blanket on this 2 hours flight which makes sense and no pre departure drink which is lacking a bit. Headphones are good though and I can't complain. Seat in general is very wide and comfortable and I'm sure I would be comfortable to be there for 10 or more hours. Business class passengers also have free Wi-Fi, even though only basic, but better than nothing. Service started around 30-40 minutes and there were two food options, I took a beef and it was good, its served on the tray, but I get that its short flight and for drink I got gin and tonic and coke. Overall happy with service, as for IFE, there are plenty of choices and I'm sure I would have enough things to watch on 10 hours flight. Overall really good experience, just one little thing, crew pretty much always start speaking Spanish and keeps doing it, would be better if they first ask you if you speak Spanish and than try to remember at least for business, I get that economy is too big. Otherwise happy with this airline and A350 is really nice aircraft.

### "three days without my essentials"
I used British Airways and its partners to fly from Barcelona back to London for another flight back to my home city of Atlanta. Not only did the airline lose my suitcase, causing me to almost miss my next flight, but it also had no sense of urgency in getting it back to me once found. The bag was on a flight from London to Atlanta the next day, but no one at the airline bothered to follow up on actually getting it delivered to my home address. I had to call them to check on the status of my bag, at which point they told me it had basically been sitting at the airport for the past two days. The best they could do was schedule a delivery within 48 hours (who knows how many more days it will actually take to get delivered), so I’m going on three days without my essentials. When I asked if I could go to the airport and pick it up, I was advised against doing so. I will never fly British Airways again.

### "have never seen such unhelpful, frankly lazy, and rude customer service"
Not Verified |  The ground crew at check in at the JFK Airport in New York is the worst, without exception, that we have ever encountered! It is unbelievable that an airline could maintain such poor representation of their airline company and in fact they were so bad that somehow there appears to be terrible supervision and management. We flew from JFK-MAD on 6/5/22. The check in process started about 40 minutes after the time on the board and that could be caused by any number of reasons, but despite a long customer line for the full flight and about 6 people milling around behind their counter, no one ever explained anything and didn't even look at any of the passengers in line. When they opened the check in finally and we got to the counter, we were told that there was an additional form to be filled in. We had our passports, COVID shot cards, and had provided all online information on the American Airlines website which is how we booked the flights. We asked for help in understanding what we were to do and the incredibly rudest of the lot, a female actually right in front of us, put her head in her hands and turned to one of her co-workers and said, "and this is how I have to start my day?". We were literally stunned! I have never seen such unhelpful, frankly lazy, and rude customer service ever on other airlines. Hopefully Iberia will start some sort of supervision process. Until then, advise to book another carrier if provided for your route.

### "My worst flight by far"
Not Verified |  One week before our flight from San Francisco to Barcelona my husband got Covid. I was told to email Salud, that was it! Just Salud! I was told to ask for a credit. One month later, nothing. No response, no nothing. I took the trip with some family members. I paid for a more up front seat and was put in a middle seat in the middle of the plane. Flight attendants absolutely useless. Skip the insanity and choose a different airline. All family members were scattered all over the plane. My worst flight by far.

### "told that the ticket was never canceled"
Not Verified | Zurich to Mexico City via Madrid. I bought a round trip ticket with Iberia. Since my travel plans were uncertain, I intentionally bought a ticket that could be rebooked as well as canceled. Four weeks before departure, I wanted to cancel my return flight. I initiated a cancellation twice via telephone customer service (online cancellation not possible). Both times I was verbally confirmed that the return flight was cancelled and the money would be transferred in a few days (written confirmation was not possible). Weeks later I still did not have my money back. Calling customer service again, I was told that the ticket was never canceled and the passenger had not shown up. Therefore, there would be no refund. I took the case further but Iberia customer service ignored me.

### "Save yourself money and stress"
Marseille to Boston via Madrid. Absolutely horrible customer service. Both during check in and while talking to customer service on the phone. At check in they did not allow me to check in due to covid testing policies, even though I had my test scheduled at my stop in Madrid, where they did not require a PCR. The lady forced me to call Iberia to try and find another flight back, and when I did they kept me on hold for more than an hour, and so I had to search for a flight back home on my own. When I called to ask for a refund they did not say anything more than that their system does not allow them to process a refund and would not let me speak to another representative. It was honestly just a very big waste if money for a returning flight I never attended or was helped to find another, and never refunded. Save yourself money and stress DO NOT, book with Iberia.

### "expectations that were not met"
Me hubiese gustado poder dar opinión positiva… La buena reputación de Iberia creo espectativas que no fueron alcanzadas en este caso, el vuelo estuvo retrasado al menos una hora sin ninguna disculpa del capitán o personal de cabina. Desde el principio muy mal organizado el abordaje. Durante el vuelo de una hora, el servicio fue prácticamente inexistente y hasta un vaso de agua parece ser mucho pedir. Fue mi primera y última vez volando con Iberia… una lastima siendo una marca tan icónica que debería ser un standard de calidad representando a toda España. - I would have liked to have been able to give a positive opinion... Iberia's good reputation created expectations that were not met in this case, the flight was delayed for at least an hour without any apology from the captain or cabin crew. From the beginning very poorly organized boarding. During the hour-long flight, service was virtually nonexistent, and even a glass of water seems like too much to ask. It was my first and last time flying with Iberia… a shame as it is such an iconic brand that should be a quality standard representing all of Spain.

### "FA were very strict and cautious"
Not Verified |  The flight started with ome 40 min delay and several passengers tried to board without wearing a mask and the FA were very strict and cautious on it. The meal in business consisted of a choice pasta or vegetarian and there were warm breads. Poor selection of drinks and refills had to be requested. Nearly 40 minutes waiting time in Brussels Airport for the luggage.

### "I will take another airline"
Brussels to Madrid. The experience was of such a kind that next time I will take another airline - the difference in fare between economy and business is substantial so I think passengers are entitled to receive something decent for the amount paid. The breakfast did consist of 2 wrapped packages of 25 g of some cold cuts, one croissant and one small yoghurt - no sign of fruit, jam, butter or decent bread - when asking a second cola zero with ice I got a look if I was asking for a bottle of champagne. Disastrous for business in full - very unfriendly FA - flight took some delay only positive fact was that the gates for connecting flights were announced.

### "The customer service is appalling"
The rudest staff I have ever encountered. First time on Iberia. They lost my bag and would not help me to find it. The staff were rude. Never again and please avoid Iberia if you can. The customer service is appalling.

### "this was the first on Iberia - and the last"
I have flown business class to Europe regularly from Panama and return over the last 10 years, using all the European airlines that cover the trip, all the American and even South American this was the first on Iberia - and the last. The plane was 5.5 years old. Seat, very little storage, very thin padding, I had to sit on my pillow to make it comfortable. Service, no menu, no pre dinner drinks, food served all on one tray covered in foil and plastic wrap. No real explanation of what the food was. No after dinner drinks. I asked for a scotch and I was told that they weren't sure whether it was available. IFE was poor. Offered 30 mins of complimentary WiFi, it did not work. Sleep was impossible due to crew constantly using the toilet at the rear of the BC cabin. Although the toilet was not cleaned until just before we landed and deteriorated during the 10 hour flight. No toiletries available in WC apart from soap. Cabin too warm even for my partner who like me has lived in the tropics for 10 years. No hot towels, no cold towels. Breakfast was lukewarm at best and it consisted of an inedible omelet thing, 3 bread rolls same as for dinner, no butter, a pot if jam, fruit and yogurt, the latter being at least edible. Overall the staff seemed non-interested in the customers and I do not think I have been more disappointed in an expensive business class ticket. I would have been disappointed if it had been economy, but for overall value, very poor.

### "beyond terrible"
Madrid to Palma. This comes as an "I really had enough" review. After other many experiences with lost bags, damaged bags without repair, terrible customer service, Avios points not automatically loaded 50% of the time and it goes on. On the last occasion, I bought a business ticket in order to have free changes. I needed to change the date, I have spent 45 minutes over 3 call centres that asked me to call one another. No one was able to change it. Until the last operator, that wanted to charge me as I was not doing the change online, even if I repeatedly let all know then system on line was telling me online was not possible! The operator told me that I needed to go to the airport. Zero empathy along the 45 minutes and the 4 different operators. They just didn't care and this is always true every time I had to call them. I had to go to the airport and got it changed at the ticket desk! All this with a business ticket. Now imagine the other times when I flew economy. How the company keeps on doing this, I don't know.

### "70 euros when we carried our bag"
They don't let you check in until 2 hours before the flight and created a huge line. On the way here we missed our connecting flight because they were scheduled too close together and they blamed us. They forced us to check our carry on bag and charged us 70 euros when we carried our bag on the previous flight. It was bought as a carry on bag and they refused to let us carry it on without paying. The flight attendants ignore call lights. Couldn't get a drink of water on a 7 hour flight. Worst airline ever. Don't fly with them if you want a relaxing, stress free flight.

### "totally unempathetic and unhelpful"
Iberia’s website says that dogs are allowed up to a certain weight. We booked the trip through Iberia and believe we can travel with our dog. Show up at LAX and are told “no”, Service dogs only. Turns out Iberia had contracted the flight to LEVEL and didn’t make that clear to us. The ticket only mentioned LEVEL in Spanish. The rest of the ticket was in English. I call customer service but they want to charge me a $500 penalty fee because we didn’t notice that, at the bottom of the pet policy page, there’s a section about how LEVEL doesn’t allow pets and Iberia and LEVEL are BFFs. Anyway we had to scramble to get a different flight (through Swiss, wonderful service) to Madrid instead because it was the only other flight to Spain that day from LAX. All in all, with cancellation fees for hotels and the more expensive Swiss ticket, we lost about $1,000, maybe more. Customer service was totally unempathetic and unhelpful. Horrible experience.

### "getting off the plane was even worse"
Not Verified |  The boarding process took a very long time. When we landed they gave a great explanation in Spanish about their procedures of getting off the plane. Never once did the attendant say them in English. When I got up with my bag and made it down the walk way to get off, a female flight attendant stopped me to wait for business class. When she turned around and saw everyone was standing behind me she proceeded to cross her arms and shove into me to keep walking. The boarding process took long, but getting off the plane was even worse. Just because you are cheap does not give you room to be rude.

### "did not perform the safety briefing"
One of the worst airlines I’ve ever traveled with. The extra legroom seats are a total joke, and legroom in the normal seats is atrocious. The staff were very unprofessional. Passengers with luggage in front of their feet in the first row of the sections, window blinds down, seats reclined, and tray tables out, all during takeoff. The flight attendant on our side did not perform the safety briefing at all. He was too busy messing with overhead baggage and it wasn’t until we took off that I realized he hadn’t done it.

### "They lost my baggage"
The flight was really uncomfortable, expensive and they do not have vegetarian food (only if you choose in advance). They lost my baggage and are not able to give me any sort of information on it, and they cannot give me information on how much I will be compensated.

### "Their customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Iberia again. I tried to cancel a ticket, was given a case number and told I would get a refund, 45 days later I am told that I will not get a refund, that I am just out nearly 1,000 euros. Their customer service is horrible, they charge for everything under the sun. Never again will I fly Iberia, signed a former Iberian Plus member.

### "Most bizarre and ridiculous booking experience"
Most bizarre and ridiculous booking experience. I purchased a ticket on their website that was listed in Euro (112.6 Euro), but then got the receipt, which was in pound (112.6 Sterling). I am from the USA and that resulted in approximately $20 difference. Twenty dollars was not much to get worked up about, but it was so absurd that I had to call. After much back on forth with representative, I was told I would be credited the difference. However, when I got my credit card bill a month later, I realized that the representative had actually given me a credit for 112.6 Euro. That drove me to the website to see if I still had my ticket. Sure enough, my booking no longer existed. So basically I ending up paying $20 to not have a ticket and by this time tickets had almost doubled in price. At this point, I have spent hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. Even if the mistake is so obvious, the customer representatives have resisted doing anything about it. Finally, after much nagging, they agreed to look further into it and get back to me in a week. In the meantime, no ticket. A fiction writer could not have come up with a more bizarre set of circumstances. Finally, I just bought another ticket since otherwise I would be stranded and hope they will reimburse me back to original price plus the $20 difference. We will have to see. I am certainly worried about what this will mean for the actual flight. Maybe they will accidently book my seat in the cockpit and send my baggage back to the departing city.

### "worst in customer service"
Not Verified |  Zürich to Madrid. Is the worst airline in customer service and loyalty program. I’ve been flying with them weekly since September 2021 and I put at least one claim every month. And forget about calling, waiting times of 20 mins and not a single time they solved my problem.

### "be sure you book with Iberia and not LEVEL"
Not Verified |  Since LEVEL is now a part of Iberia the customer service is non-existent. Be advised if you need to make any changes to the flight or any COVID cancellations will not be honored. Other than that, be sure you book with Iberia and not LEVEL as they do not serve the same food on board and you may be left without eating the entire flight.

### "customer support is the worst"
I had to cancel previous flights due to covid from what I got some redeemable codes. Those codes could only be used on Iberia, even if the same flight in Vueling is 50% cheaper you need to book it on Iberia. The flight did not cost the total amount I had in my code, which I was going to use to book some seats as I'm 198cm. To my surprise, check-in is done on Vueling which means that my whole plan went to the garbage as the codes and money I have sitting on Iberia cannot be used on Vueling. Trying to fix this issue with customer support, I call once Iberia Express getting hung up by the automatic answers without speaking to a person, the same result after calling Iberia customer support and 5min on the phone waiting for nothing. After this, I decided to try the WhatsApp chat, which take me 10 min to make the automatic answers formulary to understand my problem, and when I finally get a real person on my chat, I get as an answer one line saying: "the code can only be used on Iberia". Iberia don't care about the customer and customer support is the worst I have seen.

### "fabulous crew on board"
Excellent Velazquez lounge in Madrid, with real meal. Very quick boarding, and fabulous crew on board. Covid precautions well enforced. 3 points might be improved: Entertainment system is outdated, with an extremely limited choice of movies as well as poor flight tracking. Seat cushion is much too hard, and access to baggage compartment is nearly impossible. Too high.

### "passengers were stuck in immigration"
Not Verified | Huge line in the airport because the flight left without passengers that were stuck in immigration. How can the airline do this? The plane was right outside, I could see it and the lady said you are not allowed in. If they know there is a problem, they can’t leave everyone that’s running to get to the gate on time because there was terrible lines at the airport.

### "find connecting flight closed"
Seriously frustrating to have my flight from London delayed over an hour only to find connecting flight closed. Over 20 passengers waiting at the gate and the plane shut the gate. Iberia leave a large group of people stranded, wasting their COVID tests and legion of paper work. Now in line with over 50 stranded passengers and only two agents.

### "Food was eatable but no more than that"
Between average and under average to sum up my flights. Boarding for business passengers in Lima was perfect: very orderly and quick. The usual oldish looking business cabin pretty worn out. When I asked something else than the 2 choices for the welcome drink: plain water or cava (the Spanish sparkling wine), I was told: "after take off" Even if I asked for it again twice I had to wait 1h10! and it was given to me at the same time as the meal: Iberia staff likes to make the minimum efforts possible. The dinner was dreadfully presented on a tiny tray (size of a coach meal tray) and in a very oldish and ugly china. No menu with the usual Covid excuse. So I was asked "Beef or fish? and when I asked how they were prepared I got the 2 same words snapped back to me. Food was eatable but certainly no more than that, and the presentation did not make you hungry. Appetizer was canteen style, meat was tough and overcooked, cheese truly bad and desert bad. Apart from the beef or fish, no choice. To be honest the wines were good but once again no menu to know what you were drinking. Between the dinner and the breakfast we never saw a crew member: doesn't Iberia train the cabin crew to treat decently business class clients decently? And in my fair opinion of ultra freqent traveller the Iberia executive in charge of food should be transferred to some another department asap. Business passengers are entitled to 30 minutes wifi: never worked! even if on my outbound flight it did. My short haul flight between Lisbon and Madrid was better.

### "Don't pay for upgrades in advance"
Not Verified |  Don't pay for upgrades in advance. They won't honor it, concur with another reviewer. Trip frim Madrid to Bogotá I paid extra for leg room since I'm pretty tall. Selected my seat and paid. Checked in at the counter and they stuck me in the last row next to the bathroom. Told them I paid extra but they wouldn't change it. Same thing happened from Bogotá to Madrid. Essentially I paid extra for a small non reclining seat next to the galley. I will never ever fly this airline again. They're a scam.

### "flight was a big disappointment"
The A350-900, a first for me and I was very excited to fly Iberia for the first time. The flight was a big disappointment. The problems started at check-in; long queues and unclear instructions on what Covid documents were required to show at this stage caused the queue to move very slowly. Boarding was not much better, the process was slow and unclear. Passengers stood in wrong rows and the order in which people were being boarded was very chaotic, causing a long queue in the jet bridge. After a 45 minute delay and everybody onboard, IB3166 left Madrid for London. The crew handed out a small sanitation kit and a small bottle of water. There were no menu cards available due to Covid and the menu was not available on the IFE. There was no option to purchase other food or drinks or any of the luxury items Iberia advertises on the IFE, a bit disappointing since I was planning on purchasing some food for my short layover at LHR. The seat on the A350 impressed me, it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom, a relatively large IFE screen and adjustable headrest. The IFE shut down after 30 minutes into the flight and the flight crew refused to help me by resetting the screen. The crew seemed tired and not interested in the passengers. The flight attendants were not visible during the flight and did not respond to people calling for help using the button on the IFE. This caused issues upon arrival at LHR, they did not have a system for deboarding, passengers were queueing in the aisles and pushing forward towards the exit of the aircraft. A very disappointing experience and I expected the Iberia crew to perform far better than this. In conclusion, Iberia showed me to be an airline which is just average when it comes to these flights. The seat on the A350-900 was amazing, but the fact that there was no food service, no system behind the boarding process and the flight crew being uninterested in the passengers experience showed me that I would rather pay more to fly another airline on a route such as this one.

### "wide bodied jets make business class an attractive option"
The wide bodied jets that Iberia fly on this route (A330-300 and A350-900) make business class an attractive option: lie-flat bed, movies and a lot of space, even if only for 2 hours. The food from Do&Co is also very good, with Guylian chocolates now added with the coffee service. The crew are fairly reserved but ready to assist. This flight was an on-time departure and early arrival. I was connecting through Madrid and used the Dali lounge in T4, where they were making cocktails to order.

### "Problems were first a late flight"
Not Verified |  Everything on the actual planes was fine. Problems were first a late flight to Madrid for me discernable reason. Then lied to about still making connecting flight to Chicago. About 15 people that I saw were denied boarding because they had closed it least 15 minutes before the closing time shown on the boarding pass. Rebooked through American then endured a 3 hour check-in line that was a model of slow motion incompetence. Miraculously just made the Boston flight.

### "at times frustrating experience"
Not Verified |  All in all a very underwhelming and at times frustrating experience. Serious problems with cabin crew, service/hospitality is non-existent. We travelled in both economy and premium economy and the service and food were equally bad in both. In premium economy, I wanted to ask for some water so I put my call bell on - this was ignored for about 15 minutes (though many crew saw it) before one woman came by, turned the call light off and walked off. I had a laugh about it with a guy across the aisle, we were both in awe at the spectacularly bad service. I also spent hours and hours on their website trying unsuccessfully to check-in, it just kept freezing, tried to call customer service, was on hold for 10 minutes before being disconnected (several times) because the call centre was supposedly too busy. In summary, customer service on and off the plane is atrocious. Food was also pretty poor, on both 9 hour flights, the first meal was mediocre quality (at best) and the second meal was a banana or a packaged muffin. The only positive thing I can say is that they offer last-minute upgrades for quite reasonable prices. Perhaps worth the gamble to go long-haul business or premium economy for an extra hundred euros or so. If flying economy, definitely bring your own headphones, the ones they provide are a joke.

### "never fly with Iberia"
Los Angeles to Dubrovnik via Madrid. What a joke this airline is. No customer service what so ever. We need to change our return ticket and cannot find an English speaking service rep and when you do they disconnect your call or refer you to another number that automatically disconnects. We have spent 4 days trying to find someone that can assist us and now we will lose our return ticket as we can’t cancel it or change it on their website. We fly internationally 4 times a year but will never fly with Iberia again.

### "no service, attendants ignored call bell"
Paid full fare business class, was denied entry to the lounge despite it being included in the fare, also included and not delivered was catering and priority boarding, I got to the gate and she roped off the priority queue in front of me, showed her my ticket, she pointed to the back of the economy line and turned around. I said I'm flying business and she looked at the ticket, said "too late, should have got here earlier", she then proceeded to let 4 groups of people down the priority lane after I walked away, all of whom I later saw flying business class just like me. Seat was wet, covered in wine, sauce and stains, cabin full, 'nothing they can do', spent the flight uncomfortably on 2 jackets. Catering was non existent, no service, attendants ignored call bell when I tried to get a drink, went to the crew to ask in the galley, was told to "go away, you cant be here". Flight attendants proceeded to sit together as a group of 3 laughing the entire flight and taking selfies. Toilets were disgusting, not cleaned once, piss and toilet paper everywhere, never felt like I needed a shower more than when I was on that flight.

### "don't pay for any upgrades"
Not Verified |  Be aware of Iberia's fraudulent attempt to get your money. My husband and I traveled from Bogota to Madrid this last September 2021, and decided to pay extra for a more comfortable seat, since my husband is over 6 feet tall. Iberia offers a Premium Economy upgrade option for extra 100+ dollars per ticket, which the company will charge to your credit card but they will not honor the upgrade upon check in. It is a scam! Iberia has old, uncomfortable planes and if you have no choice but to travel with this airline, don't pay for any upgrades, because they will not reimburse you when they stick you on a regular uncomfortable seat. Avoid traveling with Iberia if possible, due to the terrible service.

### "Boarding was a chaos"
Boarding was a chaos due to the rudeness and inefficiency of the staff who made no attempt to keep order and appeared overwhelmed by checking documents. Very unprofessional.

### "crew barely said hello on boarding"
The positives were the A350 wide-body aircraft on the London/Madrid leg that had good inflight entertainment and the Business class catering with cold cava was very good. Flight left the gate at Heathrow a few minutes early and got to Madrid some 20min early. The service, however, was very poor. The crew barely said hello on boarding, the lighting on boarding was too dark and the crew were neither friendly nor professional, they were simply going through the motions. The 55min flight Madrid/Lisbon had a friendly purser but the other crew member working Business class was clearly not happy.

### "nearly perfect for these two flights"
My wife and myself flew recently ACE-MAD-BRU with Iberia, using Avios miles. I haven’t flown with them for some time, and I did not have high expectations when reading passengers comments on this web site and elsewhere. However, most of these comments are about refunds, cancelations, missed connections, missing bags, rude service on board or on the ground, or about problems when trying to contact the airline. Nothing similar happened and I am glad to report that everything went well and was (nearly) perfect for these two flights, in both cases onboard brand-new planes (a A321 neo of Iberia Express, then a A320 neo of Iberia iself). The only criticism I could have is that legroom is limited in C as in Y class, but we secured seats on the very first low (1F & 1D, the 1A and 1C), and this was less of the problem because of the bulkhead. I shall limit myself below to report the service we received on the ground and and in the air, for which all employees and crew members should be complimented. I hope that this will be good for their morale in these days ! Check in at Lanzarote airport was a breeze, as was going through security. We were there early, and spent some time in the small, but nice common lounge, equipped with a side terrace where we enjoyed our last sunny hour of the year. Boarding was done in good order, but we had to go down and up via stairs, despite the fact that an airbridge was available at that stand ; but this Iberia Express, isn’t it ? We took off on time, and a hot lunch was quickly offered thereafter (with above average gnocchi as the main course). The two hours or so of this flight went quicky, and we found that it was just too short. We had a two-hour transit at the busy Madrid hub, where we retired to the much larger, somewhat crowed Iberia Lounge. Boarding for the connecting flight was again on time, and it went as well in good order in these COVID days. Take off was somewhat delayed, but arrival in Brussels was on time, as some recovery margin is built into the schedule. Another hot meal was again quickly offered, this time in the late afternoon (with a steak of a decent size and very tasty ; this was our day of luck ! ). Crowning this, there was an excellent Rioja 2017, of which I asked for (and got) a second (small) bottle (whereas I did not ask for a second one of the dry white on the previous leg ; airline wine is sometimes as military music). Landing in cold and rainy Brussels came also too quickly, and our suitcases arrived soon on the carousel after a long, but enjoyable journey. All in all a perfect one from start to end, but I realize that we have perhaps been very lucky ; these things happen, however, and they should be reported as well! Had we paid full fare for these tickets, it would have been good value for money.

### "experience was very stressful"
I booked my flight on April 25, 2021. On September 15, 2021 my flight was canceled for unknown reasons due to COVID-19 just a few days before my flight on September 18. They offered other flights that they had but none of them got us in at the right time. I appreciate that they offered a refund, but since they canceled so late we had to scramble to find a new flight and had to pay twice the amount. This entire experience was very stressful.

### "no way to get my money back"
They cancelled my flights with Vueling and Level 5 days after booking, without any explanation. The email I recieved said that I was entitled to rebooking or refund, but none of the days within the required window had flights available to rebook, and when I requested a refund, my request was denied. I got no service, and no way to get my money back for a flight that they cancelled.

### "Their planes are extremely dated and uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Iberia is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. I would rather fly Ryanair or Spirit across the Atlantic than ever endure another another experience with this airline. The check in agents were unprofessional and did not enforce any type of queue (despite the fact many travelers waited over 1.5 hours to check in) - they first checked in anyone who cut the line and shoved their way to the front. Agent took my bag at the plane due to no overhead space, frantic and yelling at passengers (not in English), not allowing us time to remove our passports or other important medication. Every departure (and thus arrival) was late. Their planes are extremely dated and uncomfortable and were not cleaned/wiped down prior to boarding which is particularly concerning during the pandemic. I would urge you to choose a different airline when flying.

### "charged me for the two suitcases again"
I bought a ticket with one suitcase included, then I bought two extra suitcases because I was traveling with my son. When I arrived at the airport, it did not appear in the system and they charged me for the two suitcases again and told me to claim the money that would be returned. The fact is that I am in Cuba and there is no way that I can communicate with someone. Nobody answers the phone only machines. It is impossible to talk to someone. Compre un tiket con una maleta incuida, luego compre dos maletas extra porque viajaba con mi hijo. Al llegar al areopuerto no aparecia en el sistema y me cobraron las dos maleta otra vez y me dijero que reclamara el dinero que seria devuelto. El caso es que estoy en Cuba y no hay manera que pueda comunicarme con alguien nadie responde el telefono solo maquinas. Es imposible poder hablar con alguien.

### "If you are not 100% sure your can make this flight do not book this airline"
Not Verified |  We have not flown this airline yet but have booked tickets. I wanted to write a review to let others know that they do not give vouchers or refunds regardless of Covid. On their website they make it seem like we can get vouchers in case we are not able to fly into the EU but that is not the case. We were told that we can only change our flight but they would charge us $200+ to change the flight once, even though we don't know when we will be able to fly in. I asked to speak to the managers and was told that all the managers were in a meeting at 7pm at night. Yeah okay. If you are not 100% sure your can make this flight do not book this airline. The EU recently put out a travel ban on the USA and we still can't even get a voucher for our flight. I would never use this airline again, no wonder it is so cheap.

### "Silent bird, perfect crew"
Check-in in Marseille was quick and efficient, as a special counter for passengers connecting with flights to USA (not our case) that demands extra care on documentation. Silent bird, perfect crew.

### "The crew did not enforced the current regulations"
After a couple of flights within Europe, where COVID precautions were respected and/or enforced, we faced a stressful situation. A whole family decided not to wear masks (just around the necks) in order to talk, eat the whole meal they had brought etc... They were on the other side of the corridor, 3 of them. The crew did not enforced the current regulations. We kindly demanded the crew to ask this family to wear mask. They did not. They ran away from them! They were afraid of being contaminated, we believe. We are afraid of having been contaminated. What could we do? We could not escape from the flight. We were prisoners.

### "check in took over 1hr and 30 mins"
I flew with Iberia from Zurich to Madrid. The check in took over 1hr and 30 mins for a A319 (which is a small aircraft) to pass through, it was organized chaos with people jumping the queue and many issues. It is COVID time but when I got to the desk, my baggage was taken in less than 5 minutes so I have no idea for the delay. The aircraft was dirty and old, the issue I had the biggest problem with is the economy seat space. I'm 190cm tall and i couldn't bend my knee so had to put my legs in the aisle. Very poor Iberia, I won’t be using you again. I actually chose you over Air Europa and I think it was a poor choice.

### "the experience is great"
Flew to Madrid and back on Iberia’s new A350-900. They’re using these wide-bodied jets right now and the experience is great: lie-flat seat, full entertainment schedule and very good food. Crew lovely. Both flights were on time, maybe even early. Used BA lounge at LHR and then Iberia’s Dali lounge at MAD (it was early so the T4S Velazquez lounge was shut) which was quiet and very well stocked.

### "Service was very attentive and focused"
A good flight experience. Service was very attentive and focused. All over the flight it was possible to get whatever you wanted in case of drinks. Meal quality at a very high level, which airline does serve its customers a full and warm meal of fish? Iberia's food was delicious.

### "had a number of out-of-pocket expenses"
We flew with Iberia in August (Mexico-Madrid-Dublin). We were stranded for over 24 hours in Madrid because Iberia cancelled our flight and only offered us an alternative the next day. We had a number of out-of-pocket expenses as well as having to take extra time off work. Firstly it was very difficult to get in touch in Iberia. Every time we tried to contact them by phone we were cut off. We were unable to access anyone via the web using the online forms, as they were restricting us from entering information. We tried to go to one of the Iberia counters at one of the airports and they were closed. We sent numerous messages through Messenger on Facebook that were unanswered. Only when we tagged Iberia on a public post on Facebook did they start to answer a message. Even then we were given the run around. Firstly we were fobbed off to BA, who subsequently wrote back and said it was Iberia's responsibility to deal with a particular issue. Iberia advised we could contact Serviberia. When we accessed it, it said 'sorry this page has flown'. Eventually someone in Iberia gave us a correct link we could use to contact Serviberia. The response through Serviberia to our complaint was very disappointing to say the least. It seemed to be just some template letter with a few standard phases and an opt out clause that allowed Iberia not to help us. We just hope that no one else has to go through what we had to endure. We’re hopeful the airline industry is recovering which will give customers a better choice of who they can travel with.

### "tried to make a cancellation"
I made an online reservation for a flight from Madrid to Barcelona in August of 2021 and I figured I made a mistake with the dates and tried to make a cancellation for the ticket within the 24 hour free cancellation window but there was no online option to do that. I called the 800 number hundred times and it was keeping me for several minutes on a waiting then hangs up. After so many trials somebody answered me and refused to make any changes to the reservation because it was made from the US to a flight inside Spain. He gave me a number in Spain and asked me to arrange with them. So I had to make international calls this time and again the number is always busy. I went to their facebook and twitter pages and asked for help, they initially responded with the 800 number and then stopped answering. It is been almost a month since I made the reservation and until now I was not able to cancel the reservation.

### "the onboard team is superb"
The difference between a reasonable and a mediocre airline is its cabin crew and customer service staff, although I can't speak about the later, the onboard team is superb. Their hub is also quite good but they need to drastically improve in cleanliness. The A319 was showing its age but was completely acceptable for such a short route.

### "attentive cabin crew"
The professional, charismatic and attentive cabin crew is what makes this airline an acceptable one. Because in terms of cleanliness, my seat was dirty so I had to clean myself before seating. More or less on time.

### "I was never comfortable"
I never felt unsafe while flying Iberia, but I was never comfortable. The plane was older and a bit worn, and the seating not meant for that many hours of sitting. The staff seemed to have no personal investment, and to take a very hands-off approachs. I had one terrific meal and 3 bad meals. I’d think twice before repeating the experience.

### "having to pay 110 Euros for luggage"
I am traveling with my family, wife and son from Berlin to Porto via Madrid on flights IB3067 and IB8664. I upgraded the Berlin to Madrid section to business and there was no business on the Madrid Oporto section and I bought the emergency seats. Also I am sapphire in One World for being Paltinum in American Airlines. When the Agent went to deliver my bags to the Iberia counter in Berlin, who spoke very bad Spanish, he did not know the rules of One World. I assumed that traveling in Business I was entitled to at least one suitcase for each passenger but apparently this is not the case. Then I explained to him that because he was a sapphire he had the right to a suitcase in the reserve and he did not recognize me. I ended up having to pay 110 Euros for luggage over the 168 I paid for the business upgrade from Berlin to Madrid and the 63 for the seats on the Madrid Oporto flight. I called Iberia and they informed me that business tickets are always entitled to one piece of luggage. However, the agent in Berlin forced me to pay even while going in business. It seems inconceivable that you have to pay for luggage traveling on business. For your information, on this journey I will travel through Iberia from Madrid to Rome, from Berlin to Porto via Madrid and from Porto to Madrid. Iberia agents do not know the rules of One World, in all cases I had to fight to be recognized for a piece of luggage for being sapphire. ES: El día de hoy estoy viajando con mi familia esposa e hijo desde Berlín a Oporto vía Madrid en los vuelos IB3067 y IB8664. El tramo Berlín Madrid hice upgrade a business y en el tramo Madrid Oporto no había business y compré los puestos de emergencia. Además soy zafiro en en One World por ser Paltinum en American Airlines. Cundo fue a entregar mis maletas al mostrador de Iberia en Berlín el Agente, quien hablaba muy mal español, no conocía las reglas de One World. Asumí que viajando en Business tenía derecho al menos a una maleta por cada pasajero pero aparentemente no es así. Luego le expliqué que por ser zafiro tenía derecho a una maleta en la reserva y no me lo reconoció. Terminé teniendo que pagar 110 Euros por equipaje encima de los 168 que pagué por el upgrade a business de Berlín a Madrid y los 63 por los asientos del vuelo Madrid Oporto. Llamé a Iberia y me informaron que los boletos en business siempre tienen derecho a una pieza de equipaje. Sin embargo el agente en Berlin me obligó a pagar aun yendo en business. Parece inconcebible que tenga que pagar por el equipaje viajando en business. Para su información, en este periplo viaje por Iberia desde Madrid a Roma, de Berlin a Oporto via Madrid y de Oporto a Madrid. los agentes de Iberia no conocen las reglas de One World, en todos los casos tuve que pelear para que me reconocieran una pieza de equipaje por ser zafiro.

### "not necessary to be vaccinated"
Inconsistent, rude staff at the counter in San Jose Costa Rica who told me I could not take the flight because I don't have vaccine to access Spain. I had to stop there because my final destination was Dubai and it is not necessary to have vaccine just to transit through Spain. Dubai is open for tourist or residents and is not necessary to be vaccinated. After some time of having a hard time with this guy at the counter who was "saying is the supervisor", because i showed my Dubai Visa on my passport he was taking me into consideration to get to the flight after he made a call saying yes, she will fly because she has Dubai Visa, but he did not let me travel with my suitcase when i was just in transit in Spain.

### "service has been drastically downgraded"
Terrible check-in staff not knowing the location or opening hours of Iberia's VIP Lounges. They were unaware of the procedures to check documentation and COVID related requirements. VIP Lounges close early, leaving flyers to sit it in a corridor. On-board service has been drastically downgraded. Drinks, aperitifs, entrees, breakfast items all gone. Crew were not aware of the contents of the menu. The size of the washbags has been reduced. The crew now have one of the 2 toilets allocated to the business class cabin (A330-200) but they also used the other one. Comfortable seat. Entertainment system needs updating. My priority luggage was delivered last.

### "really recommend Iberia Business Class"
Again a very good experience in short haul Business Class of Iberia. They changed their caterer about one year ago and offer now even a better meal service than before. Seats are regular like in most short haul flights within Europe. The entire crew was attentive and offered all kind of drinks available during the whole flight. I really recommend Iberia Business Class for international flights within Europe.

### "experience was unbelievable"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the rudest and most uncaring attendants during check-in at Dubrovnik Airport as well as Madrid. Customer service is non-existent. So frustrating. We would have missed our connecting flight had a stranger not told us to check-in online for our boarding passes in Madrid. They were unable to give us boarding passes for the second part of our journey and were held when we got off the plane for at least 20 minutes before walking us to a check-in desk in a big group. We weren't separated even though 3 different flights were in the group. Our flight was departing in 50 minutes and there was only 1 lady printing boarding passes even though there were over 80 of us. It was taking at least 7-10 minutes per passenger. A man came to help and was screaming at us to distance even though we were all in our family groups. Not to mention we had all been held in a bus like sardines together prior to boarding the previous flight for over 20 minutes. Now that we were all trying frantically to catch flights they were concerned about social distancing. The experience was unbelievable. Thank God the young man told us that we were able to check in and get boarding passes online. We barely made our flight with absolutely no help from Iberia staff. I highly doubt that we will ever use this airline again.

### "never offered me a real refund"
Worst experience with an airline. Iberia tricked me to accept a voucher for a flight ticket they cancelled due to COVID. They never offered me a real refund of my EUR 76. They refused to extend the expiration date of my voucher, so in the end it became useless. Overall, I lost my time over the phone with rude customer service agents.

### "Food was excellent if a bit cold"
I took advantage of a very cheap upgrade to try the A350 business class MAD/LHR. I hate this cramped aircraft in general with small seats and less toilets. Even the seat plan in business is cramped. Crew were pleasant but mostly disinterested in their service. Quite unkept uniforms on show. Food was excellent if a bit cold and fantastic cava served. I didn’t use the WiFi or IFE but it looked quite good. Summing up most business travellers I guess would perhaps use a better presented product but the price was good on this occasion so worth a try. Iberia has never been high in customer service like some of its other IAG airlines.

### "the worst experience with an airline booking I've ever had"
This is the worst experience with an airline booking I've ever had. First, they cancelled my booking without telling me. Good that I noticed myself. Had to call support. Spent two hours on the phone. Bless their heart we finally managed to book the ticket for me after 3 attempts. It was more expensive now of course. Now I cannot check it - they demand money for any seat selection, there are no free options. The customer support phone hangs up on me. I have no idea whether I'll be able to fly tomorrow.

### "I am still unable to contact them"
After being told on the phone that I would get a voucher because I couldn't fly during covid, Iberia changed its mind, cancelled my voucher and asked me instead to board the plane that had to take off in a few hours. As I was I unable to board the plane in such a short notice, customer service reassured me that this was an internal mistake and that they would issue the voucher in any case on the next day. Since then (6 months ago), I am still unable to contact them, the customer service can't find my booking anymore and I'm being treated as a liar. Iberia doesn't even want to refund the airport taxes.

### "offered me no assistance"
Not Verified |  Iberia couldn’t care less about their passengers, on a two and a half hour flight from London, we were served two small glasses of water, this was on the economy part of my journey. Nothing else was offered, we were informed that this was called a simplified service due to COVID-19. I received more from BA on a one hour flight. The main reason for my complaint is the manner in which I was treated by ground staff. Unhelpful, ignorant and uncaring are a few words that come to mind. The business check-in organization in Madrid is absolutely non existent, a complete mess. The customer service agent standing before the check in area offered me no assistance and was not motivated in resolving passenger issues. The check in agent did do her best to help me after I eventually and embarrassingly skipped the que. I had a short connection time in Madrid, due to Iberia refusing to check me and my baggage from London to my final destination in Costa Rica. The check in supervisor in London was rude towards me, she was more interested in gossiping with her colleagues, than helping or resolving passenger issues. Therefore this resulted into an absolute nightmare whilst in Madrid, due to the size of the airport and the numerous checks that I endured whilst connecting to one of the furthest possible gates in the “S” pier. My flight from Madrid to San Jose was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly. They provided a good service onboard. Though due to the manner in which I was handled on the ground, it has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I won’t be flying with Iberia again.

### "This is ludicrous!"
Not Verified |  My husband and I, flew Iberia business from Madrid to Santo Domingo last week. Iberia has introduced a consent of one glass of wine with the meal due to COVID. This is ludicrous! There is absolutely no connection between COVID and pouring one or more glasses of wine. It’s frustrating to both passengers and cabin crew who has no way of explaining why such a policy is implemented. I wanted a glass of white with my starter and a glass of red with my lasagna - the second glass was denied me! At best this is a cost saving measure or it’s just plane stupid, invented by someone sitting in a head office somewhere who does not even fly.

### "Worst company regarding customer service ever"
Not Verified |  Worst company regarding customer service ever! We had to cancel our flights in June 2020 due to the pandemic. They put an expiration date on them for June 2021 however the pandemic is still going on. When I call I get the run around and was told sorry you have to use by June but you could call 15 days before the expiration date and see. We’re in a pandemic you think they would be more willing to extend like other airlines under the circumstances.

### "Flat out robbery!"
Flat out robbery! Iberia stole my money. After my flight in May 2020 being understandably cancelled and after being told multiple times that I could re-schedule and get a voucher they denied me. Even having proof of my ticket and expense paid, I spent hours on the phone with customer service and emailing and chats. All the while being told I would be able to re-book for a different date. They never issued me a voucher or a new booking. Buyer aware.

### "I don’t recommend Iberia to anybody"
Not Verified |  I would give zero if I could, worst service and worst customer service, they canceled my flight and they don’t want to refund me. I keep calling them and they hang up on me. I don’t recommend Iberia to anybody. If you have the same situation please file a claim to US department of transportation, this airlines should be banned from the US.

### "voucher that expires in two months"
Boston to Lisbon via Madrid booked for May 2020. They have unethical business practices and terrible customer service. They refuse to return my money after nearly a year. They’ve issued me a voucher that expires in two months and we are still not able to leave our country due to Covid.

### "I won’t ever fly with them again"
Worst airline ever. Zero customer service mindset, poorly organized. They lost my suitcase on the outgoing flight, it’s not appeared since then, more than 6 weeks later. And they refuse to refund my spendings and the content of the suitcase. Furthermore the flight on the way back was 5 hours delayed, the communication about the delay was inexistent. I won’t ever fly with them again.

### "avoid if you don't want big time problems"
I have been traveling for the last 28 years on hundreds of flights, but this bad experience takes the cake. I booked a ticket to Lisbon from London via Madrid. They didn't notify me of anything of transit restrictions. The link they provided said there was no problem for passengers in airport transit. I was on the phone calling them for days before the flight to clarify if there was any other restrictions, but the calls was served by answering machines even after hours of trying. At the departure airport in London they denied me boarding citing that as a non Spanish person I could not travel via Spain. No amount of explanation was of help. As one can see from the reviews for Iberia on this forum, it tells its own story. My advise is avoid if you don't want big time problems. I have not even been refunded my ticket money citing some unfounded reasons. They don't even care for the negative reviews according to this forums advise. Its your choice.

### "I've called 10 numbers and no one does anything"
Not Verified |  My 73 year old aunt (in a wheelchair, because of a hip problem)and my 65 year old uncle, flew with Iberia today, London IB 3175, they were supposed to get a connection in Madrid to Porto IB8664. The first flight was delayed by 80 minutes and they missed their connection to Porto. They arrived in Madrid at 15:46 and have been until now left at the airport by Iberia! My aunt can't get up on her own and has been sat in a wheelchair for over 5 hours now. Iberia booked them on a flight tomorrow at 11:25 IB8776. Are they going to let an elderly disabled woman sleep in a wheelchair at the airport? I've called 10 numbers and no one does anything in Iberia! I'm waiting for my family here in Porto and my aunt and uncle need to be taken to a hotel by Iberia in Madrid!

### "no information for hours"
I was flying from London to Jerez, and it took me 48 hours. From one flight getting delayed three hours and no information on the matter during the waiting period, to lines of hours to reschedule connection flights with only one person working the counter, the next day my flight was also delayed with . My luggage was lost, they were not bothered to send it correctly to the destination and i was told this when checking in. Staff was super unhelpful at almost all points.

### "13 days before having it delivered home"
Not Verified |  1 hour and 45 check-in queue. First leg with Iberia express in new A320- seating is very bad, Flight was 45 mins delayed and I was almost certain to miss my connection flight in Madrid, but I made it. My luggage never arrived and waited 13 days before having it delivered home. This is the second time i take Iberia and they misplace my baggage.

### "a total lack of care for their customers"
Not Verified |  We booked our flights back in September for Dec 18 - Jan 3th. About a month ago we were notified that the flight for Dec 18th was changed for Dec 17th, the day before. My husband and I had to take an additional day off work. Today we have been informed that our return flight has been changed from Jan 3th to the 4th, a day later. I have called customer service twice to kindly ask if they could either refund the price difference for the new and less desirable dates (from a Friday we were changed to a Thursday and from a Sunday to a Monday). They said rotundly no. Then I asked if, as a courtesy they could let us bring one 23kg suitcase (we only had cabin luggage included in the price of our ticket) since now our trip was two days longer. They didn't even entertain the idea. We asked to talk to their supervisors and they didn't pass them to us. We are regular Iberia customers and in our opinion, this reflects a total lack of care for their customers. Very disappointing.

### "change my return flight"
I booked my tickets in October 2020 and flew New York to Madrid in October. At that time, it showed on the website that the policy is flexible and I could change my flight for free due to Covid-19 situation. But today, I called customer service to change my return flight to a later date. I was charged $200 service fee and in addition, they charged me $2000 per ticket. So they asked me to pay $1650 price difference. I ended to give up my previous booking and rebuy a new ticket.

### "I still trust Iberia"
Not Verified | We bought 4 tickets from Madrid to Havana for December 2020, but obviously it would not happen, because Havana airport is closed due to COVID. I did not want the voucher either, because I was not allowed to buy return leg in 2022. We preferred that because we wanted to spend the new years eve in Cuba. When Iberia postponed the outbound flight by 10 hours, I called them and asked for a refund, as I knew that entitles me. I did not receive any news from them for a few weeks. When I read the reviews about Iberia here, I panicked about the refund I was expecting from Iberia. I thought I would never get it. Then I checked my credit card, and I saw they had already refunded already, but I had not noticed for it came to the credit card, and I was expecting an e-mail notification. After all they paid it within a few weeks. I cannot complain. I thought I will write here and let people know that I still trust Iberia.

### "Really bad experience with their customer service"
Not Verified |  We decided to cancel our flight to Mexico because of COVID-19 and they said they would give us vouchers. We never got the vouchers so I had to call to see what was going on. They sent the vouchers to my email and I thought it was the end of it. When we tried to use the vouchers to pay for another flight the vouchers didn't work. I called again and they said they were going to look into the problem in 3-10 days. I'm pretty sure it will take more than that which means I will most likely have to pay cash to buy my flight. Really bad experience with their customer service in during these difficult times.

### "Never again for us Iberia!"
Not Verified |  Iberia is one of the few airlines that consistently rejects all voucher payment requests that we have not requested. Iberia makes it virtually impossible for consumers to submit a claim through the website. Cannot be reached by e-mail and they also earn money by telephone as this costs € 0.35 per call. Dutch speakers are not on the line because they are supposedly busy, English-speaking agents are supposedly not authorized to authorize a refund action. It is clear that management is committed to undermining consumer rights. Never again for us Iberia!

### "waiting since April for the refund"
Frankfurt to Buenos Aires via London bought through Iberia. Terrible Customer Support. I am waiting since April for the refund for my canceled flight to Buenos Aires due to Covid-19. Customer service is always telling me that the application for refund is complete but they cant tell me when the money will arrive. Now they even hung up on me as I kept asking for conformation for my request.

### "Never again flying with this terrible company"
This company must have the worst customer service compared to any other European carrier. I was due to fly out of London on August 18th to LA but due to Covid-19 related travel restrictions I couldn't board the plane. I applied for a voucher and was told it was going to be ready in 5 business days. I received a response 20 days later saying my voucher is not approved. Despite being told on the phone it has been approved and it was a matter of sending me the approval via email. Never again flying with this terrible company.

### "don't have any right to a refund"
My San Francisco to Barcelona flight with Level got canceled due to covid-19. I was asked if I wanted a voucher or a refund so I said refund. They said they would refund me within 30 days, it's been over 30 days and no signs of me getting a refund. I called again and the guy on the phone was rude and said that I don't have any right to a refund.

### "I had no right to a refund"
I required a refund for a flight that had been cancelled by Iberia due to COVID-19. After navigating an automated response system with barely-comprehensible messages, I finally reached a service agent who was arrogant and rude. Without even knowing my booking code, he insisted that I had no right to a refund, refused to check my reservation, interrupted me and then put down the phone while I was in mid-sentence. I was left incandescent with rage; I rarely get angry, but this guy really did it. Iberia doesn't respond to online feedback.

### "still not given me compensation"
Left stranded in Madrid by Iberia. The 5+ hour delay from Santiago de Compostela caused by Iberia caused me to miss my Iberia MAD-LAX flight. Iberia did nothing to help me even though they had two seats available on the Iberia MAD-LAX flight the next day. Their excuse is that my agent had booked two separate non-connecting tickets but Iberia did not at minimum offer me and my traveling companion the 250 euros each that they are supposed to offer as per EU regulations for delays of more than 3 hours. They have still not given me that compensation even though I had requested it several times before the current COVID crisis.

### "I would fly with Iberia again!"
Madrid to Chicago in Premium Economy. Transitting in Madrid-Barajas  Airport was such a breeze. I would have spent more time in the lounge if it wasn't for the BA staff at LHR T5 not printing my boarding pass so I had to spend 25 minutes at the Iberia transfer desk. After my boarding pass was issued, security was a breeze. I went straight to the Iberia Premium Velasquez Lounge where I was greeted by happy and cheerful agents. Food and beverage options in the lounge had an outstanding selection. Boarding was on time on this very full flight and very orderly. I have oneworld Sapphire status putting me in Group 2. Upon boarding the plane (EC-LUK 'Costa Rica'); the plane was 7 years old and did not show its age. The cabin was very spacious and very clean. The onboard crew were very welcoming, warm and friendly. Amenity kit were distributed along with headphones which were pretty much the same as what BA offers their Club World passengers. The amenity kits were of high quality which is pretty much similar with what some airlines offeres in their business class cabins. The amenity kits did not came with socks, ear plugs and eye mask which were all of high quality. The dental kit was disposable, the bag as a whole is very practical and reusable. Welcome drinks were offered with a choice of orange juice and water in plastic cups, I asked for both and without hesitation the crew were happy to offer both. The whole seat appeared to be clean. High quality blanket and pillow were already on the seat which I later found to be very comfortable for the 9 hour flight. The IFE content had great selections of the latest films in Hollywood which was enough for the 9 hour flight. In total there were more than 50 films in the selection. In addition to films, the IFE also came with a great selection of TV programmes. The disappointing bit was that the Audio selection was poor. We took off on time and the entire flight was fairly smooth. The meal and bar service was average at most. Drinks and food were served the same time. The options were chicken or pasta and I opted for the former which tasted great. Only soft drinks, tea and coffee and wine were offered. Spirits were for purchase. After the meal service, the cabin crew came with a second round for drinks, at this point everyone was resting. The cabin temperature was kept comfortable. The toilets were kept clean.Throughout the flight, the cabin crew were doing hourly rounds of drinks and ensuring the well-being of passengers. I decided walk around, the economy cabin looked immaculate and faily full. Everyone seemed comfortable. I also noticed that the economy seat recline was more than industry average. I was at the back of the plane stretching my leg and had a nice long chat with one of the cabin crew. I requested if I could have a spare amenity kit and I was given one without hesitation. I had a 3 hour nap and I must say it was one of the most comfortable sleep/ nap I had on a plane. The recline was outstanding. The second meal service came with a warm croque-monsieur which was outstanding. In addition, drinks service was included. The plane landed on time. The captain kept us well informed of the flight progress. One thing that I noticed was that the Wi-Fi was fairly expensive. Iberia has lost marks on the basis of: expensive Wi-Fi, the need to pay for Spirits on board and the poor selection music selection. Overall, I would fly with Iberia again!

### "giving credit notes / vouchers"
Paris to Lima via Madrid. In the context of Covid 19, cancellation of flights by the company, Iberia is giving credit notes / vouchers valid for one year instead of refund. Do not expect to correspond by email and an online message via the form still has no response 3 weeks after. To think before choosing Iberia

### "No service whatsoever"
Santiago de Compostella to Vienna via Madrid. I have not flown. I have a booking for May 2020. I am trying to contact customer service to either cancel my flights or push them out by 12 months so I can fly the same time next year. I cannot get in contact with customer service as the customer service people in Spain only speak Spanish and no one answers the English line. No email or other contact details. No service whatsoever unless you are Spanish. It looks like I will lose my money.

### "extremely frustrating"
New York to Madrid. This is the worst airline to deal with. I purchased roundtrip tickets to Spain that use Iberia as a partner airline. I am unable to get any representative on the phones. Their system has continued to hang up on me (10 times over the course of a couple of hours). They have a Facebook messaging option that no one responds to. I can't send a message through their system because I didn't sign up for a rewards accounts (for an airline I've never flown on and don't plan to fly on again). Therefore I have no means to contact this company. I understand that there is high call volume right now but I expect to eventually get through to talk to someone. I would be perfectly fine to be placed on a call back list or be placed on hold, but that fact that I cannot even make it that far is extremely frustrating and poor business practice. I would not recommend ever using this airline for any flights.

### "is a budget airline"
Madrid to London. Chose Iberia for the flight on the basis of their OneWorld membership and presuming them to be full service (and being more expensive than competitors). The problems started early - the itinerary from trip.com said we had to pay for luggage, but the manage my booking function would not work. That meant we could not add one bag at £25 instead of E40. So, at check in we were charged the full E40 despite the person behind the counter admitting they were having issues with 'manage my booking'. On board, there was no included catering in economy. Nor were there menus in the seat pockets so you could try an make an informed choice about what you could buy. Rather, the staff came through the cabin waving the menu as in 'here it is'. We asked to buy some wine, but were then advised that the credit card machine was not working (and as we were leaving Europe for Australia we had spent the last of our Euros at the airport). Rather than offer an apology or a glass of water, the crew just walked off. Iberia on this route is a budget airline. It's embarrassing. We would have been better off booking Vueling or similar.

### "will send my bag the same say"
Santiago to Munich via Madrid. I was only flying with one bag of hand luggage. Iberia wanted me to give my bag to them because the plane was to full. they said my bag will arrive at my destination. Once landed i received an sms that my luggage will be arriving late with the last plane. The lady at the counter told me they will send my bag the same say or the next morning, which didn't happen. Now it's the fifth day and the customer service and communication to get my luggage back has been a disaster.

### "never fly Iberia again"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Bogota return. Booked through BA on a code shared return trip via Madrid. The LHR - MAD sectors were fine with BA. I only used this route for the Avios points which in hindsight are not really worth it so regret not flying direct with Avianca. I have never experienced such lazy crew. The flight to Bogota started with a meal served about one hour in to the flight. I took the pasta which I found to be foul. After that meal was served we did not see the crew again until an hour before landing. They did not offer any drinks or light refreshments between services. I did have some water with me but about 6 hours in I went to see if I could get a drink - the lady in the galley was sat on a chair on WhatsApp and when I asked for some water, the look on her face was priceless. The toilet I used did not appear to be serviced for the 10.5 hours. The seats were not made for comfort. Will never fly Iberia again.

### "the check-in was denied"
At Sao Paulo  my husband was denied to check-in without a return ticket. We presented a return ticket that was bought with TAP. The lady could not find the ticket in the system and did not allow my husband to check-in. We asked the Iberia service counter to help and found out the check-in was denied due to the staff only searching for Iberia return flight numbers. In the end, Iberia listed us as a no-show for the flight. We made an official complaint and asked for a partial refund as we had all documents to board the plane. Iberia denied to compensate us. Buying tickets with Iberia cost us a lot: 24 hours at the airport, overnight accommodation at GRU, and we needed to buy new tickets to Europe where we live. We decided to buy new tickets with another company.

### "5 hours with no food"
We were heading to Rome via Madrid and our flight from Nantes to Madrid got delayed. Before the flight, no information was given to us, one flight attendant told us we were going to make it to our connection on time (also a Iberia flight), but the story changed during the flight. And so we arrived in Madrid too late and we missed our connection. I don't blame Iberia for a technical incident or whatever caused the delay, but once arrived in Madrid, we were told to go at the Iberia help desk to solve the situation. When we arrived at the help desk, there was already more than a hundred people waiting there. And there was no queue and no organization whatsoever. There was  no Iberia staff to be seen except 4 employee busy at the help desk which we had no way of contacting. So we started waiting. This is when we discovered that they were from other planes and some of them were waiting here for more than 4 hours already. At one point, an employee of Iberia finally came out. Naturally, we went to her to ask question. At least to know if there was any form of queue to reach the help desk. So we tried talking to her, in a polite and calm way, and she look at us and .. directly turn her back. Every time we tried to talk to us, she ignore us. Then she started shouting in Spanish. So we had no clue what was going on. People started rushing to her and she started giving paper away. After a while a person was kind enough to explain to us that she was giving away number for the queue (which didn't exist since people had already been waiting there for hours with nobody organizing anything). At this point it was already too late and we ended up being 150th in the waiting list. So then came 4 hours of waiting to finally reach the help desk. During this time we had to wait standing, with no food and no water -  they didn't even bring water and refused to give voucher for food (against EU traveler rights). And the help desk was not really helpful, they just book us a new flight and told us to go on. We were pressed on and not given a choice about flights or to spend the night in a hotel and fly the next day. And at this point, it was already late, and our flight was arriving at Roma after midnight, so we had to pay for an expensive night bus and late fee at our hosting place, which Iberia refused to pay for. So  we had to wait for more than 5 hours with no food, no water, and with almost nobody speaking a word of English.

### "no explanations about what to do"
Bruxelles to Bordeaux via Madrid. We left 45 min late from Brussels and arrived 40 min late in Madrid. I had a connection flight to Bordeaux but after running in the airport I was too late for boarding and they denied my entrance. No information from the stewards about what to do after landing was given, during the flight from Brussels to Madrid - after getting off the plane no Iberia employees to answer simple questions - when arrived at the gate and denied from entering the plane, no explanations about what to do were given. They told me to go back to where I was from to deal with the Iberia desk already full  - on the way back, I asked for directions to Iberia employees but none could give me a clear answer.

### "not have my meal on board"
I booked business class from London to Quito return. Am a long standing customer of BA and my meal options are long registered. I confirmed my meal options (vegetation lacto-ovo) separately with Iberia as the BA app doesn’t allow you to do much even though they own Iberia. Both my long haul flights to Quito and back did not have my meal on board. Given there were only meat options on board I couldn’t eat much. What’s the point of paying so much if they can’t take care of such a basic thing. Having said that on my return flight the steward made a lot of effort to put it right.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. On check in online we discovered that on the both flights (London - Madrid / Madrid Bogota) we were seated separately, on the first flight the computer denied us the the option of sitting together, on the flight Madrid - Bogota, the computer blocked the free seats, even though the plane was half empty, and forced us to pay to sit together. When we complained, their response was we allocated you the seats that you purchased, and when we told them that they were wrong, and if allocated to us those seats, we should not have to pay for them. We have been ignored after our response.

### "expected to receive a priority seat"
Marseille to Tokyo via Madrid. Travelling with a 11 months baby I had just expected to receive a priority seat with carrycot. But priority seats are sold to those who want space for legs and not reserved as a priority to families. A 14 hours flight with a baby on your knees.

### "I lost my connection"
Palma de Mallorca to Marrakech  via Madrid. I lost my connection for lack of service, had to spend the night in a average hotel with no suitcase. And on my way back they lost my suitcase and took it home in the next day, the suitcase was damaged. They answered my email saying sorry for my inconvenience.

### "they left our luggage in London"
London to Madrid. The seats were very tight. I am 5' 9 and weigh 185lbs. But my complaint was with the service. First they left our luggage (along with about 10 or 12 other people) in London. It does happen, but our luggage was not delivered to our hotel the next day. When we called about the luggage, there were at least 4 transfers between automated lines, when I finally reached a live person the staff was so rude! They refused to give any information. They said they couldn't contact the delivery company to get our luggage to us. They said we would have to wait for someone to call us. And of course compensation was out of the question. The worse Customer service of any airline I have ever flown.

### "lost our connections flight"
My flight been delayed yesterday more then 3 hours and have connection flight from Madrid to São Paulo. In London no one inform us or just helping us. After the plane arrived it’s delayed again about one hour. We arrived to Madrid late we lost our connections flight to São Paulo and they lost our bags .. we been waiting in the information desk and no help or give us water or food. And not accommodate us our next flight been booked the following day at mid night.

### "Staff was really friendly"
Lima to Prague via Madrid. I read horrible review about Iberia before my flight, but nothing horrible happened. We took off from Lima 30 min after schedule (which I think is ok), the food was good, they offered coffee and drinks. There’s not much space for your legs but I cannot complain about anything else. Staff was really friendly, I got my bag, so for me really good service

### "This was a terrible flight"
London to Cuba via Madrid. This was a terrible flight. Never reviewed an airline before but Iberia were poor. Started from the unhelpful miserable girl on the desk. Then on the flight cabin staff who were not interested in serving and requests made you feel like it was a chore. Then it gets worse. Was given a frozen solid dinner. No not just cold frozen solid! How she didn’t realise when she gave it says everything about them. Was a replaced by a lukewarm one. And the coming back from Cuba had 2 items stolen from my luggage. Opened a case a week ago still haven’t hrd anything at all. Don’t fly Iberia.

### "only cost me £55 return"
Madrid to London Heathrow. Checked in online with only hand luggage so quick passage through security which worked well. Airside Madrid had good variety of restaurants to choose which worked well. Boarding was slow but full A340-600 which is acceptable therefore. Seat was ok but 10 year old aircraft was showing its age. IFE was available but the screen is sensitive so a simple volume adjust causes you to lose what you were doing. No in-flight free service as it is by onboard. Ticket only cost me £55 return using my BA avios points so not to bothered by this. Okay overall but would not like to travel in this seat on a long-haul from Madrid to South America as many do.

### "We were not given any information"
Disgusting customer service and complete inability to deal with problems. Iberia are scammers. They sold tickets, cancelled the flight and simply refused to take any responsibility. On December 7, Iberia cancelled a transatlantic flight IB2626 from Boston to Barcelona. Passengers were told to go home or to the hotel and wait. On the next morning, we received an email saying that the flight was cancelled (in case someone hadn’t figured that out). That was the only update from the company. Phone customer support refused to deal with the problem. The flight was marketed under Level, an airline brand under which Iberia operates low-cost flights, so we were told to call Level. Level customer reps, in their turn, kept sending us to the operator, Iberia. Level website clearly states that Iberia is the operating carrier for flights to Barcelona. After a dozen back and forth calls we were told to go back to Boston Logan Airport. At the airport, we found over 200 frustrated passengers from the same flight - and no Iberia representatives. None. At the airport information desk we were told that Iberia refused to give any updates to Boston Logan. 2 Iberia reps appeared after 1 pm on December 8, that was 15 hours after the flight was supposed to depart. Their initial response was - again! - to tell us to call Level. Or Vueling? Or someone. And to keep waiting. No attempts to book passengers for other flights were made. Eventually, Iberia reps said they needed to write down passenger names and ticket numbers. When I asked why, they told me they needed to send that information to Iberia office in Madrid. Seriously? The company didn’t have information about 200 people that had already checked in for their flight? After that, we were - again - told to go home. We were not given any information about what to expect, potential compensations, refunds, anything. We called customer service again and asked to book us for a new flight. Apparently, the earliest date available was December 12, i.e. five days later. Alternatively, we could get a refund for the tickets. Still waiting for a refund.

### "No seats available for a couple"
Mexico City to Madrid. No seats available for a couple to sit together (the new configuration apparently only has 4 pairs of couple seats and all other couples are seated either in same row but far apart or one behind the other). At mexico airport, they closed the business class check in line so same q for all passengers. The seats are narrow and no sense of privacy. The toilets (no tissues, not cleaned regularly), the sandwiches they offer as snacks during the flight. My bags literally came out the last at Madrid airport, despite having priority tags. The lounges were ok at both airports. The amenity kit was okay. Overall, just doesnt feel like anyone is in charge  with service.

### "flight was cancelled last minute"
Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled last minute. They kept us waiting in the terminal for 2 hours before finally cancelling. They tried to rebook us on a flight from Boston to Dublin and then to Barcelona from there. The email they sent the rebooking information on was in Spanish with no English translation. There was also no option to check into the flight or any information about how to access the flight online or cancel it. At this point I would only have 2 days left in Barcelona which was not worth it to me. When I tried to get a refund customer service was unhelpful and told me to call the airline that they rebooked us to. They made no effort to help and had no further communication with us. It felt like they were trying to push our problems with them onto another airline to avoid us.

### "charging to sit together"
San Jose to Madrid. Terrible service on the outward and return journey. My food was inedible. After food service staff disappeared. Bathrooms were not clean. People travelling together split up just to get a bit more money out of you by charging to move and sit together.

### "poor as a low cost"
Lisbon to Madrid. I need to fly with Iberia quite often. Over the last few years the quality has dropped to a level that makes the experience as poor as a low cost. A need to pay for seat selection within 24 hrs of the flight, space inside the aircraft, you purchase an Iberia flight and may end up in an Iberia Express or Vueling aircraft, delays. In Lisbon they opened the check-in counters 2.55 to 2 hrs before the flight, which meant a long queue. I enclose a picture of the queue two hours before the flight departure.

### "crew were very unhelpful"
London to Havana via Madrid. The crew were very unhelpful. When food was served they refused to ask the people in front to put their seat in an upright position thus we had to squeeze and eat our meal. he crew only seemed intent on looking after a handful of people - even when I rang the bell someone just came over and turned the light off but didn't enquire what my query was.

### "They lost my luggage"
Madrid to New York JFK. I had a very bad experience with them. They lost my luggage. They said when it went missing that it never made it to the plane. They located it and will deliver in 24 hours. It has been 3 days now and no one is answering us.Their customer service is below mediocre.

### "lost my baggage"
Casablanca to London in August 2019, the flight departed from Casablanca over 45 minutes late, consequently we arrived at the departure gate for the Madrid Flight three minutes after the last call and they refused us to board. We  went to the customer service desk. They have an automatic ticketing system which has a alpha numerical number and it took 2 hours 45 minutes to get served. Iberia booked my wife into a Hotel in Madrid and an early direct flight Madrid - Dublin. As we missed our London - Dublin British Airways flight we were classified as a no show therefore our return flight from Dublin - London was cancelled. I had to purchase two new Dublin - London flights. Iberia lost my baggage so for fourteen days we were without our luggage.

### "managed to lose my luggage"
Madrid to Tenerife, water is not offered for free. The seats were uncomfortable, and they managed to lose my luggage and returned it on the day I was leaving from my vacation. Staff did not seem to care when I was trying to get a full refund for the things I had to buy and had no contact with the airport or the delivery company directly. Everyday I had to call them and everyday they promised it would arrive and it never did. According to tracking, my luggage arrived the next day but I got a call from the airport at a final day asking if I even want it delivered anymore? On the flight back they didn’t have enough hand luggage space in the aircraft and had to ask the last people in line to check in their luggage. At this point I will try to avoid this airline as much as I can.

### "FA were friendly"
Madrid to Brussels. Quite an old A319, boarding was on time. FA were friendly, was a hot meal served with a choice of chicken or pasta average quality best items were the 2 pieces of cheese. Decent choice of drinks however not a welcome drink and it took more 40 minutes after departure when they started the service. One of my bags was delivered as one of last luggage pieces despite labelled priority. Iberia is not one of my favorite airlines however it should be wrong to say it is bad.

### "suitcase was put in the hold"
Barcelona to Madrid. We left 7 mins late, as I was group 4, because I am not a frequent flyer was forced to board late and my suitcase was put in the hold. They didn’t care, but once inside the plane I saw plenty of space on the overhead compartment and many people after me boarding with their case. Attendants treated me badly as when I asked why they didn’t even answer me.

### "were refused to board"
Madrid to Tangier. We were at the gate but were refused to board after the gate staff checked with someone. Our bags were also not offloaded. The delay was due to a long queue at the passport control. We were then kept asking to talk to different staff from the airline and they didnt bother how to help us to get another ticket. It is the worst experience I have had.

### "the staff were very attentive"
Buenos Aires to Madrid. Online check in painless and quick. Bag drop at Ezeiza - chaos. 3 hours before departure and there was a long line snaking through the terminal and only one person at that time handling the economy class check in. Over an hour to check in. Boarding at Ezeiza - chaos. The call came out and the lines started forming early. Waiting and more waiting. Boarding by groups. When the calls came to board group 3 it was as if a crowd had decided to form a scrum and there was no major effort to establish some order. On board: The aircraft is new, the seats comfortable, good IFE, basic pillow, blanket and earphone provided. The flight was full and the staff were very attentive helping with hand luggage and getting people seated. The crew were friendly and the service efficient. Economy class meal portions are getting smaller but the quality was perfectly fine. In the middle of the flight, in the back galley, juice and water was available as well as some sandwiches. One hour approx before landing, breakfast service was a snack box (sandwich, chocolate and yogurt) plus tea/coffee/juice. All in all: On the ground at Ezeiza - poor. On board: good. Flight was on time.

### "lost our flight to Puerto Rico"
London to Puerto Rico via Madrid. Flight was half hour late into Madrid - the bus that took us from arrival to our new gate kept us in the bus for 50 minutes and we lost our flight to Puerto Rico - had to stay the night in Madrid - next day they put us on a flight to Philadelphia which ended up being cancelled in Philadelphia so we spent the night at the airport sleeping on the floor and left the next day again late - a total of 44 hours delay. I filled in a complaint in June - they say they will respond in 21 days - 4 months later I receive a note that says they only offer compensation when they have oversold a flight and cannot accomodate you. I not only was delayed due to their fault 44 hours but I paid two nights in a luxury hotel in Puerto Rico which I was not able to use.

### "1 or 2 minutes late at the gate"
Porto to Santiago de Chile via Madrid. 1 or 2 minutes late at the gate and we were refused to board, bags were offloaded and we lost our connecting flights. We had to buy new Tickets for next day's flight. Absolutely unacceptable. We will avoid Iberia whenever possible in the future.

### "I missed my connection"
Bilbao to London via Madrid. Avoid Iberia  if you have a connecting flight in the evening requiring an overnight stay in Madrid if you miss your connection. My flight from Bilbao to Madrid was 1,5 hours late and I missed my connection to London Heathrow, which was the last flight to London in that evening. Once I left the plane, I found out that there was no transfer desk or customer service desk available. I eventually found a staff member at a random boarding gate, who told me that there are no more transfer desks near any boarding gate areas (they used to exist before) and that missed connections are now handled at check in. I would have to leave via luggage claim and go to check-in. I did, only to find a crowded service desk with 3 or 4 ladies in red uniforms chatting to each other. After waiting for 20 minutes and no progress in the line, I decided to check the Business class service desk, where a very friendly staff member decided to help me, confirming my new flight in the next morning and giving me a hotel and food voucher for the night. If it was not for her, I would probably have stayed up all night waiting for a solution. Therefore, never again. On top of that, my flights with unmotivated cabin crew and very slow service in general.

### "I could not get verification"
Not Verified |  New York to Madrid. At check in, I paid to select seats for a group of four travellers. Iberia’s website hung and I could not get verification. We restarted the process and were successful, except when I reviewed my credit card bill at home, I discovered that Iberia charged us twice.

### "Very rude staff!"
Not Verified |  Flew round trip from Chicago to Madrid and the cabin service both ways was horrible. No water was being offered during the whole flight. The only time drinks were being offered was at meal times. After that no attendants were seen again. And when I went to the back where the attendants sat and visited with one another I was treated rudely for asking for water. Very rude staff! They made me feel I was bothering them. Also they never walked around picking trash before landing. The only time they pick up trash was after meals. The cabin was littered with trash since there was no place to put them. People had to also used the seat pockets as trash bins. Very sad. First and last time flying with Iberia.

### "have never had a horrible experience like this before"
Not Verified |  This is the worse trip my friends and I have ever had! I booked my trip with Iberia, not knowing that this company was going to use another company called Level for my return to the USA. The awful experience started when I was trying to do my check-in online. The system did not let me finish my check-in and I got a message saying "If you are unable to complete the process, the boarding passes can be received at the airport. The system also asked my if I wanted to check in an "extra" luggage. Since I only had one luggage with me, I decided to ignore this (one piece can't be considered extra luggage, specially on an international trip). When we got to the airport the lady from Iberia told my friends an I that we needed to pay $90 for our luggage. I explained to her what happened during the check-in and that the system did not give me the option to check in the first luggage, however, she ignored the claim and we had to pay for it. In addition, we asked the lady if the meals were included and she clearly said: "yes, two meals are included. The trip lasted 12 hours and 50 minutes. This airline did not offer a cup of water during the whole trip, the flight attendant had a list with people's names, and only those people received a meal. The person sitting next to me, received a whole meal, while my friends and I were not offer anything (literally, not even a cup of water, for the whole trip). The people sitting behind me were really upset and they told the flight attendant that they had paid 30 euros for their meal but since they were not in the list they did not receive anything. The flight attendant told the lady "if there is extra food when we finish serving to whoever is in the list, I will bring something for you. On top of that, we tried to purchase some food and the screens on the seat indicated that the store was closed. My friend needed to take a pill and asked for a cup of water, they responded: "we only have water for purchase. There were so many unhappy people in the plane that all we heard during the trip was complains. In addition, it was super cold in the airplane and the airline did not provide blankets or anything, only for purchase, but again, the store was closed. In conclusion, do not book your trip with Iberia because you don't know what you going to get. Believe me, I have travel a lot but I have never had a horrible experience like this before. Please take my advice!

### "I missed my connecting flight"
Athens to Seville via Madrid. This was a 4 hour flight departing at 4pm, the arrival flight was 20 minutes late which was OK until we boarded with two extra passengers, yes they issued 143 boarding passes for a 141 seater aircraft. With the two extra passengers being booted off their baggage required finding and unloading this delayed the flight by a further hour. They do not have inflight entertainment, Wi-Fi, music or anything. Within 10 rows of pay to order food service they ran out of substantial snacks only chips and chocolate left. Due to all these delays I missed my connecting flight which happened to be the last flight for the day. Ground staff told me I could not retrieve my bags, they would provide accommodation but there would be no compensation for costs already incurred (airport Transfer and accommodation). My accommodation at Airport Suites was appalling, single bed, no toiletries or night wear as advised we would receive. The meal was a buffet which may have been sitting unheated or refrigerated for over 3 hours. Iberia do not except emails all complaints need to be loaded on a web page which after spending 30 minutes completing would not submit.

### "inconsistent and not reliable"
Madrid to Chicago with Iberia. This airline is inconsistent and not reliable. They are slow and never on time leaving or arriving. My husband and I flew this airline to London as well and to our luck it was late taking off and arriving. The staff do not treat everyone the same and are quite rude.

### "create a true nightmare"
Madrid to Havana. We bought business class as it is a long flight and we wanted to relax and enjoy ourselves. We checked in online and had boarding passes all the way via Madrid when we boarded the plane in London. But when we arrived in Madrid, my son had lost his seat to Havana and was put on standby. We had hoped to enjoy the lounge in Madrid before boarding but in stead we were running around between the Iberia offices where they provided no help. After 1.5 hours of dealing with staff and explaining the gravity of the situation, my son was given an economy seat. But we had at that point lost all confidence in Iberia staff. They started telling us different stories - clearly just lying. We did not trust them our son would get on, in which case we would not go. They had changed aircraft to a smaller one, which meant 5-6 couples had similar experience to us with the wifes bumped to economy. Premium economy was all moved to economy. My son was not on our reservation when I looked online upon arrival in Havana. Iberia had split his reservation so at that stage I was worried they had canceled his return. Only calling the travel agent from Havana allowed me to find that out. Iberia managed to create a true nightmare.

### "such little legroom"
Bilbao to Madrid. The flight was delayed due to thunderstorm in Madrid. No problem, this happens and the crew too well care of us whilst waiting. The plane looked new and fresh. But the seats were just terrible. I cannot recall having experienced such little legroom and narrow seats ever. Padding was hard and table, armrest very small. Recline not possible. Other than that, all well and no complaints

### "did not enforce blinds shut"
Madrid to Santiago de Chile. Flight delayed 30 minutes and the captain said we were 15 mins early, crew was polite but I had an aisle seat and they woke me several times walking through the cabin and bumping my shoulder. They did not enforce blinds shut during the flight. They charged me 5 euros to get a drink in flight and they refused to recognize our oneworld member status and wanted to charge us to pick our seats during check in which should be free. My inflight food quality was a bad quality.

### "crew was very polite and helpful"
I was flying Iberia the first time, and the check in was very average and not very prepared, although they let me check-in in the business class counter, I believe to avoid the queue. I´ve asked to change the seats of my connecting flight as I was flying with other friends, but the lady at the counter did not know if it was possible so she told me to do this in Madrid. A321-200 which was looking new from outside, the business class was very nice arranged and divided by curtains and then the first 5 rows were for the “extra comfort”, and finally mine 7A, which came with a USB plug to charge my phone which was very helpful. I was surprised that food and beverages are buy-onboard with Iberia. The crew was very polite and helpful and before landing they gave us information for connecting flights.

### "speaking and mostly Spanish"
Madrid to Vienna. I was coming from a connecting flight which had a very short connecting time, about 35 minutes, the first plane de boarded very close to the next one which had a delay of 2/2.5 hours. I had to deal with the staff which was speaking little English and mostly Spanish. They rescheduled the flight to a different terminal T4S, without saying it, so I thought it would have taken just a few minutes walking, but we had to take the connecting train which in took like 25 minutes. The A22O neo, was very clean, staff was very rude to me and seemed to be in the hurry. During the landing phase the hostess started telling her colleagues to be quick and make sure that they would have closed everything. Just one time during almost 3h flight the captain, apologized for the delay! There were no free drinks or snack included. I will try in future to avoid flying with them.

### "Very unhappy with our experience"
Not Verified |  Very unhappy with our experience on these flights, which we were on because of the BA strike. The in-cabin service was adequate on both legs of the journey. However, our Seville-Madrid sector was running late (we were stacked over Madrid for some reason) and we were concerned about making our onward connection to London. We were given the impression by the stewardess that the distance between our arrival and departure gates at Madrid would be modest. In fact it turned out that we had to get from one end of the terminal to the other, no little distance, and at some speed: we only just made it. This was a very stressful experience as one of us has restricted mobility. To make matters worse, while we made the flight, our luggage did not. We ended up hanging around in baggage reclaim at LHR for about half an hour, only to be told upon enquiry that the bags were coming in on the next flight. We still don't have them. It is impossible to speak to a human being in the customer services department, so I have no idea when I will get them back. Given that we had paid for a premium service, I had expected to receive one, and we did not. Never again.

### "hands down the worst airline"
Seville to London via Madrid. Iberia is hands down the worst airline experience I've had in my life. Of the three Iberia flights I took a month ago, all of them arrived late. They also lost my luggage and could seem to care less about it. I haven't got a single apology for losing it, let alone an attempt to actually recover my bags. Their customer service numbers are an endless maze which keeps you from talking to an actual person. If you do get someone the phone, they are rude and unhelpful. I will never fly Iberia again!

### "tried to book seats in advance"
Chicago-Madrid leg with Iberia. We tried to book seats in advance. It was impossible from both their website and customer service. I was willing to pay money for my isle seats, but I couldn't. When we checked in at American Airlines desk in LA, they told us that they couldn't change our seats on the ORD-MAD flight, as these can be changed only in Madrid, as AA don't have access to seats map software of IBERIA. Iberia and American Airlines are under the same alliance. So, we had windows seats, and every time we wanted to stand up, we needed to ask to the person who was sitting in the isle to stand up. The problem was that if we were going to the end of the plane, hostesses were telling us that we couldn't stand there unless we were queuing for the toilet. I tried to explain that it's healthier to stand up every now and then on an 8 hour flight for the blood circulation, but it was impossible to explain it. I was willing to pay more for better seats. I couldn't do it.

### "attendants were rude to me"
Bogotà to Venice via Madrid. Iberia divide the boarding in 4 groups (which is ok if performed correctly), then they create lines randomly in the airport, move the lines and create chaos. When it was finally my turn and I was almost handling the boarding pass, they called my name for a passport check at the counter. They didn’t explain why, and I had to do the queue twice. Everything just didn’t make any sense, and they didn’t provide any explanation. Flight attendants were rude to me and seem annoyed if you ask something. I pushed the assistance button twice but they never came to the seat. I had to go to the back of the aircraft to get a glass of water and ask assistance to the seat screen. My food was horrible. And for a 10 h flight only one meal. Seating super tiny.

### "legroom and seat width reasonable"
London Heathrow to Madrid. Checked in online via Iberia app which was fine. However bag drop at Heathrow is not automated and there was a huge queue with only 2 staff working - disappointing. Flight itself was OK, legroom and seat width reasonable. Cabin crew seemed jaded. No drinks or snacks included, as per the norm on most airlines now, could be purchased at exorbitant cost, of course. No WI-FI or USB on outward leg, inward leg advertised both, but USB ports broken on my seat. Best feature? Access to Pressreader app from checkin until 24 hours after flight to download unlimited newspapers and magazines from around the world; more airlines should copy this.

### "staff only spoke Spanish to me"
San Francisco to Madrid return, in both flights the price was the cheapest but you get what you paid for. The airplane itself is nice, nothing different from the rest of the airlines. The on board entertainment was good. I was surprised that the staff only spoke Spanish to me. Madrid airport lost my luggage. what makes it worst is making the claim through Iberia customer service, they don't have a representative in SFO, you would need to call a number in spain, which an automated service in spanish. I spent couple hours trying to get to someone that spoke english.

### "I couldn't check in online"
Athens to Chicago via Madrid. The only decent part of the experience is the actual flight. Customer service, online checkin were an absolute zero. I couldn't check in online the night before. For some unknown reason, Iberia's online check in wouldn't "accept" my document's country, even though it is USA and appeared in their drop-down box. No matter which browsers I used (Safari, Chrome) it wouldn't work. I called the Iberia customer service phone line and they were no help - told me I had to check in at the airport on flight day, We arrive to Athens airport on an early flight from Santorini. We have a 6-hour layover prior to our Iberia departure and were expecting to spend that time in Iberia's lounge, no - the lounge is beyond the security checkpoint and because the Iberia counter didn't open until 12:20 PM, we were without boarding passes and couldn't go thru security,  I would avoid at all costs.

### "luggage  not included in our ticket"
Milano to Medellin via Madrid. Staff is very cold and not helpful at all. We had to pay additional 120 euros at the check in cause the luggage was not included in our ticket. For 10 hours flying you got advertisement and you have to pay for some drinks. THe price is a bit cheaper than other companies, but not worth it. The seats are very  unconfortable, I had a dirty screen and dirty toilet.

### "I will avoid flying Iberia"
Madrid to Florence. Absolutely awful experience. Flight was delayed out of Chicago causing me to miss my connecting flight. I was given a new flight that would have caused me to stay at the Madrid airport for 10 hours and fly to Paris and then to Florence when the airline had more available better option flights available. After I went to 5 different customer service stands, I was finally able to get my flight changed to an earlier flight. During this time waiting on customer service I missed 2 potential earlier flight options to my destination. Terrible customer service, long lines at  kiosks. I’m now having to travel to Rome and train to Florence, which was my original destination. I will avoid flying Iberia.

### "lost 1 of our checked bags"
Madrid to Panama. Our family of five was told we were on standby waiting list after we arrived at the gate in Madrid for transcontinental flight even having purchased our tickets well in advance. Iberia was finally gracious enough to find seats for us, albeit scattered around the aircraft, and in the very back of the plane. To add insult to injury, they lost 1 of our checked bags. After 12 days, we still can not get a human on the phone to help us locate it.

### "Aircraft felt rather tired"
Madrid to London. Disappointing. Charged similar prices as other full-service carriers on an intra-European flight yet no free snack or drink, same service as a budget airline. Aircraft felt rather tired and the cabin crew were not friendly. Boarding was a complete nightmare, a single jet bridge in the summer in Spain, with no A/C to board a full A340, very poor!

### "treating customers with such contempt"
La Coruna to Nice via Madrid. I got bumped off my Iberia Flight to Nice in Madrid even though I was at the boarding gate before boarding started and had a boarding pass and had paid extra for choosing a seat. I and others were connecting from an Iberia flight from Coruna which was late, so they must have sold our seats to others. But the Nice flight was also late so we were at the gate before boarding started. There was 45 minutes wait at the Iberia service counter after we got bumped, so I bought another Iberia ticket on the next flight before they were all allocated. Iberia refused to refund me the second ticket when I eventually got to the service counter where they transferred me to that same flight on my original ticket. Not at any time did any Iberia staff apologise for selling my £350 seat to someone else. They react as if their customers are just a massive inconvenience to them. Who else could continue to trade while treating their customers with such contempt.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Santiago de Compostela. I received an email to check in 24 hours in advance. I went to their website to check in. Just as I was about to complete the process, the website said an error occured. I could not confirm if I was checked in, or what seats I had. I experience motion sickness, so having a window seat is imperative. Our first flight with Iberia (last week) I was fortunate enough to be assigned a window. Today I was assigned an aisle seat in row 20. I knew I was going to have issues due to my inability to check in, so I ensured to arrive 3.5 hours early for my flight. Apparently, the only window seat left 3.5 hours before the flight is for 30, the last seat of the plane. It is close to the lavatories and does not recline. Checked luggage: I flew with Iberia last week, and again today. Last week we did not have to pay for checked luggage, and today I do. It is 45€ / bag. They cannot explain to me as to why I did not find this information online during the booking process. I'm fine paying for luggage as long as it's reasonable and I am aware in advance. They didn't explain why I didn't have to pay for luggage last week on a longer flight. As far as the flight today, I have not boarded the aircraft yet. Last week we had to wait 45 minutes for our bags to be at the baggage claim.

### "I am feeling angry, helpless"
Hamburg to Sevilla via Madrid. I thought that Iberia stood for quality, but I experienced no customer-oriented behaviour on so many levels today. Boarding was completed and we were already running late - cabin crew told us that there was a problem with the luggage - we stood there for one hour in a boarded aircraft, summer heat of 36 degrees outside, cabin crew denied opening the doors to let air in. We were not allowed to take the hand luggage with us (standard procedure, I know), but some had connecting flights and were told that the time would be sufficient (we had that delay of one hour then, had 40 minutes time to change planes...impossible I guess unless that other plane waited. After landing we were told that connecting flights were rescheduled to the regional airline Air Nostrum, but we did not have our luggage, so I had to get my luggage, leave the airport and enter again, go through airport security. Unfortunately, Iberia could not tell us which gate we should go to and told us we should talk to the customer service to find out more. Well, there was a line of 50-100 passengers and 4 employees. So many of us just waited without being able to talk to customer service for our connecting flight. We were hoping that at some point some information would be released. -During those hours of uncertainty I tried to talk to Iberia personnel and was told that I should wait in line. Iberia personnel would even avoid me, when I talked to them, they were just starting to talk to their colleagues. I would have never expected this experience in my life. Certainly it was the worst travelling day for me. I am feeling angry, helpless and also humiliated. I do not expect to get any refund for this.

### "less than service oriented"
Madrid to New York on a new A350 aircraft. The inflight crew was less than service oriented. I had to argue over drinking water and how much I am entitled to. Beside the two regular scheduled services on this 8 hour flight, the crew was not to be seen again in the cabin. They never came through the cabin to offer water or beverages. The food I found to be of inferior quality. The toilets ran out of towels, paper and soap. The flight was delayed.

### "cancelled 1 hour before"
Los Angeles to Madrid, my flight has been cancelled 1 hour before departure. At first all passengers have been directed to check-in desk. After 8 hours of waiting, we received new tickets for the flights 28 hours later (flight by BA, which belongs to the same alliance). It was around 2 AM in the night. According to EU regulations, EU airlines on the flights to EU airport in such cases should secure all passengers with: hotel, food and transportation airport-hotel-airport free of charge. At least to cover the costs of it (we paid on our own for it, they only booked the hotel after pressure from passengers). None of these has happened and Iberia is rejecting to compensate without given reason. We are extremely dissapointed for this service.

### "entitling us to checked bag each"
Madrid to Rome. My wife and I bought economy tickets entitling us to a checked bag each. We arrived at the Madrid airport 1:30 before the flight. The check-in area was pure chaos. No help. No clear instructions. Hundreds of people. Finally, we figured out that we needed to use automated machines to emit baggage tags. The first tag came out fine. When I tried for a second, the only option was to pay €60. Same thing for either boarding pass. Since we wanted to get on the plane, I paid. Now Iberia has informed me that my purchase is non-refundable. What a rip-off.

### "say a massive thank you"
I just wanted to say a massive thank you to A Vicente (the main man for the cabin crew) on the June 2nd 7.30 Madrid to Luton Airport flight. An error at the desk meant I didn't have a seat number and after some mixed messages from other staff he very quickly thought on his feet and came up with a plan so myself and several others with no seat number could sit down and rest after a long 24 hours. After this, he not only checked up on me to make sure everything was okay, but couldn't do enough to make my journey as pleasant as possible. It really made my flight back to England the best it could be and helped ease the pain after watching Tottenham lose the night before. Cabin crew have to deal with some difficult customers at times, but if all flights had staff like this staff then most customers would be happy in the end. Again a massive thank you for solving what was a quite worrying situation for myself and others.

### "satisfied with service on the flight"
Arrival to Miami from Madrid was 30 minutes early. The originating from Palma to Madrid was 35 minutes late in leaving, which gave me 35 minutes to board the flight from Madrid to Miami. Additionally, the computers in Mallorca were down, and all information was entered by hand. Check-in lines in Mallorca were long and slow, and I was happy we arrived 2 1/2 hrs early to Palma airport. Madrid airport is large and I needed to catch the train from one terminal to the next, then ran to the gate for boarding. I made the flight but my luggage did not make the connection. Once in Mami I received a text informing me that our luggage did not make the connection. In Miami the Iberia representive was barely helpful. She was given the text I received from Iberia. She was given my bag claim tickets, and my drivers license which contained my address for delivery. Only one of two bag claim tickets were entered, and my home address was entered wrong, both the street name, and city. Arrival into Miami was Saturday afternoon. It is now Monday and still I am without my baggage. It is very difficult to call Iberia by phone. Initially your information must be given by voice to a computer which more often than not incorrectly interprets your voice instructions requiring repeated attempts, then often transferring you to the incorrect department. Once connected to a live person, they only repeat the data that you can log on and see for yourself. No mechanism exists regarding confirmation of the location of your bags. While the Iberia staff are polite, they really have no mechanism to assist, and were unable to help. On the plus side the staff on the Madrid to Miami flight were pleasant, and the service was above average. I was very satisfied with the service on the flight. The food was below standards compared to the American Airlines flight from Miami to Barcelona. I consider myself a seasoned traveler, and this experience has been trying, frustrating and frankly unacceptable.

### "can't file a complaint"
Madrid to Los Angeles. Mobile App doesn't work, on-line check-in never works, they "bump" your seats which were paid for and confirmed 6 mo's in advance without any notice and customer service is useless. The new planes have no room in coach, they require you to put your seat up straight (take off position) during service. When I filed a complaint on their site., it won't accept my  information so you physically can't file a complaint!

### "Punctual service"
Not Verified |  Milan to Lima via Madrid with Iberia. Punctual service, medium-recent airplane, discreet entertainment, space between seats at the height limit of about 1.85m. Main meal to be improved, breakfast ok, no snacks.

### "unacceptable handling"
Geneva to Mexico City via Madrid. Smooth flight from GVA to MAD, very good lounge at MAD. But flight to Mexico City had 2 hours delay. Food and wine on board excellent. Flight attendants very distant and uninvolved. Arrival in Mexico City chaotic. No Iberia staff to be found to help with missed connections. Found an Iberia lady eventually only thanks to help of airport staff. She handed me ticket for onward flight at 8.20 pm (scheduled, but missed flight would have been at 6.50 am), saying there were no available flights before (there are flights to Cancun every 5 mins, just not all with Interjet, Iberia's partner airline). I demanded hotel, but was refused such. Was handed voucher for a breakfast and lunch in transit area, and then I was on my own. No access to any lounge. Had to re-check in at Interjet, queueing for 70 mins. Asked for earlier flight and was sent to stand-by counter and actually got a last seat on a 11 am flight, running to gate after 4 hours of waiting (standing and no food/refreshments as voucher valid only in transit area). On way back to GVA, Interjet at CUN was unable to print boarding passes for Iberia flights. I was told to get it at departure gate at MEX. Many people with same issue were queuing there already, but no Iberia staff to be seen. I made my way to Iberia's lounge and was granted access after much discussion since I had no Business Class boarding pass yet. Boarding utter chaos. Flights to MAD and GVA smooth. Food and wine again quite good. Flight attendants somewhat more involved, but way below friendliness of airline staff like Asian airlines or even Alitalia or Air France. Overall: Good hard product, but huge staff problem. Absolutely unacceptable handling of Business Class passengers at airports.

### "Very rude cabin crew"
Porto to Madrid. This flight with Iberia wasn't much different from my past ones. Very rude cabin crew shouting to people when boarding. I was told that was mandatory to get my tax free shopping underneath the seat, which is not true and there was space above. But the best part was the fact my bag didn't make it for my next flight, and is not the first time this happened. Madrid airport seems modern but clearly don't work like should work!

### "would be able to no show"
I checked multiple times on the phone that I would be able to no show on my Madrid to Barcelona leg of my flight and made plans to do so. Over the phone they reassured me that it would be no problem at all and I would not have to pay any extra fee. I was wrong and the ticketing officer let me know when I went to check upon arrival to Madrid. Iberia automatically printed a second last name similar to my real one on my boarding pass. This was not my real last name and caused problems at security. I had problems at every ticket booth retrieving my boarding passes.

### "fly another airline"
This airline is a real vacation bummer. From the moment I arrived in LAX to check in. The customer agent would not check me in for both my flights and refused to check my bag through to my final destination. I had a 50 minute connection time from one Iberia flight to another in Madrid. They wanted me to pick up my bag in Madrid and recheck in for my connecting flight on Iberia to Tangier! However, after I paid $105 to check the bag , which should have been a free bag, it was checked through to Tangier and I got a connecting boarding pass. However, my bag made it to Madrid and not to Tangier. It was extortion basically. The plane was horrible as was the service and the food. On the way back I had the same problem, except this time when my bag got left in Madrid they delivered it to me the next day, but the bag was damaged beyond repair. When I tried to contact the airline via, web, email and phone, I kept getting error or disconnect messages. Basically there is no customer service. Don't let them ruin your vacation, fly another airline.

### "received no vegan food"
Madrid to Quito. Contacted Iberia offices in London in Feb requesting Vegan meal onboard. I was reassured on the phone that my order is recorded. On the flight I received no vegan food and once had to eat a vegetarian meal. Remained hungry throughout the flight. No help from crew. Very abrupt and impolite attitude. Seat was extremely uncomfortable. You couldn't hear the sound through the headphones provided onboard. Extremely bad service.

### "nothing short of shambolic"
London to Madrid was nothing short of shambolic from boarding, running an hour and a half late, running out of food and hot water! And then when we landed we ran flat out to the gate of our connecting flight to Porto to find a guy behind us was allowed through and onto the flight but we weren't - no explanation, rude attendant told us we had been out on another flight. We asked which flight she said we had to go to customer service, we asked where that was, she waved her arm but wouldn't give us directions. The customer service desk woman was also rude - no apology and totally rude when I asked would our bags follow us - I'm still not convinced! And the final insult - a voucher for free dinner at McDonalds.

### "slightly higher than low cost"
Madrid to Milan. Iberia's short-haul flights are different from long-haul or intercontinental flights. In these Iberia offers a service just slightly higher than that offered by the low cost: no IFE, food on purchase seats with a decidedly insufficient pitch.

### "offers comfortable flights"
Miami to Madrid. A fairly recent aircraft, with comfortable seats equipped with a proper pitch and equipped with IFE with personal screens and power. Good quality of food and beverage. Flight attendants are kind, but being a night flight, not all the time present and very attentive to the passengers' needs. Iberia generally offers comfortable flights and adequate prices to destinations in North America and Latin America

### "The seats were great"
Flew Iberia from Sao Paulo to Madrid on my way back to London. The seats were great when compared to the BA Club World but service and food was terrible. The FA were in such a mood that it looked as if they were doing me a favor and the food, I chose the chicken but mine was undercooked and full of nerves. Could not eat it. In summary - seats pretty good and the rest rubbish.

### "Horrible check in"
Buenos Aires to Madrid. Horrible check in service. Baggage not sold with tickets online. Poor Web interface. Call center in Buenos Aires ask for voice recognition then cut line off. Poor boarding experience. Unruly not organised. On board sat next to a lady crew member. Friends (ie steward) gave two bottles of wine on board to be put in her bag to take out. Utterly unprofessional.

### "not recommend this flight"
Madrid to Miami. Worst customer service. The seat is so tight. I do not recommend this flight, pay extra little money and enjoy the other flight.

### "a very poor Premium product"
Not Verified |  Bogota to Madrid. When flying long-haul these days I prefer to pay a bit more for Premium Economy in order to have extra space and a slightly better level of service. With Iberia I feel that it is not worth the additional expense and is a very poor Premium product. Whilst the seats were comfortable and the IFE good, the service was pretty sub standard. There was no pre-dinner drinks service, with beer, wine and soft drinks being handed out with the meal. Spirits were not available but there was an announcement saying these could be purchased later (No one came round to offer so assume you would go to a galley to get them). The meal was a choice between chicken and pasta - when I asked what was in the pasta the cabin crew member serving me had no idea and said I could open it and check and hand it back if I wanted the chicken instead. It wasn't bad but you really would think in 2019 that crew know what they are serving given all the issues around allergies. There was no proactive offering of a second drink and I had to ask for one, though bizarrely they did offer more bread rolls - when everyone had already finished their meal! The crew then disappeared after clearing dinner and made only cursory passenger checks through the night. Breakfast was served about at an hour before landing in MAD- the main element was a warm cheese and tomato roll that was stuck to the box it was warmed up in, and took a while to loosen. The late serving of breakfast meant there was a mad rush to get it cleared and the cabin ready for landing- this wasn't achieved and we touched down with seats not upright, window shades closed and video screens not stowed away. Overall a poor experience and if you are going to offer Premium Economy at least invest in the product - British Airways have done this quite successfully so it is a mystery that their sister company hasn't.

### "over charged for golf clubs"
Birmingham to Madrid. I was over charged for bringing golf clubs. It clearly states £40 on the website. I was charged £50 even though I showed the webpage to the guy on the desk. When I phoned customer service and when a went to customer service desk at Madrid they both agreed I was over charged. After filling out a complaint form the emailed me back saying it was the correct charge on a no reply email address.

### "No idea how to handle delays"
Not Verified |  London to Vigo via Madrid. Awful all round. No idea how to handle delays, how to manage groups of people, or how to treat passengers. I’ve encountered the same problem with this airline time and again, so I will be seeking alternative routes in future.

### "service and food quite bad"
We recently endured economy return flights from Buenos Aires to Madrid. While the seats were actually quite comfortable and we appreciated the 2-4-2 configuration, the service and food were quite bad. We hardly saw the cabin crew except when serving a meal, rest of the time there were 1 or 2 chatting in the galley. There was no drink service before meals. No information about the meal apart from a cursory “pasta or chicken”. When I asked for an eye mask I was told to go to the back of the plane. Earphones were awful and seemed like the ones other airlines used to provide 25 years ago. Perhaps we’re too critical as our benchmark is Singapore Airlines, Thai, Cathay Pacific, Qantas etc and they’re in a higher quality segment of the market.

### "I had to go to the galley"
I flew from Mexico City to Madrid. I asked the flight attendant for water but he refused to give me water saying "the seat belt Sign is on I can't serve you". The seat belt sign was on for like 5hrs. I had to go to the galley to get it myself.

### "EasyJet style experience"
A swift trip from London to Madrid on Iberia. It was a EasyJet style experience on an A340. No real issues. Food and drink had to be purchased and in fact they had run out of most things by the time the cart came around. Got me from A to B and thats fine.

### "most unprofessional airline"
On Thursday, December 27th, my fiancé and I were scheduled to fly New York to Madrid. At 8:30, we all lined up to board and then after standing for 30 minutes with no direction, we were told that the plane had a mechanical issue. For the following three hours, we were given vague and unhelpful updates roughly once an hour. This was stressful since it was getting later and later in the night. Finally, close to 11:30, we were told the flight was cancelled in Spanish. The message was not repeated in English for another three minutes. We then proceeded down to baggage claim and there was no one from Iberia to direct us or tell us what was happening. We waited in complete confusion for close to 30 minutes. Finally, we were let through a door and told to write our name, phone number and email on a white sheet of printer paper and that they would be getting buses to take us to a hotel. Everyone on our flight was very confused why we were being asked to write our information down as we assumed that any airline would already have this information in their system. At this point, we took a cab and returned to our apartment in Brooklyn to attempt to get some sleep. We were told we would get a phone call or text letting us know when the plane was fixed. At 2:53AM, we woke up to the sound of a text saying our itinerary was changed. We were now scheduled to leave on December 28th at 18:59 to London, have a three-hour layover and then take another flight from London to Madrid. I immediately called Iberia and spoke to an incredibly rude customer service rep. She told me that Iberia already changed my ticket for free so any other change would require a fee. I have never heard of a policy like this. I knew there was a 5:00 (17:00) direct flight on Dec 28th and I at the very least I wanted to get on that. After a very frustrating conversation with no apology or resolution, I attempted to get more sleep. At 7:05AM, I got another text saying that our original flight was delayed to 15:30 and to call the airport at 12:30 to check. I immediately called Iberia to ask about that flight status and why our itinerary didn’t show that flight and the customer service representative could not explain this. They said that the 15:30 flight did not exist and/or that we didn’t have tickets on it. At this point, we were confused whether we should go back to JFK with no ticket or go for our new flight with the connection. I finally reached a customer service rep,  who told us there was nothing he could do. At that point, I asked to speak to his manager and suddenly he said that he could get us on the 17:00 direct flight. I’m confused why this wasn’t an option from the beginning. When we arrived at the airport and returned to our original gate from the previous night around 3:45PM, we were told that our original flight from Thursday night departed at 3:30 (15:30). I do not understand why we weren’t given the option to be on that flight. The lack of clear communication is unacceptable. I have submitted a formal complaint to Iberia about the situation, asking for reimbursement for the cabs and hotel room we had to pay for, but did not use in Spain, and I was sent a generic apology email saying it was out of their control. I cannot emphasize enough, Iberia has been the most unprofessional airline I have ever experienced and I have flown too many places to count.

### "have to pay at the airport"
Round trip from Tel-Aviv to Seville via Madrid. Flight to Seville was OK. But troubles begun on the way back. During online check in, a day before the flight, Iberia's web site popped error message saying that it's not possible to pay for our luggage online and we'll have to pay at the airport. At the airport we've been ordered to pay 60 EUR, which is twice as online payment price. I've tried to contact Iberia's representative and explain the problem but in Seville they have only company that providing ground services. As you can understand we had no choice but pay in airport luggage fee. I've left complain form which explained the problem that we could not pay for our luggage during online check in due to problem with Iberia's web site and have been charged in airport luggage fee, but the complain has been denied. Will hardly order our next flight with Iberia in foreseeable future.

### "I could not move at all"
I had an inland Iberia flight from Coruna to Madrid. It is a very short one (around 1h). So I was not expecting a lot from this flight of course. Usually when I take this kind I have got no problem. It is however the first time I have had such short leg room. Indeed I am tall (1m90) but I dont have this problem on other flights. This one was a nightmare as I could not move at all and I had to work with my computer. Just found it is a joke to propose this cabin arrangement.

### "waiting for baggage for 4 days"
Turin to Madrid via Chicago. My family and I arrived at Chicago airport on December 21st, flying from Madrid. Part of our baggage was missing. A nice lady at the carousel was already informed of the occurrence and prepared a claim for us. Apparently this is something that happens quite often. She pointed out to a pile of baggage from the previous day, same flight. She said the baggage would be delivered to our location the next day. We were a little disappointed because the baggage contained all the kids' clothes and presents for the people we were visiting, but it's a busy time to travel, things like that happen and we were pleased with the way things were handled until then. The next day nobody called to schedule the delivery, nor the baggage was delivered. So the day after (December 23rd) we call the airline. A gentlemen speaking a bad English informed us that the baggage was likely in Madrid but could not confirm the location or when it would be delivered. Likewise, no information on the Iberia website. We would have to call the next day. That was starting to be a little too much annoying. Finally on December 24th we were informed that the baggage was boarded on the flight to Chicago and that it would be delivered the same evening or at latest the next morning. At night we found a voicemail informing to call before 8:30pm or the next morning for the delivery. So on Christmas morning we called, we were informed that the baggage was actually at the airport closest to our location (about 20 miles away) but it would not be delivered because Iberia does not pay the courier. If we wanted our suitcase, we would have to go and pick it up at the airport! That's what we did. Of course we issued a claim, requesting compensation for the emergency clothing we had to buy, for the travel expense to go and pick up the baggage and for the inconvenience of having to do so on Christmas morning after waiting for the baggage for 4 days. The airline recognized compensation only for the emergency clothes.

### "a big zero for this airline"
London Heathrow to Madrid with Iberia. The worst airline ever. First we got a very rude lady at the boarding desk, she wanted to let us give her our handbags to be shipped with big pieces of luggage. She was very rude and not helpful at all. I lost my ipad as I forgot it on the aircraft and then tried my best, even paid twice to go to the airport but staff were not trained and it was useless talking to them, a big zero for this airline.

### "missed my connecting flight"
London to Santiago de Chile via Madrid. I had to check in my cabin baggage, although correct size as check in clerk said possibly insufficient room on plane but they would check it in for free. I padlocked it. When I finally got to Santiago, the lock had been ripped off and thrown back inside the case, the gifts I had had been broken into and a mans watch had been stolen. The flight left one hour late and as a result I missed my connecting flight at Madrid and was put in a substandard hotel near Madrid and told they couldn’t get me on a flight for 2 days. They wouldn’t let me have my cabin luggage because by the time they got around to dealing with me they said the baggage place was closed, so I had no overnight things, clothes, toiletries etc. I arrived at my destination 44 hours later than scheduled. That was 2 days I lost with my young grandson who I had not seen for 2 years. When I submitted a complaint and in particular a request for EU flight compensation, I asked for the reason for the delay and got a stupid response that the delay was beyond their control, but still no actual reason or explanation. I submitted the complaint again and took advice from the consumer advice service which provided the correctly worded letter template for EU flight delay compensation and they replied that I was inconvenienced because of something beyond their control and no explanation. They closed down my complaint references without any explanation or apology.

### "the Iberia flights are normally good"
Iberia flys daily to and from from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic and Madrid and they have Air Europa as the alternative, I always fly Iberia as they have flat bed seats in business class and arrive in their terminal where I make my transfers. Like most airlines there are good and bad flights but the Iberia flights are normally good. The seats are comfortable, the crew are normally pleasant and the prices are fair if you book early, they rise steeply as the departure date draws closer and also at Easter and Christmas time. My last two flights were very good. I have to say that the entertainmentt programmes are mostly rubbish unless you like B grade movies and pop music and I do not like spanish wines but everything else last December was top notch and I will continue using them.

### "lost my luggage in September"
Boston to Madrid. Iberia lost my luggage in September. I filed a claim on October 1. On October 17, I was told I would be receiving $405 USD in compensation via check. It has now been more than 70 days since that original email, and I have not received the check. I have spent hours on the phone with Iberia, and eventually after complaining on Facebook I was told that the check had been lost. I have not been able to get any further updates for more than a week now. Iberia is the worst company I have ever dealt with. I will never fly them again.

### "luggage did not make it"
I arrived in Tel Aviv on 12/22 at 9:50 PM. My checked luggage did not make it to Tel Aviv. I immediately went to the Iberia "Customer Service" Counter to file a claim. I was visiting the Holy Land for Christmas. I was there from 12-22-18 through 12-29-2018. My husband was at home in the US. He made numerous calls to Iberia. He spent over 3 hours on 12/24 attempting to have my luggage located and delivered to my hotel. He finally read on a travel blog that if you threaten to contact the Spanish Government that Iberia will finally react. It was correct. He received an email within 10 minutes of this threat. They located my luggage in Miami on 12-25. It never made it out of Miami (It was supposed to follow me with my connecting flight in Madrid, then on to Tel Aviv). I finally received my luggage on 12/26 -late in the evening. Just in time to turn around and leave early in the morning on 12/29 for home! Now I am trying to get someone to respond in order to be reimbursed the $50 allowed per diem per day that I did not have access to my luggage. My tour director had to take me shopping on 12/24 because I had been wearing the same outfit since I left my home on 12/21. I Will NOT give up, I WILL be successful in retrieving my $200 that they owe me for reimbursement for clothing and toiletries. I was with a tour group.

### "My bag was misplaced"
Palma de Mallorca to Madrid. Worst customer service I have ever received from any company. Surly and lazy staff, bureaucratic and unhelpful. After a delayed flight I was refused repatriation of any kind and was delayed two days to my destination. My bag was misplaced during this ordeal and it has been over two weeks and Iberia have refused to help in any way. However, the cabin crew were polite and accommodating which is why I think 1 star is appropriate.

### "surly unprofessional crew"
Buenos Aires to Madrid with Iberia. The worst cabin crew ever. Despite being the festive season they turned out to be the most surly unprofessional crew we’ve ever experienced. The flight was barely half full so it could hardly be that they were overstretched! Safety didn’t seem to be a priority as far as pre-take off and landing checks were concerned. Very cursory cabin checks were undertaken and large carry on bags were allowed to remain on seats for both take off and landing. The crew seemed totally disinterested in the safety implications. Food and beverage service seemed to be a chore. On one occasion I went to the galley to request a drink, two staff were idly chatting to each other. Despite one of them certainly being aware of my presence they totally ignored me and disappeared in the other direction! The toilet was a disgrace and didn’t appear to have been cleaned throughout the 11 hour flight. The only positives were the excellent information provided from the flight deck and the fact that the flight landed an hour early. The latter was of little benefit to us as we had an onward connection.

### "impossible to contact"
London to Mexico City via Madrid. Customer service is terrible, if anything doesn't go smoothly they are impossible to contact - there is no response, the line is dead, webpage doesn't work etc. Prior to flying I  tried to change a flight. No-one could help me and no-one ever contacted me. I gave up and accepted the flight given. We had a connecting flight and baggage was delayed. We were given a number to call and a website to check to see when they would arrive (they promised within 12 hours). We didn't receive it for 24 hours and had no idea when it would arrive as they were impossible to get in touch with.

### "no in flight entertainment"
Madrid to Dakar. After an Iberia express flight to Madrid (I was on business class but it is no worth for this kind of flight), I went to International Iberia lounge in Madrid T4S. The lounge is quite new, wide and there is everything you need for food & drinks. I had a long stopover but I manage to work well. Really this lounge is good and convenient (basically Iberia Terminal at Madrid Bajaras is very good) The flight was less good. The cabin was old fashioned with very depressive lights and the engines were very loud. The business cabin arrangement is 2x3 seats with the one in the middle empty. These were standards seats that can only by angled and there were very uncomfortable (thickness like 10 cm) and very sensitive to the movement of other passengers or crew walking in the aisle. Flight was 4hrs 40 mins and there was a quite good dinner served. Then 1 coffee, tea and then over. Crew disappeared behind the curtains. There was no in flight entertainment system  (no Ipad etc). This flight is too long for short haul carrier like A321 with low business class service.

### "cannot find fault with Iberia"
Buenos Aires to Madrid. Once again, cannot find fault with Iberia. Very fast check-in and boarding, excellent cabin crew available throughout the 12+hour flight. Plenty of newspapers and magazines offered plus welcome drink before take off. Ample drink selection and hot tasty meal and good spanish wines to choose from. IFE good, but movie choice could be more up to date. Smooth flight, hot breakfast before landing and sailed through immigration etc.

### "they swap my second surname"
Not Verified |  On the English Website, when you do a booking ask you to fill the Name, Surname/Last name, and second Surname. when I did my booking, they swap my second surname to my last name and now they want to charge £30 per person to change to the right one because in Spain is the way it is when I used the English version. I called twice, and the customer service was just ridiculous,super unhelpful. They understood the mistake is their mistake, but they want to charge me £30 per head to change when I did everything correctly.

### "Very nice experience"
Lima to Madrid. Very nice experience. The flight was on time. The cabin about 90% full, the at the check-in counter I was asked if I want to change to a row without any other pax - very nice. Modern cabin with good IFE. Seat is semi tilting, semi forward sliding but leg space never a problem. Toilets could have been more clean towards the end. Also one did not have soap the entire flight. Food was okay for an 11 hour flight: a warm "classic" meal with salad, warm main, desert, bread; plus a sandwich with sweet crackers later which could have been more. KSML and others available and treated accordingly. They did many drink runs. During the flights they offered one of the strangest sandwiches in the galley: soft white bread with grated carrots. FAs were all very kind, I asked for a second main which was granted and I even got some small snacks for my pretty long layover. Luggage was checked through without any problem despite competing airline.

### "you may get delays"
Not Verified |  Miami to Madrid return. The flight to Madrid from Miami was ok, even though the flight attendants were not in much of the mood. The food wasn't the best. The flight in return got delayed because of strong headwinds and the flight had to be rerouted from 8:30 hours to 10 hours. I had an interconnecting flight to catch at 9:35 PM in Miami, and the flight was scheduled to arrive at 8PM, leaving just enough time to pass through immigration and other necessary stuff. The flight arrived at 8:40PM even with the rerouting scheduled to have arrived at 8PM, and we set foot out of the gate at almost 9PM, time for boarding the other flight. Since time through the security passed, the flight left while I was picking up my luggage. After talking to them, they were able to give me a hotel and a dinner and breakfast voucher, which is something at least I am a little grateful for. If you are flying with Iberia, you may get delays.

### "extremely disappointing"
Disappointing flight from start to finish. Think twice before booking. We booked to fly to Lima, Peru through British Airways (BA) and they routed us on Iberia (IB) going via Madrid as they done do Lima direct. I felt comfortable selecting the Iberia flight knowing that the two airlines merged several years ago , and I assumed they would be quite similar in standard. Unfortunately that was not the case, Iberia is a vastly inferior service with lazy staff who treat passengers with disdain. We flew in Premium Economy(PE), something that IB has added to their aircraft around 18 months ago; we traveled on a Airbus 340-600. Boarding: the gate was absolute chaos - no signage to indicate where each class of travel should queue, and only 2 staff members to manage a crowd of 350 passengers. No priority given to people in wheelchairs or families traveling with push buggies etc. Onboard: the PE hard product looked good; Seats were standard premium economy and the bulkhead seat was spacious. The tv screens were modern, large with sharp picture quality. Unfortunately there were several coffee stains on the cabin walls and my footrest was broken. The crew: they were very lax. No cabin crew pointing out emergency exit, or any form of demo - just a pre recorded met. Throughout the 12 hour flight when ever the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign (5-6 times), the crew only made verbal announcements but no crew member actually came round to check that passengers were safely buckled up. When there was turbulence during meal service the crew would just carry on - even walking around with a hot pot of coffee serving passengers! The toilets were dirty all three times I used the facilities- no crew went in to tidy it at any point during the flight. The crew were literally just doing the bare essentials- well, not even. They were not particularly friendly either, no smiles no banter, just dropped the food on your tray table and moved to the next seat. Between meal service there were no crew to be seen. The food and beverages: the food in PE was economy food, as were the beverages (wine choice was “red or white”) and no spirits were served. No pre meal drinks service either. The food menu listed did not match the food being served. Summary: Iberia as a whole were extremely disappointing. The crews lack of adherence to standard air safety protocol is concerning. Iberia’s premium economy product was well below par and not worth what you pay for it. I was relieved when we landed, and thankful that our flight back to the UK from Buenos Aires is going to be on a British Airways aircraft.

### "no organization, no communication"
Boston to Seville via Madrid. Our flight to Spain was cancelled due to a mechanical problem. We milled around the staff desk for 3 hours with no info re where/when they would put us up for the night. Or how we should reclaim our bags. On the way home, again it was total chaos, no organization, no communication.

### "avoid Iberia in the future"
New York to Venice via Madrid. Flew on an AA codeshare RT flight from JFK-VCE with a transfer in Madrid. Iberia's new A350-900 is a beautiful plane. Cabin comfort is awesome even though seat pitch is terrible. Although I picked seat 38L which is by far the best seat in economy. Overall I was very happy with the service I received even if it was minimal and basic. The highlight of flying with Iberia is Madrid-Barajas airport which is one of the most beautiful in the world. Being Sapphire on One World I was also able to use their gorgeous VIP lounge and take a shower before my flight from Madrid to Venice. The reception desk employees couldn't have been more disinterested however. Their inter-european flights are horrible however. It's run like a budget airline where you have to pay 2 Euros for water. That's pathetic. Also the A319 I flew both directions was ancient and dirty and shouldn't have been in service in that condition. The water in the forward cabin restroom didn't work and instead they had towelettes to wash your hands. That's not acceptable. The flight back from Madrid to JFK was comfortable however service was absolutely terrible. They advertise WiFi but I couldn't get it to work after being in the air and at cruising altitude for over an hour. When I asked the flight attendant she gruffly told me that they haven't turned it on yet and that "Usted tiene que estar patiente" as if she was scolding a 5 year old. I'm not sure why that was necessary. When the WiFi did work it was so slow as to be rendered unusable. During the flight there was a 5 hour stretch where they couldn't be bothered to come through the aisle to even offer water or juice. This was unacceptable. Also they used the excuse of turbulence. I finally got up and asked the flight attendant in the back if I could please have some water. He poured me a cup and when I handed him the glass back he rudely snapped at me in Spanish saying: "Don't you see the seatbelt sign is on? You are supposed to be in your seat. It was uncalled for and inexcusable. At the end of the day they used the turbulence excuse in order to sit in the back of the plane and chat. Later I tested them by pressing my FA call button. They never came to my seat. That's no good. Of course when the final meal before landing was being served we were flying through extremely rough turbulence. But it wasn't enough in that case to suspend service? My overall takeaway is I would avoid Iberia in the future and fly AA-BA codeshare flights in the future. My overall impression of Iberia is that of a third-rate airline and is one of the weakest links in the One World Alliance.

### "poor business class product"
Barcelona to Madrid. Shockingly poor business class product. An economy class seat at three times the price in exchange for a guaranteed empty middle seat. Lunch consisted of a tuna salad sandwich wrapped in a plastic package, which looked awful and tasted worse. Aircraft old and shabby, no IFE, no power or WiFi and shuttle gates at far end of A concourse in BCN. You simply could not of dreamed up a worse combination on this key route. Do yourself a huge favour and take the AVE fast train. So much more civilised on so many levels and such a better experience and value.

### "bad customer experience"
Santiago de Chile to Brussels via Madrid. The flight from Santiago to Madrid was fine. Only in Madrid did we see that our connection was canceled. When requesting assistance to change our flight at their helpdesk the attendants where rude and useless in helping us out. Because it was caused by a strike by the baggage handling company, they offered no options for refund. All in all a bad customer experience.

### "regret choosing Iberia"
Sao Paulo to Barcelona via Madrid. All the passangers were comfortably seated, ready for take off when we were informed that there was a delay of 20 min, of which did not bother us much. Then another announcement, this time we were told to get our hand luggage and return to the boarding gate and wait there. Nearly 3 h later It was a total confusion at their desk, we were still waiting but Iberia did not look after us at all - No more update about the flight; No refreshment provisions; No respect for passenger's right. The only thing we knew was that there was a faulty piece that needed to be changed. Finally more than 6 hours later our flight took off. The hostess served the usual dinner and a drink, only once. Never again any host came back during the flight to offer us another drink, not even water. Our calls were ignored. In the morning before the landing we were not served any breakfast. When we asked for it the hostess refused and reasoned that they had no obligation to be in that flight since it was so late in leaving. The hostess were not pleasant, in fact not professional orientated; they made no effort to speak any Portuguese, we had to make the effort to speak Spanish if we wanted to communicate. I regret choosing Iberia and surely will never fly with them again!

### "electronic tickets not accepted"
Marrakech to Madrid. We arrived 2 hours before just with our hand luggage at the airport and headed towards the boarding. There we where told that our electronic tickets are not accepted and that we have to print it at the Iberia counter. The Iberia counter was full with those who wants to drop-off their bags. We were told to do all the queue just to print the ticket. It took forever, they where teaching a trainee at the counter. A service-lady from the airport told me I should ask the office which are responsible for Iberia and Ryanair to print the tickets for me. The Lady there just refused to print our ticket without telling me why. As the priority-line of Iberia was empty I went to the counter and asked the check-in man if he would just be so friendly to print our tickets, we are about to miss our flight. He just refused talking to me as I had no priority tickets. In total we had to wait 1:30h just to print the tickets and almost missed our flight. We were lucky that there was no line at the security or passport-control. Why does Iberia not inform their customers about this printed ticket airport-regulation? We could have avoided all the stress by printing the tickets at our hotel and why is there no ticket-printer at the airport? Bad experience with very stressful hours which could be easily avoided.

### "Not a good experience"
London to Granada via Madrid. Not a good experience. The 1hr delay was not the airline's fault. Indeed the Captain got off to try and find the missing passenger. But the aircraft was old and tired. Business class seating is standard seats with the middle one empty. The food was awful for me. Service was slow and chaotic.

### "the boarding was a mess"
Madrid to New York JFK. The Information counter in Madrid Airport was a joke. Four personnel standing there doing nothing. When I approached the desk to ask a question about my 3 hr delayed flight they told me to go take a number [even though no one else was in line.] After I got the number they let me come to the desk. The person that was supposed to help me seemed to be annoyed at me being there. She was definitely in the wrong occupation. Then the boarding was a mess at the gate. The boarding pass said Group 1, 2, or 3. The lines had A, B, or C on the floor, and it was hard to tell were the lines even were. Other fliers were helping out each other. There should have been an airline person helping people get into the lines. I'm not a fan of this herd boarding but this was unbelievable - especially after everyone waited 3 hrs for Iberia to fix the plane problem. To finish it off, the food was some of the worst I've ever had. The cold sandwich was just ok, the warm food - awful.

### "was a vast improvement"
I am very happy to report that my return trip from Santo Domingo to London this time was a vast improvement on my last two trips. I traveled with one suitcase and my golf clubs and this time the Iberia staff at Santo Domingo could not have been more helpful and the two items were transferred to a BA flight from Madrid to London and back again without a hitch . All because of a desperately needed change of staff on the ground. The longish flight from SD to Madrid went well with my seat 2K a most comfortable bed and the staff and the food and the entertainment all very acceptable. It really does prove that airline staff are a most important asset that can make or break.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Casablanca to Venice via Madrid. Very nice crew from Casablanca to Madrid. Average crew from Madrid to Venice. Madrid is not very connecting passengers friendly. Airline lost bags, both flights on time, luggage in Madrid. Took them two full days do deliver! For information about their faulty work you need to call a premium priced number! Most links on the website for information and filing complaints not working (on purpose I presume). Staff at premium telephone customer support service provides non working telephone numbers. One of the worst customer service experiences ever....and I fly a lot!

### "she would not give me cream"
Madrid to Miami. Very bad service. Attitude poor. I had ordered a vegetarian meal with allowed milk products. First of all the air hostess did not even stop to ask me if I wanted coffee. I had to turn back back and ask for it. Then she would not give me cream because she said I had asked for a vegetarian meal. Then for the second meal they had salad, fruit, butter and jam. No one asked me if I wanted a roll. I noticed the mid portion of the plane was  hot as I walked back to the toilets a few times.

### "new, clean and spacious enough"
Not Verified |  I had not been flying with Iberia for a while and was therefore impressed by their current standard of operation. In Sao Paulo, an Iberia gate representative was able to give me two boarding passes for my remaining two Finnair connections, which LATAM had failed to do despite being in the same alliance. I was also privileged to enter in priority group 1, as a OneWorld Ruby passenger. We left Sao Paulo 15 minutes early and arrived in Madrid 35 minutes before the scheduled arrival time. The 10 hour flight was comfortable. The Airbus was new, clean and spacious enough. Even in the economy class, the service was impeccable and food & drinks both tasty and plentiful. Keen to avoid substandard food ingredients, such as hydrogenated fats, palm oil and glucose-fructose syrup, I was happy to be able to eat almost everything, with one exception (a palm oil chocolate bar). In Madrid, they helped with Finnair gate information, which was not available on monitors, unlike the other departures. Well done Iberia, well above the average OneWorld standard! We will surely see in the future.

### "hardly any friendly behaviour"
Iberia was delayed at Quito due to random police controls. Didn't matter to us though since the connecting flight was only leaving more than 4 hours after landing. Others might have had a worse experience with that. Personally, I think the staff were very unfriendly and harsh sometimes. They didn't seem to be right in the position of working and interacting with people. No smiles, hardly any friendly behavior, some of them even were annoyed by us asking for water on a 18 hour journey. Also on short flights they cut down any food and beverages which meant we didn't get any water or coffee or anything for free on a 4.5 hour flight from Madrid to Frankfurt. We could have bought some really expensive beverages though. Haven't experienced that with any other airline so far.

### "Kudos to the staff"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Barcelona. Our luggage was lost in the confusion of a delayed flight and missing our connection to Canada. Iberia staff at the Customer Service Desk and Lost Baggage Desk in Barcelona were extremely helpful. They got us on a flight the next day and rerouted our luggage to the hotel when they tracked it down. They made a very tense travel situation disappear. Kudos to the staff from some very appreciative travelers.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Pamplona to Dublin via Madrid. The worst airline I’ve flown. Missed my connection in Madrid due to them changing the time of the flight from Pamplona. Then they flew me to Marseille (supposedly en route to Dublin) where another delayed flight meant I was stranded in Marseille. Not a single staff member available in Marseille to help. Ended up having to organize my own way back to Dublin from Marseille which they then refused to refund. Avoid at all costs

### "delayed, miss connection and lost bag"
Flew Iberia from New York to Madrid via Barcelona. Connecting flight was canceled and wasn't put on another one for 8 hours later with no compensation. Return flight was delayed, miss connection and lost bag. Spend the extra money and book through another airline - I ended up losing more money with this "cheaper" flight. When I contacted customer service, they hung up on me and then emailed me and said we have no proof any of these incidents happened. Every single person that I interacted with that works for this airline were extremely rude.

### "confirmed that it was free to cancel"
We booked a flight from Milan to San José via Madrid for October 2018. We changed our mind and wanted to stay a few days more in Madrid on the way back to visit the city. I called Iberia to know if cancelling the last leg would be free. They confirmed that it was free to cancel the last leg without any issue. Therefore, I booked a flight a few days later from Madrid, for myself and my wife. We also booked hotels, etc. When I called to cancel the last leg, they told I will have to spend €600 for that. I tried to explained that I had the confirmation it is free, but they did not care.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
Faro to Miami via Madrid. This is my first time with Iberia and I am sad to say this is by far the worse experience. The plane is really nice, the food was decent but the staff is awful. It is very upsetting how rude and mean the staff was at the airport (Madrid) and also in the plane. Starting by staff not wanting to speak in english (my flight was to Miami, USA), getting pulled aside twice during the boarding process by the same people and without any explanation regarding the matter, getting pushed up the plane by staff with a food cart without saying a word to me. I am so disappointed and feel so upset that I am actually writing this review from the plane (that has free wifi, how awesome!) with my hands full of soap since the water in the bathroom doesn’t work. I have travelled in worse planes, with less space and less comfortable but I would go back to that due to their service being so much better. I cannot recommend this airline to anyone.

### "asked to surrender hand luggage"
Madrid to London. Boarding chaotic. Due to flight being busy passengers towards the end of the queue were asked to surrender hand luggage. Instead of this being identified at the boarding gate it was decided when passengers had almost boarded. We were then led back up the corridor and had to toss our cases down a chute. The staff  ran out of tags and had to leave the passengers waiting. Very poor - not what you expect from Iberia. easyJet and Ryanair do better than this!

### "upgrade to business class"
Lisbon to Madrid. When checking-in online, the airline offered for 49€ the possibility to upgrade to business class, that I accepted. The upgrade included the option to pass through fast-track on security at Lisbon airport. I found a very fair offer. Boarding more chaotic due to lack of space at Lisbon airport (gate S19) and through bus (no jet bridge). Meal served on business class quite good (not expected for an 1 hour flight). Full dinner: salad, sirloin, cheese, yoghurt, and feee bread servide as well as drinks available. No main dish choice available nevertheless. As IFE only the board magazine, no wifi available. The flight had a 20 min delay, captain apologized for that.

### "Boarding fairly organized"
Madrid to Lisbon. Late friday night flight, on-time. Boarding procedures were fairly organized being priorities respected wothout any mess. Once on-board hostesess were concerned about fluidity of boarding immediately helping passengers who seemed lost or unable to place their luggage properly. No Wi-fi on board, only a board magazine as IFE. No meal service (only "à la carte") for economy class.

### "Good flight, not exceptional"
Good flight, not exceptional. Nothing I can put my finger on to moan about but it did not achieve the high standards that I enjoy when I fly Business class with Delta or Alitalia. The food was good not great. The seat is a very good seat, proper lie flat and was comfortable. Staff were good but for business class not great. Entertainment was not that good, a nice screen but quite a limited selection of movies. A free hour of Wifi was a nice touch as an hour is typically all I need and it is nice not to have an additional cost on top of an already expensive flight. I would recommend Iberia's business class product I just would not do so enthusiastically.

### "I missed my flight "
Naples to Miami via Madrid. It's now 10:15 p.m. and I have been up since I missed my flight and I am now in a hotel room provided by Iberia. Bad experience at airport, terrible, no one wants to help you and it's huge to get from one gate to the other from T4s to T4 and vice a versa, exhausted.

### "the trip was quite smooth"
Madrid to Rio de Janeiro. On both legs the trip was quite smooth, both on check-in, boarding procedures, flight. Exception to be made on Barajas airport passport control (though not liable to Iberia). Seats were quite comfortable and IFE quite modern with a huge selection of movies. I missed foot rest (even on economy it can be of great help for a comfortable journey). Staff on board really indifirent to passengers, showing some tireness on their faces on the oubound leg. On the inbound, staff were more helpful and smiling. Also had the opportunity to see one of the air hostesses doing something I always dreamed of, that is to kindly ask passengers to put their seats on vertical position during meal service. Must mention also that on A330-300 on the outbound flight I had seat 22A which was a huge error. Quite unfair as passenger travelling on 21A had two windows only for him There is no window at all and you feel stuck for 10hours, with no space, no window, no view, no choices, and a passenger on your right. Fortunately IFE was quite good and I could concentrate on the screen rather then having a panic attack. Three food services during the flight was quite enough and quality acceptable.

### "a good experience"
Frankfurt to Buenos Aires return via Madrid. All flights were fine without any problems. Departure of first flight (FRA-MAD) was delayed by 20 minutes. While we were waiting at the gate, the captain went through the cabin and asked passengers if they had any questions. A great gesture, never seen this before. I was worried about my connection, but finally the flight arrived on time in Madrid. Had to change terminals (4 to 4S) and go through passport control, which took 35 minutes. By the way Madrid is a great airport, clean, great architecture and easy connections. Flight to Buenos Aires was very relaxed. Seat was spacious and comfortable, good IFE and nice crew. I liked the Airbus A340-600 because of its 2-4-2 seat configuration. First meal was very delicious, second meal was a snack box, which was okay. There were snacks and drinks available at the galley, but FA’s could have done more drink rounds between meals. Same experience on the return flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid. Had a long layover at Madrid (5 hours) and decided to spend 30 Euros for the airport lounge including showers, free drinks and food, which was a good investment before my last flight to Frankfurt. All in all it was a good experience with Iberia.

### "Not punctual at all"
Worst airline experience. Not punctual at all, laid back attitudes, dirty cabin. My family and I used Iberia to fly on 7/14/18 from New York to Zagreb via Madrid. We were excited to use it and we looked forward to this trip. Unfortunately, this turned out to be the worst traveling experience for my family and I so far. We were delayed 2.5hrs right from the start and we barely made it onto our connecting flight. Our bags were delayed for 3 days making this even more of a horrible experience. Since Croatia wasn't our final destination, we had to go back to Croatia to get our baggage. First three days of our vacation were destroyed and filled with frustration. Service inside the plane was decent, but since the plane was cleaned in a rush, we ended up getting dirty, filthy blankets. Our seat trays were filthy. One of our TV screens didn't work. The plane was one of the most outdated ones that I have seen in the last several years. We will never use Iberia again.

### "worst airline customer service"
I had a recent trip with Iberia from Frankfurt to Boston via Madrid in July 2018. My flight from Frankfurt to Madrid was cancelled, just a night before my flight. Since my flight IB3127 was cancelled I could not depart from Frankfurt according to my original booking plan. I was rebooked and reached my destination with a 8 hours of delay. According to the European law Iberia should compensate me for the delay, but they refuse to do that. Iberia only sends me automatic answers and do not disclose the reason for the cancellation. The worst airline customer service.

### "an airline I would recommend"
Miami to Madrid on 3rd October 2017 with my wife. A late afternoon flight to arrive at dawn in Madrid. Check in was late for about 25 minutes but was fairly efficient and the Iberia ground staff were polite and courteous. After check in and luggage drop, went for TSA control which went ok, albeit rather slower than when arrived and took an internal flight. Boarding was delayed for about 40 minutes and we ended up asked to board last again, even though our seats were in the middle of the aircraft. Once aboard staff were fast to serve dinner as soon as the aircraft fully completed take off. blankets were handed out rather fast as well, and lights were dimmed. Aircon was at a pleasant temperature for the whole flight. During the evening flight staff were passing by and were available when we needed water or juice. Flight arrived on time despite the delays on the ground. Landing at Barajas was very smooth and pleasant. Food was tasty, and the inflight enetrtainment was sufficient for a flight of that length.Overall, an airline I would recommend. I do not award full marks due to the luggage policy and the delays.

### "I would not fly them again"
Jerez to London via Madrid. The customer service for this airline is as bad as bad can be. I have called countless times and the level of rudeness and lack of care is appalling. As a business class passenger who paid extra for seats and service, I am not getting what I paid for. Delayed flight - rude service - lost luggage. I would not fly them again and warn anyone transiting via Madrid to do so at risk of your luggage. What has followed since they failed to put my luggage on my flight at Madrid has been excruciatingly painful. It took 5 days to return the luggage - I had 2 pieces which both arrived at different times (first took 2 days and second took 4 days) Every time I call Iberia they have incorrect information. At one point, I called customer service on the number I was given and was told I should call another number, which was the number I was calling and the lady refused to believe i was calling it and refused to believe me - I had to hang up!

### "worst customer service"
My review concerns Iberia's and Vueling's behavior with regards to a flight I had to take from Brussels to Barcelona on 17th June 2018. As I was downloading my boarding pass on August 16th, I noticed that my flight time had been moved from a mid-afternoon to an early morning time. Further, I saw that my flight had been moved from the 17th to the 20th. Since I was heading to Barcelona for business, with presentations on the morning of the 18th, this change of schedule did not work for me. I called Iberia about the issue (since I booked my flight through Iberia's website), but was told I should talk to Vuelig since they operated the flight. I tried to reach Vueling, but never managed to reach a human. Showed up at Brussels airport first thing the next morning to try and speak to a representative, but the person manning the desk for both Iberia and Vueling told me she did not actually work for either company and could not help. Finally find out that all Vuelig flights have been cancelled due to French controller air strike. However, also find out that Brussels airlines has not cancelled its flights and so manage to book a last minute ticket with them. It's important to note that during all of this, not once was I notified by either Iberia or Vueling that my flight had been changed, and this despite the fact that both companies had my cell phone number and email address. Also, when I filed a complaint with Vueling, I was told it was an Iberia problem since I booked through Iberia. And when I filed a complaint with Iberia, I was told it was a Vueling problem because they operated the flight. three weeks into arguing with each airline, they both stated that under EU law, they are protected because the French strike was none of their doing. Neither company has taken any responsibility for the lack of communication (which I find very unprofessional), and neither has offered to compensate me for the new ticket I had to purchase + all of the unecessary stress they created by cancelling the flight and not offering me any reasonable options (3 days later is not a reasonable option for a business traveler). Overall, very disapointed and feel like neither company cares much about customers. I indicated as much to both companies and neither has cared to provide a response since telling me EU law allows them to bahave in such a manner. I have travelled all over the world over the last 35 years, and this is by far the worst customer service and ownership of responsibility I have ever experienced.

### "never travel with Iberia again"
I tried to travel from Madrid to Hamburg with a valid ticket that I had purchased and paid 2 months ago in combination with some Iberia miles. When I got to the airport 3 hour early, I was not allowed to check-in as I could not present the credit card I had paid the ticket with. My card expired last month and since I had already paid for the ticket and obviously I got rid off the old card. The man working at the ticket office at Iberia at Madrid airport was extremely rude and did not give a damn about helping me: I presented my email ticket showing proof of my purchase with my name on it. That was not enough. I presented to him a photo proof of my credit card proving that the card was indeed mine which he did not accept. I showed him the credit card bill with the Iberia charge showing that I had paid for the ticket and there was not fraud. He told me that I could not get on the plane and he would not even let me cancel my existing reservation and pay for the same seat on the same plane again. I was told that the Iberia flights during the next two days were fully booked up so that he could not even make me another reservation for me on another day. I went online to see if that was true and there were seats available on both days. He told me that Iberia and Iberia Plus are two different companies and that he could not help me since part of my ticket was paid with my miles. He said he had nothing to do with my ticket reservation and gave me the phone number of Iberia miles so that they could fix the problem. He would not even call on my behalf to Iberia Plus given that I am not a native Spanish speaker. At Iberia Plus on the phone I was  told that they could not verify my card. (even though they had proof that I had paid with this card on previous Iberia flights). When I asked for reimbursement for my miles (I had paid a large part of this flight with my miles) I was told that the miles could not be reimbursed. I will never travel with Iberia again.

### "cabin service was much better"
New York to Zagreb via Madrid. Overall, the travel experience was okay. Ground service was horrible. Cabin service was good. Food acceptable. Iberia apparently changed my seat on the connecting flight from MAD to ZAG, which I had pre-selected. By the time I looked at my boarding pass hours later and realized my seat had changed on the second flight, it was too late. Since that leg was much shorter, I didn't bother to change the seat. Boarding was chaotic, the US ground staff at JFK don't seem to care. When boarding began, a hoard of passengers stood on the business class queue. I suspected something was awry and asked people if the line they were on was for business class (as the sign clearly indicated). They shrugged and stayed on the line. As the gate agent started boarding people, he realized that practically everyone's boarding pass he scanned was NOT business class. Only then did he announce that business class passengers were being boarded first. All of a sudden, the line shrunk to 1/10 of what it was before. Once onboard, the cabin service was much better and the remainder of the trip was okay.

### "there was dust and lots of dirt"
Santiago de Chile to Madrid. You can't expect much when booking a cheap fare but at least I am expecting a minimum standard of quality on every flight, no matter if I fly on a LCC or a premium airline. My first contact with the airline was at the checkin desk. I tried to purchase an upgrade but they said that it wasn't possible today. I was okay with that and went to the gate to ask if they can at least give me an empty row as the flight was very empty (I assume the load in Y was about 30-40%). The gate agent was very unsupportive and told me to search for a free seat once I'm in the plane. Eventually, after asking her a second time, I got my free row (an absolute standard request). On board, we were "welcomed" by the purser who seemed very uninterested in her job. The crew overall seemed not to like their job, except for some of the FAs (one of them was our "service FA"). They barely speak any English (or just don't want to). The procedures were very unorganized and chaotic. The seat comfort was fine but there wasn't much leg space (not much of a problem thanks to the free neighbor seat). The blanket colored my black shirt so I had to change it afterward (luckily, I had just hand luggage and some shirts with me). I lifted the armrest and there was dust and lots of dirt. I looked up the plane and it had been delivered to IB in 2010. It appears that it has not been properly cleaned ever since (see the images). The food for dinner (Lasagne) was acceptable. The drink service was okay. Breakfast was delivered in boxes and a bit small but okay. I complaint to the airline about the cleanliness by an official form at MAD as well as via FB. The ground staff at MAD was very friendly and apologized for the inconvenient situation. I received a reply from the customer relations department the day after: “To ensure the utmost hygiene on every flight, the aircraft are always cleaned immediately after arrival at destination. However, air traffic control limitations and the length of the aircraft's stopover mean that occasionally we have to do this in less time. Please accept my apologies if the seat was not in perfect condition. Fast cleaning may not include the cleaning under the armrests but it should be normal to do it at least every other month. As my connection (A320) had dirt at the same place, IB seems to be cleaning their aircraft not very well. Wifi is very overpriced (about 5$ for 4MB). In short: The ground staff (an agent on behalf of IB) in SCL was bad, the crew not good (except for some of the members), food acceptable, cleanliness disastrous.

### "it was a good experience"
Los Angeles to Milan via Madrid, returning from Rome. After reading all the negative reviews about Iberia Airlines, I drastically lowered my expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised to have had a nice flight both going to my destination and returning home. The seats and legroom were comparable to other airlines I have flown (with the exception of Lufthansa, which has more legroom in economy). I received a packaged pillow and blanket, which was nice. The food was standard airline food and was served with premium plastic ware (not the cheap plastic utensils used with other airlines). I carried my luggage on board, and did not check it in. Overall it was a good experience.

### "a bland performance"
Madrid to Santiago de Chile. A worn out A340-600, seats are ok (staggered configuration similar to Alitalia), but overall impact is less positive, stained seats and this ageing look. Boarding was quick and efficient, with pre-takeoff Cava served. Crew was mixed, the purser looked annoyed by passengers; FAs ranged from being very professional and attentive to absent-minded and approximate (asked twice to have more water after lunch was served, it never arrived and when I went to ask for a snack the FA said "oh, I forgot your water"; same thing for the pre-landing snak, which I had without anything to drink only because I asked for some milk in my tea). Amenity kit looks ridiculous in size, in equipment, in "look and feel"; food quite good actually but again, the whole service process took longer than expected and FAs were erratic. The seat is comfortable, maybe a bit rigid for sleeping, and cabin was freezing. A 4MB wi-fi voucher was offered to Business class passenger, it lasted some 3 minutes only on whatsapp, bought a 25MB pass for USD 19.95 with a fairly decent speed (unfortunately they forgot to mention that over Brasil and Argentina - 1/3 of the flight - the service would be unavailable). Overall quite a bland performance, hard product is still fine but service was below par.

### "Overall a pleasant flight"
Flying to Miami from Madrid Barajas Terminal S4 in September 2016. Efficient check in at Barajas. Then on to Terminal 4, where the duty free was really very good. Terminal 4 is spacious with lots of amenities. Terminal 4S does not have these shops, which makes it not that pleasant if you have to spend a lot of time there waiting for the flight. A very long line for the extra security screening needed for US destinations. Closing the time for check in there was a long line at the gate. After about 20 minutes past the time for check in there was the first announcement that there would be 15-20 minutes more before check in would start. When check in started, for some reason boarding group 3, to which we belonged, boarded last, even though our seats were not at the front or back of the aircraft. On board, cabin staff was attentive and fairly polite. The cabin was warm at first but later temperature went down and then blankets were handed out, which became useful during the evening. Overall a pleasant flight.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Flew Iberia from Madrid to Los Angeles. After seeing all the bad reviews I really wasn’t expecting much for my long haul flight home. I was pleasantly surprised. The airline itself was great, comfortable (as economy can be), the food was ,good the attendants were very nice. I was satisfied with the inflight entertainment. Sat in the seats I picked for my family. Received my baggage. I would fly with them again without hesitation. Now the Madrid airport is another story.

### "we have no checked luggage"
Madrid to Keflavik. After an otherwise wonderful holiday we arrived at Madrid airport. Their check in computers jumped to Spanish completely randomly, causing you to start all over again, until it completely crashed. There was no help to get from the Iberia staff on location and the solution was to check in manually. While waiting in line, the barriers were changed two times causing 50+ people to rearrange everything, with expected results. Almost at the end of the cue, a staff member pulls us and two other couples out of the cue, says something in Spanish and walks away. I catch up with him for explanations, and he tries to explain that he has other check in desks around the corner. We get there only to face the most unfriendly check in agent I have ever seen, who tell us that we have no checked luggage for the flight. When presented with the receipt for both flight and luggage, she claims that the receipt is invalid since it's from a third party, (Flight Network), and proceeds to charge us €70 extra. The other options would be to leave it behind, or not go on the flight we already paid for. At this point the atmosphere was not good to say the least. But a tiny plus was that she managed to assign to us seats on 3rd row. When we entered the plain we saw that this was behind the business class divider. The seats were a different color than the rest of the economy class seats, but otherwise the same shape and size so I thought nothing of it, until a stewardess came and asked us to relocate as she needed those seats for someone else. I tried to explain that we had been assigned those seats for the discomfort of the check in errors. She immediately got very unfriendly and said that we were being moved, because we had not purchased business class seats, and it was clear that we had no choice in the matter if we wanted to fly at all! She then moved the divider back one row. Throughout the flight the 3rd row seats A-F, remained empty! After relocating, the flight crew continued to be unfriendly. We will never fly with Iberia again!

### "don't know where our bags are"
Florence to San Sebastian via Madrid. I will never fly with Iberia again. After sitting on a plane for half an hour, due to wind we were taken off and herded back to the gate. We stood there, no one telling us anything, until they herded us back  onto the plan. When i asked about a connecting flight I was told "this flight takes 2 hours". Thats it. When we landed in Madrid we were told no luggage was on board and to go to the service desk regarding our missed connection. We waited half an hour before being served by the most unhelpful and miserable woman I have met She was angry with us for not going to the departure gate, as our original connection had been delayed, meaning that if we hadn't waited for her for half an hour we would have made it. When we asked about our luggage all she did was tell us to get on the plane. At San Sebastian no staff were waiting, they had closed for the night. We had to go back and catch the flight staff as they came off the plane to help us. We filled in paperwork and were told by 1030am the next day the bags would be delivered. We were given an online portal log in and a phone number. It is the evening of the next day now. We have used the login, it says that they still don't know where our bags are. We have called the number, it isn't even connected. We have contacted them multiple times via the portal, and I know they have read our messages as they updated our bag descriptions as I instructed. Still, no one has contacted us, regardless of the urgency. I am departing for Australia tomorrow, leaving san sebastian at 6am. No one has contacted us. They have expressed no concern or interest in calling us despite my messages stating it is urgent.

### "Airline staff were unhelpful"
Travelled with Iberia from Amsterdam to London Luton. Boarding passes said to be present 40 mins before departure time for boarding, all passengers where sitting and waiting but airline staff showed up about 5 minutes before departure time and took forever to get organised for no apparent reason. Plane took about 20 mins to drive to the runway and pilot stopped the plane and announced that one of the brakes wasn’t working and the engine was too hot to take off so we had to remain stationary for est 10 mins. Plane eventually took off about 10 minutes before we were supposed to land in London. Flight was fast yet concerning, plane seemed to randomly accelerate and slow down abruptly and without purpose. Inside was shabby and warning signs on the wings had visibly faded to become indecipherable. Airline staff were unhelpful and did not provide Travel cards needed to access the UK, when we requested them specifically they seemed confused about what we were asking for. There was no recognition from the staff or pilot whatsoever for the significant delay until the plane started defending and a pre-recorded message apologised for the delay (as if it happened all the time so they had it ready to go). Landing was bumpy and seemed much faster than normal and getting off the plane took much longer than usual. Worst flight I’ve ever taken and the only time over ever been concerned that a plane would not land safely. Strongly discourage using this airline.

### "our tickets have been canceled"
Boston to Barcelona via Madrid. We took a flight from Boston to Madrid on 6/7/2018. Our flight was approximately 20-30 minutes late to leave from Boston. Our suggested layover from Madrid to Barcelona was approximately 1 hour. This hour layover is the flight route they suggest online while booking, we booked a round trip back to Boston on 6/18. Due to the long customs line and security over 20% of the passengers missed their next flight, we ran (not walked) through the airport. By the time we made it to the gate the airplane was closed, we and 25+ people missed the flight. My husband and I had reservations in Barcelona later that day with a prepaid group. We called Iberia to request another flight, they couldn’t guarantee us to be on a flight until the next day, it is 8:00 am at this time. The customer service rep we spoke to suggested we book a flight on Vueling, their partner airline. We did this for $300 without complaint, while not being refunded for the flight from Madrid to Barcelona. The flight to Madrid is an hour and a half. Fast forward to 6/17, we are checking in for our flight from Granada to Barcelona. We are informed at the gate that our tickets have been canceled and we will not be receiving a refund because we missed our flight from Madrid to Barcelona 9 days prior. Now we had to go book with another airline, in another country. We had to pay double the price we should have, still without a refund.

### "missed the connecting flight"
Boston to San Sebastian via Madrid. We as family flown out of Boston to go to a wedding in San Sebastian. We were supposed to have more than 1.5 hours time in Madrid for our connection. Plane was delayed by almost an hour in Boston. I had asked the ticket agency and they had said not to worry they will put us on the next flight. When we arrived in Madrid, we still had about an hour. The customs lines were long and we asked Iberia for help, they said get back to the line. Needless to us we missed the connecting flight. When we went to the agent to book the next flight, they asked us to pay - we had to ask for a supervisor to clear that it was their fault for delaying. On the next flight they could only take two people from our party with the suitcase. They didn't take the suitcase. They put us on priority waitlist for the next flight. Needless to say they assigned us to an 8 o'clock flight. Once we were boarding, they took us off and said the flight was cancelled. We ended up in a hotel to fly out the next morning and missed the first part of wedding and one night of the hotel which was prepaid. The luggage still didn't come with us. It was delivered two days after the wedding. The staff at Iberia were rude and untruthful. Every time I complained, they asked me to fill out a complaint form.

### "recommend Premium Economy"
Santiago de Compostela to New York via Madrid. Flew from Santiago de Compostela on Iberia Express to Madrid yesterday to connect to our Iberia flight to New York. I can see why Iberia Express gets its 'most punctual airline' reputation. Boarding was swift, very organized and we departed about 5mins ahead of schedule. On board, sadly there wasn't much to say except the legroom was very tight and even a coffee had to be paid for. The crew seemed pleasant and helpful. I was however, not able to connect to the advertised free streaming entertainment at all. Not a huge deal breaker as it was a short flight. I had decided to take up an email offer to upgrade my next sector to New York and was so glad I did. Having priority boarding as a part of it was a huge plus on this maxed out A340-600. I loved the Premium Economy seat with the extra recline and legroom was great. It's a fresh, relatively small, more private cabin than the wild expanse of regular economy. The larger, responsive, IFE screen worked well and had just enough options to keep me occupied for 7 hours. The very slightly upgraded meal (main served in a china dish) was fairly decent thought it took quite a while after take off before it was served. There was no bar service before this. The crew were warm and pleasant though and seemed to be constantly working. We sat in row 15 which is only slightly ahead of the galley, so could hear everything and the light from the galley was distracting at times. The pre-arrival snack of a boxed sandwich was fine and we arrived only slightly late into JFK. All in all, I'd recommend Iberia's Premium Economy if you do get an email offer to upgrade. Very comfortable seat, more personalized service and priority boarding made the decision easy for me.

### "friendly, efficient and competent"
Flew Iberia from Quito to Madrid. The aircraft was clean and modern. The main course of the dinner was dry and the bread was stale, but the red wine was good, plus we were given real cutlery and not plastic. I would have preferred them to come around with more drinks—I think they only came through once. The breakfast was good but everything was sweet, no savoury option. Flight attendants were friendly, efficient and competent. My biggest complaint is that the in-flight entertainment system was broken for the entire 10-hour flight—luckily I had plenty of books but I would have preferred a couple of movies to pass the time. I really think they should have made sure this was working beforehand. To be fair, they did credit me with Avios points when I complained.

### "flight took off without us"
Ibiza to Frankfurt via Madrid. Irresponsible madness Journey from Ibiza to Frankfurt, scheduled for 2018-06-01, stopover at Madrid. Flight  from Ibiza was cancelled due to "technical reasons" 2 hours after estimated departure. We had to wait 7 hours in a queue afterwards to get new tickets. Iberia staff only assigned 1 employee to handle reticketing. The main counter was not seated at all which lead to major confusion. Iberia finally booked a hotel. The new flight, operated by Vueling was delayed, so we did not reach the Iberia flight to Frankfurt. We arrived on the minute of boarding but Iberia's pilot refused to re-open the door. He stayed at the gate for another 30 minutes and the Iberia flight took off without us. We had to get another new flight with Lufthansa to return to Frankfurt.

### "the flight was very cheap"
Faro to Frankfurt via Madrid. My first flight was operated by Air Nostrum. There was only small turbulence but they kept the seat belt sign on the whole time so that I had to wait for an hour until I landed and could use the bathroom. The landing was very rough too. Weird that the last time I had a short flight to Madrid, we had turbulence as well. The second flight was delayed for 1,5h and we were not offered any free drinks or any compensation for the 2,5h flight. Now I am waiting with half of the passengers at my destination for at least 30 min. for my luggage. I would give a 4 star because the flight was very cheap, but with the waiting, at 1 am in the morning it just cost me a lot of nerves.

### "Our flight was cancelled"
Luton to Barcelona. Our flight was cancelled about 36 hours before we were scheduled to depart. We spent hours speaking with them and the booking agent - we unfortunately used a 3rd party booking which made the whole ordeal even more complicated. They refused to put us alternative flights which would fit our travel plans and stranded us in London for 24 hours longer than we expected. The last phone call we had with them, they hung up on us because we were requesting to speak with a supervisor. Completely ridiculous. I will make efforts to not fly Iberia again.

### "meals were scarce"
❌ Not Verified |  The crew were friendly and helpful, and they knew how to deal with a flight full of turbulence, with nervous passengers. However, the services Iberia offers on a 12 hour-long flight are poor in comparison to other airlines of similar cost. The meals were scarce and sporadically delivered, which meant that at 3am we got the cabin lights on as they would serve some snacks, while the majority of the passengers were sleeping. The beverages served are also scarce, which means you have to be constantly standing up and going to the galley to get some drinks. In other long flights I’ve done in economy class, passengers got given amenity kits, whereas in Iberia, we got a blanket, a pillow, and earphones.

### "worst experience ever"
Zurich to Miami via Madrid. My husband and I flew Iberia yesterday and had the worst experience ever, at the check in counter in Zurich the lady offered us to fly Swiss if everybody shows up since the fly was oversold. We accepted, but at the end we flew Iberia since the plane was not full, at this point the lead counter person cancelled our assigned double seats by the window (he didn’t mention anything to us and we find out when we got to Madrid) and they gave us the most horrible seats in the middle even dough we got to the airport before anybody else. Not enough with the frustration we haven’t received our luggage yet, they never send the luggage to the plane. We travel at least twice a year on long flies to Europe but definitely will never use Iberia again.

### Iberia customer review
I flew with my father in a wheelchair in early February from STR to SCQ via MAD with Iberia. The new wheelchair came 3 days after us extremely damaged, so that it was impossible to use this safely. On top of that, the pre-ordered and confirmed at check-in wheelchair assistance neither in MAD nor SCQ worked. To date (after more than 2 months) we have no confirmation if the damage will be reimbursed. In February, I already submitted the required documents (cost estimate from the expert, photos, invoices, etc.) to Iberia. To this day and after X-fold contact attempts, I have just said on the phone I should be patient! My patience is at the end! It's a shame like Iberia deals with people who use wheelchairs.

### "friendly and efficient"
Madrid to Santo Domingo. Check-in – Friendly staff and quickly passed through. Business lounge in Madrid is large but at times crowded. Good selection of beverages and snacks. Due to the early time no actual meals available. Boarding was quick although it did take some time before doors closed. Take-off was as per schedule. The A330-200 looked fairly new and the 1x2x1 business layout is good when comparing with BA. Attendants were friendly and efficient and made you feel welcome. Perhaps they could adopt other airlines policy by addressing you by name. Food was above average and the wines/spirits above average.

### "the bags are in Madrid"
We missed our connecting flight to Barcelona from Madrid because the Iberia representative told us the wrong gate and only had an hour layover. Then when we attempted to change to a different flight we were told we would have to book an entire new flight because we used Vueling, but we wouldn’t even be able to fly out that day so we would have to drive! So we waited 2 hrs to receive our bags only to find out they shipped them to Barcelona without us. So we drove 6 hrs to Barcelona. We get to the Barcelona airport and the bags are in Madrid. Fast forward to the next day we called and they promised the bags would be here by 9AM. Confirmed on the flight. It’s now 10:10 we are at the airport and they told us they missed the flight. I am about to go on a cruise with no clothes and it’s the fault of Iberia.

### "left passengers bags at Madrid"
I flew with Iberia from Gatwick to Miami via Madrid. Their onboard customer service is offensive with flight attendants hostile to customers, unless you speak Spanish of course. The baggage handling is shocking, they left passengers bags at Madrid. And forget booking and paying extra to select your seat because if someone pays more, you and your partner split up for a 10 hours flight. I would not book another flight with Iberia.

### "refused to send my luggage to London"
I tried to book my seats from Santo Domingo in one booking but the Iberia Reservation system showed no seats were available but when I looked at Santo Domingo to Madrid and then Madrid to London, there were plenty of seats available on the Iberia website so I made the two bookings and printed them out. At Santo Domingo airport they refused to send my luggage to London so I had to go through immigration and customs in Madrid, retrieve my bags and recheck them on to London. Although both bookings were made on the Iberia website. I am later in the year going to Hong Kong via Madrid first with Iberia and then from Madrid with Cathay and they have told me they will not send my luggage direct to Hong Kong although both are ONE World carriers and the arrival and departure are from the same terminal in Madrid. I will cancel this next flight. Once on board, the trip to Madrid, more than 8 hours, was without any breakfast, only dinner as soon as we settled in. The business class seats are ok and the service is just acceptable. My return flight from London which started with BA to Heathrow was without incident. They escalate the business class prices dramatically around Easter, double the normal price so beware

### "overall experience was terrible"
I recently flew roundtrip Miami to Barcelona on Iberia. I purchased a Premium Economy ticket and upgraded in both directions for a fee at check-in to fly in Business Class. I must say, the overall experience was terrible. From trying to ask questions via Iberia's reservation line prior to the trip - virtually no one spoke English and extremely unhelpful, to the onboard experience. In Business Class, the cabin was the most recent version with lie-flat seats but they were very uncomfortable, basic and the service by the crew was, let's say I'm kind by calling it awful. I would not ever fly Iberia again regardless of price. Not surprised they are linked by ownership to British Airways, which has gone downhill as well. So sad, very bad experience.

### "on par with budget airline"
Madrid to Zurich. When I arrived at the airport I was told that my ticket was not valid and was asked to spend almost 30 min on the customer line to clarify the situation. The airline initially tried to blame me saying that I cancelled the flight. They eventually acknowledge their mistake, but never really apologized and issued a new ticket. Service on board and seats on par with budget airline: very small leg space and you have to pay for a snack or drink.

### "No service at all"
Iberia is the worse airline if it comes to customer service. They claim to be the most punctual airline in the world, but if they are late and you miss your connecting flight because this one departs on time you are in trouble. No service at all. They even close the gate 5 minutes before you arrive and they know you are on the grounds and trying to get the connection, but because they are so punctual, no chance. If you in business you most likely experience next thing is a downgrade into Economy with no word of sorry or no attempt to try and work alternatives out. Compensation, forget it. Service in Economy with a paid Business ticket means on Iberia you have to pay eventually for drinks and food. Economy is Economy and nothing better than Ryanair. On top of all of this, and you paid for Business in the first place, they cut your Milage down to Economy too. Can it get worse? Wonder if they would deny you the Lounge access too, as you are now officially downgraded to Economy. Never again, or I pay Low Cost in the first place. Saves me anger and my budget at the end.

### "Was completely satisfied"
Flew Iberia from Lisbon to Vienna via Madrid. Was completely satisfied, except for the fact that there was no meal at all on any of the planes. First time it has happened to me on a non-low-budget flight. Is this normal? Punctual take-off and landing. Kind and friendly on-board staff. No Problems during the booking, check-in, or flight.

### "will never book with Iberia again"
I have experienced many problems whilst flying with Iberia. Some of these were caused by external factors, and some by poor management.I can accept long delays, or even cancellations (more often than not), what I can't accept is that every time I call, they try to blame the problem on another organisation (airport, British Airways partnership, etc), and they were  rude. Just now I called to ask if there is anything they can do to help my elderly father (with terrible back pains), who's waiting for over 3 hours for a supposed delayed flight, and the customer service agent hung up me. This was the last drop, I will never book with Iberia again.

### "The cabin crew disappear"
Flew Havana back to Madrid. The seat is reasonable - aisle access for all seats is good and reasonable space around the seat. I'm a few inches short of six foot, and I could not lie straight and it has a very narrow area at the bottom foot area which is uncomfortable. The food was the worst I'd ever encountered in any class of travel. Basically they put economy class food on china plates. The bread was stale, main was an inedible slab of processed beef with dry rice and the dessert of fresh fruit was actually processed tinned bits. The cabin crew disappear and leave the business cabin for most of the flight. They did the same on the outward flight which was day time. Basically you have to walk around the plane to find someone to give you a drink. They don't respond to the call button. The lounge in Havana is absurd, a smokey den with processed meat and cheese left out without refrigeration. The cabin crew director blamed all this on their Cuban supply chain. Having had good food in Cuba everywhere this seems unfair to blame the Cubans, more likely cost cutting at the hands of Willy "the slasher" Walsh - ex CEO of BA who now runs Iberia. Would recommend use Air France or Virgin for Cuba.

### "I need a letter from Iberia"
London to Lima in December 2017, with a stopover in Madrid. As soon as I arrived in Lima, I was told that my baggage was delayed. They issued me a ticket, saying the baggage would arrive the day after and that I should pick it up from the airport. That would be fine - but the day after would be the only opportunity for me to pick it up in Lima, as I would travel to other places in Peru after that, for 15 days. The day after - I arrived at the airport to find the desk closed, and the Info help desk tried in vain to help us call the number stated in the directory. No answer. For the next 15 days, I would be making daily phone calls to their helpline. By the way, they only allow you to call the "call centre" but the people here cannot really help you - they don't know what's happening on the ground, neither can they make any decisions regarding your request. I asked them to send my baggage to Cusco where I was - call centre people said "yes, we will leave a message for the airline to do so". But every day i called up the luggage would still be in Lima and the call centre people kept saying "yes we will leave the message". This went on until my final day when i was in Lima to fly out of Peru and there, i picked up the luggage myself (after a very convoluted process at the airport in itself). Needless to say, I made a claim to Iberia for delayed baggage compensation. They issued only half the amount of what their policy says I should be entitled to, and despite my question as to why, they informed me that the case was closed without giving any reasons. In order to make a claim through my travel insurer for the additional expenses I incurred, I need a letter from Iberia stating the date they returned the luggage to me and the final amount they compensated me. But despite me sending several emails to the helpline email address requesting this, they refuse to give me that letter. This effectively prevents me from making a claim to my insurer to cover the costs incurred by me.

### "Be aware with this airline"
I paid to select 4 seats, row 8 and 9 (two window seats and two corridor seats) when I bought my tickets. 24 hrs before my flight, I did the online check-in, and my selected seats changed to row 48 aprox. When we arrived at the airport they told us that they changed the aircraft and the rows I selected did not exist on that aircraft, because the economy cabin started from row 21, so my seats had to be changed to row 48 aprox. two corridor seats, one middle seat, and one window seat, I would never have paid such a large amount of money for those seats! I complained and demanded a refund, but they told us they couldn’t do anything, and if I wanted a refund I had to complain to Iberia’s offices in Buenos Aires, and they will only refund me the middle seat. The only Iberia aircraft that the economy cabin begins from row 21 is the A340-600. But when the plane arrived I noticed it was A330-200 that was the plane that was supposed fly! So I asked why did my seats change since the seats I selected physically existed on that plane, and they did not give us a clear answer. When I entered the plane, the distribution was as it was supposed to be, meaning that the seats I selected really existed. I am still confused with what happened to our seats, and hoping it does not happen again on the return flight (MAD-EZE). I think that this issue must be clarified and give us a compensation due to the problems caused by this involuntary change of seat. The seats were standard and the service was poor. The plane was only 1 year old, so it was in very good conditions. Be aware with this airline.

### "lost luggage clerk was rude"
The check in for Iberia flight 3279 on 04 Feb 2018 from Budapest to Marrakech via Madrid. During check in we were informed we could check in our cabin luggage free so we elected to check in the larger of the 2 bags which was still "legal" cabin size, but it would make our boarding easier. When we got to the gate, we were informed we had to gate check my wife's bag which was tiny (50x33x20) compared to many other bags people had at the gate. So we arrived at our terrible 28 inch spaced seat with only a personal briefcase and wife's pocket book. However, many of the other passengers had quite large carry on bags and in some cases had 2 large bags. All of these in "Economy". Of course, when we got to Marrakech, my wife's bag was still in Budapest with no flight until 06 Feb 2018. In addition, the lost baggage people in Marrakech rudely informed us we would have to come back to the airport to pick it up if it comes in. No delivery to our hotel. When we went back on 06 Feb 2018 to pick it up if it came in, the lost luggage clerk was rude and arrogant and informed me we should be grateful to him that we got it back at all.

### "Crew were very unprofessional"
New aircraft, looks good. But on board service was very poor. It was a 12 hour flight from Guatemala City to Madrid but they did not supply aminity kits. Even the bathroom didn't have soap or lotions. Crew were very unprofessional with very rude behaviour. It was like a low cost carrier service. Wifi service too expensive. Really bad experience with Iberia. Should to think before flying and compare other long haul airlines service.

### "pleasant and enjoyable flight"
Good experience with Iberia. From Rome to Madrid in January 2018, the flight was very punctual, we took off at the exact time from Fiumicino airport and arrived at the Madrid Barajas airport at the appointed time. It was a pleasant and enjoyable flight, comfortable seats and good service from cabin crew. I recommend it.

### "would never ever risk booking them again"
I booked Iberia for a family holiday to South Africa to visit family. Booked the flights nearly a year in advance to get the best prices. When I phoned to add a new born baby to the booking a number of months later I discovered that the flight time for the first leg had changed so I didn't have time to transfer for the second leg. Iberia were offering a full refund. But a refund is no good as then you have no flight. And as months had passed the prices on all airlines had increased. I had no choice but to accept the refund and pay extra to book flights with another airline. Or cancel the trip. I have since heard of other people having similar problems with Iberia on long haul routes. Where parts of the journey are cancelled close to the departure date and Iberia just shrug and offer a refund leaving people with no flights to where they are going. I would never ever risk booking them again for a long haul flight.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to New York. My friend and I flew from Madrid to NYC on January 10th. The staff was arrogant and unprofessional. They spent almost all of the flight talking on the back side. We needed to ask for water four times and receive attitude about it. Food was served extremely hot or extremely cold.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Madrid to Panama City. Very impressed with the seats which were very comfortable. Standard of food was excellent, good choice of wines and frequently offered a range of drinks. Electric seats could be angled for comfort. Staff friendly but some had limited English. Entertainment not too great, not many recent films but as it was an overnight flight not too much of a problem.

### "The worst flight ever"
Flew Iberia from Madrid to Rio de Janeiro. The worst flight ever and I make around 150 flights per year. The seat was not reclinable because it was broken. No possibility to change the seat (fully booked flight). No entertainment service working for a 10 hour flight. The staff on board didn't answer when we called them. When we search for them, she was seated reading a magazine.

### "the service was appalling"
Flying from Bogota to London via Madrid, we travelled in Premier Economy expecting to enjoy some more comfort and better service. The seats and additional space were definitely better however the service was appalling, again. We fly reasonably regularly to Bogota, and every time we fly Iberia we are disappointed. This time the Steward attending our seats was rude and impatient. Regularly not waiting to hear our question or food order before leaving and bringing back what he thought we'd asked for. He was abrupt and often didn't bring what he offered and we asked for eg. a glass of water. The food was poor again but having travelled Iberia on this route a few times we expected poor food. On top of this, I asked for a gin and tonic with my meal and was told I'd have to pay for the gin. This I didn't expect having paid for premium economy tickets on a long haul flight. I wouldn't expect this in economy either on a long haul flight. Perhaps my expectations are wrong. I thought Iberia and BA were premium National carrier airlines, not budget airlines like Ryanair. Then on landing in London, we were advised that our luggage didn't make our connecting flight. We filled in our missing baggage forms and were told they would be delivered that evening. Of course they weren't. I checked the tracking numbers which said the new flights our baggage was supposedly on had landed had 4pm. I say flights because they split our bags over 2 different flights. I say supposedly as the tracking website said they hadn't located our baggage. Calling the helpline the next day they confirmed the new flights landed the day before but still couldn't confirm if they had our baggage. Our wait continues. We're unlikely to fly Iberia on this route again as there are other airline options. I don't know if this route is a problem with Iberia or if they are poor in general.

### "I did not board the second flight"
Chicago to Seville with a layover stop in Madrid. After booking the flight, I realized I spend the beginning part of my trip in Madrid. After arriving in Madrid, I did not board the second flight to Seville. Unbeknownst to me, Iberia cancelled my return flights (Seville to Madrid and Madrid to Chicago). When I arrived at the airport in Seville, I was informed that my ticket was no longer valid and that I would need to repurchase a new ticket. Iberia did not contact me to inform me prior to my arrival at the airport, despite the fact that a week had passed since my flight from Chicago to Madrid. In fact, two days before my return flight, I received an e-mail from Iberia titled "Comunicación operativa: Información sobre su vuelo" (Flight Information). This e-mail gave no indication that my flights had been cancelled. I ended up buying a ticket on the same flights as my original booking - Iberia did not refund my money for the flights they  cancelled. I submitted a complaint through Iberia's website on November 28th in which I requested a refund for the flights they cancelled. I received this response on December 22nd: "Certain fares do not accept refund and have a number of limitations with regard to changes in the route or sequence of reserved routes. For this reason, if the journey does not start, our system automatically cancels the ticket and if any of the purchased journeys is not used, the remaining routes included in the ticket will be cancelled. This is what happened in your case. I have no complaints about Iberia's flight attendants or in-flight service, but the fact that they cancelled my return flights, didn't inform me and won't refund my money does not strike me as good business.

### "the food was deplorable"
Dublin to Buenos Aires via Madrid. Worst airline I have travelled with in the last 10 years. It was 12 hr flight from Madrid departing at midnight and a nightmare, the food was deplorable and minimal. Three hours after departure  a cheese and ham sandwich followed by dinner and cheese and ham for breakfast. The worst service I have experienced.

### "my luggage did not come"
I had a trip from Miami to Ibiza via Madrid and Palma. When I get to Ibiza my destination my luggage did not come and they promised to deliver to my home, and they would pay 50 euros a day as compensatipom but I came back to the airport and I had to wait for my luggage as I had important items. When I came back from Ibiza to Miami my luggage did not come again. Because of it I lost my fly to Atlanta, I came to Atlanta in the next morning without my luggage with Iberia saying they would pay me and it will be delivered at my home in 48 hours. After 5 days trying to get information they said that my luggage it was at Atlanta Airport but not where and when it was coming! So I decided to go to the airport to get my luggage by myself.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Amsterdam. My connection flight to Amsterdam was cancelled - no reason given but we assumed due to weather. (My colleague flew later same evening from Istanbul and landed safely in Amsterdam!). Ground staff hopeless in assisting. Long lines at customer service with minimal staff to assist. My travel agent rebooked my flight and with this information I eventually was attended to (FOUR HOURS LATER!). The clerk behind the counter could barely speak English and when I showed him my reservation for the following morning, he consulted with a colleague and assured me that the flight booking would be honored. I should arrive at the desk of AirEuropa in the morning and they will issue my boarding ticket. With my hotel voucher and shuttle details, I got to my hotel (in the centre of Madrid), trusting the system that all would be ok. I got back to the airport at 06:15, proceeded to the check-in counter and lo and behold, no reservation and no ticket. Iberia did not answer their phone and faced with being stuck for 24 hours (Iberia rebooked me on my previous scheduled flight 24 hrs later). I paid €540 for the only available seat out of Madrid to Amsterdam. No honoring cancelled flight, no service, pure frustration.

### "Food was delicious"
Berlin to Boston via Madrid. Berlin Tegel went to Madrid punctually. All drinks and food had to be paid, but I was prepared. The seats were ok for the short flight and the crew very nice. You could get entertainment for free via wifi. I have read. From Madrid we continued punctually and I was even in Boston earlier than planned. Nice Airbus with great entertainment. The latest movies like Home Again, Baby Driver, Dunkirk, It, Pirates of the Carebean and so on. There were blankets, pillows and headphones for free and drinks and food was free. At the beginning there was food with a drink service, then coffee and tea and at the end again food and drinks and coffee. In between, they did not come through, but you could always get something. But I had my own water. Food was delicious, crew was nice. Luggage arrived too. Everything is great. What annoyed me was that I could not reserve my seat in advance and also could not check in online, because AA and Iberia can not access each other's booking systems. This is a no go for me, because I have to have my aisle seat. Therefore, I would try to avoid AA and Iberia. But luck today, even a series of two for me. Everything that could happen now has nothing to do with Iberia anymore.

### "will never choose this airline again"
Madrid to Vienna. I couldn't do an online check in and at the check in they informed me that I am on a waiting list. I still had to go to the gate and wait there till everybody finished boarding. There were like 10 people in the same situation than me. Iberia explained me that this was normal. After everybody boarded they called 3 more people from the waiting list. I didn't get to be on the flight. They gave me the money back but I dont care about that. I wasted a lot of time, missed important business and got a lot of frustration from Iberia. I will never choose this airline again.

### "Iberia is a reliable airline"
Frankfurt to Madrid return on A320 and A321. I can recommend Iberia although there are some negative aspects: there are no free drinks and snacks, not even water was free. Check-in at Frankfurt airport took very long, standing in line for 35 minutes and the online check-in did not work (impossible to download boarding pass on my smartphone). And the seating on A320 was very tight, even for me (I’m 170 cm tall). Experience on return flight was much better: Check-in at Madrid airport without waiting and seat pitch on A321 was much better. In general Iberia’s hub is fantastic, Madrid airport is efficient, modern and pleasant. One negative aspect turned into positive: when boarding time of my return flight had begun, the staff told us that the aircraft had technical issues and an equipment change was needed. We went to another gate and finally the delay was only 30 minutes, which is a good result in my opinion. Iberia is a reliable airline and much better than Ryanair with their canceled and delayed flights.

### "asked to check-in hand luggage"
Madrid to Porto. We were being asked to check-in our hand luggage or to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival (people were approached in an extremely polite manner in MAD, I must say). I find this irritating, as I had one piece of luggage, within the rules. Other people didn't. Those should be asked to do this. Nice crew and otherwise uneventful flight.

### "experience was outstanding"
We flew round trip between Chicago and Madrid in Iberia business. Our experience on both flights was outstanding. Check in was quick and lounges in both cities were excellent with the American Airlines O'Hare lounge being exceptional. Cabin crews on both flights were pleasant and efficient. Iberia's business class seat is comfortable although the aisle seats lack privacy and are subject to bumping by folks passing by. We selected a pair of "honeymoon" seats to avoid those issues. Iberia offered frequent beverage service that included good wines. Only their coffee was lacking (I wondered if they use robusta rather than arabica coffee) Our main meals were some of the best we have ever had in business class. My grilled bream was one of the best fish meals that I have ever enjoyed and equaled fish I ate at quality Spanish restaurants. I've included a picture of my fish entree and the appetizer service which could be a meal by itself. Even the arrival procedures in both cities went quickly and smoothly. We plan on flying Iberia again on an upcoming European trip and appreciate the effort they are making to provide a top notch business class product.

### "interior and condition raise eyebrows"
After several disappointing flights with Iberia, this one hit rock bottom. Iberia's Airbus A330-200's are all less than 2 years old, yet their interior and condition raise eyebrows. I had to store luggage in the compartments behind me as the one above my seat did not open. Very disappointed with how Iberia have changed over the last years. Their Menu has not changed once - yes not a big issue, but if you are a frequent flyer you would like an alternative maybe once in a while. The food was terrible but I don't recall ever having a sound meal on a flight departing from JFK. Iberia should change their catering logistics here as food on inbound flight from Madrid was a 10. Cabin crew did not seem bothered on this flight. The purser of the flight made no effort. Sat in his seat and played on his phone. Hate the idea of everything being recorded now. No announcements done by cabin crew whatsoever anymore, all recorded. Makes it very un-personal and very annoying. Some of these messages go on for minutes. Whoever came up with that idea. Free WIFI voucher did not work. Their seats were OK and that is pretty much it. Apart from that no chance. What a shame Iberia!

### "Stay away from this company"
We booked a return flight from Barcelona to Punta Cana for 3 people with Iberia. While making a booking, Iberia was shown as the carrier all the time. Since I have flown Iberia multiple times I am confident booking their flights as I know 1pcs hold baggage is always included in the fare and they have one of the best meals. Upon checking in (also done on Iberia website) we got a boarding passes marked as LEVEL airline (never heard of it before) with a huge mark no baggage. So we had to purchase additional baggage for 3 people, but we were not aware that there is also no meals included on a 10hr flight! Looked at an electronic ticket from Iberia and it clearly marked meal included (as Nr 3, No preference). Check-in agent was very attentive and said he can try to do whatever but that he has tons of cases like that where people are deceived into flying with Iberia but then they put them on a Level flight, with no luggage and meals! He said it happens every day! As meals were clearly marked on the ticket we kindly asked if we can talk to Iberia customer service regarding this. And that is when we were outraged by their customer service. He looked into the system and just waved at us that there is nothing he can do. When presenting their ticket with meals clearly marked for both flights and the inbound flight even stating “operated by Iberia”, he said that is a mistake on the ticket (their ticket!) and there is nothing he can do. The LEVEL flight experience was very bad. The plane is cramped, staff very unpolite, no blankets and pillows are offered. Paid 10eur for 40mb of internet, the line was unactive (notified after payment of course), so did not get to use any, threw away money. Stay away from this company at all costs.

### "I was very disappointed"
London to Madrid. Iberia is the national airline of Spain and accordingly one would hope that this airline would attempt to create a positive first image of a nation famed for hospitality and good food and high standards of service. Sadly, this was not the case. On what was a very busy Saturday afternoon at Heathrow, I dropped my bag off at the BA counter shared with Iberia. This was quick and efficient. Boarding was via a rather remote part of the airport and I noted some elderly people struggling with steep stairs to reach the boarding area. As I boarded a flight a male flight attendant coughed in my face twice and made no apology. The crew with one exception were absent during the flight. What alarmed me was the robotic and insincere attempt to have a security talk. I was not impressed. Food had to be purchased and was not of a good quality at all. I was very disappointed. The aircraft was however clean and the seats comfortable. The captain only made one announcement at the end of the flight. Disembarkation was orderly. In view of the cost of the flight, I was rather disappointed.

### "better if they didn't serve any meal"
Barcelona to Madrid in domestic business class. The business class service was shockingly bad on this 1 hr 15 min flight, no real attention from the crew and it would have been better if they didn't serve any meal, rather than the poor quality cheese sandwich. First time I have seen that the business class passengers actually have a chance to upgrade their meal to buy onboard option. Buy onboard menu cards were available in Business.

### "disappointing vegetarian catering"
Havana to Madrid. Decent cabin interior, very poor on board entertainment. I would recommend bringing your own iPad and noise cancelling head set (luckily I did), disappointing catering. If you choose the standard meal you may survive. Choosing vegetarian meal was something that I ended up far worse than I have experienced in economy class.

### "very bad service"
Zurich to Quito via Madrid. Very disappointed with Iberia. I arrived 07.11.2017 at Quito, while my suitcase did not make it. Iberia promised to deliver my suitcase by 09.11.2017. When I called they told me that the suitcase was just arriving and they could not deliver it until 10.11.2017. Today in the morning I got a call from Iberia, that my suitcase will be delivered today. However, my suitcase still did not get delivered and when I call Iberia nobody would pick up the phone. I am here in Ecuador on vacation and have already lost several days waiting for my suitcase with my clothes and other important stuff in it, and Iberia does not even answer my calls. This is very bad service. I would not recommend to fly with Iberia.

### "couldn't rebook me to a different flight"
Iberia informed me by email that my flight was cancelled one week before my flight. When I called them, they couldn't rebook me to a different flight whether it's on Oct 31 or a day before or after. They just said I'm being refunded end of story. I had to spend more money for tickets for me and my wife not to mention the stress we had to go through. It's hard to communicate with anybody to seek redress since they have no offices in Madrid nor do they have any assistance by phone or online. Don't the carriers or the airline industry have any mechanism where ordinary passengers like us will be protected from this situation or at least be provided with some form of restitution or st least an apology or explanation for subjecting us to circumstances beyond our control and getting away with it.

### "getting worse and worse"
Iberia is getting worse and worse. When I was flying to from Athens to Santiago de Compostela via Madrid there was a strike in France so the flight was cancelled. All passengers had to wait 3 hours to get a voucher and a ticket for the next day, because there were only 2-3 people working on the 6 counters that evening and were trying the help hundreds of customers. When I was flying back to Greece, I asked for a seat on the window or the aisle (I was the 3rd person to check-in that morning) and they asked me for 7 euro to change the seat they had given me 30 seconds ago, "new company policy". 7 euros to change from aisle to window. The company is not offering not even a glass of water anymore and they are seriously getting worse and worse in their customer service, when at the same time their tickets are not as cheap as other airline companies, from which you get what you pay for. I would advise to stay away from Iberia.

### "wanted to change our ticket date"
Madrid to Tenerife. Overbooking on many seats. Rude customer service who doesn't care about anything. They don't serve water on a 3 hours flight. Online reservation doesn't work properly and when we wanted to change our ticket date we had to pay extra 30 Euro for each passenger in phone customer service.

### "delayed for 7 hours at Madrid"
Marseille to Johannesburg via Madrid. Wheelchair assistance was requested and confirmed for an elderly member of our party with a broken leg. At Marseille airport we were told that Iberia did not inform the airport of our request. We had to use a luggage trolley as a wheelchair. Our flight was delayed for 7 hours at Madrid without explanation or special transport arrangement for the wheelchair. We use Uber at our own expense. The hotel provided by Iberia also was not wheelchair friendly. During our flight to Johannsburg we had to help ourself with drinks and snacks between 8:00 and 15:00. On arrival in JHB we were not assited to exit the plane and had to look for wheelchair assistance ourself while the air stewards were just standing around or packing their own bags.

### "legroom was extremely tight"
Booked a return ticket from Vienna to Madrid (flew on the 2nd Sept. and returned on the 6th September 2017). This was my first and probably the last time I flew with Iberia. It is such an embarrassment for a premium airline to actually not providing any drinks, even more snack without charging the passengers for flights below 6 hours. The flight took about 3 hours of duration and I was extremely shocked to find out that their policy is like budget airlines who will charge you for refreshment onboard the flight. It's absolutely cruel, at least they could have served drinks free of charge. The ticket price is of other premium airlines and I would expect them to have a certain standards in terms of service onboard. The seats were uncomfortable plus the legroom was extremely tight and you could hardly move your legs at all. Please avoid this airlines at any cost. I would highly advise not to fly with this airline.

### "just another way of making extra money"
I always fly with Iberia when ever I am traveling to Melilla from Malaga. I was made to pay extra 60 euros to change the name that I always use as per normal. I showed my passport with my photograph as a proof of ID. I filled my details as normal online but that was not good enough. Apparently I used my surname first. This is just another way of making extra money of the customers who have already paid top price for very little value. Extremely disappointed with the service.

### "gate staff refused to do anything"
London to Valencia return via Madrid (out in economy, return in business), return with minimum connection time (1 hour). LHR-MAD flight was mediocre and the attitude of the crew left a lot to be desired, particularly their attitude to safety. MAD-VLC was delayed by 30 minutes with no information given (at one point, gate stuff packed up and left) which meant we arrived too late for our car hire. Inbound VLC-MAD flight was delayed due to weather, and later air traffic control. When enquiring about our connection, the gate staff at VLC refused to do anything and informed that everything had to be done in Madrid. We called the helpline and were told that nothing can be done to rebook onto a later flight either. VLC-MAD in Business Class had no service, the seat-belt sign was left switched on for the whole flight. With the seats on the CRJ 1000 being the same as economy there was no point paying extra. Upon landing in Madrid, nobody was there to meet our flight. We approached the customer service agent in the T4S lounge and were told they could find no seat for us (economy or business) until the next day. We found seats on Iberia Express but the agents maintained that they could see no availability. We then had no choice but to pay for the seats on Iberia Express in cash just to come home that day and throw away our business class Iberia flight home which we had missed. We were told when we called the call centre that the back office would have arranged us a new flight already knowing we'd miss our connection - obviously, this wasn't the case. We made it in time for the MAD-LHR flight, but because assistance was not given upon landin- we did not make it in time to the plane.

### "staff service efficient and polite"
Milan - Madrid - Havana - Madrid - Milan in economy. Their product is OK, Airbus 330-200 brand new and super silent. On board staff service efficient and polite, food quality good but trays are realy too small. Ground handling in LIN was a mess very slow but in HAV very fast from check-in to air side within 2 mins. Connection in Madrid between T4 / T4S was smooth.

### "not able to seat us next to each other"
Panama City to Hamburg via Madrid. Within three weeks my girlfriend and I experienced that Iberia personel were not able to seat us next to each other on three out of four flights despite us emphasizing this wish during check in. Despite our early check in they would even charge us afterwards to change the seating and told us that it was possible to be seated next to each other if we just paid the charge. Furthermore the service was bad - personel did not seem to care much about the passengers. You have to take a flight for more than 6 hours to get anything to eat or drink (we did not get anything for our three hour flight). For our more than 10 hour flights we barely got enough food due to two small servings. The seats were small and it was difficult to sit next to each other. The entertainment touch screen that did not really to react when touched and the movies were outdated. Would not recommend using Iberia.

### "Worst customer service"
Madrid to London. I fly around 4 times a year to Spain from London and I usually take BA but sometimes Iberia operates BA flights. From my experience they are usually late and try to rush to arrive just on time. On my last trip, we arrived to London to find out that around 10 people were missing the luggage. I had some food in the luggage which went bad but that was the minor issue. I had to take a trip to Mexico 24 hours after this trip and they couldn't locate the bag. They do not have line managers in their phone service so don't try to ask for one. I asked for the phone to contact the courier company who was supposed to take my bag to my house and their reply was "we do not work with phone numbers". They were reading to me literally what I could read on the World tracer website to hurry up and hanging the phone as soon as possible. A really distressful and frustrating experience for holidays. If you can, stay away from Iberia! Worst customer service.

### "got switched to this terrible airline"
This airline was a nightmare. Flew Madrid to Boston. Picked my seats 8 months ahead of time only to get there early and be told I couldn't sit next to my fiance who I had just engaged while overseas. Afterwards they stopped me on my way to the plane and literattly ripped my carry on out of my hand on the gate ramp and demanded it be checked even though a ton of other people were bringing their bags on and mine was small. On the plane there was a lot of overhead space. I had my benadryl for flight help and much more in my carry on that was important. AC was terrible and the plan was hot, amd it was a 7 hour flight. Supposed to be comfortable! I'll never fly this again. My ticket was supposed to be American, got switched to this terrible airline.

### "not helpful or sympathetic"
Paid $37 extra to pick my seat when I bought my ticket to fly from Miami to Madrid. When I went online to check in for my flight the day prior to the flight, they had changed the plane and my seat no longer existed. When I called customer service, they said I had to pay another $37 and pick a new seat. I was told that when I got back from my trip, to call back and they would refund me for the original seat. I did exactly what they said. The first time I called customer service, they Iberian Representative said he could not find 2 seats, just one, so he could not refund me. I asked to speak to his manager. I was placed on hold for 20 minutes and eventually hung up on. I called back the customer service number later in the day and a women answered. She told me I had to file a claim on the website. I explained to here that I was told we could do this over the phone. She was not helpful or sympathetic. I do not understand that because the airline changed the plane which messed up my seating, why I have to waste my time jumping throw hoops to get my money back. The plane seats are super uncomfortable (9 hour flight) and the food on the plane was pretty awful. So overall - terrible experience.

### "flights were amended 3 times"
London to Almeria via Madrid. My flights were amended 3 times before my trip. I resorted to changing my return flight from Almeria to Madrid because of the final time change. I also then had to change my ongoing train from the UK airport to home because of the time factor. When I arrived at Heathrow, the BA check-in assistant said there was not enough time between my Heathrow to Madrid and Madrid to Almeria flights for my luggage to be transferred. She said Iberia are always doing this. Her superior told her that the luggage could only be booked to Madrid and that I would have to sort the problem out there. Iberia do not have a desk at Heathrow. The assistant printed out boarding cards for both outgoing flights. I would have to collect my luggage at Madrid and check it in again. At the boarding gate an assistant checked my details and insisted that I’d booked the flights separately. I disagreed. I later checked this online: I had one booking reference; therefore I had not booked them separately. Iberia never acknowledged this. I spoke to a flight attendant on-board. He said this had not happened before. He said that the assistant at check-in should have booked my luggage to go all the way to Almeria. He said ‘BA are always doing this’, contradicting his earlier comment. A Heathrow member of staff said she would make a note of what had happened. On landing at Madrid, I ran to Enquiries to be told to go straight to the gate and make a claim for the luggage at Almeria. No one had told me this previously. I am 61 years old and had to run the length of the airport to board my plane by the skin of my teeth. On arriving at Almeria, I made my claim. Again I was told my luggage should have been booked right through! I eventually got my luggage the next evening. In a reply to my email to Iberia, they asked for various details as if I was making a claim for 'lost' luggage. Iberia also gave me some platitudes regarding airport policies on change of flight times. They had misunderstood some of the main points of my email: to make Iberia aware of the complete shambles of booking my flights, particularly with not enough time allocated between connecting flights and little or no coordination with BA, whom I dealt with during check in at Heathrow. In their last email to me, Iberia said 'As long as you have confirmed connecting tickets which comply with the minimum times we can usually offer you the possibility of getting your boarding cards and checking in your luggage through to the final destination'. When I booked the tickets for my flight, I expected Iberia to confirm 'connecting tickets which comply with the minimum times'. They indicated that the onus was on me. I strongly disagree. In fact, I spoke at length with BA Customer Services who said that if I tried to book a flight online with them, their website would not permit such a booking with such a short connecting time between flights! I feel that they tried to fob me off by deflecting my criticisms and complaints. I do not intend to fly with this company again.

### "service onboard was perfect"
Madrid to New York JFK. Iberia is doing a real good job on the business user. Check at Madrid was very fast. Fast track in less than a minute. Lounge is great. The only issue, still don't know how to deal with the boarding. People around the gate, it's a bit messy. Once on board, FA's are better than ever, serving with a smile, and around all flight. Really comfy seats, all with direct aisle access. Pre-drinks served, bar was great, and food very tasty and with a mediterranean look. IFE very efficient, and overall experience of the service onboard was perfect. On time departure/arrival, and I was on a cab 20 min short after my arrival at JFK, impressive.

### "ground crew rude and unhelpful"
Iberia staff are rude and unwelcoming. I entered the lounge for my Madrid to Rome flight as I have with other airlines on 100s of occassions with a flying partner and was told the offer only extended to myself. I left and checked the website and returned as the rules say with partner, the same attendant said "I Know the rules" so I asked for a supervisor who read the rules and said I could enter with a partner to which I said "No, thank you", why would I want to expose myself to further rudeness and poor attitude. The onboard staff are pleasant however, ground crew rude and unhelpful.

### "cabin crew were friendly and helpful"
The Iberia check in in Orly was efficient although the check in agent did ask me to change my seat on the plane instead her doing it - I guess she couldn't be bothered so early in the morning. The breakfast they served from Paris to Madrid or anywhere in Europe has not been changed for the past few years - packet of fruit, yogurt drink, a biscotti, a croissant and eggs with tomato sauce. Transit in Madrid was quick and easy but lounge in T4S in the morning was full and crowded. The mid range A319 on the way to Tel Aviv had dedicated business class seats but clearly the cabin is dated and seats are well worn. Choose row 2DF for the extra legroom. Cabin crew were friendly, helpful and present on both flights and they were extremely apologetic for the malfunctioning handheld entertainment device. Turned out all the machines they had on board were not charged on the ground. They also gave out a laughable amenity kit for the 5 hour flight.

### "certainly no compensation"
Santiago de Compostela to Zurich via Madrid. From Madrid to Zurich I was the only business class passenger. They forgot to load the dinner, and my meal consisted of salad, a roll and some nuts. Far away from what Iberia calls "a dinner that will surpass your expectations" on their website. After the flight, I contacted their customer service - and this is the main reason, why I publish a review here. You wait for weeks to get an answer and when it finally arrives, it consists of prewritten modules and a lot of marketing slang, but no real regret and certainly no compensation.

### "Both flights were delayed"
Porto to London via Madrid with Iberia this week after many years without using them and not impressed. Both flights were delayed, first flight over 40 min late, on arrival to Madrid T4 had to run to board my connecting flight on time. After an on time boarding for the flight to Heathrow we stayed inside the plane over 1h before move away for take off without any information. The result was a late arrival at Heathrow and I missed my connection to Aberdeen with BA. Service is paid for.

### "staff were nice and friendly"
Flew Iberia from Madrid to Athens. Very good punctuality, we arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled time. The staff were nice and friendly. The space between seats is spectacular. The captain informed us about the route that we were going to do and some points that could be observed from the windows.

### "obvious difference between long and short haul"
Boston to Bucharest via Madrid with Iberia. We had a nice flight from BOS to MAD. It was obvious the difference between long haul and short haul on this airline. Food very good and entertainment system with updated films and very easy to operate. Cabin crew was the worst; they should be more nice and helpful. I was waiting for more then ten minutes after calling attendant when I decided to get up so I could get water for my kid - they were talking and reading magazines in the back of the plane. Ckeck-in staff was also untrained or unfriendly. I asked for seats with more space and leg room that airlines usually keep for families, but first they told me they were occupied and less than a minute after, they said it was $32 per seat. In the end, these seats were vacant, and families were travelling with less space - it just seems they tell you the anwser that will give them less trouble.

### "No food or water included"
Porto to London via Madrid. When we got to the airport they told there was problem with our tickets. I called my travel agency, and after more than 2hours Iberia admited a mistake. We lost the first flight to Madrid just because of a small system error. Iberia refused to pay for the best option for us, and we had to accept the option of flying late. When we got to madrid (almost 11pm) we head to iberia costumer service and they refuse to pay or assist us in finding a hotel. I had to pay for everything, taxi, hotel and food! In the morning, we head to airport and the flight was 45mins late. No food or water was included in ticket. I never found staff so unfriendly.

### "service attentive and friendly"
Madrid to Buenos Aires return, a 13 hour long flight. Excellent service, attentive, friendly. Brand new aircraft. Confortable seats. Departure right on time. Arrival 30 minutes before schedule. Quite, smooth flight. Better than average inflight entertainment, both hardware and selection. Nice touchscreen. Food and drink was just OK, however. Great price. We travelled with our 2 kids (8 and 7), and they loved it, and crew was particularly friendly to them. By far better than most European airlines. Seems that Iberia has undestood that the client wants service and value for money. And they deliver.

### "a race against time"
Ibiza to Madrid via Valencia. April 17, 2017, at 4:30 PM our chauffeur service from the hotel took us to Ibiza Airport. We got to the airport at 4:45pm and went to the Iberia's One World/Business Class check-in counter for us to get on the flight to Madrid via IB 8027. We told the staff that we have a subsequent connection to Manila via Doha from Madrid. For some bizarre twist of fate, we were placed on waitlist despite having confirmed seats. We were told that since we have a Ruby Status on OneWorld, we would get prioritized as the flight was overbooked and that there will be passengers who would not show up. After security checks clearance, we read on the flight info monitor where our boarding gate was. We whiled away the time at the lounge and at the same time, checking if the boarding commenced, until it started at 5:40pm. Boarding was late by 10 minutes. So we had to approach the check in staff of Iberia and informed her of the situation. She just nonchalantly made us wait on the side until boarding was done. When the last passenger came, we approached her again only to be told that the we could not be accommodated on the flight despite having international connection to Manila via Doha on Qatar Airways (Business Class). We were then instructed to go back to the check in counter in order for them to resolve our case. We were not even guided or escorted on how we were supposed to get back considering all our bags were checked. So off we went. When we reached the counter, the Supervisor was there. She placed us on a flight IB 8437 to Valencia and subsequently on IB 8027 from Valencia to Madrid. She asked where our luggage where and we told her that they were checked in. She said you have to get it from the belt. So my partner had to run back to the arrival area and make his way inside the luggage carousel to get the backs to be re-checked in. I then asked her if we'll make it in time for our flight. She only answered by telling us that we would be arriving in Madrid at 10pm and that we'll have to get our bags and run to Qatar Airways' check in counter. We were told also to show our null boarding pass from Ibiza-Madrid either in Valencia or Madrid in order to get compensated from being bumped off. We were left with no choice but to take it as there were no other options. When we get to the boarding gate for our flight to Valencia, we noticed that our boarding passes for the Valencia-Madrid leg bore the same name (Atienza) although with different seat assignments. We again approached the same Iberia boarding staff regarding this and told us to inform Iberia boarding staff that it was their fault and that we should be let on the flight. We took the flight IB 8437 operated by Air Nostrum to Valencia which took 35 minutes. We deplaned and went to the boarding gate for our Valencia-Madrid leg on IB 8027 and begged for the staff their to get in touch with Qatar Airways as it was not our fault to get bumped off and for them to wait for us since we were flying in Business Class. All we got was the staff's word that she would call but whether or not she did, there was no way for us to know. We were also given a proof for us to get compensated for being bumped off our Ibiza to Madrid flight indicating a minimum compensation of €125/passenger. IB 8027 flight was delayed. It was totally a race against time. We boarded the flight and touched down half past 9pm. And to our bewilderment, we deplaned at a far flung gate.

### "polite but not friendly"
Madrid to Mexico City. Flight in business class after using the system of Iberia with the minimum bet (500 €) to upgrade from economy. Comfortable seats, complete reclining, individual space due to alternative design of seats spacing. Crew was polite but not friendly, they did their job and no more. Free wifi was a joke, only 4 Mb were free, for further connection huge prices. Food was not good. They had instead, a wide selection of Spanish wines, which were super ok. Flight delayed for about 1 hour. Big personal tv screen with many new movies.

### "Crew were very attentive"
Madrid to Lima. Quite a lousy experience on an old A340-600 (the age was very much visible in the toilets). Seats are the like of Alitalia business class but seem narrower so it's more difficult to sleep, although fully flat. Touch screen was very slow and I ended up using the remote touch screen to get things done. Crew were very attentive - and that's the big plus of this flight - but food quite tasteless (my fish was overcooked and the yoghurt tart was stone-heavy), wine ok but nothing special. I was expecting something more in terms of soft product, got a bit disappointed. A nice touch was a 4MBvoucher for the wi-fi, which is nothing if you want to download stuff or even check your mail, but allowed me to whatsapp for an hour or so (no files sent, obviously).

### "I could not sit down properly"
Flew Iberia from Hamburg to Madrid. The seat row spacing was so tight that I could not sit down properly. The crew saw this and re-seated me. So great crew but due to the seat row spacing, never again. Both flights the same disaster. Any of you who are taller than 190cm should not book Iberia short haul. Cannot judge on long haul.

### "a very serious problem"
While Iberia is known to deliver a decent, if not stellar, service in Business Class (with the exception of the shameful Iberia Express brand which should be all Economy), there is a very serious problem with its checking agents in Paris Orly (Iberia Staff? Vueling? IAG? Outside contractor?) who possibly deliver the worst service in the Industry. These agents are quite brazen about doing as little as possible with the worst professional attitude, and they seem completely unsupervised. The Iberia rule is to open check-in 2.30 hours before departure time. Check-in seldom opens more than 2 hours ahead of time, with no agent to be seen before. It creates long lines including in the Priority line where the criteria is not enforced. This invariably results in chaos and altercations, handled by the staff in a tone more adaptd to women guards in female prisons. If in addition the check in banks stop rolling and accepting checked bags (frequent and not Iberia's fault), they continue accepting passengers, printing tags and leaving them loose for future attachment to heaps of baggage just left there, which must result in horribly misdirected luggage in large quantities. In other words, these agents need supervision, and training both in operations and addressing passengers. Obviously they get none whatsoever.

### "an absolute delight"
London to Bogota via Madrid with Iberia. This was an absolute delight. It started with a very good experience in the British Airways business Lounge as this was a code share flight. We flew after 8 PM from Gatwick to Madrid and after changing terminaI was able to go in the Iberia business Lounge which was deserted and use a bed in the relaxing area and successfully slept all night. Woke and havd a complimentary shower and shave and then a good breakfast before my flight from Madrid to Bogotá at noon. The business class seats all laid out very well and all seats are accessible without clambering over any other people. There are various airlines that if you get stuck by the window or in the middle and the other person puts their bed down then you've got no choice but to try and climb across them. All very poor but certainly not with Iberia. The staff attention was good and so were the meals. It seems that the Spanish still take the service sector as a career rather than a reluctant top up job like they might in the UK. There are still a sense of pride by working with an airline. On the return sector everything was equally as good and I think I slept for nearly 8 hours. I really didn't want to get off the plane. I have travelled numerous times on different business airlines and I must say this was amongst the best. I now I want to go again.

### "won't hesitate to fly them again"
Zürich to Palma de Mallorca via Madrid. The first leg of my trip to the Island of Mallorca was a rather underwhelming experience. The seats were worn, the cabin filthy and some parts of the cabin interior were loose and needed a fix. The temperature onboard was far too warm - maybe a trick by the crew to push the inflight-sale of drinks? On the positive side, the flight was full and the crew happily helped me to find a space for my cabin luggage as I was among the last passengers to board. Another big plus was the fact that the aircraft was pushed back from the stand on the clock and touched down in Barajas 20 minutes before schedulded arrival. The second leg to Palma on Iberia Express, a couple of hours later, was a much better experience. The aircraft interior looked clean and fresh and so did the cheerful all-female cabin crew. I especially liked their colourful uniforms. Once again the flight left on time and touched down a couple of minutes before schedulded arrival. Happy smiles and warm "bye-byes" to the leaving passengers at the aircraft door. I won't hesitate to fly with them again.

### "nice experience with Iberia"
I flew from Athens to Madrid a few days ago with my family. It was a 3.5 hour flight. The flight was on time, they are very punctual. The stewardesses were kind. As a Spanish airline they speak Spanish and English too. Also I could heard some explainings in Greek (good thing for the people from Greece). The legroom was quite smaller, but the seats were very comfortable. It was a "short" flight so they didn't serve food. It was a nice experience with Iberia. I recommend it!

### "the cabin is spacious"
Madrid to London Heathrow. Deliberately booked this flight as it is planned as a wide-bodied aircraft. Held for a long time on the airbridge for no apparent reason. Allocated seat 31C on booking and no opportunity to change it before boarding. Décor onboard subdued with brown cloth seating and seats very hard. However the cabin is spacious and a 2-4-2 layout gives a fair amount of room. Although a shorter flight than usual for this aircraft full IFE was working with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows available, although this was switched off 15 minutes before landing for some reason. All shorter flights no longer offer even a complimentary drink, never mind a snack. Carriers like this need to realise customers book with them, rather than LCC's, for slightly more room and better service and as this is now lacking why do they still charge far higher prices? I have one more flight booked with an IAG company this year and it will be my last.

### "only one of our two cases turned up"
Manchester to Santiago de Chile via Madrid. Computer problems cause significant problems for us. Could not check in on line on 3 February and when we arrived at check in at Manchester the computer was still down. Took 35 mins to check in and although our luggage was checked through, there was no allocation of the seats from Madrid to Santiago. In Madrid we were allocated the last two seats on the plane. Not good. I ended next to an obese lady, not pleasant for an hour during waiting and take off. Fortunately she was relocated after take off. The flight and food were okay. I had a lovely chicken dish and the service was prompt which is really good for an overnight flight. Managed plenty of sleep. On arrival only one of our two cases turned up. It took nearly 90 minutes at the desk to register a delayed case, not what you need after a 13h flight. The case was delivered 27h later, but there was no offer of anything to help us during this period when we were without toiletries and a chane of underwear.

### "slow and messy boarding"
Flown from Lisbon to Naples via Madrid with Iberia. My reservation included two people but our seats on the flight were assigned far to each other - the check-in desk asked 17 EUR each to get us a place close to each other. Slow and messy boarding. The plane was almost full, so hand luggage was stored for free - that's been nice. No drinks included even though it's a flag carrier company. Flight was on-time.

### "friendly cabin crew"
I flew from Madrid to Zurich on a mileage reward flight in Iberia's economy class. The flight was only about 1/4 full and therefore, the friendly cabin crew offered the passengers of the economy cabin to take a seat in the first economy rows with better sitting comfort. I did not use the catering service. The only point which i found not okay is the lack of any cleaning of this aircraft before departure - table, seats and floor not clean at all.

### "very good and kind service"
Zurich to Madrid on a mileage reward flight and got an upgrade into Business class. Very good and kind service although the flight was almost completely booked and good food and beverage quality. Overall good cleanliness of the cabin but no soap dispenser at the toilet - however Iberia provides seperate sealed soap. The aircraft (EC-MFO) belonged to Air France until Spring 2015 which means a different seat and comfort condition (e.g. no reclinable seats at all).

### "quick cautionary note"
Gatwick to Malaga. A quick cautionary note for when things go wrong. We were not able to travel on this booking and required assistance from Iberia Customer Services. This was possibly one of the most painful experiences I have ever had. Initially I attempted to cancel the flights via telephone. They were non-refundable so all I was asking for was an email to confirm that the booking had been cancelled and that we were not eligible for a refund. Iberia were unable to do this. Subsequently I attempted to contact the airline by email (for a written record this time). Again, all I was asking for was an email stating that we did not use the flights and that the booking was non-refundable. Four months later, I have managed to at last get the required document from Iberia. By way of comparison, and despite having booked through Iberia, one of the flights was a BA code share. Iberia said that we would have to go to BA for proof that we did not board that flight. One form on the BA website and one week later, BA had provided the email. I would therefore suggest that it was a relatively simple task made impossibly difficult by Iberia's hideous Customer Service.

### "It is a small incident"
It is my first time flying with Iberia, in Business class from Zurich to Madrid. I went to Zurich airport, and waiting on the Business class line when it is my turn, the Iberia Lady behind the desk asked a young couple on the Economy class line to do the check-in at Business class line. I went to ask the lady what happened and I was told the couple has been waiting for long time, because the economy line's computer had a problem, so she judges herself that it would be fair to let them go before me, and it will only take 2 minutes. Her supervisor came by and he told me in private, that there is no difference between Business passenger and Economy passengers at Iberia. It is a small incident, but it shows the mentality of Iberia staff and the company, the onboard experience confirm further that. Iberia is far behind the leading companies such as Swiss or Qatar. Will I fly again with Iberia? No.

### "good and attentive service"
Zurich to Madrid with Iberia. Very punctual and quiet flight; good and attentive service from the crew. However - the food variety in Business Class on this flight is poor. I have take this flight several times in the last 20 months - you'll get a good quality meal but it's about the same every second time.

### "service was fast, efficient and friendly"
Madrid to Havana. Very nice and quiet flight with Iberia in their new Business Class long-haul design. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. The seat offered a full-flat bed like promoted without any difficulties. However, the wi-fi service isn't working well over the atlantic ocean. Good food on this Madrid outbound flight. For the return food quality for the main dish which they have to order from Cuban suppliers was very bad - a fact known by the airline.

### "beds you can get comfy on"
Madrid to Havana flight on time and the seat layout in business was spacious and the seats comfy. One of the few planes even with lie-flat beds you can get comfy on. The A330-200 is a great plane and with only 4 across in the business section. every seat has access to the aisle. Service on both outbound and inbound sectors was attentive and quality of food good. Wine selection was also of a good standard as you would expect from an airline from a wine producing country. We were given free 30 minute wifi connection on boarding the aircraft for use any time during the flight. A nice touch is that, whilst in the lounge, I received an e-mail telling me the boarding gate before it was on the departures board, so I could plan when to leave the lounge.

### "look like a budget airline"
Gran Canaria to Paris Orly via Madrid. A very smooth flight to Paris via Madrid with Iberia, the only thing that I felt that was rather disappointing was the fact that Iberia are a One World member and so are British Airways, which was strange because if I were to compare British Airways and Iberia as flag carrier companies and members of one world, British airways would make Iberia look like a budget airline! Not bad at all though!

### "lie-flat beds you can get really comfy on"
Flew Iberia from Madrid to Havana. Flight on time and the seat layout in business was spacious and the seats comfy. One of the few planes even with lie-flat beds you can get really comfy on. The A330-200 is a great plane and with only 4 across in the business section. every seat has access to the aisle. Service on both the outbound and inbound sectors was attentive and quality of food good. Wine selection was also of a good standard as you would expect from an airline from a wine producing country. We were also given a free 30 minute wifi connection on both legs. A nice touch is that, whilst in the lounge, I received an e-mail telling me the boarding gate before it was on the departures board, so I could plan when to leave the lounge. The only reason they don't get a 9/10 rating is I couldn't pre-select my seats at booking

### "my bag stayed in Miami"
Miami to Barcelona via Madrid. American Airlines was my carrier, but they screwed up at the start with a 2 hour delay (another horror story) so when I got to Miami for the second leg of my journey to Barcelona they put me on Iberia, which went to Madrid then to Barcelona - one extra leg. Anyway, as I found out, my bag stayed in Miami with the note attached quote "waiting for instructions" for six days. I would call Iberia lost luggage daily multiple times and they said they were waiting for a response from American Airlines. For 6 days this went on my luggage wasn't lost it was just sitting at the Miami airport. Anyway, when they finally got it, I only found out about it because I called for like the 30th time. Even though I had an online account for "lost luggage" per their prompting they couldn't even keep that up to date. Then, when my luggage arrived at the Barcelona airport, I found out that they wanted me to come pick it up as opposed to the instructions for delivery on my account - the website account was not updated. Now, 3 WEEKS later, exactly 22 days after I filed a claim for reimbursement of my expenses I incurred for not having my luggage for 6 days, I'm told that the request is finally being processed, even though early on they had told me the max length of time for reimbursement was 21 days after filing. Not once did they initiate contact (no email nothing) or info or instructions. Even to this day 3 weeks later, my "lost luggage" account on Iberia's website states "delivering pending". I picked it up at the Barcelona airport 3 weeks ago!

### "antiquated seats and poor entertainment"
This was a leg of a One World Round-The-World Business Class Fare, so I had no choice, but to take this overnight flight between Madrid and Moscow. The first thing to point out is that the business class on this flight is just the renamed First Class Cabin from 15 years ago. The seats were the wider, but limited reclining type that you found on international flights 15 years ago. The entertainment system was more nostalgia with a small screen that was stored in the armrest and looping movies for the duration of the flight. The service was very pleasant, attentive and friendly with a variety of languages including English, Russian and Spanish. Overall, if this were a 5 hour day flight, it would have mitigated the impact of the antiquated seats and poor entertainment (who these days is not with some device to keep them busy for a couple of hours). Given the flight left at mid-night, one would have expected amenities more toward the red-eye flyer.

### "really recommend this service"
Took the Air Shuttle (Puente Aéreo) between Barcelona and Madrid to go and come back in the same day. Check-in can be done up to 20 minutes before flight departure and the flight is about 50 minutes, which makes it really quick to get to Madrid and come back in the same day. The price is not cheap, but the total flexibility is worth it and being able to take which ever flight you want is great. Puente Aéreo is much faster than the high speed train and makes it easier to go and come back on the same day. I really recommend this service for passengers flying for business purposes.

### "very enjoyable flight both ways"
Treated ourselves to Business Class flying from Madrid to Havana return. It was a very enjoyable flight both ways. The flat seats were great for the overnight flight on the way back. The cabin crew were attentive but not in your face. The plane appeared relatively new. The only downside was that as an English speaker found the crew and captain hard to understand but only a minor irritation.

### "doesn't pay for cleaning"
Tokyo Narita to Dusseldorf via Madrid with Iberia. Probably the worst experience I've ever had when it comes to traveling by plane. Long before we were supposed to even fly, our seat reservation was constantly changed without any notice. When we wanted to check in online, our newly assigned seats were distributed all over. We finally got seats together for the first leg from NRT to MAD. However, the ground staff failed to assign seats next to each other from MAD-DUS. We were supposed to sit in Row 9 and 16 (fortunately we were able to change the seats in MAD). Departure was on time and shortly after we were airborne, lunch service had started. However, the service was very stressed and the cabin attendants did not seem to be very coordinated. The staff seemed more focused on getting everything done as fast as possible. During the coffee service, the flight attendant was literally running through the aisle, I could not even get my cup raised quickly enough to get some coffee. Upon request, the unfriendly cabin attendant grunted "not now, maybe later". Only after I asked another cabin attendant who was slightly more friendly I got my coffee which was cold by then. In general, the service was unfriendly. Adressing all passengers in Spanish, although it was very obvious, they were not speaking Spanish. They were also replying in Spanish, after I had adressed them in English. The food itself was awful. The noodles were overcooked and the meat was very chewy. Shortly after lunch service the cabin light was switched off and we were asked to close the window blinds leaving us in the dark on a daytime flight. After that, the crew completely disappeared and only appeared again for a quick snack service and the pre-arrival meal. As we were flying in one of their brand new A330-200 models from Tokyo, the inflight entertainment system was, hardware wise, state of the art. However, the movie and TV-series selection was rather poor. The 3D, interactive flight map, however was great. The connecting flight from Madrid to Düsseldorf held another unpleasant surprise. When we boarded the aircraft, the aircraft was extremely dirty. French Fries were all over the place and when I asked the flight attendant why it was so dirty, she replied "there were kids sitting there and the company doesn't pay for cleaning until the airplane will be back in Madrid". Luckily we were able to have our seats changed and got some seats which were cleaner.

### "I wouldn't use this airline again"
Flew Iberia from London Heathrow to Havana via Madrid. Positive - the flight was on time and check in was very smooth. Negative - the food was atrocious, had some beef dish and I imagine eating my shoe would have been preferable. The meal was the only one served during a 10 hour flight except for a disgusting breakfast, which was practically thrown in our face. Tried to get a drink of water during the flight but wasn't supplied, I assume the cabin staff were sleeping. I wouldn't use this airline again as these inconveniences are okay on a short haul, but not on a longer flight.

### "low prices with reasonable comfort"
I flew from Lyon to Rio De Janeiro via Madrid in Mid-October. Boarding and ground staff were nice, exept at the check-in couter, where the lady was rude and unwelcoming. Our LYS-MAD flight was what you would expect for a short hop, but I was disapointed with the fact that you had to pay for food or drinks. MAD to GIG was a rather long flight (10 hours and a half) and the flight cew provided A good service. The food was correct (although I have tasted better ones on other airlines). IFE was good, with personal touch screens with games, plenty of music and some 50 movies/series. They did not lose my luggage, which was "surprising" since I had a very short connection. Compared to the price I paid, I would consider the service great. It is a good airline if you want to fly to South America at low prices with reasonable comfort.

### "service provided on board was very good"
New York JFK- Madrid return. Onward to Madrid, JFK terminal 7 is nice and easy. Still the fast track takes a bit longer than expected. Around 25min. Lounge great. Boarding and departure on time. Priority boarding provided. FA very nice and service provided on board was very good. Window seat privacy and confort is great. Food selection and wines are better than competitors. Amenity kit with L'Occitane products. Arrival 30min early. On my way back same level of service. Lounge at Madrid airport is very good. Same aircraft, seating and comfort level. FA very good service. Overall, great business product and service.

### "overall they did a good job"
I booked this flight from Milan Malpensa to Cancun via Madrid through their website and the first thing happened was that they have booked the flight twice and charged my credit card accordingly. After calling their call center I was able to get the money back, but in more then a week, and we are not talking 100€ here. The big surprise was when I arrived in Milan at the airport. Online when checking in I couldn't give my frequent flyer number so I said I will do everything at the airport. The lady at the priority check in very rudely tells me that my reservation has been cancelled and she asks me to go and provide her a valid reservation number looking very busy, although there was no client anywhere. So I call Iberia again, after 8 minutes waiting in line they tell me that everything has been resolved and I should go to the check in desk again. I go this time to the normal check in desk and there is another lady, same style. She says my flight is in 3h30m and I should get back in 1h30m otherwise she can't check in the bags. I didn't need any bags, I just wanted my boarding card, so she has to somehow leave her "doing nothing" and she issues the tickets. I should say I have told her to insert my FF number before issuing the tickets, 3 times, without any success. She first issued the boarding passes and then at the end my card number. This caused me a lot of problems, first at the business lounge in Milan where they couldn't read my oneworld status. In Madrid I found out that the FF number inserted was wrong (a 7 too much) and while trying to fix this, they've told me the system is not working and that they will fix it later. when it was fixed, it was in Madrid when returning and they have given me the right number just for the last part MAD MXP, for all the other legs I should contact them via internet. I was pretty sure I will get my miles 3 months after this, but it turned out to be different. I got them a week after I returned home. Now, about the flights. The planes were new and the A340-600 was impressive. 2-4-2 configuration. The crew very attentive and friendly, active at customer's needs. The food wasn't great (only one meal for 13h) and the breakfast was a joke: a box with different cold snacks. I must say I was impressed by the punctuality. Arrived on time or even 30 min ahead of schedule. So thumbs up for the flights, thumbs down for the ground service. Overall they did a good job and I would fly them again (booked already for next year).

### "do not deserve your money"
Gatwick to Havana via Madrid. In May I flew to Cuba from London with what was meant to be a short stop in Madrid. On getting to Madrid, the flight to Havana was delayed - these things happen so we weren't panicked. However, the length of the delay kept changing on the board, 1 hour grew to 5, the boarding gate kept changing and so (whilst we stayed in the bar at the airport) every 50 mins or so a plane load of people would cross from one end of the airport to the other. The staff refused to give us any update, just kept saying to check the boards. Our 17.30 flight was finally cancelled due to mechanical faults at 22.30 and we were told that we would have to leave the airport collect our luggage and get on a coach to a hotel for the night. This would be the start of the farce. Our luggage was not available we were told if we waited for it we would miss the bus to the hotel. On going through passport control there was no member of staff to herd us and nobody knew what was happening, on getting to the hotel there was a 2 hour queue to check in. Finally reaching my room at midnight I was exhausted. Again, mechanical faults happen, but it could have been handled so much better. We were collected and driven to the airport the next morning for a 1300 flight, that didnt take off until 1500. This meant we had lost a full day of our holiday. The flight itself was great (there and back) and although the return was delayed too it was only by 45 mins or so. It was when I wrote to Iberia to claim compensation that things got worse. I raised the claim on my return and was told that the issue was an extraordinary circumstance and I was not entitled. This is not true for mechanical faults and I asked Iberia to confirm the issue with the plane. I was ignored for 3 months despite chasing emails. I then asked the Spanish Aviation Authority to look into this and in September I received an email from Iberia admitting fault and offering to pay compensation. That said, no money was forthcoming and a further 4 chasing emails eventually led to an apology a month later saying I would have the money in "a few days". A week later I chased again and this time I asked for the address to send a notice of legal action to. Finally money was paid to me. As far as I'm concerned I will never fly them again, whilst the flights were good and reasonably priced if something goes wrong it is impossible to reach a member of the staff, it is only emails and always an automatic response. In addition they clearly lied to me when claiming extraordinary circumstances at the start. Please do not fly Iberia, they do not deserve your money.

### "strong competitor to other providers"
This is an overdue recommendation from our cross atlantic flights to and from New York JFK to Madrid in June 2016 with Iberia. From Check in to landing, the service level, comfort and professionalism were perfect. When comparing to other business class tickets / prices, Iberia in my opinion is a strong competitor to other providers. We traveled with our children who were treated exceptionally well. The food was good, not on the same par as a first class, but it was unique, presented very well and accommodated my children's specific needs. Their hub in Madrid is a perfect gateway to virtually any city in Europe. I look forward to flying again with them soon.

### "Iberia did a good job"
New York JFK to Porto via Madrid. I was pleasantly surprised with my first flight on Iberia. I am a Delta Platinum flyer, but chose Iberia to Portugal/Spain for convenience and best flight times. I read some unfavorable reviews but having experienced good flights on Iberia in economy class, my impression of the airline is good. The aircraft was new and clean, the flight attendants were professional and helpful, they provided newspapers and earbuds for in-flight entertainment free of charge, they remembered to provide my low calorie meal. Each and every seat in economy received a blanket and pillow. I was seated next to a passenger who mumbled to himself and appeared to have a viral infection (coughing, sneezing) and I asked to be moved to another seat. The flight attendant found another seat and in fact the two seats next to it were empty the entire flight! Cons: The meals were average and the website would not let me print my boarding passes for my return trip home which resulted in me waiting in line for over 35 minutes to get passes. I know airlines are far from perfect, but Iberia did a good job and I would fly Iberia again.

### "Iberia was a surprise"
Marrakech to Madrid Barajas. Iberia was a surprise! Check in a little bit slow because lots of people lining up. Immigration was terrible for Marrekech airport. You can see more about it in the Marrakech airport review. When it was final call we were rushing to the plane. The airline waited for us so I was quite pleased. Landing okay and arrival baggage smooth. Maybe because Madrid was their hub airport. Great surprise from us.

### "business class product is great"
Madrid to Miami. Initially assigned 42A (in the rear of the aircraft). Forked up a bit of money to upgrade my seat to business class. Worth the investment. I arrived at Madrid Barajas 2 hours before the flight, so checked out the Velazquez Lounge. Had a nice bite to eat for breakfast and picked up a few complementary magazines for the flight. Nice views of some planes taking off outside the window, and there were computers with Internet access available. Seat 2A was probably the most comfortable I have been on. Fully lie-flat, with a soft pillow and blanket included. It was a window seat, with no one next to me, so the privacy afforded was a plus. Top-notch meal - ham hock with potatoes plus a salad and liberal doses of Spanish wines. Wi-fi was inordinately expensive for such a long flight. The IFE was great - was able to squeeze in two movies. Before landing we were also offered a light meal (Spanish cold cuts). Flight departed slightly late to Miami but we made up for it in the air. Iberia's business class product is great with attentive service, great meals and quality IFE. Will prefer them for my flights to USA from Spain from now on.

### "Worst customer service"
Barcelona to Madrid. When we arrived at the airport, our flight was shown on the departure board as leaving on-time. We waited in line for over an hour to check in our luggage, but when we arrived at the front of the line, we were informed that our flight had been cancelled. No explanation was given as to why. We were told to wait in a different line to change to a later flight. After another hour wait in that line, we were told that the next available flight to Madrid was five hours later. While waiting in line, we had researched the high-speed train on line, and knew that we could arrive in Madrid by train earlier than the departure time of the flight Iberia was offering. So we said told the agent not to book the substitute flight and she assured us our money would be refunded. Since returning from Spain, I've tried in vain to get a refund for the flight Iberia cancelled. I've called four times over the course of a week, and each time I wait on hold for longer than the flight time from Barcelona to Madrid, only to be told I need to call back in 24 hours (or 48 hours or 72 hours) when they will have finished researching the cancellation. It is obvious they hope I will give up and let them keep the money for the flight they cancelled. Worst customer service I've ever received from an airline. If I ever return to Spain, I will travel by train and avoid the complete disaster that is Iberia.

### "good food and wine selection"
Madrid to Mexico City with Iberia. I cannot get over how the good the food and wine selection was. Far better than any of the airlines I have flown recently (Singapore, BA, American etc) and on par to Qatar Airways. Good dishes and healthy food. Aircraft was configured with the new seats which are fully flat and very comfortable although they lack a little space for more storage. Overhead space is good anyway. Seat is narrow but well design. Screen is big and inflight entertainment good with a decent mix of International and Spanish films. Not as many selection as in Qatar, Singapore or Emirates but still good. Crew was friendly and efficient across flight. They also give you 5MB free of wifi connectivity. Overall an excellent flight

### "not in any way a "premium" experience"
Iberia Business Class: really an awful experience. We flew on a connecting business class flight from Madrid to Lisbon. Overall we were surprised to find that the aircraft was quite old - there was no entertainment system or wifi and seat space was minimal. The experience on the aircraft had nothing that would distinguish it from an economy flight as they received apparently the same food too. It really leaves some room for improvement there as the flight experience was not in any way a "premium" experience. The real bummer came upon arrival: our luggage apparently had been left behind in Madrid and the Iberia service staff were really terrible at speaking English so we ended up waiting at the airport without any information for 2 hours in the middle of the night. We were then promised delivery in the morning, but the luggage did not arrive until 16 hours later. That is without any apology or reimbursement. And don't even get me started on their online helpdesk - it is pretty much a waste of effort to write to them and good luck getting a straight answer out of these people. At that point I was really asking myself, why I had even bothered flying business class on Iberia, neither the inflight experience nor the following service experience are up to speed with any other airline I have recently flown on. Definently not a returning customer for Iberia.

### "seat spacing is too tight"
I was on the air shuttle (Puente Aéreo) service between Madrid and Barcelona, a service directed at business travelers who need full flexibility flights between the biggest two spanish cities. The service promises open ticket access to a constant stream of flights so you just hop on the next plane (and if that's full just wait for the next soon after). For this flexibility you pay a fairly hefty 373€ return (or 271€ one-way), quite a substantial premium over the high speed rail service on this short 500km hop. However if you need to fly in August little is left of this promise - in line with classic Madrid vacation season customs, Iberia slashes their schedule down to as little as 6 flights in a day, some with more than 5 hours between them. No online check-in is possible and self-check-in on regular machines at the airport is also refused. You need to just know that only the machines at the Air Shuttle area will accept your reservation identifier as that isn't explained anywhere. This is quite annoying as it rules out the possibility of locking down your seat while you're on the way to the airport. When I arrived, all (roughly a dozen) check-in machines were down showing a maintenance screen and the grumpy lady at the counter begrudgingly looked up my reservation. On board the elevated pricing only yields a comfort level one would expect from a low cost carrier. Seat spacing is too tight for passengers taller than 180cm, using skinny plastic-backed seat with no seat pocket. There are neither Wifi nor any in flight entertainment. Sandwiches and drink are only available for purchase, not even water is complimentary. Cleanliness on the plane left to be desired, with potato crisps and fresh chewing gum on the floor and an undefined sticky residue all over my tray table. Cabin crew also did not bother to come through collecting rubbish since they didn't manage to sell any sandwiches in my section. Overall I would only recommend this if you're in a serious hurry and your destination is quick to reach from the airport. Otherwise the train service will be just as fast and offer better service and value.

### "fast, impersonal, no smile"
Frankfurt - Madrid. First flight out of FRA for Iberia. Check-in was slow and full loaded. Even if you’re doing online check-in you need to queue. There is no certain baggage drop-off counter. Boarding also was very chaotic. We had to change our pre chosen seats twice for no obvious reason. The comfort inside of the Airbus was standard. Seats were good for the 2 hours hop. Service wasn’t included. The flight however was safe and disregarding the fact, that no one of the flight crews speaks understandable English, we arrived into Madrid on-time. Madrid - Lima flight was done by A340-600. The transit in MAD is smart. We arrived with no rush at the gate. Boarding this time was quick. First impression of the cabin was good with acceptable seats in 2-4-2 configuration. Apparently Iberia improved their long-haul product a lot. Personal TV was available and the selection was absolutely sufficient. Again English announcements were very hard to understand. The Captain did not even do an announcement in English. This might be an issue in the case of an emergency. Service was Iberia still. Fast, impersonal, no smile and as a passenger you get the feeling to have to excuse for any request. The flight was smooth and we arrived safely in LIM ontime. Lima - Madrid - this flight was a nightmare. Same issues as on the way to LIM. Additional we had an 4,5 hour delay due to late arrival. No one of Iberia apologized for the delay. Departure in LIM finally at 1am. Vouchers or any sign of customer focus? Not with Iberia. Finally airborne the crew was good-humored among themselves. Towards the passengers in consideration of the heavy delay it was just beyond words. Never undergo such an ignorant and arrogant crew. In MAD we expected to receive our new ticket for the late flight to FRA as we missed the actually booked connection to FRA. And again Iberia surprises you. Tomorrow 8am”. That’s all what the ground staff has to tell you. Furthermore you receive Spanish documents only and need to translate them with google translator. Finally we had received a hotel voucher as they were not able to arrange a connection flight the same day. Iberia in short words – rude, unreckonable and nerve-racking.

### "good and punctual experience"
Zurich to Madrid. A good and overall punctual experience. Friendly attention from the crew, Even I offered them to change my meal in order to please another customer, they didn't want to do so. That's one thing I found very special since other Iberia crews did more appreciate my humble way.

### "very friendly attention"
A very good experience - excellent service and very friendly attention! However, it has to be said that there were only 1 1/2 half rows of Business class to be served and there was no problem among the customers for the Business Class meal choice.

### "good attendance to all customers"
A very good experience flying Iberia from Madrid to Zurich - the crew even remembered the Swiss National Holiday and they made sure to lower the cabin lights in order to enjoy the fireworks over Switzerland. Good attendance to all customers. The only point to mention is the delay, especially where Iberia claims to be the most punctual airline in Europe.

### "good quality of service and meals"
Good experience overall flying Iberia from Zurich to Madrid. Good quality of service and meals. However, departure was delayed and baggage delivery in Madrid took a long time. The aircraft had been in service since 1999 and some bits had been fixed only by tapes.

### "never to fly with Iberia again"
We flew with Iberia Business Class from Panama to Biarritz France, via Madrid on the 25th July. Only one of our suitcases arrived at the airport at our final destination. We submitted a claim for the lost bag and today, 5 days later we still do not have our suitcase. Iberia call centre has been unrelentingly unhelpful and unapologetic, I have called every day several times, each time they tell me different information. I have been told the bag is in Madrid, Toulouse and even several times the operator insisted that the bag had been delivered to our address by courier ! I can not believe anything this airline tells me. I am very upset that we do not have our bag with all our personal things. I can't believe how Iberia don't care, their operators are blasé and most importantly do nothing to find my bag. Iberia Business class is old, old seats, worn, old TV monitors, choice of perhaps 6 films on the flight, food is average. The hostess seemed quite put out when we made a request to them, doesn't seem to be in the company manifesto to care for their customers on any level. I will do everything I can never to fly with Iberia again.

### "lack of sufficient Iberia personnel"
We arrived at the Iberia Check-In line at 06.50 on July 7 for an 08.45 domestic flight. Two adult passengers + 2 pet-in-cabin. There were about 200 people in line waiting to check in, but only 4 Iberia employees working at the check-in counter. After 80 minutes (1 hour and 20 minutes) we arrived at the counter (08.10) and were told that check-in was closed. We were denied boarding. We were told we could be put on a wait list for the 17.55 pm flight but with no guarantee to get on the flight. This problem was caused by an insufficient number of Iberia personnel checking people in. Also, at 08.00, three Iberia employees left their stations and were not replaced until 08.10. We were traveling with an elderly passenger who was not feeling well. We could not wait all day and take the chance of again being denied boarding on the 17.55 flight. We rented a car and departed immediately for Malaga. We arrived by car at 15.20. We missed our flight due to the lack of sufficient Iberia personnel to check-in everyone in the line.

### "process was fast and efficient"
Flew from Madrid to Dusseldorf. I have to say that I am impressed with Iberia. They have improved a lot. I was surprised how the crew handled boarding being pro active helping people stowing their bags in the overhead racks. Something not common in Europe. The boarding process was fast and efficient. The cabin crew were smiling during all the flight. I am really impressed by Iberia improvement. The only bad point is the seat pitch.

### "the cabin crew disappears"
Madrid to New York JFK. I flew regularly from Europe to South America, so far Iberia has always been one of my first choices even if I never had great expectations of this airlines in economy class due to its very poor service. The flight attendants were not friendly or caring. There is no welcome drink on board, meal service is rushed after take-off. Before landing a small snack is served and between the two services the cabin crew disappears. If you are thirsty, walk to the end of the plane where you can serve yourself something. No extra mile is done by the crew in terms of caring about guests on board. Quantity of food served little and quality is not good either. This time  my flight experience has been worse than what I expected. It was the first time I was on an Iberia plane with the new individual IFE which is a very good product: big touch screens, user friendly, lots of choice. The problem was that my IFE was broken, an electrical problem made it impossible to view a movie or listen to music as there were continuous interruptions. As my screen was broken, so were also those of my neighbors, the row in front and the row behind. So it was an electrical problem affecting various seats where I was. When I complained to the purser, he took my complain personaly and started to shout at me in front of passengers. They tried 2 times to restart the system but nothing changed. So I couldn't enjoy the IFE during my flight. Towards the end of the flight I stood up to go to the toilet and by walking around I realized that there were at least 20 free seats in the economy class cabin. I felt really frustrated because the flight attendant didn't offer me another seat with an IFE which was working properly. They just let you there with the problem, hoping that you accept the problem and don't start complaining again.

### "very attentive service"
Flight from Madrid to Zurich on time (as usual with Iberia). Aircraft in good shape, cleanliness could be better (toilet for Business class cabin has not been cleaned well before departure, I finally did my best for the following passenger - unbelievable). Very attentive service, good food and beverage selection.

### "provided a very poor service"
Our flight from Venice to Madrid was delayed and we just caught the connecting flight to Barcelona. Unfortunately, our luggage did not get loaded on the same flight and it was sent on the next available flight, two hours later. When we arrived at Barcelona and realised the luggage was not with us, we were told it would be delivered to our hotel that night. That did not happen and we were sent a text later that evening saying it would be delivered between 9am and 4 pm the following day. (I am writing this review on that evening, trusting we will get our luggage tomorrow). Our luggage should never have been sent on a separate flight - the airline has provided a very poor service and has left us with the inconvenience of not having our luggage for most of our short visit to Barcelona. If you fly with Iberia, I would definitely suggest you allow plenty of time for any connecting flights because the airline does not seem competent enough to provide a proper service.

### "Business Class cabin excellent"
Having landed in Madrid after a four hour flight from Helsinki, I made my way to the Iberia lounge in Terminal 4S before this Madrid to Buenos Aires flight. In good time before the rush before all flights due to depart at midnight, it was nearly empty, with plenty of space around and with wonderful views over the mountains and the runway. Food and drinks selection was excellent, although I preferred to wait for dinner on board, just to make the following night seem shorter. The boarding started with Priority passengers, with a separate jetbridge to the A340. For some reason, we were stuck there for a long while, before being able to enter the plane. When embarking, it was obvious that cabin crew was in the middle of preparing the plane, which seemed rather odd, bearing in mind that the aircraft had landed in Madrid a long time ago. I was pleased to find my single seat next to the window with plenty of space for storage and to move around. Soon, a glass of sparkling wine, menus and a well-stocked amenity kit was offered; containing standard socks, eyeshades, earplugs, shoe bag, lip balm, moisturiser and a brush. After take-off on time, there was a long wait until the service started with hot towels and an apéritif, which was a bit annoying, especially at this time of the night For my dinner I had sea bass, which was the best I’ve had on an airplane: crispy and juicy with an awesome mix of vegetables Best of all, Iberia boasts a great selection of Spanish wines and the crew even suggested to compare various wines Excellent choice of films on the IFE with a large screen, although I soon decided it’s time to go to sleep The full-size bed of Iberia Business Class guaranteed me a full night sleep. Before the excellent breakfast I just had time to check my e-mails thanks to a well functioning wifi. All in all, an excellent flight, the Iberia Business Class cabin is excellent and so is their food & beverage offering. The cabin crew is very professional and easily approachable at all times.

### "luggage did not reach destination"
Seville to Porto via Barcelona. We booked our tickets with Iberia but it was operated by Vueling. Our luggage did not reach the destination after more than 60 hours so far and nobody could answer for that through either airline. Porto ground staff people have been very helpfull but there is nothimg they can do about it. We were left without clothes, necessities and medication and there is not a phone number with someone able to help us. Very frustating and damage our amazing trip trough Spain/Portugal.

### "no complimentary soft drinks or food"
Flight from Düsseldorf to Madrid and back with Iberia. Very narrow seats, no complimentary soft drinks or food. Staff was unfriendly and snobbish, especially to not spanish speaking persons. On the flight back to Duesseldorf i had to check in my hand luggage afterwards, just beforde getting boarded (size and weight of the luggage was totally correct!). I and many other passengers were told in a very rude way that there is not enough space in the airplane because the flight was fully booked (really astonishing). Entering the plane, there was enough space in the overhead locker, so that it would have been no problem for placing my luggage somewhere. Staff seemed to be very unmotivated to make the flight comfortable for their passengers. During the flight there were no information given about the current flight status and estimated arrival time or weather or anything else.

### "were allocated distant seats"
Madrid to Barcelona. Iberia went from being an A class airline to comparing to the cheapest airlines in a mere couple of years. My husband and I bought a flight together and even though we checked in online timely we were allocated distant seats. A seat change had a 20€ charge. At the airport we asked to be seated together and were "punished" with the non-reclinable last row seats. Afterwards we were prized with a 2:30 hours delay due to which we lost the possibility to use public transportation services at the destination and had to pay a late check in fee at the hotel. The cherry on top were unhelpful and rude staff.

### "Business Class is a joke"
I booked a BA flight but it ended up being on Iberia at 6pm on a Sunday. Business Class is a joke - really old plane, food was inedible and the staff didn't care. Don't waste your money. I took another flight from Madrid to Lisbon some eight days later in Economy and it was a jam-packed flight in the middle of the say - it was passable with a much newer plane. The lounge at Madrid is quite decent - not the best airport though.

### "new interior and excellent IFE"
Lima to Madrid. After many years without any IFE at all I hesitated to fly Iberia transatlantic. But with a ticket at very low cost I gave it a try. The A340-600 I flew had a new interior, and excellent IFE. WiFi available at quite high cost. Leg room was limited, and catering quite basic. Crew were nice enough but not very enthusiastic. They would speak Spanish to everyone first, and only switch to English if you made clear not be able to understand them. I had a connecting flight with BA from Madrid on the same ticket, and I was surprised since both airlines work closely together neither at check in in Lima nor at Iberia transfer counters in Madrid could they provide a boarding pass for that BA connection. I had to get out of the airport and go to a check in desk for that.

### "unwilling to help it's customers"
Chicago to Granada via Madrid return. Traveling with Iberia was a huge hassle. Our flight home was delayed five hours and we had to run back and forth between American Airlines and Iberia to book a new flight. Also we were all given the same ticket to exchange at the Iberia desk for boarding passes. The attendant honored three tickets of the four of us, but made the last member of our party return to American Airlines. In the end we had to be escorted by an American Airlines attendant so he could discuss the issue for use. There was nothing wrong with the ticket and the attendant honored the ticket only when told to do so by another worker. Went we changed flights my vegetarian order was lost and I was given a meat meal which I could not eat. The flight attendants were never available so I could not flag one down to request a meal. Overall Iberia seems to be an incompetent airline who is extremely slow and often unwilling to help it's customers. Will not fly with them again if I can avoid it.

### "sometimes the only choice"
Santiago de Chile to Munich via Madrid. Check-In in Santiago de Chile: Quite fast, Ground staff does the best adjust the lines to regulate the flow of waiting passengers. A dedicated line for baggage drop-off for pre- checked in travellers was missing. Does not check through luggage from a national connecting flight of fellow one-world carrier LAN/LATAM overnight. Seating: Only automatic pre-assigned seats by the airlines reservation system for the lower price Economy booking classes. Charge a 33 Euro fee per seat if you want to change and probably more (didn't try) for exit row or front row seats. Intercontinental seating rather cramped. New thin seats aren't very comfortable. Entertainment: New, large back seat screens, good selection of new release films, all on demand. All controls via touch screen. Standard socket, so you can use your own headphones. Has USB and other sockets, if I remember right. Offer WIFI, but I didn't use it. Sorry, forgot, whether it was per hour or MB charged. Food: Surprisingly good, both in and out of its home base. Drink comes with food. No pre- and after dinner drink. Further water and juice mostly on demand-only. European connections are food and drink for sale only, IB was one of the first to do so. Service a bit grumpy, but ok. Arrival in Madrid: Fast passport control for EU citizens, not so much for everybody else. On May 2nd the train between T4 and T4s broke down, which led to a chaotic and cramped situation until a bus service had been organized. Wouldn't recommend IB for North America, but for South America it is sometimes the only choice or at a competitive price, especially if you have exotic national connections served by LATAM.

### "recommend to not fly"
Madrid to Rio de Janeiro economy class with Iberia. I would recommend to not fly with this airline. We know its economy and what to expect but the fact that it was a long journey flight we expected some sort of service. The staff were rude, we were served water twice (in small cups)  and when I asked I didn't get a bottle for at least 30 minutes. There was no personal inflight entertainment screens, just a main screen in the cabin and as I was sitting by the window I was unable to stretch my eyesight and see anything. It was the most uncomfortable long haul day flight I have ever taken.

### "never use Iberia again"
Buenos Aires to Madrid. Another cramped, uncomfortable long-haul Iberia flight with minimal and poor quality food and services. This 12 hour flight had the added distinction of being on an ancient plane effectively no inflight entertainment, unless you count a single old CRT monitor at the from of each cabin. Following a missed connection in Madrid on the outbound journey to Lat Am rushing from T4 to T4S, we managed to make this connection as we did not have to change terminals. Connection time was 1hr 25mins, but this was barely enough. We made the gate with seconds to spare. T4S is vast and we and several passengers had to run like crazy for a very long distance to make the gate in time. Such was the panic and stress that two of our fellow passengers did not even have time to put their shoes back on after removing them for security, and did the remainder of the run in their socks. I will never use Iberia again for long-haul or connect in Madrid.

### "the worst experience"
London Gatwick to Sao Paulo via Madrid. I take over 100 flights annually, and this was the worst experience for years. When Iberia sold me a flight with a 55 min connection time in Madrid, little did I realise that there was virtually no chance to make this. 2 hours should be the minimum in this nightmarish airport, especially between terminals. Not for the unfit or easily stressed. Normal flight from LGW to MAD, which landed about 8 mins late. I was assured by the flight crew that there should be no problem. Landed at Terminal 4. On disembarking we (family of 5) were directed to bus with a few other connecting passengers. Waited in the bus for 15 mins for no apparent reason. I didn't panic because we were in Iberia's hands and I felt sure the onward flight was held for us and the others. The bus journey took another 15 mins to get to T4S, which is very far away from T4. Barajas in massive and a terrible place to connect, especially if you have to connect. Instead of the bus taking us to the next gate, we were dropped at the entrance to T4S. We all ran like crazy the very long distance to Gate 37, through a vast and empty terminal, up and down badly signed stairs and escalators. We saw the gate in the distance and felt reassured. Plane was there, and ground crew were at the gate. We were denied boarding on the grounds that they shut the doors 15 mins before scheduled departure no matter what. We begged and argued for nearly 30 mins to open the gate no avail, during which time the plane stayed attached to the jetty. Staff were extremely rude, unsympathetic and unhelpful. We were sent to a hotel and put on a flight at midday the following day, making me miss a whole day of meetings, which had a knock-on effect on my Lat Am trip. No compensation offered. Flight to GRU characterised by cramped conditions, food extremely low in quality and quantity and surly service. Was shouted at for asking for a glass of water from a flight attendant. Never again will I use Iberia long-haul or connect in Madrid.

### "pleased with every aspect"
My wife and I flew Iberia yesterday from Los Angeles to Madrid. We chose the airline for the convenience of it being a non stop flight. We were very pleased with every aspect of the flight. The aircraft was new and there was obvious pride on the part of the crew. They were friendly, accommodating and very professional. The leg room in economy class was adequate (I am 6'2"). The food was as good as airline food can be. We had the choice of chicken or pasta and we both chose chicken. The aircraft offered personal entertainment for each passenger with plenty of options. There was a unique feature of a camera mounted on the tail of the plane showing the take off and landing - nice touch. Finally, we arrived 20 minutes early and our luggage came out on the carousel in a timely fashion.

### "nice crew both ways"
All flights perfectly on time. Nice A330 on the way out, a testing flight. Nice seat and full meal, which was very good. Only 2 red wines, but good enough. A321 on the way back, business cabin has economy seats with free seat in the middle. Meal was good too. Nice crew both ways. Lugage came quickly in GVA. Was on a connecting flight to and from Bogota with Avianca.

### "service superb"
Great flight/product from Iberia. Check in no lines, security thru priority lines. British Airways lounge at JFK very nice but a bit crowded. Boarding on time, very nice FA's. Once on board delayed because of technical problems. The pilot apologised several times and kept us informed. Finally departed 2 hours late. Service superb. FA's did their best, always with a smile. Food great, the best in years on Business Class. The seat feels very private. Could manage 4 hours spleep. Barajas easy to walk. Bags on belt a bit late.

### "training on customer service"
New York JFK to Madrid, and the flight was very average. The Iberia Flight attendants were more interested in each other than the passengers. Upon arrival I had a close transfer to Casablanca, as did others to various locations. Some of the passengers were provided a guide to assist them to their connecting flight. No one was available for me. I did ask for assistance and was told to run fast. I missed my connecting flight by 2 minutes and I lost my luggage for two days. On my return flight from Marrakech to Casablanca and then on to Madrid on April 14th, I lost the same luggage again for three days. I have all of my lost luggage documents as a "keepsake. Iberia has old aircraft and some newer aircraft. They have poor luggage handling, and generally poor service. They need training on customer service. My return trip from Madrid to JFK was a good flight with a very competent crew. My compliments. However, I will avoid this carrier in the future. My back ground is that I fly many airlines around the globe. I have traveled extensively for the past 36 years, and never complained or written a poor review until now.

### "no personal entertainment"
Panama to Munich via Madrid with Iberia was really bad. Really old plane and not well maintained - dirty toilets, dirty lights and seats and a lot of broken tables. No personal entertainment system at all. My girlfriend had to vomit a couple of times and the crew barely helped and was unfriendly.

### "old aircraft with worn seats"
Rio de Janeiro to London via Madrid with Iberia. Simply horrible. Old aircraft with seats so worn out that metal frame cuts into a back. Miniscule leg space, even for me and I am very short person, just below 1.60m. Everyone sat with their legs stretched into the aisle, so had to walk over the feet to the toilets. When someone in the cabin used overhead light it would lighten the whole cabin and wake up everyone around. No personal entertainment, just a shared TV at the front of the cabin with black patches on the screen. Absolute disgrace for the airline to be operating an aircraft so old, and on the long haul flights too. Especially considering that price they charge is the same as if no higher than other airlines that operate newer planes. I booked with them only because they are OneWorld Partners, but never again!

### "superb food, lovely staff"
A first class trip to and from Madrid and Havana with Iberia. Superb food, lovely staff, comfortable seats and great entertainment. This was as good as Cathay Pacific - what a surprise. If you get a chance to travel on the new planes take it. The Madrid business lounge is impressive too.

### "comfort quite good for economy"
Quite good experience on this flight from San Paulo to Madrid. Flight was delayed for 1 hour but arrived almost on time. Good service from Iberia at GRU airport as they satisfied my request to have a window seat - employee couldn't do it at checkin counter but a colleague did it at boarding counter on his own initiative. Aircraft was A340 with new cabin. Very good IFE with large choice of intl movies (in many languages and often with subtitles), games, music and WiFi (for a fee). Strangely, the screen cannot be titled which can be annoying. Seat inclination and comfort is quite good for economy. Lighting in the cabin can be improved to be more pleasing. Service during flight was polite and quiet responsive but lacks the eye-contact and could have been more smiling. Food and drinks were not bad. Very good communication from the captain.

### "good and attentive service"
Zurich to Madrid return, very good and attentive service, my flights with Iberia always on time. Good food and beverage quality on international flights in Europe, you get a full meal for a very reasonable fare in Business Class.

### "chaotic boarding situation "
Stockholm to Madrid. When boarding, the last third of the passengers embarking were told that they would have to check in their hand baggage since there was no space left in the cabin. This was a result of allowing the first two thirds of the passengers to embark with several pieces of luggage, some of which were also too large to be allowed as hand baggage. All this resulted in a bit of a chaotic situation which also delayed take off for at least half an hour. Seats had very little leg space and several passengers had to put their hand bagagge under the seats in front of them. Also the corridor was blocked by the crew with their carts with merchandise for sale during most of the flight. All of this made it very difficult or impossible for the passengers traveling in economy to get to the toilets and many of them had to use the toilets in business class.

### "comfortable seat, good legroom"
Madrid to Brussels. Fast check in and boarding, friendly crew. Comfortable seat, good legroom and clean aircraft. Safety instructions in Spanish, English and Belgian. Punctual. Good cabin climate. The snacks to buy onboard at good price and nice. Cheap ticket.

### "reliable, clean cabins"
Flew Iberia in Economy from Frankfurt to Madrid, departure marginally delayed, but this was caught up during the two hour flight. Cabin in Economy almost fully booked, did not see anybody flying in the business cabin. This flight showed that IB on this route has a good reputation as a LCC, reliable, clean cabins, up to date planes. When it comes to a more expensive and comfortable way of flying customers prefer other competitors like Lufthansa or LAN Chile. This Iberia flight was absolutely ok, I got what I paid for, but not a single drop of water in addition. The snack and beverage list showed a "hefty price level", so I did not invest any Cent in addition. Just a fair deal.

### "crew were friendly"
First time experience with Iberia, flying from Miami to Madrid. Crew were friendly and welcomed passengers. Announcements are made in Spanish and English. Level of English is good. Entertainment up to date, quite impressive selection of films latest and older, tv shows both US and UK ones and music. Wifi available on this aircraft although you have to pay for a limited usage. One thing I'd point out is that they do not do a round of drink service before they serve their meal which I find inappropriate for a transatlantic carrier. Food ok - nothing major but not as good as say Lufthansa - coffee and tea are served from the smallest cup you'll ever see. Apart from that, Iberia is ok middle of the road carrier. Would fly with them again if the price is right. One thing to add we have bought this flight as a codeshare of American. When you book Iberia as a codeshare with One world alliance you cannot check in online or choose your seat before 24 of your departure. As they do not process AA, BA pax until the 24hrs before the departure which is strange to me as AA and BA seems to do it on their codeshare flights between Europe and the US

### "lazy and disinterested"
The check in staff at Miami were rude and ignorant. It didn't get much better when we borded the aircraft. Not a smile from any of the staff members who were miserable for the entire flight. Food was pretty good to be fair but served with the same surly attitude as the ground crew. Despite the aircraft being the new (ish) A330, it was dirty and the seats were not comfortable at all. Two of the toilets were closed and out of use all flight leaving the others in a deplorable state mid flight. The crew did no further drink service until breakfast. They were lazy and disinterested for the entire flight. On a positive note the inflight entertainment was pretty good. Avoid Iberia unless you want to be treated like an inconvenience and watch out for the tutting when you dare to bother them for a glass of water.

### "lounge in Madrid better than usual"
Flew return from Brussels to Montevideo via Madrid. Usual check in with fast track and lounge in Bru, which is cleaner than in the past. Easy connecting airport train in Barajas Airport between terminals. Lounge in Madrid better than usual but needs revamping. Food okay. Onboard was the old business cabin layout. Hoping to get the new layout. Old A340 with old seats and tired crew. Food inedible. Neither intercontinental legs had the audio and IFE working properly. Many passengers complained and Head Purser understood this and said she was sorry. . Some compensation avios were given in order to compensate.

### "economy was dreadful"
Madrid to Miami with Iberia has been one of the worst flights I have ever experienced. A330-300 was excellent as was the in-flight entertainment however the service in economy was dreadful. There was no bar service unless you went to the back of the plane and asked for a drink and only once during the 10 hours 30 mins flight did the crew come around with water but you had to stop them to be served. The only time that the crew cleared in was after the meal service therefore the cabin was strewn with cups, cans, wrappers etc. the cabin was like a tip. Not once were the toilets cleaned and they were in a disgusting state. The cabin was very cold and the crew did nothing to improve the temperature within the cabin despite numerous requests. Most people wore their jackets/coats and/or had blankets around them for much of the flight. The all-female cabin crew were surly (apart from one lady) and other than delivering the meal tray and selling tax free goods, did absolutely nothing in the way of service or attending to passengers. We were sat in 27A/C and observed the crew going to their rest area carrying their blankets and pillows with them. I have no issues whatsoever with flight crews having breaks on such long flights but they weren't doing any work anyway so had little need of a break. I can only say that I am disgusted with the abysmal lack of service, abruptness of the crew and the fact that Iberia is part of the same company as British Airways, they are dreadful. The flight deck spoke once to the passengers shortly after take-off to, in a few words tell us to turn off our mobile devices and then just before landing to give the weather. I now have to look forward to the flight back on Iberia which I will be dreading. In future I will plan my trips from Spain to the USA either on American carriers, who from experience are ten times better than Iberia, or travel via the UK or Europe on known quality airlines. I am a frequent flyer having flown with numerous carriers, long and short haul and I can't emphasise enough how bad this Iberia experience has been. So when travelling long-haul economy, unless you want to travel in a flying, refrigerated garbage can with filthy toilets and no cabin service, fly Iberia. If you want to be relaxed and enjoy the flying experience choose any carrier other than Iberia.

### "most horrible flight"
Quito to London via Madrid with Iberia. The most horrible flight. You can choose your seat if you pay 45USD to begin with. I was not informed that my flight had a 1.5 hour stopover in Guayaquil. My seat would not stay upright, it would gradually lean backwards annoying me and the passenger behind me. No individual entertainmentent but dated curved screens TV monitors of the 80s, one set per 40 passengers. Food was little and not good. I want to say that fortunately the cabin crew was very polite.

### "shall now choose Iberia"
I flew Iberia from Madrid to Havana on 29 January returning on 9 February, and on the basis of my experience I shall now choose Iberia with these business class seats over BA and Virgin whenever possible. The flexibility of the table, availability of storage and the rake of the seat have all won me over. The food was also superb. I didn't use the IFE apart from tracking the flight progress and I am not sure it can be wholly controlled from the handset. A flight attendant was unable to demonstrate how to make final selections on the IFE. A token for 4mb of complementary wifi which could only be used by a smartphone and not by an iPad was distributed and worked with my iPhone. Paid for wifi was available. The crew were slow to serve water or drinks after boarding on both legs compared with BA, but were otherwise charming and helpful. I used to fly frequently with Virgin. I then developed a preference for BA seats but now I shall use Iberia business when possible until I can find other airlines with comparable seats. I connected to these flights from an Iberia/BA codeshare economy flight from London. Outbound my case failed to make the fllght from Madrid and arrived more than 36 hours late in Havana.

### "crew were very friendly"
Flew Iberia from Madrid to London Heathrow. Pre-boarded aircraft and took up our seats in 3A and 3C. Very good space, middle seat left empty as per other European Carriers, which gave a good level of space. Newspapers were offered before take off. Crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Drinks offered just after take off, and every 20 mins during the flight. Lunch served just after take off. The meal very good. Salad and dressing, Chicken with Mango and Rocket stuffing served with a barley and mushroom risotto. Followed by Cheese and Bread and Chocolate Mousse. Departed on time and landed ahead of schedule.

### "clean and very comfortable"
Flew Iberia from London Heathrow to Madrid. Boarded aircraft by the business class gate and were given a warm welcome and shown to our seats. Jackets were taken and given head sets. The aircraft looked very new, clean and very comfortable. The crew were very friendly throughout the flight and attentive. The on-board entertainment was excellent with new released films available as well as music and TV shows. Wifi was also available to purchase during the flight. The breakfast was serve soon after take off, which was a little odd as it was 12 noon by the time we left Heathrow. But the meal was very good. Crew offered drinks and tea and coffee throughout the flight. The seat was amazingly comfortable and would recommend this aircraft, fully lie flat seat.

### Iberia customer review
Once again a bad experience flying a long haul flight with Iberia from Buenos Aires to Madrid. The old A340-300 has not been refurbished. Seat 5A. Part of the interior upholstery was torn. The pillow was not wrapped in the usual plastic bag, obviously it had been used by someone else since it was not clean. No individual IFE. The small screen in front had a white line in the middle. My headset plug did not work properly. Food was bad, the lasagne was inedible. The girl next to me had reserved vegetarian food which she did not get. She was offered the pasta which had pieces of ham in it. The only good thing was punctuality. I hope they improve the service.

### "service more like Ryanair"
Iberia costs are similar to British Airways, however the service is more like Ryanair. Flew from London Heathrow to Madrid and water was not even offered onboard for free. British Airways flights sometimes are operated by Iberia however there is inferior service is provided compared to BA flights. Why pay for British Airways service and get a lowcost service instead?

### "very bad experience"
San Jose to Madrid, and rude and unfriendly Iberia staff who didn't want to be there. You wave to wave to get their attention, and make sure your sentences are short and effective because there is a high chance the staff disappears before you complete the sentence. Extremely bad service. 10 hour flight. Not enough food, no possibility to buy more. My IFE screen didn't work the whole flight and they didn't worry about it after I reported it at least 7 times. Very bad experience.

### "FA's very nice on board"
Flew Iberia from Madrid to New York JFK. Check in at Madrid airport was fast, no lines. Fast track for security and I was at the lounge 15 min after arriving at the airport. Lounge nice, breakfast buffet with lots of hot and cold choices. Boarding on time. Priority boarding line empty. FA's very nice on board. Window seat feels very private and comfy. Great IFE, but limited choices compared to other airlines. Good selction of movies. Great on board selection of wines and lunch. Got a good rest on an 8hr flight. Arrival in JFK T7, not my favorite terminal but fine. On a taxi 40 min after arrival to the city.

### "service has been improved"
Athens to Rio de Janeiro return via Madrid with Iberia. All flights on time, crew smart looking and good service provided. Food and drinks provided on the long haul flights, nothing served on the medium haul ones, but available to be purchased. Smooth transit in Madrid Barajas T4. Seems like the service has been improved a lot. Pretty well organized and orderly embarcation of the aircraft. Good flight information provided by the captain. Impressive in flight entertainment system on the A330. Can't really fault Iberia on my recent trip.

### "$45 to select a seat"
New York to Alicante via Madrid return on Iberia. It's robbery for an airline to ask for an additional $45 to select a seat, especially when a passenger can be responsible to check in online. I prefer a seat with a wall behind me since I'm not a fan of touch screens on the backs of seats. Needless to say, the flight over got me no sleep as the person behind me played a quick tap game all night long. The almost non-existent leg room added to the misery of an uncomfortable flight. I had been hoping that the chaotic departure gate boarding in JFK would be the only disappointment. Thankfully, the return to the US was better. On that flight, I appreciated how the pilots kept us informed of the extra hour we'd need to fly in order to have a much smoother flight. The attendants also seemed more willing to be friendly on that leg of the journey.

### "definitely fly again"
Chicago to Madrid with Iberia business class. Excellent service, nice design of Business cabin and seats. Food is below average though. Decent amenity kit. Limited internet usage for free. Nice shower and breakfast upon arrival at the arrival lounge at Barajas airport of Madrid. I would definitely fly again.

### "nothing to brag about"
I flew Iberia from New York to Madrid. The check-in at the BA terminal was very efficient for JFK, which is always congested and inefficient. And that’s where the positive surprises stopped. When I boarded the A330-300, it  feels crammed. Sat down in my biz class seat and found the seat to be very dirty. There were crumbs and small pieces of garbage on the floor, my IFE headset was very greasy when I pulled it out of the holder, as if it hadn’t been wiped. Given how short this night flight is (6.5 hours) I wanted to have a good meal and a good, quick, rest. The presentation of the menu looked very promising. Fresh design with great options. The taste however wasn’t that extraordinary, aside from the Spanish wine which I loved. The seat is also a bit awkward. It’s slightly on the short side for my 190cm body. There is very little storage space and is a tad narrow. IFE was good and easy to use, but with not many options. Overall, I was expecting much more from Iberia. Everything, from the seat, the plane, the service, the catering, the entertainment options is middle-of the road. Not terrible, but definitely nothing to brag about.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Pleasantly surprised with recent Iberia flights from Bogota to Madrid return. Despite the fact that in Bogota the inbound plane was late because of the weather, the outbound flight managed to land on time in Madrid Barajas. The price was good for the high season, planes are modern and have an excellent entertainment system, Food was OK, wine for free, flight attendants ever present. Would consider flying with Iberia again.

### "food and service was good"
This was my first time flying to Israel on an airline not named El Al. What have I been missing all this time? This Iberia flight from Madrid to Tel Aviv was punctual, food and service was good (even with a special meal) and the AVOD entertainment system had a very good selection and an ample-sized screen for economy class. All told, a very good experience. I would definitely fly Iberia again, and I certainly would recommend them over El Al, even though it requires a stop in Madrid.

### "very friendly staff"
Madrid to Bogota. Second round-way flight on the new Iberia Business class cabin. On the outbound flight everything went perfect: fast check-in and luggage drop off, fast security control thanks to fast track service, nice VIP lounge in Madrid Barajas T4. Onboard very friendly staff. The food was excellent (for a plane) and so was the wine selection. The seat was very comfortable. The only negative things were the WiFi (unstable and expensive. The free 4MB ticket was not enough) and the IFE choice (very limited). On the inbound flight the food was less good but fair enough. In both flights we were on time even if the departure was delayed.

### "FA's were charming "
Madrid to Manchester. The leg room is tight but the design of the seatback pocket gives a few more centimetres and the seat itself is relatively comfortable. Iberia was cheaper than Ryanair on the same route, and the price we paid included 23kg of hold luggage and two pieces of hand baggage each. Iberia ground staff at both baggage drop and boarding were curt and impatient, you now have to print your own luggage tags and a surly, scowling monolingual matron barking orders doesn't ease the rather complicated procedure. However, once onboard, FA's were charming and had excellent language skills in Spanish and English; although their failure to ensure that passengers switched off electronic devices and had their window blinds up during take-off and landing gives cause for concern - moreover several passengers near to us had coats and bags on their laps during take-off. Fifty minute delay departing due to air traffic congestion, but only twenty minutes late landing into Manchester. Expensive and limited buy onboard food and drink service.

### "won't be flying Iberia"
Manchester to Montevideo via Madrid. I booked the flights early in the year and a few months later Iberia changed the longhaul flight schedule and my original dates were no longer possible. Rebooking was a big hassle and the first person I had to change the reservation was useless, the second one a bit better but I ended up having to cut my trip short 3 days. Flight from LHR to MAD was in a super plane but then we got on the long distance flight from Madrid to Montevideo and it was all downhill from there. My seat was broken and I basically sat on a metal pole for 13 hours. On the way back same old plane and my seat was broken again, this time I couldn't recline. This time they showed a couple of films but like on the flight to Montevideo no flight information. Food was poor on both trips and on the MAD to LHR route we even had to pay. Nobody walked through with drinks on the long haul -  you had to get out and get things yourself and climb over sleeping passengers to get out. On the way there the steward was nice but on the return flight the steward was rude and told off my little girl for going to the toilet and made her cry. The connection to Manchester on return was also bad - 3 hours connection time in LHR for the 30 min trip to Manchester after already travelling 17 hours. I liked getting the gates for the connecting flights texted to my phone but guess all the other big airlines do that too now. So next time I go to South America I won't be flying Iberia. It was the cheapest option to get to Montevideo at the time but now I wished I spent a bit more for better planes/service.

### "avoiding from now on"
Iberia changed my flight 3 times, would not offer a refund, only offered me airline credit. Submitted a complaint, 3 months later no response. Legroom was terrible and I was asked to pay 10 euros for food which was already included in my ticket. I was also asked to pay 30 euros to check in my bag on my first flight, but it quite clearly said on my ticket and booking confirmation that it was included! I had to go and find wifi in the airport to download my booking confirmation and then wait in the queue again. I showed the check-in assistant who looked and just said "oh ok then, sorry". My return flights were with BA which were significantly better,  and no ridiculous charges for food or luggage. However it is my understanding that Iberia and BA are in fact the same company, so I'll be avoiding both from now on and I recommend you do the same.

### "everything was fantastic"
I am normally travel in business class but this time I came back to Sao Paulo in Iberia economy. I have to say that everything was fantastic. A good seat, a new plane ,very nice hostess and very nice food. Really was very surprised and have to say that it was fantastic. The only thing a very impolite ground floor staff where I changed my seat.

### "product becoming very good"
New York JFK to Madrid. Iberia business product is becoming very good. Check in very fast, no lines. Fast track at JFK, in the lounge short after 15 minutes of arriving at the terminal. Boarding on time, nice cabin staff on Iberia. Pre-departure drinks and magazines. Purser introduced herself short after seating. Hot towels and menus fast, since a 6 hour nigth flight to Madrid, they serve dinner quickly. Very nice meal and wine selection. Breakfast before arrival, but did not taste it, most of us sleeping. Asked for and expreso 20 min before landing and no problem. Arrival 30 min before schedule time.

### "decent hot breakfast was served"
Lisbon to Brussels via Madrid. Iberia uses the horrible Blue lounge at Lisbon airport : dirty place, old damaged chairs and poor food and drinks. We do not have ice" paper message was attached on the door. Lisbon to Madrid is a short flight, decent hot breakfast was served with hot croissants and friendly flight attendants. Iberia lounge in Madrid was good, ample choice of drinks, also wines and some decent food. Madrid to Brussels difficult boarding of a nearly full A321 - departure caused a delay of some 25 minutes. Plane was clean, no pre take off drink, but a  hot meal was served with 2 choices. A friendly but rather slow service and a second drink must be requested, however Spanish digestives were available, served out of full size bottles. Arrival with some 10 minutes delay. Luggage delivered after some 15 minutes

### "seats the worst I've ever seen"
Amsterdam to Lagos via Madrid. My first time with Iberia and probably also only time. The flight to Madrid was ok, but the seats were the worst I've ever seen, so small I could never fit (I'm close to 2 meters tall). I've never experienced this before - there was just no way that I could fit between 2 seats. After complaining I got an empty seat next to me in a different row, but I can't imagine the horror it must have been if this wasn't an option. Next to the poor seats, the aircraft was very dated, there was no entertainment at all, no flight info, nothing. They also did not check any carry on luggage, which meant people took enormous bags with them that would never fit in the overhead spaces, resulting in bags being squeezed between empty seats. Crazy! On the way back from Lagos this was even more extreme; they 'kind of tried' to stop people with more than 2 huge carry on bags, but again it was chaos inside the half empty aircraft (bags everywhere). Never again!

### "plane new and clean"
Bogota to Madrid, economy with added extra legspace seats. Online-check-in didn't work for me. Check-in at airport and boarding chaotic. Allow to be at BOG 3 hours before departure. Plane new and clean. Good individual entertainment-system (mine had to be restarted all 30 mins). Sat for 90 mins in plane after scheduled departure, and no apology by captain. Attendants didn't pay attention to passengers. Arrived 50 mins late into MAD. Will not book them anymore.

### "staff not very friendly but professional"
Staff not very friendly but professionnal, great flight safety (the pilot made announcements to reassure the passengers if necessary: turbulences, delays etc..). The plane took off late but we arrived on time. Service on the ground is not great in Madrid. Food was ok, seats a little small but nothing unusual for such a price, and best of all: we forgot our tablet on a plane and they sent it back to us. Cheap and really ok, I recommend if comfort isn't your priority.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Online Check in wasnt possible. Check in at Iberia counter in BCN very quick and professional. Boarding a bit chaotic, but in time. Seat-space for 1,90ms very tight, but for 1,5 hours was okay. Drinks and food like low-cost airlines, just for payment. Anyway for 1.5 hours possible to stay without. Flight on time. Just one thing disturbing - staff is really very weak in its abilities in English. Not understandable at all. Plane clean and looked well maintained. Pleasantly surprised about them.

### "book them definitely again"
Booked 3 months in advance and 520 EUR per person are reasonable for flights to BOG. So we added even prebooked seats at exist rows (35-65 EUR per flight and person) - highly recommendable! Iberia-flights to non-Schengen starting in MAD at satellite Terminal T4S - not very convenient to reach - plan extra time - min 15 mins compared to T4! Boarding in groups, however, in reality completely chaotic - no announcements, so everybody pressed himself to the gate. Because of that departure 20 mins delayed. Seats at exit row very pleasant, this A340-600  had the new entertainment system. Individual screens, a lot of movies, even in german. Offering also Wifi and connectivity for also reasonable prices (but didn't try). Meals tasty (one dinner - choice: meat,chicken or vegetable) and two snacks and drinks without limitation. Arrived in BOG with 30 mins delay due to heavy winds over Atlantic - however, unexpected relaxed and felt well. Will book them definitely again to south-America!

### "about as good as it gets"
Iberia economy class from Chicago to Madrid. Seat numbers 14L/14K. The flight was completely full. Pretty good seats, knee room was adequate, but not generous. The plane left about 30 minutes late. The flight crew was so, so, served a dinner and disappeared. Mostly a night flight, so most people were sleeping. I wished they should have served some beverage and water, periodically. The atmosphere was very dry. The seats were fairly comfortable, the entertainment system had a good selection of recent movies to watch. I made the return flight three weeks later in October on the same type of A330 aircraft. Seats 11L/11K. There was less knee room on this flight, for some reason. The flight crew was much more attentive and friendly. This was a day flight, so they served a lunch. We also had a sandwich wrap before landing. There were several beverage services. All in all a pretty good flight, very smooth, and landed twenty minutes early. The price paid was reasonable compared to other airlines. Comparing this flight to other European flights, I have taken recently, it was about as good as it gets in current economy class.

### "good experience for European flight"
I flew recently with Iberia from Brussels to Malaga and back via Madrid. As the international and domestic legs are different products, I report here about the first and fourth segments, both operated with an A320 the middle seats unoccupied in business class. I got a very decent rate for discounted business class and it was a good experience for a European flight. The planes were in good shape internally, and the crews were as should be. BRU-MAD was delayed by 30 minutes because they had to unload the bags of two passengers who missed the flight, whereas MAD-BRU was on time. The delay on the first leg had no impact for me, as my connection in MAD was a very long one. And this connection was a pleasant one in both directions, the Iberia lounge at T4 MAD is equal or better than what can be found in competing hubs. There was ample legroom in the front section of the cabin, and the seats were okay, even if their recline is limited. I can do without IFE as long as there is enough space to work on my computer. Both flights from and to BRU  offered the best warm meals I had in the last ten years on a European flight of such duration. A menu card was provided, and the choice was meat or pasta. I had a veal hamburger one way and a steer eye fillet steak the other way, with a quality and a quantity you expect on a long haul flight. They came with a salad, cheese, cake, and there was also a good selection of decent airline wines, followed by coffee and cognac. My suitcase was not on the carousel at my arrival in Malaga because they had left it in Brussels. I reported thus to their missing bags office. I was first told that my suitcase was in Mallaga, and I wasted time queuing before filling a form and getting neither an explanation (except that the bag was still in Brussels), nor any sort of assistance. They promised it would be delivered “manana”, but this translated at the end into a two-day delay. This was under the unpleasant physical pressure of a Guardia Civil member they called because another passenger was complaining loudly for the same reason, and I filled a complain in writing about the event. At the time of writing this back in Belgium (seven days later), I am still waiting to hear from Iberia customer service department about my claim and written request for compensation. On the phone they just told me that they will reimburse my expenses (but did not explain how), and I shall not push the matter further because the amount of what I bought is far below the value of my time to get a problematic refund.

### "crew were nice and helpful"
When I reached Bilbao Airport, there is no one queuing for check-in, so I could get my Iberia boarding pass within 1 minute. Passed the security in another 1 minute and took quite a while to find the lounge. The lounge is the only one in Bilbao airport, there was not much people when I arrived at 11am. Food choices are limited but quite a large variety or drinks and alcohol. When it was 40 min before departure, there was a long queue already. I could hardly find a sign showing queue for priority boarding. Eventually the IB staff just started boarding without inviting Business Class and OW Priority Members to get on board first. After airborne, a cold and small wrap was served with drinks. Passengers could enjoy a wide range of drinks including alcohol. Crews were nice and arrived Madrid in an hour. After 1.5 hour in Madrid Airport, I needed to go to the T4S for boarding my flight to London Heathrow. The queue in the immigration was terribly long and I was so rushed that it was only 10 min prior to my boarding. Priority boarding was given this time, and the A340 aircraft was incredible for short haul flight. Very soon after airborne, meals was served with 2 choices (Steak or Pasta). Drinks choices are up to long haul flights standard. They did drink run more than 5 times in this 2.5 hour journey. The seat was very good which could turn to a lie-flat bad. Entertainment is so-so with limited choices of movies. Crew were nice and helpful too.

### "no personal entertainment system"
We quoted for an upgrade to business on our Zurich to Quito trip, highest bid as possible. We did not get the upgrade; a couple flying with us got it and they bid for the same amount. Business class was not full! Web check-in failed. Hotline agents are unfriendly and incompetent and I got cut off twice! Check-in at the airport was a nightmare - it took each couple more than 30 minutes since they messed up our bookings. I still have an e-Mail inquiry pending - handed in 2 months ago - they just don't care. The airplane was old and we did not have a personal entertainment system - the flight was 11 hours, full of screaming kids, food was terrible, service was poor.

### "staff weren't so friendly"
The business class seats reclined only as much as Economy. We received a drink and snack, but were given more on request. We had priority boarding and disembarking as well as our bags being tagged as priority. They took a long time to come out but quick Business Class check in. We had only the seat between us empty, not a proper business class seat. The staff weren't so friendly. We got from A to B which was the main thing. Everything was BA at Heathrow, check in, lounge, boarding staff etc.

### "food was very expensive"
We booked these Iberia flights through BA and I assumed the same level of service. Staff were rude, safety demonstration was only done in Spanish and food was very expensive and inedible. I didn't see a member of the cabin crew crack a smile once. Only plus, was that on the return flight they had a good system by which you could watch a few select BBC shows through your iPhone.

### "don’t pay for the XXL seats"
We are a family of four and booked our summer holiday in August from Munich to Costa Rica back in February. We specifically chose Iberia, because we could get XXL seats for all of us at 260 Euros extra. Since my husband and I are both very tall, we need the extra legroom on the long flight. We got the seats 25 G/H/J/L confirmed for the flight to Costa Rica and the return. Unfortunately we did not get the seats on the first flight and no reason was given. In the plane we found out that only two of the seats would have been XXL seats anyway (25 J/L), because they are at the emergency exit. The seats 25 G/H have exactly the same legroom as every other seat in the plane, but were charged to us as XXL anyway. Once we arrived in Costa Rica I called Iberia and asked if we could at least get the two XXL seats on the flight back. I was told that of course we would definitely get those seats. On the return flight, we did not get the seats however. The answers were always the same: “I don’t know how this happened, but I cannot do anything, it is a different department that is responsible, I can’t do anything about it, but in Madrid you will get your money back.” Anyone who is tall knows that XXL seats are not about getting money back but about having more legroom on a 10-hour flight. On the way back we spend two days in Madrid. When we checked in for the flight back home to Munich, we were at the airport 3 hours before the departure time. Iberia told us that unfortunately that was too late, and only my husband and my daughter could fly, whereas my son and I would have to stay another night in Madrid, because the plane was overbooked. Booking and paying a flight 8 months ahead of time, reserving seats and being at the airport 3 hours before the departure time is obviously not enough to guarantee you any seat at all in an Iberia plane, never mind the one that you booked. I was told that we would have had to do the online check-in 24 hours before the flight, like everyone else. I am usually not online when I am on holidays, so I did not receive the email with the online checkin data. If you are planning to fly Iberia, don’t pay for the XXL seats since you won’t get them anyway and carry your laptop with you so you can check-in online, otherwise you will probably not end up in the plane that you have booked. The service on the plane and the food were good, although two of our four flights were delayed because of technical problems with the aircraft for 60 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. Needless to say that we did not get the money back for the XXL seats that we paid and did not get.

### "I saw some improvements"
Milan to Lima via Madrid. Haven't flown Iberia for almost three years, this time I chose them for this business trip because of price and convenient schedule. I saw some improvements in their website, cabin crew attitude (not all of the,m but speaking they are nicer than before even though the interactions with the passengers are very basic) and the fact they are buying new planes or retrofitting some of the long-haul ones with personal PTV. I find Madrid a great airport for connecting, one of the best among the main European hubs in my opinion, better than CDG and FRA for layout of the terminals, the cleanliness and the shops. On the downside, some aircraft like the A340-600 I flew with on my return trip from MEX are kind of old, worn out, with no entertainment system and with pretty hard and uncomfortable seats. Food can be okay, like on the way to Lima, or bad like on the way back from MEX - so it looks like it is a matter of luck. I booked another trip with them for my upcoming trip to USA in November as their price was unbeatable (EUR 450 both ways but with one flight operated by AA) so I hope I will be flying on their new A333 for a better experience.

### "I gave them another chance"
After 6 years of personal boycot of Iberia because of delays and quality, I gave them another chance to fly from Barcelona to Madrid, basically because I had to for a domestic flight in Spain (and in order to avoid Vueling). Online check in was not possible (ticket bought one day before flight and they do not update their systems), by telephone staff who said they could not do it etc. As a BA executive club member I feel that I was treated quite badly, especially because it was a very expensive ticket. Boycot back in effect (I know, they will not notice but it gives some personal pleasure).

### Iberia customer review
The plane was new (or recently renovated) with comfortable seats, a new-technology touchscreen for inflight entertainment (very good movies too). Nice food, you can choose between meat or pasta, and friendly staff. I didn't have any problem with my transit at Madrid Barajas (a good airport). I heard that Iberia has changed many things and renovated it's planes. Really good and recommendable!

### Iberia customer review
The distance between seats was minimal. I had trouble, even though I am not a tall person. There was no service. There were sandwiches for cash. Staff was normal, nothing special. I selected them because there was no other option between Athens to Seville with only one stop.

### Iberia customer review
Iberia Express flight LHR to TFN on A320. Good points: Convenient routing LHR to TFN and very good value business fare. Orderly and efficient boarding, even though full flight. Fairly new plane in newly-refurbished format with slim seats - much improved from previous configuration with bearable leg-room in 'Business' seats. Nice cabin crew. On time flight. TFN civilised and quiet by comparison to TFS. Not so good points: Could not check-in online as there appears to be a system problem identifying a BA flight, flown by Iberia Express on behalf of Iberia. BA Lounge was very crowded - the check-in girl warned us in advance - but we managed to find a quiet corner all the same. Cabin service very limited for a 'business' product, rather like a poor-quality economy service of old. Having said that, further refreshment was always available on request, and served with a smile. Three disruptive children in business cabin were a nuisance, and their parents did nothing to calm them - crew did their best to keep order. In flight Wi-fi offered but so slow as to be unusable.

### Iberia customer review
Iberia pleasantly surprised me with an excellent long-haul flight. The seats were comfortable, with plenty of leg room, and the entertainment system was top notch. Staff were friendly, the food was good and the 9-hour flight went by quickly. I would fly with this airline again over other transatlantic carriers.

### Iberia customer review
Our Saturday flight was cancelled and despite the lack of information from the airport services at Boston Logan, we were able to take the Sunday afternoon flight. Iberia upgraded my family and me to business class in our Sunday flight. Although we did not fly in a new A330-300, I love this old-fashioned, well-proven planes, the service was excellent, flight on time and great food. I would recommend Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
Barcelona to Bogota few days ago with my family, wife and two children. We had confirmed tickets in business class (discounted business class) and I had given a boarding pass with my seat when checking in Barcelona. At the gate in Madrid, in my connecting flight, I was told that the flight from Bogota to Madrid was overbooked and that I was downgraded to economy. Iberia did not change the aircraft and there was no reason of force majeur that would justify this change. I was not given any alternative, either to have my ticket endorsed with another company or to travel on the following day. The ground staff was not helpful nor cooperative in our situation. They gave me a very bad seat in economy class (no window or corridor seat).

### Iberia customer review
I booked with BA to go to Tangier, but then they said it was operated by Iberia - now I wish I hadn't taken the flights. This flight was full to the brim, there were many people shouting and children screaming, it took over 50 minutes to take off. Even though the entertainment system was fine, there was no meals on the plane, and what was made available (for purchase only) was not meant to be for people who prefer certain types of food, halal, kosher, etc. To make it worse the price was so expensive. In Madrid, we boarded a small plane which was operated by 'Air Nostrum' (oversold over again). This time it actually took about 1 hour to take out handbags, lock them inside the plane and let us go bag free to the aircraft, which was not acceptable as I wanted to keep my bag because it had all my medications in it. On the way back though, it was delayed for more than two hours at Tangier airport, which meant we had only 15 minutes to catch our connection flight from Madrid to London, we were actually running to get to the aircraft, and I have no idea what would have happened if we hadn't caught our plane. There were 7 passengers who missed their flight due to 'no-show' as we learned later. We had to wait for the airline to discharge the baggage of the 7 passengers who didn't show up. All flights have no meals. I will never accept a flight that's ('operated by') after this horrible experience.

### Iberia customer review
Contrary to lots of reviews of Iberia, IFE on every seat and the cabin recently refurbed, although obviously an old plane. IFE was limited by modern standards but good touch screen controls. Food and service relatively good. Madrid is a slightly annoying airport with Terminal 4S and 4 and huge distances. Overall, Iberia seemed to have made a decent effort to catchup with BA (whom I also fly to Rio with regularly). Recommended if the price is similar to KLM/AF and you prefer to fly Oneworld.

### Iberia customer review
GVA to MIA booked through Orbitz with Finair. I then found out that it was operated by Iberia. 24 hours prior to departure I could not print my boarding pass so I called Iberia. One agent explained that I should go to the counter because I had not booked directly with Iberia because of security reasons which made no sense to me. On the day of departure I went to the counter early to try and get seats with a bit more leg room (expecting to pay for it). 3 different agents tried to fix the boarding pass problem. I was asked several times to step aside and only after 1 hour and 10 minutes someone showed up and managed to resolve the issue in just a few minutes. As for better seats, no chance. I was told that nothing was left. No surprise, so many passengers went through their booking while I was waiting! Madrid to MIA was not very enjoyable, the entertaiment system did not come on and after rebooting, worked for 30 minutes and then the screen froze for the the rest of the trip. We asked 3 different attendants for help but only one tried to do something but it did not work. When leaving the plane in MIA, I told 2 attendants at the exit about the problem so that the next passengers would not experience the same issue. They said I should have reported the problem while in the air. I still don't know if this was supposed to be a joke.

### Iberia customer review
I had to admit that I had low expectations choosing Iberia for a long haul flight to South America. I chose them because it was the cheapest business class ticket I could get. The cabin was fantastic with the new business class seats. It is similar to Alitalia and Emirates business class setting. All seats have direct access to the aisle which is much better than Bristish Airways. The FA's were great, nothing to complain about. The IFE was also great with proper noise cancelling headphones. I have to give them credit for the food they served during the flight. It's always difficult to serve food during flights but looked like they did good job on that. The food were tasty and the spanish wine was just icing on the cake. So at the end, I must say I was quite impressed with Iberia. It seems that they have improved a lot since the merger with BA.

### Iberia customer review
The flight pricing was reasonable. The service, awful. I was disappointed at every turn. Our first flight was overbooked and we had to use a different airline altogether. Once we arrived the in Madrid, they booked myself, my wife, and two children seats at different areas of the cabin. That means that my 4 year old and 7 year old were going to sit alone. When I respectfully requested different seat assignments, everyone was unhelpful and rude. I have never seen such awful customer service at an airline. I wouldn't recommend this airline.

### Iberia customer review
After many years flying CE with BA, and avoiding Iberia due to bad experiences, we finally made the change and booked Iberia Business and then our usual Iberia Regional (Air Nostrum) business flight, what a difference. Good legroom, polite and efficient service and proper meals served (travelling at a time that BA would only serve their excuse for an 'afternoon tea'). It was a pleasure to fly with an airline which provided business class service for the business class fare.

### Iberia customer review
FRA-MAD-BOG. All flights on time. Check-In slow. took me 35 min. for luggage drop off (did online Check-In). No free drinks or snacks from FRA to MAD. Food from MAD to BOG average. No service between the meals. Crew were just hanging around at the galerie. UIO-MAD-FRA. All flights on time. Very old plane from UIO to MAD. No personal TV. Very old, worn seats. Food ok. No service between the meals. Crew disappeared. Again no free food and drinks on Europe flights. not even free water. checked bag did not arrived. got them one day later.If you like to chose a seat you have to pay around 50 USD each way.

### Iberia customer review
The Velazquez lounge at terminal 4S offers a great deal of amenities and perks. Food is great, views of the terminal are excellent, there are showers, resting areas, TV watching areas, and a couple of beverage stands at both ends of the lounge. Boarding was conducted in a very organized form using two bridges: one for Business Plus and one for the main cabin, and allowing families with children and elderly to board first which is always a great gesture. Cabin was clean, and flight attendants welcomed passengers in a friendly way. The new seat is superb: private, comfortable and lies almost flat allowing for a reasonable sleep. Entertainment system also had a great selection of movies, games, and TV shows. Food selections were good quality, although portions were a bit small. Flight attendants were able to suggest wine and were quite generous about serving it. Once service concluded, a self service bar was set up in front. One thing I liked about Iberia is that flight attendants are not intrusive, which can be confused with uninterested. This is probably a cultural misunderstanding, because while other carriers have an almost prying and intrusive service, in Spain, it is considered respectful to let people reach out if they need something. All in all an enjoyable experience.

### Iberia customer review
This ridiculous idea of cramming log haul flights with seats that have cushions that are about a hair thick and crammed about 10 cm from one another to save money meant that I arrived on the MAD to ORD leg of the flight hardly standing up and with terrible neck and back pain. Food was so so, less than expected on long haul flights. I can't say that the flight attendants were rude, they were just not present!

### Iberia customer review
Having heard lots of horror stories about Iberia long-haul, I was eager to try them given that the reviews did not match the quite satisfying experiences I have had with them on a couple of intra-european flights I have taken with them, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is important to understand that Spaniards talk loud and do not like to beat around the bush, therefore, it sometimes appears like they might be angry or aggressive, while deep down they are more than willing to help! Boarding was carried out in a very organized way. Standing at the door, were a couple of flight attendants welcoming passengers politely. Other members of the crew were helping passengers find their seats and stow their bags. Once airborne, kids received entertainment kits, and passengers got earphones if needed. IFE had a wide range of choices from movies to games and IB information, WiFi and GSM were available, but I did not try it. Meals consisted on pasta or beef, but flight attendants came around a couple of times in case anyone cared for more bread. Coffee or tea was offered. I asked the flight attendant if I could have another glass of water, he mentioned he was busy, but that once he was done, he would bring it to me. I did not wait for more than 2 minutes, he came back with an unexpected glass of water for me in the middle of his tasks! Another flight attendant was equally enthusiastic and happy to help. Overall, service was carried out in a professional and genuine way: no patronizing and no fake smiles. Really looking forward to my return trip on the A340-600!

### Iberia customer review
We flew to Madrid for a long weekend and got a good price for business class, so treated ourselves. The London-Madrid flight was only half full in business class, however the purser and steward serving us seemed rushed and very disinterested - no smiles or pleasantries! Lunch was ok and nice sparkling wine. On the return, we got a long haul A340 that was really tired and not very clean. There was a full business class this time and the service provided by the 3 stewardesses was again mediocre! 2 Iberia crews we encountered just seem unhappy and not willing to interact with customers.

### Iberia customer review
Booking was easy. Paid 162€ for BCN-MAD return. Booked Classica fare which include 23kg hold luggage and seat selection. Both flights departure time changed to 1h later but informed on time and accepted changes. Online check-in done using Iberia's mobile app, luggage drop-off was friendly and fast. Welcomed on board by well presented crew, cabin on both flights clean and in good condition. Seat pitch as expected, tad larger than Vueling but enough that my knees do not touch seat in front like on Vueling flights. FA's smiling and professional, assisting with luggage. Arrivals on time or a bit earlier. Did not buy anything from BOB but prices were comparable with other cariers with similar business model. Very nice inflight magazine. Luggage delivered in average times for both airports, BCN always longer. First time with Iberia and a very positive experience.

### Iberia customer review
The online service to prepay for bags doesn't work. The have no customer service in Marrakesh. Onboard they don't even offer a cup of water, you have to buy a bottle of water for 3 Euros.

### Iberia customer review
Both flights on time, friendly staff, newish interiors. The opened the gate very early from Madrid and I sat in the bus for 20 minutes. The aircraft was parked next to an air bridge that wasn't attached to it. The buy-on-board food didn't really seem to excite anyone (LCCs seem to have better sales). I was in row 6 on the way out and it was fine (I think they can move the curtain to make this a business class seat) but on the second leg in row 10, I didn't have enough space to put my laptop out in a way that I could type on it. This means that paying a little extra would be worth it to get those extra couple of hours of work in. Also, Orly is quite a miserable airport (they don't fly from Paris CDG) but Madrid T4 is nice and modern.

### Iberia customer review
Problems started with the reservation process. Their website, at least in Latin America, has terrible bugs. 4 days after having made the reservation online the electronic ticket still wasn't issued. Had to go personally to the local Iberia office. No way to add additional luggage through the web or at their office. Only by phone and upon confirmation 48 hours after, or at the airport paying 25% plus. No seat selection until reaching the airport (neither by paying through website). The plane is old fashioned, no individual screens. Food very very basic and cabin crew clearly annoyed to serve passengers. Plane on-time. Connection in Madrid was 5 hours long so no problem to reach on time the Schengen terminal. Overall very bad experience.

### Iberia customer review
San Jose (SJO) / Madrid in May. San Jose airport lounge by third company was standard. A new flat seat with a huge PTV screen was very comfortable. Business class passengers got 4MB internet coupon. Flight internet worked well. Meals were fine, however, the quality of appetizer was down compared with a few years ago. Wine selection was great as always. Crews were kind and friendly. After arrival at Madrid, no gate was ready and we had to park on the open spot. No bus or passenger step ladder. We had to wait for them more than 10 min after the belt sign was off

Montevideo-Madrid departure lounge ok boarding on time and old style Business class seats. Lots of space. Full cabin but great service by FA. All of them provided service with a smile. Welcome drinks food service magazines all great. Arrival on time. Bags in Madrid took 30 minutes Iberia needs to improve on this. Everything else great. They are really doing a great job on the intercontinental business class service.

### Iberia customer review
This is the third flight I have had with Iberia between Santo Domingo and Madrid in recent months and I have been waiting for the bad experience but it simply has not come. The embarking and disembarking the service and the food and the wines have all been excellent and I will not go to Europe now with any other company. I do not know what has changed Iberia around but it is really a pleasure to fly with them now. I am an old man with so many bad experiences on planes that I have great pleasure in praising this airline.

Flight Rome - Lisbon with stop in Madrid. Flight on time but it seems that to fly with a low cost airline everything requires a fee - change seats and even the food. Plane was dirty. Never again this company.

Outward SJO-MAD-LHR back MAD-SJO. New planes both ways clean and as comfortable as one might expect in economy. Good staff both ways - the crew on the SJO-MAD leg were super nothing too much trouble for them and a lovely friendly atmosphere. Food adequate - again as expected for economy. IFE good too. I use Iberia primarily to avoid the pointless hassle of US airports but after the last two experiences of flying with them I'd recommend them.

ATH-MAD Economy Class May 1st. I traveled with my wife and due to the fact that their online check-in system experienced issues we booked seats in different rows (their online system prompted us to pay extra to change seats). Luckily we managed to do that free-of-charge in the airport on the day of our departure. Moreover we found it unacceptable that on a 4-hour flight there was no free meal offered not even water - for which one had to ask. It saddens me to say that it was the worst flight experience I had so far.

EZE-MAD on board A340-500 with new seat configuration. Greatly improved seating IFE so much better and even the cabin staff are so much better attentive and welcoming. Food good Spanish wines good too.

LHR-MAD. The plane was an A340-600 with the new interiors. Load factor was about 50% so lots of room for everyone. The IFE system was active and earphones were handed out like on a long-haul flight very nice touch the flight passed by very quickly! The crew was very nice although a little slow with the BOB service. I had a vegetable sandwich that was good but pricey. Pillows and blankets were provided under request. The flight departed early and arrived 2 minutes late the reason was approach congestion given that one runway at MAD was not operative which was announced by the captain. Overall a very good experience I will try to fly on the A340 whenever is possible on this route.

Madrid to Buenos Aires in Business on A340-600. Efficient check-in normal mammoth journey through Barajas to Lounge. Lounge pretty good. Had seats 6C and 7A. Flat bed type seats excellent with good control over recline when flat bed not required. Staff generally efficient but seemed tired before they started. Kosher meals very poor worse that most other airlines give in economy. Ezeiza generally chaotic on arrival.

LHR-LPA-LHR 25 April 2015. No problem with price as part of a holiday package. Didn't buy any food as ate in T5. One and only problem with IB Express is the absurd legroom. If the flight had been full I would not have been able to sit down at all. Even with a spare seat between 2 of us it was the most uncomfortable 4 hours we have ever had on a plane. We were under the impression we would be on a regular IB flight on the return leg as there was no mention of Express but turned out to be the same. Luckily got the exit row which made us feel as though we had won the lottery. Whoever approves this kind of legroom clearly never has to sit there.

### Iberia customer review
Friday April 24th flight number IB3121. Vienna - Madrid - Alicante. Worst airline ticket was expensive but Iberia is in fact a low cost airline. No luggage included no food or drinks during the 3hr flight to Madrid you have to pay for everything. They didn't even propose free water we had to ask for it. If possible avoid this airline. Expensive and cheap service.

ARN-MAD SVQ-MAD. All flights on Iberia Express. The airline has been voted as the world's most on-time airline and my experience clearly reflected that. All flights were extremely punctual. Service was also efficient and friendly and the staff were well groomed and professional. BOB options are decent but not as extensive as Norwegian's. Seats were comfortable with decent legroom. Magazine was also very well written with excellent articles. Overall a reliable LCC product with on-time flights.

Flew GVA-MAD MAD-MIA. Both flights left on time and both arrived early. Lounge in MAD was very nice. When I got to my seat (2A) on the MIA flight part of the cushion was wet. I told a FA and she made a phone call. Within minutes a technician arrived took the seat cushion in turn made a call. New cushion delivered to the plane and installed - all within 15 mins! Great food lovely wines and perfect service. The "renaissance" of Iberia is a miracle! Planes were spotless and FAs attentive English speaking. Flat bed more comfortable than BA's and IFE excellent. Will gladly fly IB again.

### Iberia customer review
Wonderful surprise! I arrived in Madrid from London with a connection time of 65 minutes but went through the security with no hassles and everything was clearly signed at the Madrid airport with many flight information boards. Boarded easily and settled down into 2A right next to the window but a squeeze to actually get into the seat because of the herringbone conformation. A good seat with a 6 ft bed and soft pillow and blanket . Warm welcome from the all female flight crew in Spanish and English and then some bubbly and a delicious lunch very healthy food and not too heavy and decent Spanish wines. We left on time and arrived almost on time in Santo Domingo. I read much of the way. The seat had many little spots to put things. Delicious afternoon tea before landing and I was very impressed.

LHR-MAD-SJO Outbound 18 Feb return 24 Mar 2015. Booked with British Airways and had BA flights from LHR-MAD and MAD-LHR. These were more than satisfactory with decent aircraft and excellent crew. The Iberia flights terrible. Going out flight completely full disinterested cabin crew and tired aircraft. Return flight like something from the 1990s. The A340-300 must have had zero upgrades from new. Again completely full and I was seated four rows back from a bulkhead. The bulkhead had the television screen fixed to it and for the whole flight(10hrs) flickered and flashed the whole time making any kind of sleep impossible. The cabin crew were as disinterested as is possible almost throwing the food on to the table. Not sure if they are in some sort of industrial dispute or not seemed like it. Seating uncomfortable but just enough legroom to twist and turn. All flights arrived safely and on time which are the most important things. We booked these flights to avoid the inconvenience caused by US immigration and customs when trying to transit to Costa Rica from Europe and using a US airline. For anyone thinking of using Iberia to avoid the US fiasco just one word - don't.

### Iberia customer review
SJO-MAD-LHR. Late departure due to a late arrival from Madrid. The first leg was with a Airbus 340-300 very old and uncountable plane no PTV's. The plane was completely full. They served two meals: dinner pasta or beef. Breakfast was a joke a piece of bun some pieces of fruit and a yoghurt. Normally you get bigger and better portions with other airlines. These planes are very old the seats are uncomfortable and dirty the whole cabin looks dirty. Late arrival to Madrid leaving me only 30 min to connect in Barajas. No Iberia staff there to help us basically you have to help yourself. I made my connection with British Airways to Heathrow but when I arrived I wasn't surprised that Iberia lost my suitcase. I'd avoid them if I have other options.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-ORD on A330. Business Class cabin very clean and lie flat seats are comfortable. Food and wine selections were excellent. Inflight entertainment system had good selection of movies and TV shows but less than other carriers. Crew were also very good. Definitely will fly them again.

### Iberia customer review
LHR-MAD on the A340 flying a long haul plane on this route was very nice. The interiors looked a little worn out but everything in my seat was functioning. The seats were very spacious and comfortable. In addition the entertainment system was available and headphones were provided the selection was good and more than enough for such a short flight. The crew were very courteous and attentive to passengers and the service was fast and efficient. The meal provided on board was OK but some details like the dessert presentation or the absence of welcome drink were not up to standards. Airport experiences were good both at Heathrow and Madrid the baggage took a while to come out though. The flight departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. Overall a very good experience one of the few flights in Europe where I felt paying business class was value for money.

### Iberia customer review
IB6253 on 22 March. Never flying this airline again! The flight attendants were rude and absolutely inconsiderate! The flight attendants could not care less about you being comfortable and would throw your food at you. Asked politely for help fixing my TV on my seat from Madrid to JFK and all I got was ya ya ya. The food was cold and took over 45 minutes to clear our trays. I will never again fly this airline again.

### Iberia customer review
BRU-MAD-MVD return c class. Just wonder how they call this service business class. I have flown IB since the early 80's when they still had a 1st class and DC10 and jumbo 747 then a new business class was brought on board and they are still using it on A340 on most os the SA routes. They have the do not care attitude both on board and on the ground. Staff on board disappear after meal service and lucky you if you need anything at all. This is a business class service of almost 12 hours long? I had the unpleasant need to fly them 4 times intercontinental this year alone and I am sorry to have to admit that there are too many comments to write about in only one report. May I just say that they need to get their act together now. I am golden status with them but I will start seeing other options even if this mean going to eze or sao. Rude is also a good way to describe it staff. I however would like to ask that MVD staff both in town offices and airport can be relia ble. Only speaking about this station.

MAD-JFK. Full flight plane boarded on time by group numbers. Once on board new economy seat fine personal IFE. Departed on time. FA mediocre not very friendly. Food served: horrible lunch snack prior to arrival was better. FA served water during the flight. Arrival on time on a taxi 30 mins after arrival.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-JFK. I was offered an upgrade paying a reasonable sum and I decided to go for it I had curiosity to try the new A330 business cabin. My expectations were broadly fulfilled. The new seat configuration is just excellent with lots of privacy room and storage a large screen and decent IFE but the most impressive for me the food and the service. The menu included very tasteful appetizers and then an excellent seabass but as usual with Iberia the best was the variety of prime quality wines. Finally it's remarkable the notable improvement of flight service in Iberia. The chief flight attendant came twice to check if everything was alright and he was extremely warm and polite. The rest of the crew were always smiling and willing to please you anytime. I'm definitely a fan of the Iberia new business class.

### Iberia customer review
GUA-MAD Jan 24/25. This flight confirmed for me that Iberia is the worst airline. I've flown on and off for 68 years both on major airlines and on minnows including internal flights on Ethiopian Airlines DC3s Aeroflot and CAAC in the 70s. Nothing was as atrocious as this recent Iberia flight. Checked in online my careful choice of seat was ignored at Guatemala City airport and I ended up exactly where I wished to avoid being - in the middle of a four seat row. On the short hop to San Salvador all the lights - secondary lighting exit signs included went out leaving the cabin in total darkness for two or three minutes which was a tad alarming. No apology or explanation given. No seat back screens only a large screen at the front of the cabin which was obscured by heads in the rows forward of me making both the security demonstration and any entertainment offered only partially visible. Overnight the cabin crew could not be found to bring water for the necessary taking of pills. To cap it all my bag did not make the transfer to my ongoing flight MAD-LHR. It will for me always be advisable to travel by an alternative to Iberia if at all possible. A dreadful experience.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid - Orly. Upgraded to Business Class at the gate. An old Airbus A320 and the average Recaro business class seat with middle seat blocked configuration which is now used by almost every airline in Europe. Flight assistants were very friendly and professional and the food and drinks surprisingly good for business class. Flight left on time and landed slightly earlier than expected.

### Iberia customer review
We make a trip Geneva-Madrid-Lima and return with my family. The service was average I could say good. All the planes were on-time and the cheking and the luggage management was average and efficient. We had the new airbus A340-600 Miguel Servet and for the return trip Mario Benlliure. The space between the seat was satisfactory good pitch even for the people that they are tall like me. The food between Geneva-Madrid and return is for purchase the prices in my opinion are not too high. Madrid-Lima and return the food service was average I think could be a bit better but the red wine for the economy class is good and free. The pilots gave the basic but efficient information during the flight. The flight attendants are not too bad but the language skills could be improve and could serve more drinks during the flights of course if you wake up the give drinks and sandwich. Overall it was a good experience and I will continue to take Iberia for my trip to South America. Of course KLM and Air France are good companies for this route.

IB6275 on 2 February - AMS-MAD-ORD in Business Class. Was supposed to be on BA to London and then AA to Chicago but AA cancelled the LHR-ORD flight. I wasn't emailed or contacted by BA/AA - just happened to find out when I woke up and checked my itinerary. Went to Iberia desk at AMS and they said AA hadn't reissued the tickets yet so I spent 40 minutes on the phone and finally got it settled. AA agent was helpful but the overall process of them moving me to Iberia and not re-ticketing me is ridiculous. IB agent was friendly and issued my boarding passes and I was off through security. A320 of Iberia Express to Madrid left on-time. Flight Attendants were so nice! Small Biz Class in front of plane - served a hot breakfast with smiles and given blankets and magazines. Landed at T4 and transferred to T4S in Madrid. A330 to Chicago - maybe 50% full cabin but coach was maybe 40% full. Flight attendants were excellent! So friendly and ready to assist anytime. Food was delicious and the seat was great - fully flat and plenty of room for storage. Slept a couple hours and watched TV - not a great showcase of options but kept me busy. Landed and bags off quickly. Iberia has really changed and I will happily fly them anytime.

Flight IB6845 Madrid - Buenos Aires 28th January 2015. Several months previously we had booked and paid for 4 specified seats to allow extra leg room. On arrival at Madrid from Heathrow) we found that our seats had been allocated to other persons and we were allocated 'ordinary' leg room seats! As well as that we were treated quite rudely by the staff at Madrid who didn't seem to care one way or the other about our problem. The food on the plane was at best fair but as I'm now quite biased it's a definite poor. Staff on the flight were distant and clearly not too interested in making sure passengers were ok. At best they did their job but barely. The seats seemed ok at first but after 6 or 7 hours (of a 13 hour flight) they became uncomfortable and before long my back was a little painful. All in all I wouldn't recommend Iberia and it will be a last resort if I ever use them again!

### Iberia customer review
MAD-MIA Business. The person who decided on these seat should have made a 12 hours overnight flight to try them out. There is no adjustable foot rest instead there is a box that forms part of the bed when you put the seat flat. As a foot rest this box is too high to be comfortable and remember that one leg of the MAD-MIA is made during the day. As a bed the foot rest become the bottom part and it is very narrow. The bed takes the shape of a coffin with little room to move your feet. It would have been better if the foot rest was adjustable and part of the seat.

### Iberia customer review
Short flight from Lisbon to Madrid and absolutely nothing remarkable except two notably bad things. Seat pitch seemed the same as a discount Carrier (cramped) and absolutely no drink service offered. I know its a short flight but pretty much every International flag carrier that I've flown on always provides at a very minimum a complimentary drink. Iberia didn't even offer water. This wasn't even a domestic flight it was International one country to another. If I have a choice between pretty much any other carrier other than Iberia I would choose them. I find it embarrassing that the Spanish Flag Carrier is pretty much the same as a low cost Carrier in terms of service.

### Iberia customer review
BIO-MAD-SCL and LIM-MAD-BIO in economy. I was unsure about flying intercontinental with Iberia due to previous unpleasant experience and because their new product wasn't still available in all their planes. Domestic legs were just perfect both flights on time easy boarding landing ahead of schedule and more than enough legroom with comfy leather seats don't really miss anything to eat/drink in a 50 minutes flight. Besides I was lucky enough to get planes with new interiors and again great legroom and comfy seats food has improved substantially even though I found it certainly average great entertainment system with many music/movies/others choices all flights in time. Finally the crew was so warm and helpful which was one of the main lacks of Iberia. Good job hope this airline keeps improving on the right direction.

### Iberia customer review
We booked and paid for exit row (long leg) seats (£80) for our flight from Madrid to Santiago but on check-in found we had been bumped back to seat 28 and not even sitting beside each other. Because we flew from London first we complained at check-in in London but they couldn't do anything about it. Then asked about it again in Madrid and they said it was too late as someone else had been allocated our seats and they didn't want to upset them. My partner was furious as we are Oneworld Emerald Frequent Flyers and this is a Oneworld partner airline. He is very tall and had especially booked the extra leg room seats. We are dreading the return flight next week as this sort of thing is really upsetting especially when the staff sympathised with us and said Iberia often do these things.

Flew MAD-MIA on a brand new A330-300 with new interiors. The cabin has improved so much from the old A340. Smooth LED lighting through out the cabin helped in the sleep. Love their new brand. Seat pitch was nice perfect for a person measuring 5'10" (170). As the plane was nearly empty most of us in the back cabin had a row for ourselves. Subsequently I slept for the whole trip using those three seats in the row with plenty of pillows and blankets. Boarding staff was a little bit rude however flight attendants were marvellous. They came with drinks some 4 times over the entire duration of the trip and offered me having both option meals. Food was standard for economy cabin. Overall a much better experience than I expected after reading some of the reviews posted. IFE much better than Lufthansa's new 747-8i. Plenty of choices and easy interface.

Well done all round.

### Iberia customer review
Flew yesterday back from Rio GIG to Madrid on the A330 with new business seats. As it was a night flight I was looking forward for this experience. I have to admit that these seats though lie flat are not comfortable especially as they are narrow and you keep bouncing on shoulder level to the plastic frame. At foot level the space is also limited and you can not move your feet freely when in a lie-flat position. Once again in middle seats you end up touching your neighbour so only recommended when you know each other. Service was again very good from the entire team with meal service done in about one hour allowing to go to sleep soon. Food was good and wines excellent. Landing in Madrid ahead of schedule baggage with priority tags arrived first but 40 minutes after landing.

Recently flew AMS-MAD-MIA and back. The AMS-MAD and MAD-AMS legs were in Business class and the MAD-MIA-MAD in economy. It has been a while since I flew Iberia and boarding their A330-300 with new economy class shows you immediately that they had a lot of improvements done. The seats are comfortable and the emergency exit rows are worth to extra for. Only disadvantage of the emergency exit row seats is that the personal entertainment screen is stowed in your armrest. When you use it you have adjust the screen frequently because the screen tends to fall down. The food is nothing special but OK. On both flights the transfer time in Madrid was only an hour. When you need to switch terminals (4 to 4S or vice versa) this is the minimum transfer time you should book. If it is busy or when anything goes wrong you will not catch your connecting flight if the transfer time is >60 minutes. The AMS-MAD and MAD-AMS flights were on Iberia Express. This means no service at all. In economy class you should buy your own drinks and snacks. However in business class a fine quality meal was provided with a variety of drinks and bread. Since Iberia is still updating its fleet it is recommendable that you check whether your intercontinental flight is on a A340 or the newer A330. The A340's do not all have personal entertainment and so on. Flying on their A330 is great and also their crew improved! They even seem to be friendly nowadays.

IB6402 Mexico-Heathrow January 4th. I was really impressed by my business flight from Mexico to Madrid. Comfortable cabin configuration on the A340 (1x2x1). Attention to detail on the supplied kit from L'Occitane cream sets to the quality of the fabric of the rug. Very good service: just in time no fuss polite efficient. Departed on time and arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The only point to improve would probably be the list of the movies offered in the IFE: could do better but that's really minor compared to the overall experience.

BRU-MVD-BRU via MAD in business class - there is nothing business about this class! Check in done by a rude employee lounge vile and first leg to Mad uneventful. Lounge in Madrid crowded and naturally no priority boarding. Sudden change of seats due to "sudden change of plane" although my seat had been allocated since August. However another fellow pax was given my seat. No apologies from anyone just the rude and shameless staff form Iberia made no change to make up for their own mistake. On arrival some other pax had picked my suitcase and took it home. Only had it back following day. Return flights correct seat allocated and the usual service food and then staff disappeared until breakfast. Let me just add that my entertainment service did not work and apart from the usual "so sorry" nothing has been done. 12 hours of nothing no service at all. I still need to fly them in February and honestly I am dreading it.

Having paid £961 for a return flight London to Santiago de Chile I received no personal in-flight entertainment and no option to select my seat. On the return connecting flight I also had to pay for on-board food. Whilst this may be somewhat tolerable for short-haul flights it is unacceptable for the duration and price of this trip. Next time I will be selecting a provider with better respect for customer service.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Buenos Aires business class flight on A340-600 with new business class seat. Very positive experience. Starting from airport experience where the check-in took two minutes then fast track train ride to T4S and in less than ten minutes after check-in we were in Iberia lounge. Quite full but we found our seats. Food offer wide and of high quality. Boarding priority enforced and separate entry to the plane through front door only for business. Seats are new but to me not the best speaking from experience of the middle two seats joined together. Quiet narrow. We were two men and on the elbow side it was very economy experience as the armrests are so small that it was impossible for both to use them at the same time. So for this matter please really reconsider these and definitely go for the single seats! Crew very good and professional. Responded to every call from passengers during the flight. Food was half-half. Lunch excellent with clearly high quality and fresh products excellent wines and liquors. After that we have got for 10 hours nothing and then before landing just a small plate of Spanish cold meats. Small means three pieces of ham cheese jamon iberico and salami. That's all. For such a long flight a second full meal would be appropriate. Especially as it was day flight and we had a lunch at 1 p.m. and the second snack was served before midnight. Besides this a very good experience and I will not be affraid to repeat it.

### Iberia customer review
Flew recently once again with Iberia on Prague - Madrid route. I was waiting for one more experience before writing this review to be sure is more objective. I was once again very happy with my flight. Plane new but unfortunately without air show. Generous seat pitch which made up for the European "middle seat empty" configuration. Crew excellent and professional. Not many smiles but every wish attended immediately and without hesitation. Food excellent. Hot lunch served. This time excellent veal burger with foie gras mousse and truffle salad cheeses and cake. Flying Czech Airlines before on this route I know they do serve only very small cold snack on this three hour flight and charge the same. I am so happy that I have switched and will continue to do so if flying to Madrid.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-MIA on a new A330. IB has a very frustrating problem with pre-reserved seats. I like an aisle to the point where I am willing to pay extra for it. However I discovered that simply wasn't possible in this case. I was booked on the AA codeshare flight (IB6123) and was unable to display my reservation on the IB website until the day before departure. 24 hours prior to departure I did online check in when my booking mysteriously appeared. The system printed out a PDF file with no seat allocation and told me to check at the airport so I called IB. They too were unable to display my reservation and told me that as I had gone into online check in they would be unable to change my seat allocation anyway. The fact that I did not have a seat allocation appeared not to matter. I later went back to the website and tried recheck in and this time the system printed out a proper boarding pass and yes an aisle seat. At no point in the process did I get a choice. This is a great shame because I found check in staff gate staff and the flight crew all very professional and friendly. The A330 is an excellent product and the meal and drinks service was perfectly adequate and followed by an afternoon snack box prior to arrival in Miami. The entertainment system is very good with a good selection of movies on demand. I did find that some of the movies offered were not loaded in the system and were therefore unavailable. We left 15 minutes late and arrived on-time so this was a good flight. If IB resolved the seat allocation issue it would be a greatly improved airline.

I wouldn't use Iberia again as their services were poor and the price of the ticket high. 250 euros per person for a trip Athens to Madrid and back and not even a glass of water was offered. I booked my tickets 2 months before the trip and one week later the same tickets cost 190 euro.

19th and 20th of December flew LHR-MAD-SCL. I have never had a problem flying Iberia short-haul. However after reading all the Iberia reviews on this site I was quite petrified (being a nervous flyer) and I was so pleasantly surprised. New interiors with personal IFE (on the MAD-SCL leg) very responsive FAs (made 3-4 rounds of juices and water). Food was decent and 2 proper meals were served with one snack round at 6.5 into the flight. Good leg space - Captain came on the PA atleast twice to inform on flight progress and weather en-route. Given the less than memorable experience coming back from Buenos Aires to LHR on BA I would say that Iberia is upping its game big time and I would fly them long haul again.

### Iberia customer review
JFK-MAD round trip in economy both flights were excellent on their new A330. The seats are decently comfortable have a nice recline and are fine for sleeping and the service was incredible. Friendly from check-in to the gate and onboard. Food was above average not the best but I was definitely satisfied. Entertainment options were okay by halfway through the flight home I had finished all of the movies I wanted to watch. I was sceptical about flying Iberia after reading all of the past reviews but I was overall very impressed with the service and comfort of the flights. I will definitely fly with them again.

### Iberia customer review
I was not expecting much but I have to say that our recent flight from MAD to SCL in a A340-600 was really very comfortable. I believe we had the latest business class seat and the storage space around this is excellent - a lot better than BA business class. Staff were attentive and polite. I declined the late night meal as I wanted to sleep but breakfast was very good. The only downside was in the earlier connecting flight LHR-MAD with the usual business arrangement for European flights i.e. economy seat but 3 seats between 2 people. Flight was ok - the connection was well sign-posted as we had to change terminals but there was an exceedingly long wait on a bus for 25 mins and this limited the time we were able to spend in the lounge.

Just flew Lisbon to Madrid. Very ordinary experience with absolutely no service offered not even a glass of water. I know it was only a 55 minute flight but they could have at least offered that! Seats have plenty of leg room but are rock hard. Not sure we'd cope with them on a longer flight. Would never recommend this airline after this experience.

### Iberia customer review
BCN-LIM-MAD. Have mixed feelings about the "new" Iberia. On the positive side they are generally punctual and if you fly one of them new A330-300 and A340-600 then the experience is satisfactory however flying on one of their old A340 (there are still quite a few in service) is a truly miserable experience as the seats are uncomfortable and cramped and the entertainment system is limited to a few screens for the whole cabin. Food is generally speaking mediocre and the crew service ranges from indifferent to fairly polite. I find their policy of charging for selecting a seat and food on European routes really mean and I really wish they stopped doing that. However compared to the Iberia from 10 years ago I can see that there are signs of improvements and since they often offer good deals on their South American routes I will probably fly them again.

Just flew from Nice to Madrid then onto San Jose Costa Rica on Iberia economy. I am Star Alliance Gold and OneWorld Sapphire and travel a lot both in business and economy. This flight happened to be in economy and I felt like I stepped on a plane from the 90s! There was no personal inflight entertainment! We are in 2014 almost 2015 and on a 10 hour 40 minute flight we had no choice of movies. Absolutely shocking. Captain didn't say a word the whole flight cabin crew were rude and inattentive highlighted by the fact the toilets were covered in toilet paper on the floor and no one cleaned it up and that they took 1.5 hours to clear away trays. Would hate to see Iberia's crews in an emergency situation. Seat was uncomfortable to say the least and for 1200 euros return I want more for my money even in economy. They should be ashamed that they offer such a poor product so far behind all other major airlines. Cabin crew are paid 33% less than they used to be 17 years ago hence the poor attitude. Will not fly them again. All that we needed to see was that they still had a smoking section on the plane would have fitted in perfectly with their "retro" style seating. Honestly absolutely shocking and how they are in business I will never know.

### Iberia customer review
The MAD-JFK segment of our American Airlines itinerary was on Iberia. As mentioned by other reviewers Iberia's seat selection system is a travesty. It's only purpose is to increase revenue pure and simple. At check-in we were assigned seats 42A and 42C at the very rear of the plane. Described by SeatGuru as "bad" these were actually OK since there was room to recline and no lavatory behind us which meant no passengers loitering around waiting to use the head. (Seats 42J & 42L on the opposite side is probably a different story.) The new A330-300 was a pleasure to fly and the flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The usual Spanish aloofness was certainly absent on this flight. Our overall experience was very good but I'd hesitate to book another flight with Iberia unless they dump their seating assignment system.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-ORD. After avoiding flying long-haul with Iberia for over 5 years I thought I would give them a try again. I was pleasantly surprised. The flight to Chicago was a new Airbus A330-300 with a bright spacious interior with mood lighting modern seats ample legroom and a great tablet like in-flight entertainment system with a decent selection of movies. The on-board service was good though the main meal was mediocre: chewy chicken and a rather dry bread roll - snack prior to arrival was a big better. Other than this I would fly Iberia again.

### Iberia customer review
This is a hard review to write. The flight was great good food clean cabin excellent entertainment options however most of the interaction with Iberia staff were unacceptable. It started when I tried to advance select seats. They system would not let me and I had to call Iberia. An unpleasant agent told me that since I had used a "travel agent" (actually on line booking) the "agent" had to make to selection and pay the fee. From then on it seemed as if every employee was doing the minimum customer service. When we got on a transatlantic flight the on- board entertainment system (seat back TVs) was on. Many people had their own headphones (they clearly knew the routine on Ibearia) and settled down for a movie. I finally got up and went back to a cabin attendant and asked for a headphone. he very rudely told me they would be passing them out and to sit back down. An hour later (honest) they finally passed out earphones. It was that way the entire flight. When we tried to check in online for a flight the evening before in Seville we could never get the internet system to accept our information. We went to the airport early to check in we went to a ticket agent who was very nice and sent us to the proper flight check in counter but there was no one there and several people in line. I went back to the agent and asked if there was a check in agent. He called and said "I guess they are not working yet. Yes in addition to the ticket agent a couple of agents were very friendly and helpful but overall they simply had no interest in providing acceptable customer service. So based on the mechanical equipment and food I would recommend Iberia but I would not recommend Iberia based on the customer service provided.

### Iberia customer review
First and last experience with Iberia. They are by far the worse airline we have ever flown and will never use them again. They do not allow the customer to choose their seats until 24 hours prior to the flight unless you are willing to pay an additional $40.00 per ticket which they do not disclose to you until after you have made your purchase. When you finally go in 24 hours prior to your flight their system selects your seats and even if you are flying as a family they do not give you seats together forcing you to pay the $40.00 per person to change the seats at their counter which you did not even select to begin with.

### Iberia customer review
17th Oct flights IB7990 and return IB7989. I flew from Portugal to Cancun via Madrid last month. I booked directly on Iberia's website and received e-mail confirmation that the ticket was booked. I received a second e- mail informing me of what entertainment features I would have aboard the Airbus A330-300 which included one screen per person in the back of the seat in front. Once we got to Madrid we found out that Iberia was doing a codeshare with a small Spanish company called Evelop! The plane belonged to Evelop and was a A330-300 however it was a charter and as such the plane was crammed with over 400 people leaving no leg room. Food aboard the plane was awful having given us some rice (no protein) at the beginning of the flight and a snack just before landing leaving us 8 hours without food or drinks. There was no TV per person instead just three monitors at the front of the plane with a very faulty sound system. To make matters worse on the way back we were denied boarding unless we paid an extra €55/person because the airport taxes were not included in the price which Iberia failed to communicate this before hand. Finally in Madrid we went to Iberia's customer support desk to raise some questions regarding the flight. After a long wait the clerk was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Her supervisor wasn't any better and shouted the whole time even though we were speaking in a calm manner. I won't be flying Iberia again!

### Iberia customer review
BCN-MAD-BCN - I use the Barcelona-Madrid shuttle quite frequently and it is a great service. Check-in is fast in the Air shuttle terminal there is no security line and you can arrive at the airport just 20 minutes in advance. It is a short flight (55 minutes) that's why I prefer it over the high speed train (3 hours). The only thing I don't like is that they don't offer free drinks. It is a pity that they have cut down frequencies although there are still somewhere around 35 flights per day operated by Iberia. I would really recommend this service.

### Iberia customer review
8th Nov Madrid Barajas to Venice Marco Polo flight IB3248. I fly Iberia regularly because is the only solution to fly Venice - Madrid. The flight fares are extremely overpriced and the service is comparable and sometimes worse than a low-cost airline. Ground service and check-in service has a lot to improve tickets can be bought only and exclusively by the passenger (and not from a parent or husband) because they will ask for your Credit Card at the check-in and boarding cabin food is not complimentary.

### Iberia customer review
LHR-MAD-GIG. Failed to honour seat reservations I had paid extra for. Customer Service Desk unavailable at 18.00 at LHR. Customer service desk at MAD disinterested and dismissive. Airbus 340-600 economy class seats uncomfortable for length of journey. Food was by a long margin the worst I have encountered on an aircraft. Cabin crew not very attentive. Inflight entertainment excellent. I was reluctant to fly Iberia because of their poor reputation. They succeeded in fulfilling my expectations. Never again. Return journey EZE-MAD-LHR no better.

### Iberia customer review
We booked to fly Madrid-Sao Paulo and I was very nervous about this having never used Iberia before and reading some mixed reviews. I must admit that I was even thinking of cancelling the booking after my wife had made it due to the reviews. Well having flown yesterday I can comfortably sit here in Sao Paulo this morning and say I'm glad I gave them a chance. I had a great flight! The customer service food onboard entertainment and seat comfort was great. Thank Iberia you have a new customer.

### Iberia customer review
LHR-MAD-LHR. Fast check-in at both airports with friendly staff. The A321s were clean comfortable and in good condition. Lots of legroom if you sit in the front rows. Cabin crew on the outbound flight nothing special just did their job. On the return flight they were more friendly and attentive. I bought a ham sandwich on one of the flights and it was good although I still consider that the menu is a little bit overpriced. Captains on both flights were chatty and gave many details about the flight always interesting to hear them. I think Iberia is a good option given that sometimes they are not expensive at all and I think you get more service for your money comparing to low cost airlines. I repeat that if they only offered some drinks for free onboard they would be a very good choice.

### Iberia customer review
On November 13 2014 I flew with Iberia (flight 6118) from Miami to Madrid Business Class. The check-in boarding and welcome by the staff was excellent very friendly and punctual. My seat was 8A which was a very private Business Class seat. As the plane's departure time was 22.50 I skipped the meal and fall asleep right-away on the fully flat bed. The breakfast just before arrival was simple but good. I will not hesitate to fly again with Iberia up and down to Miami. A great airline and the Airbus 330-300 is great. From Madrid I flew on Iberia Express to Amsterdam. The business class is very cramped but adequate for a 2 hours flight.

### Iberia customer review
ORY-MAD round-trip. A really nice experience with Iberia this time. Cabin crew very attentive and courteous both ways. Definitely better than my first experience in 1998 with a long haul flight. Easy boarding. We arrived ahead time in both legs. A nice seat (14F) in both flights with great legroom (better than AF or AER) of course. Aiming to repeat the experience.

### Iberia customer review
Flew Iberia from Boston to Madrid 12 October 2014. Aircraft was a new A330-300 painted in Iberia's new colors excellent IFE with plenty of movie/video choices. Dinner was nice unfortunately breakfast did not happen due to extreme turbulence over Spain just prior to landing. Crew warm and friendly. Would fly this airline again.

### Iberia customer review
I flew BRU-MAD-MIA two weeks ago. I really liked the experience and can confirm that Iberia is improving its quality everyday. On the MAD-MIA flight I booked a seat on row 10 (first row in economy) with plenty of legroom. The entertainment was excellent individual screen with lots of movies series and music. Both flights were on time and the transit in Madrid was easy and I even had time to buy some newspapers and sandwiches for the flight. The flight attendants were helpful and attentive. The aircraft a modern Airbus 330-300 was very comfortable. Things to improve: both pilots on both flights didn't talk to the passengers not even once. Not very polite! Food could be better. Apart from that the price was extremely convenient and I recommend this airline for this destination.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-SJC on business class. Contrary to a dreadful economy class experience this is the way to go. The seats weren't new but very comfy great windows plenty of room to stretch even for my 6'6" partner. Great food even in the vegetarian option. Unfortunately there is not a pork free meal such as kosher halal or fish but what you get is ok. Good choice of drinks too excellent olives. Great. Check-in in Madrid was fast and efficient luggage handling good staff very friendly and interested. Oh yes reading material was plenty. Never looked at the entertainment because I had all of El Pais the IHT and the Washington post to read. Partner tells me it was good. Morale: If you fly to Costa Rica with Iberia go for business and you won't regret it. Fly economy and you will.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid (MAD) - Miami (MIA) in Economy Class (OneWorld Ruby). Transfer at MAD T4 was really good (lovely illuminated huge and intuitive Terminal 4) and very fast cause I was coming from the south of Spain. I was very lucky to fly in the new Iberia A330-300. The plane was all-brand-new totally clean. The crew was very friendly and attentive (they seem to have improved the service a lot since the merge with British Airways). Flight was on time. Food was ok the standard comparing to BA AF LX and AA. The selection of the Ribera del Duero Valley wines were very good. The new individual IFEs was awesome as I was able to choose between a huge entertainment content. I consider remarkable that the new Airbus A330-300 make no noise at all and the take off and lading were very smooth. I hope to get the chance again to take a long-haul flight with Iberia due to its impressive improvements specially once they will receive the new A330-200s and the A350-900 from 2015.

### Iberia customer review
SJC-MAD in an old cattle class plane. The most uncomfortable seats. I got a bad back the seats are hollow so you have to sit upright for eleven hours without leaning against anything. The front seat was leaning back so I was jammed in like a sardine. My partner is 6'6" he was so unhappy that he was hardly able to stand up. I really suffered spent most of the time standing up because I couldn't stand it in my seat. As there was no pork free choice of meal I went for vegetarian which was horrible dry rice and no sauce accompanied by cold carrots. I showed it to a stewardess who kindly organised some tomatoes and olive oil from business class. It was certainly a never again experience. On the other hand Madrid - Bordeaux was fine a fantastic comfy bombadier airplane with good seats and a friendly service. Go figure We did the other trip in business class which is a different review all together. Oh yes there was no TV screen at all but they had the cheek to give you an in flight magazine with non existing film channels!

### Iberia customer review
We had a flight AMS-MAD-LPA 27-09-2014 and return 6-10-2014 Iberia Express. Never have had less space for legs and the rest! (row 10). With the (magazine) compartment on the top part of the seat it is even worse. The English PA information we could hardly understand. Everything on-time. Boarding in groups is a great idea (other airlines used to do that as well). Not so good - no way to find a contact e-mail address or digital form to contact. I have become an Iberia Plus member - even then I could not find a contact e-mail.

### Iberia customer review
Flew LHR-MAD in Business. Very impressed with the service of the cabin crew and the food and refreshments - really surprisingly good. Cabin crew attentive and hard working throughout the flight. Good operation at LHR to board the aircraft. Frustratingly other aspects not top notch left LHR 55 minutes late (though to be fair the Captain did get us to arrive in Madrid only a few minutes late - another plus to Iberia) and then at MAD we had to wait 50 minutes for our luggage without any explanation. The aircraft is tired and elderly and needs to be replaced soon I think. My first experience of Iberia and despite concerns before the flight I would happily fly with them again. Things seem to be improving based on reviews etc.

### Iberia customer review
GLA-LHR-MAD Return. Although I booked with Iberia three of my flights were with BA and the legroom was good and they provided refreshments free. The flight from Madrid to London was with Iberia and the legroom was terrible and you had to pay for refreshments. I had people from Canada sitting besides and they could not believe how cramped the legroom was. Also it took 40 minutes for my bag to arrive after the plane had landed. Never again will I fly with Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
I took an evening flight from LHR to MAD on a rotation operated with an Airbus A340. The business class configuration was four rows of 2-2-2 with a vast 80-inch-plus seat pitch. The cabin was half full on this occasion. Priority boarding worked well and on-board service was professional but not warm or engaging. The food and wine was of good quality although not of intercontinental standard and the starter and dessert differed completely from those advertised on the menu. The crew are clearly accustomed to this being a predominantly business flight. Meals were served and cleared quickly to allow passengers to work.

### Iberia customer review
I flew from AGP via MAD to GIG. One hour connection time in Madrid very tight. Iberia staff were waiting for us to make sure we would get our flight. New (one year old) A333. Legroom ok seats comfortable (small pillow blanket provided). First meal hot pasta with veg and spicy sauce second meal about two hours before landing (some sandwich) not the best but ok if you are hungry. Lack of free alcohol (no vodka no gin) Landing on time. Return GIG-MAD-ORY. On time same aircraft. Meal some kind of beef with potatoes second meal as above (nothing special). Landing in Madrid 20 min ahead schedule. Again problem with lack of alcohol. Second trip old A321 to ORY no food no drink - nothing at all. Overall good service for long haul flights domestic flights hopeless. Cabin crew not happy.

### Iberia customer review
Worst airline I have used. My flight was from Vienna to Madrid and then to Santiago de Chile. Stewards don't really talk in English. They ignored the call button. You had to go to middle of the plane and get water for you yourself. Steward threw the food at you in the paper bag. No leg space (and I'm not tall). There's no in-flight entertaining system There were three TVs in middle of the plane but English language was not working. You have to pay 40 euros for selecting the seat during the online check-in.

### Iberia customer review
SJO-MAD-BCN and return in economy. Iberia have improved out of all recognition since I last flew with them. The flight from Costa Rica was in a modern plane with excellent IFE the food was good and the staff were attentive. There was a delay on the return flight due to non appearance of passengers and the plane was an older model with the screens above the seats but again the food was good and the staff attentive. The Madrid-Barcelona shuttle was a good experience too - friendly staff and rapid delivery of luggage.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-LHR. Quick and hassle-free check-in. Departed on time and we would have arrived 20 minutes early but we had to enter a holding pattern so we finally arrived on time. Good seat comfort and pitch on an A321. I didn't have anything from the trolley. I observed they offered glasses of water free of charge. The crew was nice and attentive. Baggage came out on the belt very quickly. Overall a good experience they did extremely well in punctuality which I think it was the most important aspect on that flight. I don't give them a 10 because I think they should offer soft drinks or coffee/tea for free.

### Iberia customer review
SAL-MAD. Shared lounge at El Salvador average not very good selection of food or drinks. Boarding chaos as usual with IB. Once on board very nice small business cabin. Comfortable seats lots of legroom. FA on this sector very nice welcome drink amenities food during flight selection of wines all great!! Departed on time arrival 30 min in advance bags quickly on belt. Great value for money.

### Iberia customer review
LIS-MAD-VIE on Sept 21 both legs in Business Class on an Airbus 320 and Airbus 321 respectively. Both legs were on time or almost on time. Slight delay into VIE not an issue. Transfer at MAD T4 hassle free although involved long walks due to size of terminal. No extra transfer security checks for intra-EU transfers. IBs Business lounge was excellent in all respects (comfort drinks food available space etc.). Only slight discomfort was that the WLAN vouchers handed out are restricted to 30 minutes so that multiple vouchers and log-in were required. Seats in Business Class were economy seats with their middle seats empty. IB uses the same Recaro slim line seats that Star Alliance does for European flights which are not the most comfortable option but were ok due to better than average leg room. In flight service on both legs was excellent with friendly and attentive FAs. Food served was a plain but tasty omelet with vegetables on the morning flight from LIS to MAD and a very good veal burger with potatoes (or a pasta dish) with a nice mixed salad on the second leg. Check in and security procedures in LIS were hassle free and a lot faster than expected after what at first glance looked like a bit of chaos with tons of people waiting and moving when entering the terminal early morning. But everything was handled quite well. IB uses the shared Blue Lounge is LIS which was just OK. (TP’s premium lounge is far superior.) In VIE it took quite some time for the luggage to arrive but that’s not IB fault and pretty much standard in VIE. First time I chose IB for the LIS-VIE route; which was due to a late booking and price. I have avoided IB for quite some time due it’s less than stellar reputation but after two very good experiences last year on the transatlantic route I am more than willing to include them again in my travel plans. Excellent service in all respects but long layover in MAD was less than optimal this time.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-MIA-MAD. Check-in at Madrid Airport was busy but we managed to get through rather quickly. Check-in at MIA with no lines lots of counters available. The plane was a new A330 on both flights. Seats were comfortable with standard pitch. IFE was very good with lots of movies to choose from easy to use and good responsiveness. Crews were really good most of them were friendly and smiling and all of them were attentive. Food was OK good quality and enough quantity with plenty of drinks served during the flight. Both flights were extremely punctual. All of this with an excellent value for money. Iberia has improved a lot on long haul flights I hope they continue to be this good.

### Iberia customer review
My first time with Iberia and I was quite sceptical about this airline when I read the reviews from other customers. The flight was from Malaga to Rio de Janeiro with 1 hour stop in Madrid. We departed with a delay of almost half an hour because the air traffic control would not allow our flight to land on time because of heavy traffic in Madrid. The pilot from Malaga was extremely helpful keeping us informed all the time about the situation and he did everything he could to arrive at a decent time. In my opinion this is a big plus for Iberia. At Madrid Iberia personnel waited for us at the gate to help us make a fast transfer to the transatlantic flight. MAD to GIG was with an Airbus A340-600 with the newly installed inflight entertainment system which is very nice with lots of movies a good selection of music and ease of use. There was plenty of leg space nothing to complain. Food was very good served 3 times never felt I was hungry. Overall I am very pleased with Iberia. Waiting for my next flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid.

### Iberia customer review
I fly over 100000 miles a year and I have never had treatment as bad as Iberia. Was scheduled to leave Sunday at 5:30 pm. Left at 8:30. Flew an hour and came back to Boston. They told us nothing - the flight attendants were hiding and the pilot literally told us the weather in Boston as if that had been our planned destination. Another hour on the runway and they finally let us off with no explanation. No one met the plane. No one apologized. No one told us what happened. We were eventually handed a tiny piece of paper with a phone number and were told to call after 10am the next day. Turned out that number was the worldwide call center for Iberia and they knew nothing. After many calls someone finally told me we would definitely be leaving that day around 5:30 but that I had to call back at 10. At 10 they said they didn't know but they would call us. When they hadn't called by 12:30 I called and they said I had to go right down to the airport. Raced to the airport where it was a madhouse and no one could explain anything. After almost 4 hours in line with no information from anyone they told me that they would put me on the next day's flight - something that certainly could have been done over the phone. On the flight two days late. No air-con for 49 minutes as we sat there. Pulled away only to pull back because of an electrical problem. Another hour with no air-con. Finally after a two-hour delay we took off.

July 3/4 2014 on flight IB6165 Boston to Madrid and then on to Las Palmas and back to Boston on July 23 IB6166. I frequently use Iberia's non-stop flight between Boston and Madrid and back. Of the about 20 flights I've flown only once was the flight delayed and the staff have always been courteous. The food is standard airline fare. The entertainment on the last few flights has been fantastic.

### Iberia customer review
I use to travel from Brussels to Miami via Madrid at least four times a year. Iberia is improving its service dramatically! The aircraft assigned to that route is a brand new Airbus 330-300. The entertainment is excellent individual screen lots of movies series music maps. The flights depart and arrive on time and the connexion in Madrid Barajas is fast and smooth. The cabin crew is much much nicer than before. Yes there are still some "old style" cabin crew members who perform their work without a smile but most of the members now are nice helpful and smiley. The food is just ok. The price is unbeatable!! It is the best ratio price/quality in the market for those flights. I am happy to fly Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
IB524 LHR-MAD IB6827 MAD-GRU Generally commendable service. On the first leg business largely means having the seat next to you left free but the meal and service were perfectly acceptable. The business class leg from Madrid the Sao Paulo had commendable service and good food and drink. There might have been a had more storage and when the seat was in the lie flat position it would have been tight for anyone more than 1.9m but overall I would strongly recommend Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
I was on flight AMS-MAD-MEX. The airplanes are old but well maintained. Yes you don't have your own inflight entertainment but just bring your own. The seats were very comfortable and you had a lot of leg room (compared to KLM economy class). The climate onboard was wonderful no dry eyes and it was not too hot or too cold. Most of the time when I get out of the plane after a long haul flight I am absolutely wrecked. The food was not that good I must say but who eats these meals anyway? The flight attendants were very kind although sometimes when I asked for a glass of water he would just forget and I had to go out of my seat to get a glass. I must say they looked understaffed. I would definitely fly with Iberia again. The value for money is great.

### Iberia customer review
Iberia flight 3325 Malabo to Madrid 27 August. Inadequate legroom. My legs were jammed against the seatback and caused me much pain. I should have walked off and taken Lufthansa. This was an A319 aircraft no entertainment system. My second flight Madrid to Chicago was ok but I won't fly Iberia again.

BCN-MAD-BOS. Very nice people at the check-in at Barcelona. BCN-MAD is always a fast and comfortable flight and takes only about 55 minutes (we landed early). Took the train to T4S and waited for 2 hours. The flight attendants were very polite the food was fairly good and the new A330 is fantastic with a nice selection of movies the new seats are fairly comfortable and landing in Boston was smooth. It was a really nice flight and I hope the return to Barcelona will be as good.

I booked a flight with Iberia LAX to Madrid Spain. Non-stop. Paid the premium of business plus. We arrived at LAX check in was a breeze. I did however see a long line at Iberia's customer service counter. Boarding was chaos. When I reached my seat I found that soda had been spilt on the seat. The staff cleaned it up after a few minutes. Food was awful! Half way into the trip I attempted to recline my seat to the fully flat position and was unable to do so it only reclined about 1/2 way. Staff indicated an issue with my particular seat had been noticed and I was informed that I would get a refund once we arrived in Madrid. Once we arrived in Madrid I went to the counter as indicated and described what had happened. No apology was offered nor given. I was simply told to file a complaint on their website and a refund would be made. I for one will never fly with Iberia again.

### Iberia customer review
I flew Iberia with my two children from Lagos Nigeria to London. We could not believe the size of the plane nor the fact that there was no inflight entertainment at all! It was clear that the plane did not have any screens not even in business class! I did not realise that was possible in 2014! I have made a decision never to fly Iberia again and am just so grateful that we were booked on British Airways for the return flight.

### Iberia customer review
Flew from Rome (FCO) to JFK via Madrid. On the flight from Rome to Madrid we did have a 30-minute delay but managed to arrive on time. Seats on the Airbus A321 were comfortable and plenty of legroom. On flight from Madrid to JFK we took off on time and arrived half an hour before schedule. The A330-300 is very comfortable and has an amazing entertainment system. Over 15 movies to watch and some excellent TV shows and music. There is less legroom than on the A321 but still enough to enjoy the flight. Flight attendants on both flights were extremely polite. I was a bit worried because of the several reviews I read but I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely fly again with Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-SCL in C-class old A340 with ancient seats lie-flat but everything else to be desired. Cabin Service was terrible disinterested crew food horrific entertainment worse than other carriers in Y. Movie choice ridiculous! I ordered SFML that turned out to be inedible! When giving the meal back to the stewardess the comment was don't order special meals it always happens. Well apparently it only happens with Iberia. What sort of answer is that anyway? No apology whatsoever!

### Iberia customer review
IB 3205 31/07/2014. IB 3206 19/08/2014. BRU-MAD return c class poor check in - fast track - poor boarding - inflight service is rather good in short and medium range hauls. Little but good food and drinks are fine. Crew seems to be caring although after take off meal service they disappear how can you disappear in a A320/21/19? Anyway only take them because they are handy to go to S. America. All in all poor in every aspect. Ridiculous baggage allowance. Had to pay excess luggage even flying C class and being a premium member of One World. They have lost it completely.

### Iberia customer review
Travelled from Lima to Madrid on Iberia August 3rd. I was really dreading this flight as I had heard so many horrible things about Iberia and the thought of a 12+ hour flight with no personal entertainment system was slightly terrifying. I think a lot of their long-haul routes must still be with older aircraft with very poor amenities judging from the reviews but the A340 I flew on looked like it was right out of the factory and had one of the best entertainment systems I have ever come across in an economy cabin. The food was completely up to standard compared with BA or AF and the staff perfectly courteous and attentive. I'd still be wary to travel with Iberia long-haul as it seems there is no minimum level of guaranteed service across their fleet but this flight was extremely pleasant. This airline is on the right track!

### Iberia customer review
Madrid-Geneva Business Class. Smooth and easy check-in at Barajas Airport Priority Security Line and then Iberia Business Lounge - big and well equipped. Flight on time nice and clean Airbus A320 very attentive (sometimes maybe even too much since I was the only passenger in Business Class!) and nice cabin crew food was average though. Simple green salad very dry chicken breast with buckwheat horrible chocolate jelly. Good flight but nothing to remember.

### Iberia customer review
On 24 July I flew from Brussels to Melilla. First leg to Madrid was operated by Iberia on an airbus A321. Plenty of space in economy class and service was good. Not too much movement/walking around by the seemingly experienced cabin crew which I like. Flight departed on time and arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule. After a just under 2 hours layover I boarded the next flight of my journey IB3870 (MAD-AGP) operated by Iberia express on an airbus A320. Legroom was substantially less than on the previous flight and also the crew looked younger and less experienced. Some issues occurred on board regarding seating of the passengers and at times they seemed not knowing what to do. Flight in general went well but due to a 17 minute late and northbound departure we did not manage to arrive on time. The last leg from Malaga to Melilla was operated by regional daughter Air Nostrum on a ATR-72 aircraft. Short hop good service punctual pretty flight attendants with characteristic gloves. Very nice manual (VFR) approach and landing by the pilots into Melilla. In general a very pleasant experience with Iberia. Personnel did everything possible to make the flights as comfortable as possible. Iberia Express may be a good initiative for the company itself (more seats and lower fares - more passengers) but for the passengers it is far less comfortable and even comparable to low-cost airline and daughter Vueling. The only difference is the business class provided by IE. I would recommend Iberia to anyone though.

I flew from Lima to Madrid about a week ago and was pleasantly surprised. After having read a couple of reviews I was a bit worried about the airline quality having heard that Iberia would offer poor quality food and no individual entertainment devices. However I have to say that both food and entertainment were satisfying and flight attendants were polite and helpful.

### Iberia customer review
Outbound LAX-MAD - they forgot to load the food and served a truly sickening menu of unappetizing and stale food. My gluten free request had not been respected. On husband's return flight there was a three hour delay. On my return a week layer an eight hour delay. Plane was old two bathrooms were out of service and food was disgusting. Better not to go than fly Iberia. I booked American but they and two other airlines dumped us on Iberia. Note if you book through expedia you may be unable to get seat reservations or diet requests honored. No compensation offered for missed flight/8hour delay or lack of food. Business class Iberia (American) is worse than coach on any other airline.

Iberia flight from Madrid Quito 6463 July 29 2014. The seats were uncomfortable dirty and shabby I have had back pain since then. The economy class was full but the staff were insufficient. Classical music channels 4 and 5 were not working. The TV was far from my seat impossible to see the movies available. Tasteless food and to conclude the sealed cutlery came dirty - twice! Very unpleasant experience. It is the last time I take this flight.

LHR to Madrid. They operate for BA chaotic and late boarding. Sat at gate fir an hour due to mix up with tickets on bags. Flight itself ok you have to buy everything food wise. Lots of elderly Spanish constantly going to toilets. Business class bit of a waste apart from designated toilet. Seats almost the same. Lots of eye rolling and campy shrugging from crew. Seat pitch good and all updates in English and Spanish.

Mexico lunge is nice and quite not much to eat but plenty to drink. Boarding always priority line on board good service comfortable and private business class window seat. Menu ok nice selections of wines FA very good service. Fresh snack before arrival. On both flights arrived at least 20 min early.

Flew from Heathrow to Madrid and then on to Quito in Ecuador and back. This is a long journey and I could not believe that the plane did not have individual screens so we had 3 rubbish films on screens that needed binoculars to see. This is not acceptable in this day and age for a flight that is 12 hours+. Legroom was just about ok but the pillow we were given looked as if it had been used for at least the last five years. The evening meal was ok if you are being generous but the breakfast was appalling - inedible roll and some sort of stodgy cake. I have never flown that distance before without having a hot meal - very disappointing. Unbelievably after we had been travelling for a very long time we were expected to pay for any refreshments we had on the final leg from Madrid to Heathrow. I really felt like telling the staff what a disgrace it was. Would never choose Iberia again given any choice at all.

### Iberia customer review
San José Costa Rica to Madrid. I made the mistake of booking twice with Iberia in the last month because they are the only ones that have a direct flight to Madrid and it would get me One World miles but it was an absolutely terrible experience. The SJO-MAD flight I already took was terrible. I booked a window seat via phone and didn't get a window but a terrible seat after the emergency exit that reduces your already very limited space. The plane was dirty there was food scattered around my seat. Even the magazines were old and dirty. For a 10 hour flight there is no inflight entertainment: only a couple of screens far away that don't work well. An already known Iberia fact but the food of course was bad. They have the worst customer service I've seen. This is definitely an airline that does not care about their customers. I have taken the same flight with United and KLM and even if it wasn't a direct flight it was better.

MAD to LAX in Economy 07/18/2014 IB 6171. 4 hours delayed cause by a mechanical problem no one single concrete bit of information about what was going on Flight was delayed no apologies no compensation no explanation. Iberia ground staff was made up of staff acting like spoiled children. On the other hand I have never seen such an unprofessional cabin crew. Everyone on board was feeling insecure and fed-up. The worst trip I have experienced. Old planes no private inflight entertainment extremely unprofessional cabin crew horrible food quality extremely low service (cabin crew disappear after take-off and reappear just before landing no drinks served during flight). The plane looked extremely old and out dated and even though it is almost a 13 hour flight this plane had no personal TVs for entertainment.

### Iberia customer review
My wife and I flew Iberia from Vienna to Madrid in mid June 2014. The three and a half hour flight was undoubtedly the worst I have experienced anywhere. Absolutely no service (not even water) and seat pitch that is the shortest that I have experienced anywhere including budget airlines. If the lady in front of me had reclined her seat my knees would have been seriously damaged. It wasn't a particularly cheap flight and chosen as the only direct flight available between these two cities. Next time I would rather walk.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-SVQ operated by Iberia Express. I was offered an upgrade at check-in for 78€ and I got it. Fast track security was very nice lounge was OK with lots of available seats and a decent selection of drinks and snacks. Boarding was a little chaotic because of the attitude of the passengers that didn't respected the boarding sequence. The cabin was in good condition and clean and FAs were friendly and attentive inflight service was not generous but enough for a short flight it is advisable to eat at the lounge given that you only get a tiny sandwich with some cheese onboard. The plane arrived in Seville 10 min ahead of schedule.

### Iberia customer review
SVQ-MAD operated by Iberia Express. At online check-in you get a random seat if you want to change it you have to pay 6€. I got an aisle seat so it was OK for me. Boarding was done by zones. The crew was nice and helpful the FAs were very proactive assisting passengers storing their baggage in the overhead compartments. Seat pitch was minimal I'm 183cm tall and anyone taller than me would be very uncomfortable. The flight went by quickly and we landed 5 min ahead of schedule.

### Iberia customer review
We flew Iberia for the first time this summer on our trip to Palma de Mallorca starting in Chicago O'Hare with a layover in Madrid. The experience was one I don't wish to repeat. First two days after booking our tickets they contacted us to tell that our flights had been cancelled and that we would receive a refund. I went online to check the status of said flights and they were still available just a lot more expensive. After hours on the phone trying to reach a representative they finally honored the tickets at the price we paid but not w/out giving us a lot of grief. On the day of the flight airport staff were rude and would not honor the selected seats we had picked and only offered seats at 55€€per person. Once on the flight we discovered a lot of the non - Spanish passengers had similar issues. On the food I can only say that I've had some bad airplaine food but this was on a different level. The entertainment onboard was fine with lots of options and the seats were small but not too bad. To give perspective to this review I've flown to Europe before on similar trips before on American Airlines and the experience has been 100% better.

### Iberia customer review
I fly from Brussels to Miami via. Madrid at least four times a year. Iberia has improved dramatically the quality of the service. The aircraft's for the leg Madrid Miami are quite new sometimes brand new. The entertainment system is great with individual screens. Flight attendants are making an effort to be helpful and attentive. Flights are very often on time. In the past five years I never missed my connection in Madrid. Food on board was really poor in the past but is ok now. Talking about prices the are extremely competitive.

### Iberia customer review
Having flown MAD-SJO earlier in the month flew SJO-MAD overnight for the return journey. Both flights left on time went well passed quickly and were thoroughly enjoyable experiences. Having flown Iberia in the past the airline is now much improved. The Madrid Airport lounge also provided everything I needed between connections. All being well I hope to use Iberia again on this route in the future.

### Iberia customer review
I flew MAD-MIA and back on the airbus 330. Comfortable seats and personal inflight entertainment with a selection of films games etc. Food was ok. Flight attendants not interested and rushed the services to finish quicker. I went to the galley to ask for a glass of water and they gave it to me but they didn't seem very happy. Their English is very basic.

### Iberia customer review
LHR - Madrid - Lima and Quito - Madrid - LHR. My biggest gripe was lack of entertainment. The website seemed to indicate that personal screens were supplied on long-haul. I consider 11 hours and 10.5 hours long-haul. The only screens were above central row and almost impossible to see from window seats. Food was on the poor side of acceptable. Also note (though not Iberia's fault) Madrid security confiscate duty free drinks when passing through.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-LHR. Business class. In the interest of fairness after my horrid mid-haul experience from TLV I want to report my continuing flight back to London. Very pleasant welcome by the lady purser and her male colleague. I could tell this flight would be good and it was. After take off menus were given out and then a drinks run and the wine options were explained by the personable cabin crew guy. The the purser came round with lunch hake or beef and it was service with a friendly smile. A further drinks round was provided with a smile before a 30 minute early landing into Heathrow. So the simple conclusion is that the cabin crew can make or break a flight win over or loose customers. This twosome won me over.

### Iberia customer review
TLV-MAD IB3319 Business Club. Horrid flight made so by a poor Purser serving the Business cabin. Seat belt sign on for 30 minutes after take and yet no turbulence whatsoever and no explanation. Then it was a further 30 minutes before any sign of service. No hot towels no drinks no engagement with passengers whatsoever. She brought breakfast and I asked if there was a menu and if there was a choice. She said no to both. This is hot breakfast only. I took my hot breakfast and found that after a mouthful of omelette chicken and potato that it was cold. I said to the purser that if she is serving a hot breakfast then at least she could ensure it was hot. At this point any professional purser would jump into service recovery mode with maybe an apology empathy an alternative. No she said what do you want me to do. I suggested a replacement but she said there was only one meal for each passenger. No offer of more bread croissant fruit. Nothing. The flight is about 5 hours and during that time all that was offered was orange or water and coffee with breakfast. No seconds no further drinks rounds. Iberia's website says on these flights you get hot breakfast and a cold snack. No snack served. The only thing that was cold was the service and my breakfast. This lady has lost Iberia a business class customer.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Bogotá on 29 May in Business. I find the new business class seat claustrophobic. They are very narrow and I felt trapped especially when I put the seat in bed position. The strange thing is that there is a gap of around 12cm between the seat and the wall which could have been used to make the seat more comfortable and wider. The food as I expected was just ok and boring. Iberia should try to make it catering more interesting. 5 star Michelin chef and everything but the food is not worth it. Before landing we were given surprise surprise the usual selection of dry ham and cheese with bread. Come on I know they are very Spanish and Iberia wants to showcase the best of Spain but please offer something else or spruce up the menu a bit. The flight attendants were excellent.

IB 3539 May 25 MUC-MAD. May 30 MAD-MUC. Most uncomfortable seats I have had: Very low space and even worse: Their metal fixing to the floor and the cage for under seat luggage prevented every movement of my legs and shoes. No free beverages even no water.

Travelled from USA to Lagos via Madrid December to January 2013 flight from USA was fair but from Madrid to Lagos and Lagos to Madrid horrible. No entertainment whatsoever for the entire flight there was just no single TV or audio for a 6hr flight. Food was bad no food selection everybody served same thing. This had been ongoing for a long time from other passengers especially to Africa. Will never fly Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
Very disappointed with our experience with Iberia on a few levels. We were flying from Madrid to LAX as a second leg of our trip and then from LAX to Phoenix. First we board the plane in Madrid about 45 minutes late. The plane looked extremely old and out dated and even though it is almost a 13 hour flight this plane had no personal TVs for entertainment. We taxi for a while and then are told there was a technical problem and we needed to return to the gate. They said there would be a new plane ready for us in about 15 minutes. We then sat in the airport for about 3 hours before anyone told us anything. We finally boarded a new plane which actually looked even older than the first one and left about 5 hours late. We then landed in LAX at 8.00 with a connection to make at 9.35. The Iberia attendants just told us to try to the make the flight. Of course by the time we got through customs and over to the next terminal we missed our flight. We had to go back to Iberia's counters wait in another 1 hour line and were told we get out the next day. Needless to say we finally got home but about 18 hours later than we thought we would.

I flew from Venice Italy on Iberia through Madrid and on to Chicago. I must say after the flight to Italy on British Air the Iberia flight was a great relief! The food was good the in flight entertainment outstanding and the seats were very comfortable (I'm 6'2" and I've rarely said that about airline seats).

MAD-LIM and LIM-MAD in May 2014 new aircraft excellent entertainment food served twice refreshments when asked all the time boarding according to the seat row. They issued luggage label to final destination (CUZ) but did not advise us that luggage must be collected in Lima even if we traveled to Cuzco in order to pass customs control. We had to claim it in Cuzco over LAN and it took two days to receive it.

### Iberia customer review
On my first leg they were 3 hours delayed and the extent of their compensation was a $20 voucher for the next trip I'd book as long as it was within 6 months. This paled in comparison to my return trip when they completely cancelled my flight and booked me on a flight 10 hours earlier without notification. Needless to say this caused me to miss the flight and caused significant logistical and financial burdens for the remainder of my travels as they were unable to reschedule me on a flight for two days.

Great product.

MAD-LHR. Last minute booking but I thought pretty expensive at €720 one way... Flight was on time. Boarding was a joke with all the passengers queuing up in the air bridge for 10 mins before boarding the aircraft. Despite the cost no drinks or snacks were offered without paying for them... Overpriced for a 2 1/2 hr flight.

MUC-GUA because I got a very good deal. The price was phenomenal! Anyway I am a little spoiled because I usually fly with Emirates Qatar and Etihad. There were no personal TV for the 12 hours flight and the Big TV for everybody showed three boring movies! MUC-MAD didn't include any drinks or snack and the seats were very tiny. All flights were in time.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Bogota at the end of April in the old business class seats and had a very good flight expect for the food. Spanish cuisine is of the most delicious and interesting in the world and Iberia hired several Michelin-starred chefs to deal with their catering but this airline serve some awful stuff onboard. My started Salmorejo was very good even though it was served from a Tetra Pak container. Yet my main course tasted as though it was bought from KFC and then they poured some sort of gravy over it. It was dreadful. I did not mind the old business plus seats as the cabin was almost empty but I expected a good meal. I do not drink so cannot comment on their wines. Shame on IOberia you are not a good ambassador to Spain's wonderful cuisine. As for the second meal again dreadful: the usual dry and fatty ham bread. tomato sauce cheese etc. I have been using Iberia to travel to Latin America for many years and this second meal is the same. Time to change. Those expensive chefs are useless. Listen to your passengers not to them. I have a flight with them at the end of the month and will take my own food. The good thing apart from the seats is that the flight attendants are very charming they engage with passengers and are not grumpy as they used to be. The connecting in Madrid from London was easy and Iberia's lounge is excellent with a very good selection of food and drinks.

### Iberia customer review
Paris to Buenos Aires on Iberia simply because their Business Class costs almost half of what you pay for AF. Since its such a long flight anyway the two hour transit in Madrid didn't really bother me. Departure from Orly in Paris is always a better choice as you'll be leaving from a small airport without the hassle and the crowds of CDG. The IB Business lounge at ORY is very good with excellent food options and even if it is located before security checks but with IB Business Class you get Fast Track security check and you have no queues. During the two hour flight to Madrid you get a very decent hot breakfast served by friendly FA's. Transit at Madrid T4 is very easy and despite the long distances I was in the long-haul terminal business lounge within 20 minutes after landing. Unfortunately it gets very busy before noon with all flights to North & South America leaving more or less same time. Once on board the A340-600 I was thrilled to see the new cabin layout providing a very clever single seating and privacy for nearly everyone. The seats are very comfortable turning easily to a fully flat bed. On the 12 hours MAD-BUE sector I managed to sleep for almost half of the flight. The crew was very polite and available at all times. The downside is with catering where Iberia promotes Spanish cuisine but it may not be to everyone's taste when your lunch choice consists of roasted pig baked cod or vegetarian lasagne. For the starter the foie gras was nice but in Business you shouldn't serve a gaspacho direct from a carton box! No cheese or fruit available for dessert just sweet puddings. The biggest disappointment was the second meal served after 10 hours flying; just some cold greasy ham with bread and a fruit salad. Times may be rough but you would expect at least a second hot meal with a choice for such long flight. All in all the new Iberia Business Class is excellent for its value for money seat comfort and fully lie-flat bed friendly staff easy transfer in Madrid but fails badly in catering despite all their marketing efforts to involve renowned Spanish chefs.

### Iberia customer review
Flew from Madrid (MAD) to Santiago de Chile (SCL) with this airline on May 19th 2014 and was highly disappointed by catering options and on-board entertainment and service. Aircraft: Iberia operates the A340-600 with the old color scheme for this route. Flight Duration: 14hr (due to strong headwinds). Return Flight: same aircraft. Class: Economy. Price: GBP 614 for a return flight from FRA with a 2hr stop in MAD. Inflight entertainment: The were no personal monitors. We were sitting quite far from the big screen at the front row. This made watching the 3 movies shown during the flight difficult. Besides there was a lot of image noise and the screen was flattering occasionally. You could really see a grey noise stripe moving from one end of the screen to another all the time. Food and Beverages: Since we left MAD past midnight Iberia thinks it can skip a meal as it expects the passengers to sleep (what else do you want to do on a 14hr flight without any kind of on-board entertainment). Dinner was served 1hr after departure. Whisky or any other liquor (except beer and wine) was not on the trolley. I was told to kindly wait but nothing happened. We were served breakfast consisting of a dry ham sandwich (white bun no lettuce and butter tasted horrible) ca. 1.5h before arrival in SCL. No meals were served in-between which means 10+ hours without food. We got served a small salami sandwich on the way back as a snack though. But in comparison to what I have experienced flying e.g. Asiana Qantas Lufthansa or even US Airways (not my first choice though) this is absolutely unacceptable. Staff service: You had to go to the kitchen to get a glass of water as no drinks were served in-between too. Not sure what the flights attendants were doing between meals but I haven's seen them offering any refreshments or taking care of the 350+ guests between the meals. Seat comfort: Seats were comfortable and I felt I had more legroom (I am 6.3 190cm) than e.g. on an intercontinental US Airways Delta or Qantas flight. Overall: (7/10). (-) Worst-in-class food poor service and no in-flight entertainment. (+) GBP 614 for a return ticket was a bargain comfortable seats in the Economy class with sufficient legroom for tall passengers.

TXL-MAD-PTY return. 1st leg from MAD on a brand new A330 return on old A346. It was like flying 2 completely different airlines! The new A330 is excellent bright and clean. The inflight entertainment system worked well with a good selection of movies. The seat pitch is good and I'm a tall person. Surprisingly (after my last trip with Iberia to EZE) I was not starving at the end of the flight. We arrived to Panama with 1hr delay due to heavy traffic in Madrid and delayed departure. Return leg on an old (not refurbished) but clean A346. Got the emergency seat with extra legroom. Flight full. No individual monitors. Arrived ahead of schedule. TXL-MAD legs with Iberia Express where no food/water provided. I would definitely fly again with Iberia especially if possible to choose A330. Excellent value for money.

### Iberia customer review
We flew 4 legs on Iberia back and forth from Malaga to Marrakech with a short stop in Madrid each time. All the flights left nearly on time and if we didn't the pilot made up for it in the air. We purchased food on one of the flights cheese/crackers. It was good much better than the sandwiches we decided to buy in Madrid on the way back. The plane was new and clean. The leg room is horrible luckily the flight is short. I would not book this size of plane for a 2 hour flight.

MAD-LHR. I was upgraded to Business Class so the experience was notably improved. Boarding process was smooth although the T4 Satellite is a mess due to the works in the duty free area you could tell that many people got lost in the way to the gate.

My husband and I were on the flight from Madrid to New York on 15th April. We were supposed to land at 2.30pm and it was about 8.30pm when we finally landed. The pilot kept trying to land at JFK and could not because of the weather. We had to go to Boston and refuel then go back to New York to land. I want to commend the pilot and all the crew on the flight. They handled everything very professionally. The pilot kept everyone apprised of what was happening and even came out and spoke to everyone in English and Spanish when we were on the ground in Boston. When we landed we had to talk to the staff at the Iberia Air counter to figure out how to get home. There were many people in the same situation as us so we had to wait quite a while. Given a hotel for the night given meal vouchers told us where to catch a shuttle to the hotel and arranged flights for the next afternoon. What was a really bad situation was made a lot more tolerable because of the crew on the plane and the staff at the counter at the airline terminal. I would and will certainly recommend Iberia.

SXB-MAD-MIA-MAD-SXB in C-class. All in all a very good experience. While the check-in and airport facilities in SXB provides no benefits (e.g. no lounge not even a voucher) for C-Class passengers MAD airport is clean easy to navigate and the IB-lounges (T4 and T4S) are very nice roomy with good food and drinks (wine). Connecting flights to MAD were operated by Air Nostrum in small Canadair jets. I liked the flights and even the catering was very good; even better than on the last leg with IB from MIA to MAD. FA on the Air Nostrum flights were very nice and service orientated. We were happy to have the new A330 on the MAD-MIA-MAD sectors and I have to say that the seat is one of the most comfortable I ever experienced in any C-class. IFE is good and has a large screen. FA's were nice and helpful on the MAD-MIA sector not so on MIA-MAD. Drinks are extensive with nice wines especially the red ones. Food was so-so. The only thing I would consider for IB is the long process before serving dinner on the late-night departure for the MIA-MAD leg. One wants to sleep as fast as possible on such legs eastbound but it took them over 2 hours to complete first service and switch off the lights. Furthermore breakfast was minimal (no choices). However I would not hesitate to use them again - good product!

MAD-CCS in the new business class 1-2-1. What an improvement. It is similar to the new Alitalia Business Class and even close in comfort to Cathay. Nice space great screen and IFE selection. Seats a little narrow but more than OK. Great private space specially if you are in the windows. Iberia was always famous for it rude FA's but I must say the last 3 times they have proved that theory wrong. Great service. Good food and plenty of bubbles.

April 22 2014 IB 3950 MAD-SVQ return April 2014. Although the seating and pitch on the A320-200 was very very tight the flight attendants worked hard to assist everyone with their luggage. Water in a cup was the only thing you don't have to pay for. The flight attendants were professional helpful and friendly.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-LHR-MAD. Hassle free bag drop and security at both Barajas and Heathrow. Everything on time and rapid passport control and baggage reclaim on both sectors too. The leg room on the A321s was the most generous I've experienced in short haul economy class and the FAs were efficient - but certainly not as friendly as they perhaps could be. What does let Iberia down though is the buy on board catering which smacks of low cost - which it isn't - rather than national flag carrier.

We were a group of 5 guys going from Copenhagen to Madrid to watch football. We had paid a lot of many for direct flight and booked 3 months in advance. When we got on the plane they said that there were not enough seats. I told the staff that I had a seat number on my boarding ticket but they said that they didn't use the seating numbers and that 3 of us had to get off. We had to wait 17 hours to get the next flight. We got no help. The staff couldn't understand English at the service desk in Madrid Airport.

The worst trip and airline I have experienced. Ticket said Barcelona-JFK. Only tiny letters at the bottom said (change of equipment in Madrid). Our flight was delayed and Barcelona staff knew before we boarded that bad weather was canceling most flights out of Madrid but they would not share this info with passengers. En route I knew something was wrong promised that there would be help when we got off. There was no info about anything. No announcements whatever. One small kiosk with 4 people was all there was to serve hundreds of people and the line did not progress. Finally found someone who called US for me on their cell and I rebooked with my US travel agent! Then the chaos assigning hotels however it really didn't matter where I ended up at this point.

Our trip from Quito to Madrid on Iberia Flight 6464 was probably the most dreadful flight experience my wife and I have ever endured. The flight was made late because of the late arrival of flight crew. Food was absolutely disgusting. Service particularly from the female staff was extremely rude. Because of the flight being late we missed our connecting flight to London. In every single case we found Iberia staff completely uncaring unprofessional rude and obnoxious. I would never fly with Iberia again.

No assistance offered by Iberia not one of the One World alliance advantages I legitimately could pretend has been respected. No priority check-in no VIP lounge no priority boarding and no on-board catering. Flight was delayed no apologies no compensation no explanation. Iberia ground staff was made up of staff acting like spoiled children. On the other hand I have never seen such an unprofessional cabin crew. Everyone on board was feeling insecure and fed-up. Claims to Iberia and Vueling ignored. Iberia violates its One World alliance commitments and is proud of it.

Old planes no private inflight entertainment extremely unprofessional and not motivated cabin crew horrible food quality extremely low service (cabin crew disappear after take-off and reappear just before landing no drinks served during flight).

MAD-GVA-MAD. A pre confirmed aisle seat which magically turned into a center seat during check in was a bad start. I am 5 feet 10 inches and the space between the bottom of my back and my knees is greater than the space between the rows of seats on the A320. That means sitting with both legs either pointing sideways or spread apart either way extremely uncomfortable. No food or beverage but items for sale but with the seating position there is no way I can get my wallet out of my trouser pocket to pay anyway. This is an exceptionally unpleasant experience but if you have short legs and no service needs Iberia might be the airline for you. They have taken to making lots of customer friendly announcements including the catch phrase 'The Joy of Flying' which I find exceptionally hypocritical.

Even though it has not refurbished yet your business class seat offers you such large space so that you do NOT need to jump your neighbour in case you need to reach the aisle. Seat is lie-flat and very comfortable. Cabin crew are very pleasant and wine selection is top notch. Food could be better but I cannot complain as wines and spirits outweighs the balance. Both AVOD and cabin cleanliness are things Iberia should improve. I would recommend it.

MAD-ORY. I was offered an upgrade to business for 60 Euros one way doing my check-in. Nice touch! The computer system went down at Barajas thank goodness I had downloaded the boarding pass on my smartphone. Although the system was down both crew and passengers made the boarding easy. Food was good crew nice and plane arrived on time. Getting to Paris-Orly the have shuttles that get you to the hotel for 15 Euros each way on the way back I got the tube and it was 11.65 so definitely will get the shuttle again next time. Plus I could work with my computer all the trip.

Madrid to Chicago O'Hare on an Airbus A330-300. IB 6275 MAD-ORD flight was during the day and lasted 10 hours. The new business class seat was very comfortable and spacious. The cabin crew were nice! They have improved their English a lot since the last time I flew with them in January 2013. The food was also very nice. IB 6274 ORD-MAD flight was during the night and lasted 8 hours more or less. The amenity kit included earplugs and many other things so I got asleep very quickly. The cabin crew was very nice food excellent specially breakfast. It seems that the new Iberia is much better than the old one. The Airbus A330-300 made no noise at all but the only thing I missed was the minibar that used to be in the other planes such as the A340 but in the end the flight was perfect and I hope to fly with them again!

Madrid - Quito and Lima - Madrid - London. A truly miserable experience. Despite reserving a window seat five months before travelling I only got it on two of the flights and in both instances had to get my seat re- allocated and on an 11 hour flight got a window seat with no window. The food was best described as appalling and was not included on all of the flights. The passengers who had previously had my seats clearly thought the same as a lot of the food was still scattered around the general vicinity. The inflight entertainment was on central screens the earphone points didn't work properly and the choice of films was dire. In short never again.

Madrid - Guatemala (IB 6341) March 22th. Very bad service from beginning to end. Travelled in business class expecting plenty of room when really you have service that is worse than economy on many other airlines. Lazy and unfriendly staff. The quality of the food was poor and really limited. The airplane was old and needed an urgent refurbishment.

This was a long flight from Santiago de Chile to Madrid in Economy (over 12.5 hours). I paid GBP 25 in order to book an aisle seat - the thought of being stuck in a middle seat was just too much to bear. My prayer was that this A340-600 had the refurbished interiors and I would have my own IFE. Stepping on the plane I saw the seats were blue and my heart sank. Long flight and no screen. In fact the flight was good. I couldn't fault the crew and very attentive the captain was chatty and pointed out some of the sights and always at hand. The food was good too and the first film was good on the overheads the second so so and the 3rd rubbish. If I had had my own IFE the flight would have been excellent.

### Iberia customer review
Copenhagen to Madrid and Madrid to Santiago. In Copenhagen problems began. When we were about to depart there was something wrong with the plane so we had to return to gate and technicians were called. After a while we were about to depart but after pushing back the same problems occurred. After a while the captain decided we should leave the airplane and wait by the gate. After an hour we boarded again and made another attempt. The same thing repeated itself again 3 times. Back to gate get off the airplane wait for boarding try to depart. After 4-5 hours the flight was cancelled and we were transported to a hotel close by. Told to meet at 9am the next day for further information. The information we got was to wait until 1pm. At 1pm we were shipped to the airport and put on the corresponding flight. This is why I can not recommend anyone fly with Iberia their planes are just not reliable.

### Iberia customer review
We flew from San Jose Costa Rica to Madrid. The plane was delayed 4 hours because the flight crew did not show up on time. Staff around the service desk were no help and were exceptionally rude. We missed our connecting flight and lied to about our seats. My husband and I were going to sit together and they put us separately. Also only 3 screens for the whole airplane (13hr journey). The food was awful. Don't understand why BA has a partnership with them.

### Iberia customer review
I flew to Santiago de Chile from Madrid on 13rd Feb 2014 on flight IB6833. At first I discovered that my seat could not move and was jammed in a straight position (on a 13hours-flight and measuring more that 1.90m it was very uncomfortable). Secondly given that I could not lay down because of my seat I decided to watch one of the movies unfortunately the plug of the earphones were broken. Last but not least the person sitting behind me arrived in the plane already drunk and kept asking for drinks to the cabin crew who never refused to serve him. At no time did the cabin crew tried to stop him from drinking. For every one of these incidents I asked the cabin crew to give me another seat which was simply refused pretending that economy class was full.

### Iberia customer review
BUE-MAD business class very good service and meals. Very attentive cabin crew only very dodgy IFE and poor selection of movies. Otherwise great flight. MAD-BUE in A340-500 with new configuration business cabin. Incredibly narrow flat seats not comfortable and very claustrophobic cabin. Excellent service great Spanish wines but same poor quality movies.

### Iberia customer review
After 12 years of choosing not to fly Iberia I thought I'd give them another chance. I flew London - Madrid - Mexico City and had to starve on these flights. Overpriced sandwiches offered on the short haul so I skipped this option thinking I could grab a bite in the airport in Madrid but thanks to a delay in London I had to rush to the gate where passengers were already boarding. Then the big surprise that on a nearly 12 hrs flight to Mexico City they only offer one hot meal and then a "snack" before landing. This is ridiculous and the crew further contributed to make the flight as unpleasant as possible by being rude and not able to accommodate the smallest and simplest requests like filling up my water bottle. I dread my return flight to London already and will make sure to carry as much food in my hand luggage as possible. As for the in-flight entertainment - it was like travelling on 30 year old planes - lousy monitors in the middle row only to far away to see anything as people continuously paced through the aisles (probably in the search of food)!

### Iberia customer review
We flew Santiago Chile to Madrid then on to LHR all in Business Class on our way back from a cruise. We flew outbound to Buenos Aries on BA Club. We researched Iberia business class before we booked about 9 months ago and were not impressed. Then it became apparent our A340-600 flight would be the new business class offering (you can tell this on the seat map if it has EF seats showing). Then when we checked in it was back to the old business class - so our expectations were low but the resulting experience was excellent. The first thing you experience is a massive amount of open space between the seat rows which gives the entire cabin a feeling of space and comfort and airiness and a lack of crowding (unlike BA Club in every way). The technology is not very good but there were two movies in English that I watched plus I slept for almost 7 hours. The food was very good but the choice was limited the service was excellent (maybe BA staff should go there and learn) as was the wine (choice limited but quality excellent). The 13 hours passed by quickly and were finished with a very nice cooked breakfast. Altogether a very pleasant experience. Next time we go to south America we will have no qualms about using Iberia Business Class.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to LHR. This flight did not begin well with very poor service at the gate in Barajas. It was completely disorganised and reminiscent of a low cost airline "scrum". This was possibly due to the fact that Iberia staff seemed more interested in checking the size of hand baggage rather than boarding passengers. Once onboard seats were uncomfortable food was over priced and cabin crew disinterested. I will go with BA next time.

### Iberia customer review
Business class from Tel Aviv to Chicago via Madrid. Overall the experience was very good. Comfortable seats friendly crew. Only thing is that the ticket that I bought on Iberia had too short of a connection and I missed my oneworld connection in Chicago. The A330 business class product is great. Very nice entertainment system comfortable seat and great overall experience. The A319 business club is a nice surprise due to the fact that all of the other European airlines flying out of Tel Aviv offer the "euro style business class" meaning they're just regular economy class seats. Only negative thing about the A319 is the entertainment system. They give you this little Sony PSP is really not easy to use and very tiny. Better off drinking and sleeping the flight away.

I returned from Jerez to Madrid in Spain with my Mother on Tuesday and I would like to thank the staff on board and the staff at the Airports in Jerez and in Madrid for the excellence of service that we received. My mother is in a wheelchair. All staff went out of their way to make her trip as comfortable as possible. I will definitely be flying with Iberia Airlines again.

### Iberia customer review
IB3926 Madrid to Gran Canaria / Las Palmas Business Class on 9 Feb 14 on an A320. It was actually an Iberia Express flight. Having just come off a BA flight to Madrid and experienced their Business Class I wasn't expecting much from Iberia Express and as a result I wasn't disappointed. What is it with airlines that give you a middle seat spare but otherwise everything else is economy. Seat pitch - about 30 inches at best no inflight entertainment some abysmal horrible tasting fish in an inedible orange sauce of some sort and the person in front reclining into your face. That's not Business Class. That's just economy with a "luck of the draw" spare seat next to you.

### Iberia customer review
I travelled from BUE to BCN via MAD. In general the service was OK. Plane was new but entertainment is virtually non-existent - you may need binoculars to see in-flight movies as they are shown on just a few screens around the cabin. My main complaint is that I reserved a seat with extra space at the emergency exit. On boarding the plane I was told that the type of aircraft had changed and I no longer had the seat that I paid for. Iberia say that I was given a seat with "similar characteristics". Reserving a normal seat costs less.

### Iberia customer review
MAD - EZE on an A340-600 in economy flight through the night taking about 13 hours. This was the third consecutive flight for us having already flown from China to LHR and on to MAD and my Iberia first impressions weren't so great. Ideally we would have gone BA LHR-EZE but price was a factor and Iberia was the cheaper though still expensive option. Luckily I'd already been travelling for 15+ hours and had stayed awake the whole time as to try and get some sleep on this flight as there was no personal IFE and just some poor quality drop-down televisions around the cabin. I don't mind this so much on a cheap airline but on a flag carrier charging full price? Come on. The flight attendants seemed grumpy and never smiled and everything seemed like a chore (compared to the lovely BA ladies). But hey it was a smooth uneventful flight important for a person like me who has always struggled with sleeping on planes. Will be flying them back next month and hopefully they've refitted their long haul A340s by then with some IFE.

### Iberia customer review
Yesterday I was flying Copenhagen-Madrid-A Coruna. First nothing is served on the plane not even a cup of coffee despite the flying time of 3.5 hours from CPH-Madrid. The planes are old-fashioned poor leg space no service. Upon arrival in Madrid Spanish officials were screaming in Spanish unable to speak English. From a kind fellow passenger I could understand that the flight to A Coruna was cancelled. We were given the options to get on a bus (approx 7 hours - from 9pm) or get a flight the next day (without hotel option). Most of us went for the bus option and picked up our luggage where after we waited for further instructions. By a total coincidence I talked to another Iberia official who seemed surprised the flight was not cancelled but I had to hurry extremely much to catch it now! In A Coruna they had lost my suitcase.

Flew MAD-UIO (Quito) - Reserved Exit Seats at extra cost thank goodness we did this as the plane's seat pitch was appalling Airbus 340-600 disgusting uncomfortable seats filthy interior meal tray was caked in left over food underneath. The plane's interior reminded me of what the Charter flights of the 70's used to look like entertainment forget it still stuck in the 70's one screen in the middle no choice of individual entertainment thank goodness for films on my i-Pad. Worst thing? the staff miserable as sin worst than this? the food indescribable eat before you get on. Took the return flight from LIM-MAD same experience.

### Iberia customer review
JFK-MAD-SCQ. I normally fly every summer to Spain with Iberia. Normally my experience is awful but last summer it was excellent. Unlike Iberia's Airbus A340-300/600 there were TVs at every seat. We had a choice of movies and TV shows. At check-in I was offered an upgrade to fly Business Class for 70 US dollars (great deal) I refused because I thought it wasn't going to be anything special. The first thing I'm going to suggest to everybody If you're taller than 6'1" I would recommend you pay 70 dollars for the upgrade. I'm 6'3" and there wasn't much leg room for me especially when the person in front of me puts their seat in a reclining position. The flight attendants were much nicer and show that they care unlike my previous experiences. Now I completely recommend Iberia they have improved a lot.

### Iberia customer review
LIS-MAD-DUS in Economy both on Airbus A320. The Madrid-Dusseldorf leg was performed by Iberia Express. I got roughly what I paid for: check-in perfect suitcase priority checked (and it arrived well and early on the belt in DUS). Lisbon-Madrid leg on time one hour flight with "service for money" which I did not use. No newspapers or entertainment at all seat pitch unbelievably tight (I am 183cms/6ft1') but for an hour I survived. Second leg to DUS on Friday evening - full "weekend load" same seating problems. For a flight of 2.5 hours it is claustrophobic particularly when a passenger in the seat in front believes she is entitled to recline her seat then you are just like a sardine in the box. Departure was 20 minutes late we carried this delay into DUS. Baggage delivery was swift far better than usual. No newspapers no entertainment (seems that the respective equipment is inactivated - I had "appreciated" it many times before on Iberia even without headphones). Seems Iberia did install further rows after changing to the new slim Recaro seats that are also in use at e.g. Lufthansa. The overhead reading lights are still in the old intervals and sometimes do not light the passengers reading material anymore but his/her neck or just the back of the seat. Service is just the one of a low cost airline. I travelled on Oneworld points thus I paid "only fees and taxes" but that was already too much. Next time it will be Swiss or Lufthansa (the original not Germanwings) again. The investment of additional points or money to upgrade into Iberia business class does not make sense because the seat pitch and the lack of newspapers are the very same.

### Iberia customer review
LHR-MAD-EZE January 2014. I'd read a few reviews of Iberia before travelling with them a few weeks ago and I'd also spoken to a number of friends who'd taken a long haul flight with them to South America. I wasn't expecting much based on these reviews and conversations however I'm happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The short hop down to Madrid was fine. You don't get complimentary drinks and food like you do on British Airways and some other full-fare European carriers but that's fine really as its not a long flight. The flight from Madrid to Buenos Aires was on a newly refurbished A340-600 which meant it came with a personal entertainment system at each seat in economy which is exactly what you need for a 12hr flight! It wasn't a bad system either with a modern touch screen. It could have done with a few more films compared to other systems such as Cathay Pacific of LAN it didn't have the widest choice but it was fine for me as this was an overnight that left at 00.30. The system was a bit glitchy to begin with and only started to properly work about 90mins into the flight. Other aspects of the flight were ok the food was pretty basic and what you might call stereotypical airline food. The staff were fine and did a good job. Would I fly with Iberia again? If I was going to Latin America and the price was right i'd consider them yes. I think this is the start of a long overdue refurb for the Spanish national carrier and I think they will only get better from here on in.

Flew Gran Canaria - Madrid Iberia Express business class. Was not expecting too much with their express offering but pleasantly surprised. Quick check in and security on time departure of this full flight on a new and clean A320. Business configured 2X2 with middle seat blocked. Pillows and blankets available. Service was delivered by hand with nice touches like post take off Cava and a tablecloth. Hot meal served by smart and competent crew (however meal tray is very like an economy meal with a foil container and no choice.) Chocolates offered before landing. Drinks were served in real glass however I believe they do not carry spirits only beer and wine. Priority tagged bag first off.

Bought return ticket from BA from London Heathrow to Accra. Flew out on BA and enjoyed normal good service. Return leg from Accra to London was on Iberia with transit via Madrid BA's OneWorld partners. I was initially happy to use Iberia - I relished the chance to pass through Madrid i.e. to sample new language culture etc. Big mistake. There was no inflight entertainment on the over 5-hour flight to Madrid (ditto on the 2-hour Madrid to London leg). Only breakfast was served for the entire duration. Leg room was very poor. On the Madrid-London flight you could only get food if you purchased it. Felt especially for mothers with young children. Would have been thoughtful if Iberia advised passengers to bring their own entertainment and food/drink on board. On the plus side really enjoyed my interactions with Spanish airport workers and co-passengers who were friendly and helpful. The return journey had all the hallmarks of a "no frills" budget airline. However the ticket was purchased at a premium (almost £1200 for the return journey in Economy class). Unless things change with Iberia they would dilute the BA brand and it is only a matter of time before customers go elsewhere. I certainly wont be flying on Iberia in the near future!

### Iberia customer review
Buenos Aires-London via Madrid. Have flown this route regularly over the years with Iberia and other airlines. This flight was a massive improvement on Iberia's previous standards. Food was tasty cabin crew friendly and helpful plane clean and had obviously been refitted with new seats and entertainment system. The latter was amazing not only compared to Iberia's previously non-existent IFE but is well up there with best in the industry (ie Emirates). Lots of choice great touch screen and sound quality. Don't know if this is the result of the BA merger but its a big improvement. Keep it up Iberia and people might even start choosing you when you're not the cheapest!

### Iberia customer review
JFK-MAD return Nov 2013. IB now charges $40 to select seats which I did not. Seats assigned at airport. Allowed check in online from New York but not from Madrid. Outbound A340 window seat foot space limited by equipment but good 32" pitch no IFE. Inbound new A330 tighter seats so they compensate with good PTV. I flew IB two years before and A340 aircraft was falling apart doors and seat trays held together by duct tape. Edible food and complimentary wine. Inbound boarding at MAD gate agent asked to check my carry on due to full plane. My small bag was among first out the carousel at JFK.

Flew from TLV via MAD to LIM. TLV-MAD was an extremely old plane. No entertainment at all for 5 hours. No leg room at all. I am only 176 cm and could not sit comfortably. Luckily no one was next to me so had a seat empty. MAD-LIM-MAD. 2 different aircraft's. These are 11-12 hour flights. No personal TV (the LIM-MAD was a new plane and no personal screen). Tried to check in online. I could have purchased the tickets on a code share with LAN and paid a bit more and would have been much happier.

### Iberia customer review
FRA-MAD-FRA in Economy operated by Iberia Express. Plane was new and modern crew friendly (though zero service unless you pay for a glass of tea) but legroom was terrible. Perhaps with the exception of a certain low budget airline I haven't been on a plane where I (1.92m) was unable to sit just because I could not squeeze my legs in. Fortunately the first flight was half empty and on return I chose an aisle seat. For the legroom issue I will not fly them again.

### Iberia customer review
IB 6274 25 Dec Chicago to Madrid. I found everything much better than many reviews claimed. I was expecting everything to be bad but was pleasantly surprised. It was a newer Airbus and I found the leg room good since I'm 6ft and was worried. Now I must say the leg room in the cheap seats going to Spain from Chicago was less than the trip back. Plane was clean and smelled nice. I fly American frequently and would trade Iberia for American any day.

Mexico to Madrid 12 hours of unacceptable service seats uncomfortable no monitor on the seats - 12 hours without watching a movie we could do nothing!

### Iberia customer review
Very bad experience on flight IB6844 Buenos Aires-Madrid on Dec 31st. Iberia had me travel 12hrs at night with my baby in my arms even though I had booked a bassinet 3 months ahead. According to the staff this was due to a change of equipment. They did not warn me at anytime before embarking. They did not offer anything (not even an extra pillow) and made no effort to improve our comfort under the excuse that the flight was overbooked. When I suggested they disembark me and reschedule me on a flight in which I could have a bassinet they made no effort to check on which flight I could actually travel and threatened me to call authorities if I did not make my mind immediately despite their inability to provide basic information. I carried on with this flight to avoid ending up stranded for several days. This was just surreal and a very unpleasant experience. On the bright side passengers around me were comforting and helpful.

### Iberia customer review
ORD-MAD-TFN-MAD-ORD. In a word: horrific All flights (every one of them) left late and did not attempt to make up the time in flight. Boarding was chaotic. It would make sense to load the flight from the back to the front but not with Iberia. Seemingly random assignment of 'groups' resulting in lots of lost time while folks at the front of the plane get their stuff in the overhead bins holding up everyone else trying to get to the back of the plane. Staff was sulky and unhelpful. Service was poor. Security lapse by Iberia staff at the gate caused a twenty minute delay which resulted in a short connection time in Madrid. Though we made it to the gate with twenty minutes to spare (because we ran the whole way) we were not allowed to board. Lost a work day because of it. I would rather walk than take Iberia again.

Madrid to Rio de Janeiro 27th December 2013 IB6025. Truly awful: the long haul equivalent of Ryanair. Flew from Heathrow via Madrid to Rio de Janeiro. Meal preferences not recorded (despite checking 3 times) so nothing to eat. Old fashioned plane fixtures and fittings to match. No inflight entertainment (audio or visual) as both malfunctioning and despite being asked to be seated away from children I was surrounded by 6 including 2 newborns right next to me who cried more or less the whole journey. With nothing to watch the flight was rowdy. I am a very frequent flier at least once a week if not more - and this was truly one of the worst flying experiences that I've ever had.

SCL-MAD A340-600. I took this flight back in November 2011. Flight scheduled at 14.05 (Chilean time) and to land in MAD at 07.00 (European time). Efficient boarding and nice staff. Because of some cargo issue the plane did not take off until 14.40. The captain though said not to worry and that flight conditions were good and we would fly over 1000 km/h to reach MAD even before scheduled landing time. However about 4.5 hours into the flight not far from Sao Luis the flight encountered quite some turbulence with lightning and had to deviate towards Fortaleza. The turbulence went on during the whole Atlantic cruise. I have flown about 20 times from Spain to South America but this was my most turbulent flight. Finally the flight touched ground in Madrid at 09.25 and I lost my connection. But overall good experience.

MAD-SCL A340-600 30/12/2012. I arrived the T4 at Barajas at 21.00 and checked in efficiently at the Business counters with professional and polite staff. From there I went through the fast track security control also efficient and quick. My transfer from T4 to T4S went smooth. At the T4S I went to the Iberia business lounge which was spacious with great food and wines and with good views. After eating I had a rest in one of the beds in the quiet room. At 23.30 I proceeded to my gate. Boarding was on time and I was one of the first to enter. This was a very new Airbus 340-600. My seat was 1 A. I received a personal greeting together with a glass of champagne which was very pleasant. Slightly turbulent on-time take off. When airborne the pilot greeted us and informed us that the nights 13.20 hrs route would be: Lisbon-Canary Islands-Sao Luis-Tocantin-Santiago del Estero-Santiago de Chile. The sky was clear all the way over the Atlantic with some turbulence when approaching Brazilian territory. The seat was a fully flat bed with great width and length very comfortable to sleep in. The cell phone charger did not work but staff went "out of their way" to fix it. Food was great. I had scallops. The staff was personal and pleasant all the way. All in all a great business class experience! We touched ground at 09.30 in Santiago to a beautiful summer morning.

MAD-LHR-MAD. Checking-in online Iberia wanted 15€ for changing a preselected seat I didn't expect that as I my fare wasn't the basic one. I think they should change that. Outbound flight delayed for two hours due to problems with UK traffic control Iberia sent me a SMS informing about the delay even before the screens at the airport showed it. Staff on ground were attentive and helpful at check-in and handling the delay. The plane was an A321 and it was comfortable with good legroom crew were fine and the captain explained the cause of the delay and apologized. We arrived at LHR with no other issue. I was able to change my seat for free at online check-in for the LHR-MAD flight. Airport experience on the return leg was good BA staff was very nice. We boarded the plane on time but the flight was delayed for 30 min because there were problems with the tug truck so not Iberia's fault. The plane was an A340 and it was very spacious it had sockets between the seats so I was able to charge my phone. Crew were fine again and we arrived in Madrid with a 20 minutes delay. I got a very good price for my ticket and although both flights were delayed it wasn't Iberia's fault and they handled the situation well so I have no complaints about them apart from the fee for changing the seat on the outbound flight that's why I score them with a 7 instead of a 9.

My wife and I have just flown from London Heathrow to San Jose in Costa Rica via Madrid. The flight to Madrid was delayed for a day due to air traffic control breaking down in England. While Heathrow airport ground to a halt the information given to the waiting masses was virtually non existent. Many people were asked to queue for hours at desks only to be told that they were at the wrong desk and should have spent hours queuing somewhere else. It seemed that the only place to get information was to watch the television screens and catch the news reports. The onward flight from Madrid to San Jose was very disappointing for a long haul. The entertainment system was a few screens dotted around the plane that you may or may not get a decent view of. The staff seemed fairly efficient at the start of the flight but their enthusiasm very quickly waned along with their smiles. The legroom was ok and so was the food nothing special but it probably wouldn't kill you. All in all the whole experience was lacklustre. The staff seemed to find the passengers a bit of an inconvenience and everything seemed a bit of an effort. Then they lost one of our cases and still have no idea where it is!

### Iberia customer review
New York (JFK) - Madrid (MAD) round trip in new business class with lie flat bad. The full lie flat bad seats are comfortable but the tiny foot cubby can be an issue for passengers with a foot size larger than US10. The seat shell is not quite solid in my observation so the noises and kicking from the adjacent passengers are noticeable. The window seats on the two sides are better choices for people looking for more privacy. The cabin is airy and clean. The TV screen is large and crystal clear. Its also a touch screen so quite convenient to choose programs without using remote control. Though movies are quite limited. The food is edible but just not great. Amenity kit is cheaply made and not branded. The wine and liquor selections on the contrary are great and in good quality. I have to say service is cavalier and indifferent on both legs. I had to remind the crews what I asked for several times. Some staffs barely speak English. In conclusion Iberia provides one of the best hard products between New York and Madrid. But they need to improve the catering and service urgently.

We flew with from Madrid to San Jose and from Miami to Madrid this month and were very disappointed by the service the comfort and the general attitude of the staff. Travelling with my husband we asked at check in to be sat together we were assured we were sat next to each other. We did not check at the time but found out that we were in opposite side of the plane. The plane is far from being great only a few screens depending on where you are sat you can hardly see the screen. The air hostesses are very unfriendly and not helpful. They hardly speak any English. Very bad experience I usually don't put much importance on the airline we fly with but would avoid Iberia by all mean from now on. Also lost the luggage on the way to San Jose got them 2 days later luckily.

Flew from Madrid to Lima. Poor service throughout. Staff rarely seen and totally ignored call button on three occasions. Food was totally inedible; hardly ate anything throughout the flight. Request for a simple alternative e.g vegetarian turned down as not possible. Seat comfort poor and A340 needs updating. Total waste of business class fare. Will avoid Iberia whenever I can.

### Iberia customer review
Meal: Offered only one meal on board in the business class: Fish along with a mussels salad. Great choice for someone who is allergic to seafood. Ordered them to go to the economy class to grab there some food for me. Overall: the food (the fish and salad) looked like already eaten. Seats: Great leg space (I'm more than 1.90m tall) but the seat only provides a foot rest for people with a max size of 1.70m. My tip: If you are tall don't go with Iberia. Flight attendants: Each flight attendant has one aisle. So in total it is approx. 20 people. The flight to Buenos Aires takes something like 12 hrs. So enough time to remember that I don't speak Spanish. After the dinner there shouldn't be a break of 12 hrs. Maybe you ask people if they want to get some (non-alcoholic) drinks instead of letting them walk to the galley all the time. Equipment: Really poor. Take a look at American Airlines. They know how to handle that.

I flew MAD-MIA - it was my first intercontinental with Iberia. I was led to believe this is one of their best routes in terms of aircraft and service. That may be the case but compared to other airlines the service and product were poor. A new aircraft but entertainment system had very poor selection of movies for such a long flight - almost nothing current. The navigation was slow and system crashed twice. The worse thing was the staff. The flight attendants on the few occasions one sees them are rude. They assume that UK or US citizens can't speak English and on three occasions I heard they say very rude comments in Spanish to non Spanish speakers - sarcastic rude and unhelpful. There was no pre-flight safety check and again before landing no cabin check. We landed with people not belted and seats reclined. I rarely fly economy but on this occasion it was part of a special priced global ticket. It just made me feel that in an emergency it would be hard to get out of the aircraft as people were not ready for landing. I would imagine that on an emergency the staff would be unreliable. An airline that does not take safety seriously shouldn't be flying. Almost all of the 9 hours the staff was on the back galley talking. One was smoking one of those vapour cigarettes - not seen that on duty. When I asked for a glass of water they three flight attendants said they were on their break and pulled the curtain. I had one drink in 9 hours served with the meal. Iberia is a disgrace. In short don't fly with Iberia - poor attitude poor product and questionable safety procedures (or lack off).

### Iberia customer review
The website wouldn't allow me to enter my passenger information details before the flight nor choose my seat etc. even though I was flying business as it kept mentioning an error message without providing any explanation on what the error was (from my side perhaps?). The online check in was fine. The flight to Madrid was fine. The business lounge in Madrid was nothing special at all: the greeting was average the offerings rather limited in terms of food selection and the wifi was not complimentary. The MAD-MIA leg of the flight was nice food was fine the service polite the inflight entertainment options were very limited quiet boring in fact as well as a bit cumbersome to navigate. The seat reclines to totally flat however the seat design and configuration is not the most comfortable with the footrest on the side of the seat in front basically you are always sitting on an angle.

### Iberia customer review
IB flight from LHR to EZE in Buenos Aires. This was an extremely poor experience. The aircraft was old with no in- flight entertainment in the backs of the seats. Extremely small seats which were uncomfortable and no online seat selection options. There was no inflight entertainment bar three films which were shown on a drop-down screen. There were two animated films despite the lack of children on the flight. The staff were disinterested at best and rude at worst. Absolutely avoid Iberia if you have an option with any other carrier. It is a miserable experience.

MAD-LHR A320 check in and fast track in just 5 min business lounge nice with plenty of food drinks wifi. Boarding on time nice FA. Plane a bit old seat not very comfortable. Very nice hot breakfast. arrival on time T5.

### Iberia customer review
BCN-MAD-LPA-MUC using Avios and was not disappointed on a single flight. All flights on time or with a maximum 15 mins delay loads of room good food and plenty of attention from very friendly crews (the only thing you have to know that they are reserved but will do anything to make you comfortable if you ask for anything).

### Iberia customer review
Madrid -Zurich A319. First big disappointment is that when you want to check-in online you can not select anymore a seat and the system by default assigns you a middle seat. If you want to select your seat you have to pay an additional EUR15€ - pure rip off! The seats on the planes are cramped closely together. Food is only available against payment (and expensive) not even a glass of water is served free of charge! No entertainment no newspaper - Iberia has really become a low service but not low cost operator.

### Iberia customer review
BCN-MAD-BCN. Boarding was very fast in both airports due to the air shuttle entrance the lounge at Madrid was really amazing and the seats had lots of space in business cabin the meal was better than many intercontinental economy class flights and the service very attentive. We left the plane in a moment and we were out of the airport before excepted.

Wife and I flew to Venice. We were pleasantly surprised. Service the food and arrival time was all pretty good. We were not expecting anything too good going by the reviews we read before leaving. Goes to show you can not go by what some people say all the time.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-LIM-MAD-LHR with Iberia was a far better experience than I had expected. All flights on time with clean well presented aircraft smiling crews plenty of food (on the long haul sectors). All in all a good experience. The only down side is the lack of seat back IFE on the A340-600s at this point.

### Iberia customer review
I fly Iberia at least 4 times every month. I have to say that the airline is working much better now. Most of the flights arrive on time the fleet is quite new and the crew has made an effort with better service. I have made the BRU-MAD flight often and they are always on time. Last week I flew MAD-MIA. The flight was pleasant the seat comfortable the individual screen is wonderful good films TV series and music. The minus point: the food was not good at all! The ravioli were disappointing and the salad was very poor. The crew were efficient but I think some members of staff should make more of an effort they speak in a very abrupt way.

### Iberia customer review
Sao Paulo to Madrid on 29/9/2013 was good. The service was ok. The plane an A340-300 had an old seat configuration. In 2009 I had a not so good experience with this airline but this time I was satisfied with their service.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-UIO-GYE-MAD. Pleasantly surprised - new A340-600 was comfortable and new MAD terminal is excellent. Service and food far better on return and more attention (although not great) from cabin crew. Late departure from GYE but most of delay made up in flight so made our LHR connection with BA.

### Iberia customer review
We had fabulous flights from SFO to Madrid and back. I cannot say enough about the food attentiveness of the staff the on- time flights the comfort of the seats good movies amenities etc. Only thing - the bathrooms were just as tiny and old as in economy.

### Iberia customer review
I flew Iberia last April only because the price (about 80 Euros) between Lisbon and Madrid was lower than TAP Portugal Air Europa or Easyjet. I didn't have high expectations at all because I was tired of hearing very bad comments about the company. But during my round trip one hour on each leg things went ok. We embarked on an A321 on schedule and flights were very comfortable. The crew were a bit old but very professional. Iberia didn't serve any food on this 45 minutes flight between LIS-MAD and then between MAD-LIS. Terminal 4 in Barajas is very comfortable clean and organized. It was a good experience on Iberia considering the bad expectations and comments that I heard before my trip. I will chose Iberia again.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Bogota on new seat configuration for A340/600. Awful experience! Seats are crammed and uncomfortable staff are rude food is so so. If you can avoid Iberia. Only good thing is the tray table that can be pushed aside so that you can get up which out having to clear it first. The new seat configuration has certainly gained for Iberia a few more seats but this means for the traveller an incredible loss of comfort. It looks like you are in a cage and keep bumping with everything. When seated on one side of the seat there is an unmovable table which takes up so much space and one of your arms cannot move freely without bumping into it. Under this table is where the feet of the fellow victim behind you are resting. When laying down be careful when trying moving your feet! You will bump into the tray of your fellow passenger in front of you and it will hurt I can assure you. Regarding inflight entertainment earphones are far from noise cancelling. Movies are only available in Spanish or English. They say they have up to 50 movies but I could only find 2 of interest. My TV set crashed and it took 30 minutes for the flight attendant to reset it. But I understand them there were only 4 of them for so many rows of business cages to take care of. This does not explain anyway their bad attitude. One lady asked for the complimentary beauty kit when she boarded the plane and the flight attendant told her "not now!". Food is served in a rush smiles are rare and far in between. After serving food staff just disappear. Food is so so. On a 10 hours flight they gave us only one meal and wine choice is limited to five Spanish wines and one champagne (Spanish cava). It has to be said that the wines are good. Some of the starters were nice but the main dish was not. Presentation is extremely poor as table is not laid out for you but food is served inside small plastic boxes on a tray. Very little difference with what you get in economy class. The hot towel was coldish and did not serve its purpose. Bathroom was never cleaned soap and toilet paper finished one hour before arrival.

### Iberia customer review
My flight from NYC to Madrid was not pleasant. After being served dinner I realize some sauce had spilled on my sweater. I asked the flight attendant if she had some seltzer and showed her the spot. She abruptly stated go to the bathroom. I was sitting a few rows from the back of the plane and when breakfast was served the last few rows was waiting for juice. About 2 rows ahead of me they stop serving and took the carts straight to the back. The people on the other side of the plane had no problem being served. I had the center row all to myself. The only way I could get a cup of coffee was to run to the other side of the plane when the attendant came close to my row. Also the day before my flight I received an email stating that I approved my flight change. I ended up staying on the phone for 2 hours. The person that served me was very helpful. My flight was booked through British Airways and when she called Iberia they first told her the flight was cancelled (the flight was never cancelled). She got me back on the flight I had booked.

MIA-MAD. Check in at Miami fast no lines. Fast track for security and great Premium lounge at E-gates shared with AA and BA. Boarding on time new A330 comfortable seating window seat feels very private. All seats direct access to aisle. Crew was great on this night flight pre-drinks offered quick dinner if you wanted to (was my case) and could manage 7hrs sleep. Early arrival at Madrid baggage quick on belt.

### Iberia customer review
This is an airline to be avoided. I paid top dollar for a flight from Madrid to Milan because it was an integral part of a European vacation. I knew I was being had at the time when I saw that the same trip could be booked late for a fraction of what I paid (but I was prepared to live with that because I needed to certainty of knowing the flight was booked). What I cannot accept is the appalling service at check-in. Why do they even bother to have an on-line service - it means nothing. On top of that they have lost my baggage.

### Iberia customer review
I flew London to Lima via Madrid. The planes were clean and the staff were courteous and friendly. They deserve praise. Also all the planes were on time and the lounges in Madrid were fine. (Except for the absence of English- language newspapers). On board the seat configuration international meals and in-flight entertainment were from another age. Passengers are just not used to six abreast in Europe and on trans-continental flights nowadays. The food was below what Cathay Pacific served in economy 30 years ago.

### Iberia customer review
BCN-MAD-LCG. Very pleasant flight to Madrid with polite crew and comfortable seats for a short haul flight although no food is served. Then we had a 1hr and 15min layover in Madrid and Iberia staff was very helpful and responded all our questions with a smile. The leg to La Coruna was very pleasant with a nice crew and fine seats. We landed early 20 minutes before scheduled time. I will fly again Iberia and I would recommend it to friends.

MAD-MIA on beautiful new A330-300. Slightly early departure and arrival. Pretty good seat for economy with state- of-the-art entertainment system and plush cushion and blanket. But poor and scant food and detached customer relations.

This was a flight from Vigo to London via Madrid. After flight from Vigo was delayed 1 hour not even water or coffee served during 1 hour flight. Arriving in Madrid 20 minute delay to disembark due to being given wrong gate. Madrid to London flight selling food and drinks to passengers didn't even get to last row before landing. Staff attitude that you cannot even have a cup of water without paying. Overall experience very poor given that ticket wasn't 'Ryanair' type prices at all. Never again!

### Iberia customer review
MAD-MUC-MAD in A321 and in A319. Flights on time no problems with luggage. Good staff but in MAD we had to use the self check in machines for our luggage. It was not possible to do it with the staff unless you were flying in a group. Food and drinks were not free and although some prices were cheaper than in the airport they were not cheap. There was not inflight entertainment. It was not a long flight to America but I think that even in Europe you could have some music. No problems but I think that as Iberia is not a low cost airline they should give you more for your money.

### Iberia customer review
IBZ-MAD - Operated by Iberia Express. Flight times changed but no one from Iberia told us until we tried to check in meaning we'd have a really quick connection in Madrid. The check in staff were good enough to give us 2 seats in the front row of economy so we could get off quickly. Asked for quick connection tags on bags told no need they'll make your connection. Crew where friendly enough leg room was appalling! Amount of hand baggage that was allowed on was a total joke as was the rudeness of the passengers sat in front who felt the need to recline their seats before we'd even pushed back. No meal service or BOB due quick flight time but arrived on time into Madrid then taxied to the furthest gate possible! Got of quickly onto Jetty then made to go down onto the ramp and get a bus around the airport wasting a good 10mins we didn't have to play with to make our BA connection. Madrid Airport is a nightmare to connect in due to it's vast size and lo and behold after a very good BA flight we get to T5 and no bags! Thank god BA do IB's customer service at LHR as they got our bags back very quickly!

### Iberia customer review
Barcelona-Madrid-Chicago business class. We had very low expectations but were pleasantly surprised. The VIP lounges in BCN and MAD were very comfortable with a nice range of snacks and beverages. BCN-MAD sector was your regular short haul J class service with a reasonable breakfast. Upon boarding the MAD-ORD sector we were served pre take off drinks by and friendly and happy crew. They handed out cute amenity kits and served a lovely four course meal with matching Spanish wines. The cabin manager introduced herself to the entire cabin individually and took our lunch orders. Just prior to landing in ORD she again went through the cabin thanking everyone. Another light meal was serviced before landing and there were snacks available in the galley between services. The bathrooms were kept clean and all of the crew were friendly the entire trip. The seats were well maintained and fully flat although this aircraft was not fitted with the new IB seats. The only slight left down for the experience was the IFE which only came on about a hour into the flight and the choice of moves was limited to around 10 movies and none of them were that recent.

### Iberia customer review
Recently flew from Boston to Madrid with Iberia. The worst flight experience I have had. No welcome from flight crew as we boarded the aircraft. Rude flight crew terrible service and terrible meal service. Iberia will never see me onboard their aircraft's again. I can fly to Europe with a more professional airline that caters to customer service.

### Iberia customer review
Tangiers to London Heathrow via Madrid. The second leg of my journey (Madrid-London) was with Iberia. Aircraft was an A340. The seat was comfortable and the staff were ok no smiles but no bad service so I can't really comment on that. The journey itself was uncomfortable but can't blame Iberia as the weather is not in their hands. The only complaint I have with Iberia is that I checked in 3 bags and only 1 arrived I had to wait at the airport for nearly 6 hours to collect them what should of been a 4 hour journey ended up as 12 hours.

### Iberia customer review
Business Class LHR-Alicante-Madrid. Do not consider 3 seats being used for 2 people as Business Class. Very good BC lounge. Unable to check in online for return journey. At Madrid again used the lounge and did some shopping. Our boarding cards which show priority and clearly seating in BC shows boarding ends 10 minutes before departure. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes before departure and were told the gate had closed and we would not be allowed to board. Had a very officious supervisor who was not going to budge and insisted the gate closed 15 minutes before departure. She would not agree with what was printed on our boarding card and said that it was wrong. Eventually someone must have said something sensible to her because she finally caved in and allowed us to board. She would not however stop arguing - even when we were walking down the finger to get on the aircraft. To add insult to injury we sat on the aircraft for 10 minutes before 2 female passengers with a child boarded and went through to the economy area. Priority on our boarding card was obviously lost on that member of staff.

MAD-VGO. Operated by Iberia Express. Excellent check-in fast track security and lounge. Onboard service was nice on this short flight. Crew was composed of young women very well groomed and enthusiastic. The plane was 22-years- old but it was very well maintained and it didn't seem that old as it was equipped with new lavatories cabin panels racks seats etc. We arrived 10 minutes early and my bag was the first to come out on the belt.

### Iberia customer review
Iberia Express: Even though you book Iberia you're being dispatched to any carrier that flies under their codeshare agreement or any new venture that they have founded. Not a positive approach for frequent flyers. This flight from Alicante to Madrid was operated by Iberia Express. I did hear about this before but if this is a cheaper airline then why did I have to pay a premium price? The plane an old A320 with new leather seats was packed with far too many seats. The cabin attendants a bunch of young women better groomed then Iberia classic but less 'cool' and professional. The English announcements were so bad that words can't describe. How can this airline be part of an airline alliance such as one world. The worst on this flight was the sound that played each time they made a public announcement. Just like on the old Iberia planes. After landing they announced how proud we can be of them being 10 minutes early and that the statistics can be found on the net about this. Even though touch down was ahead of time I'd much prefer to be 10 minutes ahead of time out of the plane.

First time flying out of USA to Europe. Miami-Madrid great flight! We had an Airbus 340 and everything went great! The food and service was 10x better than most American airlines (airlines that operate in the US). Flight attendants were so nice. Then we took a flight from Madrid-Paris that went well! We went on Economy Class and they treated us like in 1st class the whole way! I sat next to the window which was a big plus. Overall very happy with Iberia.

Very disappointed. We flew Madrid to Los Angeles on an airbus A300. This is a long flight (13 Hours) with no back seat screens only old TV sets which you had to crane your neck to see. Awful movies. My husband's earphone connection was broken. Food was dreadful. When we arrived in Los Angeles we had to wait another 45 minutes for an Air France plane to move out of our docking area. I will not fly with Iberia again.

Brussels-Guayaquil (via Madrid and Quito) at 6/7/13 and return from Quito to Brussels (via Guayaquil and Madrid) at 27/7/13. Flight from Brussels to Madrid operated by an Airbus 321. Lots of legroom food and drinks for purchase. Boarding in zones and on time departure. Intercontinental flight to Guayaquil with a stop in Quito was operated with an Airbus 330-200. No individual entertainment and lesser legroom than on the flight from Brussels to Madrid. Flight from Madrid to Quito was 11hrs 10mins long. Boarding in zones started on time but plane left the gate one hour late. Food was average and FA's (none were smiling) were not seen between the meals. Landed in Quito an hour late. Announcement made that passengers for Guayaquil must leave the plane and wait in the lounge in Quito. For the short hop to Guayaquil (30 mins in the air) boarding was again well organised and the captain apologised for the delay from Madrid. Arrived 50 mins late in Guayaquil. FA's friendlier on that short hop. Return from Quito. No departure tax was needed to pay because everything was included in the ticketprice. Same old plane Airbus 330-200 service and entertainment (showed only 2 films instead of 3) and also the legroom was the same as at outbound flight. Departed in Quito and in Guayaquil punctual and we arrived 10mins early at the gate in Madrid. At the stop in Guayaquil we had to again leave the plane and go trough security. Punctual departure to Brussels with an airbus 321 with more legroom than the intercontinental flight. Food and drinks for purchase. Arrived at Brussels 20mins early at the gate. Luggage arrived at the same time when we arrived at the luggage claim area.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-UIO-GYE-MAD-LHR. Pre-selected seats for an additional fee several months in advance however informed a few weeks before departure that our selected seats weren't available for outbound flight. Had flown into Madrid on a BA codeshare from Heathrow and legroom was probably better than on the long haul Iberia flight. Seat on Iberia has a box which severely reduces legroom. Inflight entertainment was poor however we had prepared for this and knew about it beforehand. Food was pretty good and cabin crew were reasonably approachable. Landed in Quito 20 mins late. Return flight: At check-in they told us that our pre-reserved seats had been sold to someone else. A departure tax had been retrospectively added a cost which Iberia should have absorbed. Flight to Madrid involved a technical stop in Guayaquil. Flight between Quito and Guayaquil was delayed however the real shocker was when the plane had to turn around an hour after leaving Guayaquil and make an emergency medical landing. Significant delays were caused. When had taken off for a second time out of Guayaquil we were carrying a 4.5 hour delay. When we finally landed in Madrid we were advised that there were no available connections to Heathrow that night so we needed to overnight in Madrid to fly out the following day. Iberia agent who helped us with hotel vouchers etc. was quite helpful and had clearly exhausted all possible routes to London. Stayed overnight at a hotel at Iberia's expense and the following morning to the earliest flight back to London arriving 15 hours later than scheduled. Service was very poor will try to avoid.

London - Quito via Madrid. Terrible. Food: I ordered vegetarian it was a disaster the main dish was rice with about 3 green beans. Vegetarian on Iberia means vegan so no yoghurt cheese or anything interesting. Leaves you starving. Seats: Old and tatty. No entertainment system on an intercontinental flight! Staff hide for most of the trip. The only reason I booked Iberia was that they offer a flexible economy flight for less that their competitors and I needed flexibility. Not recommended.

MAD-LAX Business Plus. Worst business class flight I have experienced. Ground staff were good. The Lounge at MAD pier was OK. The service on board was abysmal. They brought around papers and magazines but there were no English publications only Spanish. Secondly not a smile from any of the crew at any time in fact they all bordered on rude. It is obvious that the customer is in the way of them enjoying themselves. Drinks were not served until 1 hour after take off. No welcome drink. The hot towels were cold and damp. The food where do you start? Starter tuna salad 2 small strips of tuna on lettuce and cold soup out of a packet. The main was veal 2 thin strips and some spinach. There was plenty of bread and wine but the food left you feeling hungry. The snack bar was not replenished. I asked for a diet coke and was sighed at by a crew member and did not get it. This is not business class food nor service. The seat was broken and did not extend. I reported it to a crew member but nothing was done not even an apology. The AVOD system had 8 B rated films that were years old. Overall it is pathetic excuse for a business class experience. I can only thank my lucky stars I am flying BA Club home. I will never set foot on Iberia again.

BRU-MVD-BRU via MAD. Delighted to know they have stopped the MAD-MVD services. It obliged me to find other ways to get to MVD. This company is good on short haul flights and on the phone when you are a platinum customer. For the rest either on board or check in they are just a disaster. The crew are sulky and lazy and they do not want to do their jobs correctly. Once you've boarded late at night for the intercontinental legs staff disappear. Services like food drinks and amenities are just a joke and cleanliness of the cabin and toilets just does not happen! Old and tatty planes. Goodbye Iberia - just hope I never have to board one of your planes again. However must admit that I will be happy to try their new A330 services.

IB 6345 25th June Madrid to Panama City. Plane was clearly in need of a refit everything was old. The crew also seemed tired and not at all interested in what they were doing. My seat when it reclined to make it a bed had something broken on the arm. I informed the head of cabin crew and after some effort he came to my seat and noticed the fact. He did not present any excuses only said that he would inform the maintenance that a repair was needed. They had one meal less so at first they were unable to give me the entrees and they with excuses provided me with a salad from the crew saying that it better than what they had served to the rest of the passengers. In the whole it was a very unpleasant experience. Iberia should be avoided whenever there are other options.

I booked with BA and my return flight from Nice to Madrid to Boston was Iberia. I figured BA would only partner with something comparable - wrong! Old planes with terrible seats and no individual entertainment system. Only one tiny screen for the cabin with one movie on an 8 hour flight! I thought I had travelled back to 1981. Rude flight attendants who have no real interest in helping anyone. Even the food was pretty poor.

25/7/12 from Manchester to Madrid and on to Lima. Long delay at airport. Rude unhelpful staff who couldn't care less about their customers. Inedible food. Non existent inflight entertainment. Uncomfortable smaller than average seats. To cap it all a party of older teenagers ran up and down the cabin screeching to each other and playing loud music! When I mentioned (very politely) to the cabin crew that the noise was very loud she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Worst of all was the lack of cleanliness! I will not use them again.

Before arrival in Spain the served breakfast but I just had coffee so no comments on this. After arrival cleared customs and bags fast on belt.

First time on Iberia. Company booked me on Iberia for my business from from JFK-BCN via Madrid Airport. For my 7+ hour initial flight to Madrid from JFK the plane was so old that it didn't have any kind of entertainment system at all! I was shocked to see that this kind of plane still existed! Food was decent flight attendants were average seats were very uncomfortable and small. I'm a 5'7" female and even to me the legroom was very tight so I kept on hitting the seat in front of me. I can't imagine a man taller than 6ft sitting there. Only into 2 hours into the flight my bottom started to hurt. Chairs are very awkwardly set-up as in angles and very uncomfortable. I will not be flying Iberia again.

### Iberia customer review
Still inconsistent food. Some times very good other times indifferent. My review below of MAD-BOG mentioned the food still being mediocre. However having just taken my return flight from Bogota to Madrid I must praise the delicious food on offer. It was so good I asked for seconds. The 'consommé' was very tasty although it came with the usual Iberia boring bits of cheese and greens for starters. For main I went for a delicious chicken stuffed with vegetables and blue cheese. The cabin service director spoke to every single passenger in the very full business cabin just after take off and before landing. I thought this was very good service. He took his time to do this and all FAs were smiley and efficient just as they should be. Iberia is improving for sure. Sadly the new modern seats wont be available on the Latin American service for a while ad they are putting then only in the new A330s which will gradually replace the old A340s.

LHR to MAD MAD to Santiago in Business class. All I can say is do not use this airline. I fly many times a year on many airlines and these were by far the worst. There are too many issues to list but here are a couple. LHR to MAD - awful food and a choice of cheap red or white wine. Disinterested cabin crew. Aircraft too hot. MAD to Santiago - No choice of main course. When I said I don't eat fish I was informed that was all there is. Had to wait 10 mins for milk for my tea. My second cup came with no spoon also lukewarm. Breakfast awful. Cabin crew once again disinterested.

Having travelled from Tel Aviv to Madrid and back for several years now and though I always preferred El-Al for this route Iberia pilots are very good. I have noticed an improvement in staff attitude in the past two flights (flight attendants used to be so impolite now it is mostly friendly) . English proficiency should be dramatically improved though. Food was also a little better on my last flights. If they carry on the good job I will definitely recommend Iberia.

MIA-MAD flew brand new 330-300 business class experienced the new flat seats. As for the seats Iberia tries to copy the BA concept but they avoid the rear facing seats result some seats have nice privacy others are quite exposed to the cabin. Seat does lie totally flat but the space for the feet is extremely narrow result jury still out. Service traditional slow unfriendly Iberia service in business class more than one hour after take off before any service to the cabin the crew was busy chatting! Breakfast does not accommodate for those that want to sleep full cabin brightness and loud voices from the crew.

LHR-MAD-LIM and UIO-MAD-LHR. Could not check in online for outbound flight. Delayed on inbound flight and cases lost for 24 hours. Not enough cabin staff. Food consistently horrible. Could not see overhead screens. Headphone socket broken on outbound flight. Toilets on inbound flight dirty and out of toilet paper. First and last time with Iberia.

SJO-MAD. Day before flying Iberia contacted me to notify delayed flight due to weather situation at San Jose Airport. Anyway I was told to go to the airport at Schedule time for check in and then sent to a nearby hotel for 8 hours. Dinner voucher given. Then again to airport departing nearly 12am (flight was supposed to leave 5pm). Boarding ok FA and crew apologized several time for the delay but it was due to weather. Finally pleasant experience nice seats food ok. On arrival bags quickly on belt.

BRU-MAD-LIS-MAD-BRU first weekend of June in business. Was disappointed in quality of lounge luggage lost in Brussels after a beautiful weekend food was nothing more than average check-in chaotic with nervous passengers FA's and seats were excellent.

### Iberia customer review
Have taken two flights to South America with Iberia the food is dreadful and lack of inflight entertainment is unacceptable in these modern planes. I found the Spanish crew on all the flights very rude but the English crew couldn't do enough for you. There are some pluses: the planes were on time good connection times and the seats are comfortable. The prices are far cheaper than the other airlines and for me the advantages outweigh the disadvantages so much I'm back to South America again with Iberia next year!

### Iberia customer review
I have been using Iberia for many years to get to Bogota and on my recent trip on 15 May in Business Plus I noticed an improvement in service and attitude of the flight attendants in line with the attempt to improve service after the merger with British Airways. Yet the food is still dreadful. FAs now smile and go out of their way to make one's journey comfortable but the overall better experience flying with Iberia is overshadowed by the airlines inability to offer good food despite the fact that Spain has some of the most interesting and tasty good in the world.

MAD-GUA. Check in Madrid less than 5 min. Fast track for security made it to the lounge at the satellite terminal in 15 min. Great business lounge lots of food and drink. Boarding on time. Welcome by FA with drinks. Flight departed 15 min late. On board comfortable seating flat bed. Very nice lunch and afternoon snack before arrival. Very pleasant flight nice service. Arrival on time.

MUC-MAD-XRY / XRY-MAD-MUC. After delays in Jerez and having explained to 4 different staff that my suitcase had to make all the connections as I had an onward flight to South Africa my suitcase did not make it and I received it about 60 hours later. Not pleasant when you have no change of clothes or toiletries. I was not once offered vouchers for toiletries neither did I receive an apology this after I had complained numerous times. The only reason people fly Iberia is because it is cheap. Customer service is horrific.

### Iberia customer review
LHR-MAD-LPA-MAD-LHR. LHR-Madrid codeshare with BA. Excellent as expected with snack and drink provided. Madrid to Gran Canaria was a codeshare with Iberia Express. No food or drink offered (but with the option to purchase) and the plane whilst modern had dirty baggage bins. Seats and carpet were in good repair though. Gran Canaria to Madrid with Iberia A321 very modern and well kept and clean seats comfortable but again no complementary drink or snack. Transit in Madrid on both legs was easy and straightforward. I also found the cabin temperature to be quite warm on all legs.

### Iberia customer review
TLV-MAD-SVQ and back. The price was the big plus and I have to say that I made all my connections even with a short transfer at Madrid Barajas. All flights were on time with small and very old A319 on the 5.5 hours TLV-MAD. Flight was full cramped and very uncomfortable. Plane food atrocious on both legs. MAD-SVQ-MAD was with Iberia Express with much better and more enthusiastic crew and no service as on low cost airlines and frankly I prefer that since you do not get bothered with the whole meal and service show. Overall I would fly them again since price and punctuality are much more important than atrocious service and terrible food. They should stick to no frills low cost model since that's what they are good for they have no hope in hell of doing any better.

### Iberia customer review
I was impressed by the service provided on the flight number 516 in codeshare with BA. Very professional and helpful cabin crew maybe because the flight was almost empty. That is the way to treat customers and not the way crew used to treat us (like cattle) with bad faces and more concerned with their personal lives rather than looking after the customers.

### Iberia customer review
Flights from ORY-MAD-BOS May 6 2013. Pre-flight was problematic: I was unable to check in on-line so I had to call Iberia to get seats. When I checked in at airport seat assignments I had obtained on the phone about 12 hours earlier were ignored. The flights themselves were fine. Food was typical airline food and there was no personal entertainment system on MAD-BOS flight. However flight crew was very professional and attentive which made up for many of the limitations of the pre-flight experience.

### Iberia customer review
Iberia should consider recruiting new cabin crew that enjoy their work. I do not understand where they found the crew aboard on my flights in and outbound. Not even one smile or friendly word. Food was ok. Seat comfy enough. Will not start talking about the flight safety and how cabin crew handles that. People standing in the aisle overhead compartments not closed while aircraft is ready for take-off on the runway. I can go on and on.

### Iberia customer review
I flew to Lima on Iberia for the Christmas holidays in December 2012. I was hesitant because previous trips with the airline have been difficult with baggage delays surly hostesses poor customer service and a general feeling of incompetence. This time the hostesses were friendly but I still felt a worrying sense of incompetence with passengers still standing while we taxied along to takeoff because they couldn't find room for their hand luggage in the overheard lockers and hostesses running around while they tried to accommodate people as the plane moved. These old planes have small ceiling mounted screens for the whole cabin and our headphones didn't work which on a long haul flight is a big deal. There was a lack of communication between the BA check-in staff on duty for our flight in terminal 5 at Heathrow who assured me that on my fare I would not need to pay extra for a second suitcase in either directions and that of Lima Iberia staff on departure who insisted that I did.The whole experience left me feeling that Iberia has not progressed at all since I last flew with them and that their association with British Airways has done nothing to improve standards.

### Iberia customer review
LIN-MAD-BOG on March 30th and back from MEX 2 weeks later. Onward trip: 45 minutes late leaving Milano but not Iberia's fault. No problem with my connection as I had plenty of time. However flight to BOG was initially delayed 2.5 hrs (mechanical fault) then it ended up with a 1hr 45mins late departure and plane had to be changed (A346 instead of A343). Because of this I got a horrible seat which I luckily managed to change being the rear of the plane completely empty: this helped make my trip a little more comfortable (an entire row for me) as the seat was extremely hard. The plane itself was probably one of the oldest A346 flying nowadays. Service is extremely basic and carried out by non-enthusiastic crew: no entertainment system (a small monitor placed far away from you is not to be considered as entertainment). Return trip from Mexico City: again a A346 but in better conditions rather chaotic boarding as the row announcements could not be heard clearly so everyone was pushing to enter the plane first which is something I really hate. I was lucky one more time to get an empty seat beside me otherwise it would have been a painful trip back home. Overall on the plus side I mention their hub in Madrid a new modern and clean airport good for connections and the rate which was a great deal (about 650 EUR); on the minus side their old fleet and minimalistic service. Would choose them again only if the price is considerably lower than their competitors.

### Iberia customer review
ZRH-MAD-BOG in Business and had an overall good trip experience. Very attentive and friendly staff on all legs food quite tasty on the leg out of MAD less so on the way back and good wine selection. Letdown were planes and IFE indeed require upgrade and are not on par with other European long-haul products. Good lounges in Madrid.

### Iberia customer review
LHR-MAD-BOG-CLO return. First leg London to Madrid was poor the cabin crew were rude and no food or snack given. In Madrid we had to take a bus to the terminal we had no idea on where to go so we spent our 4 hour layover looking for our gate. Plane was delayed 2 hours. Onboard there were no TV's there were still ashtrays in them. Later on we were served dinner I ordered a kosher meal and they didn't give it to me so I just had the desert. One hour left and the snack came out again they forgot our special meal so I was left hungry. When we disembarked we had to run as our flight was boarding this flight was with Avianca and I was happy to see some IFE available. This flight was only 1 hour long but all in all better service.

### Iberia customer review
Pleasantly surprised flight LHR-MAD-SJO crews pleasant smiling and courteous. 2 meals and a sandwich served all food tasty. Seats were ok considering it was an 11 hour flight lack of person entertainment but not a problem had tablet loaded with movies and books.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-CPH-MAD operated by Iberia Express. Check-in without problems at both airports attended by friendly staff. VIP lounge at Madrid was fantastic something that I cannot say about the lounge at Copenhagen which was rather disappointing. On the outbound flight service was good the crew were polite attentive an courteous. On the return flight the service was excellent the crew were excellent. Food wasn't special on both flights it consisted of salad for starter pasta as the main course and cake for dessert. There was no choice for the main something that Iberia mainline does offer. Both flights were on time. In conclusion I was very satisfied with their product.

### Iberia customer review
We flew from Heathrow to Madrid and then on to Lima the first leg was not bad but the flight to Lima was horrendous we had to sit 10 rows apart the food was inedible the plane old and unsuitable for a 12 hour flight the entertainment was virtually non existent and the staff were surly and did not want to serve any thing water appeared to be rationed. We flew back from Buenos Aires and the same comments applied apart from the food which had been supplied by Argentina that was edible in fact for airline food quite good.

MEX-MAD. Check in at Mexico DF airport was fine. Agent did not care much no premium label on luggage. Iberia has its own lounge here very nice and comfortable just across from boarding gate. Limited food and drinks. Boarding and flight on time. On board comfortable seats and very nice service food and drinks quality very good. FA not very interactive just did their job. Lights off after lunch nice sleep arrival on time. (Breakfast served but manage sleep until last minute). Passport control fast at Madrid and bags short on belt after arrival.

### Iberia customer review
Supposed to fly Iberia from Santo Domingo to Madrid yesterday March 15 at 7.15 pm after being at the airport for 7 hours they cancelled the flight without letting us know when we are going to be able to make the flight. Today March 16 at 1 pm still have no information they just say when we fix the plane no alternative routes or airlines. Total disrespect for all of us.

### Iberia customer review
Heathrow to Madrid acceptable. Madrid to Buenos Aires given seats 24 rows apart. Iberia at Heathrow and Madrid unwilling to do anything about it. Girl at boarding sorted it out in seconds. Fight from Buenos Aires to Madrid delayed 3 hours. Missed Madrid connection and had to stay over in Madrid. At Madrid cases that were underweight at all 3 other check ins suddenly became overweight. Charged 120 euros. Very dated aircraft. First and last time with Iberia.

### Iberia customer review
Nice - Madrid - Paris. I arrived late to the check in counter in Nice but the agent greeted me by name and informed me not to hurry as the flight was delayed. Flight operated by Air Nostrum in a small CRJ90 and was 1 hour late due to poor weather in Madrid. Cabin crew do not speak French and their English was very hard to understand but they were polite and friendly. I was the only passenger and two Iberia pilots in the cabin. I was offered a bigger seat which was occupied by the pilot very nice and customer focused of him. The dinner was a ravioli with cheese and it was hot and sufficient. On the return from Barajas I tried to use their Auto check in but the boarding card was stuck in the machine and thus had to queue up for almost half an hour to get it done manually. There were plenty of passengers but Iberia kept only 2 counters open once it was my turn the agent at the check in desk was apologetic for their machines and the wait. She was very friendly and smiley. Flight to Paris was operated by an A320 I fell asleep before take off and woke up as the captain was making an announcement the cabin crew noticed almost immediately and came and offered me a glass of water and asked if I wanted to eat. Dinner was a seafood cake that smelled fishy and I didn't touch it though the wine cheese were nice. All in all reliable airline better service in Business class than other airlines on the same route very nice ground and inflight staff. Shame that they only fly to ORY in Paris but not CDG. Otherwise would use them more often.

### Iberia customer review
MUC-MAD-EZE return from Rio was booked at short notice at a very reasonable price. We did not expect much but actually went away satisfied. All flights on time. Staff service and meals long-haul ok up to actually pretty good. Rather large seat pitch long-haul for Economy within Europe pay attention to sit upfront otherwise it is atrocious. Lack of inflight entertainment did not bother us as we manage to sleep on long-haul night flights. I would actually even consider it good value for money given the price paid.

### Iberia customer review
We were booked from Heathrow to Lanzarote. The schedule was changed 6 times and eventually all but one connecting flight were cancelled. Iberia were unable to get us to Madrid in time to catch the connecting flight. We were left high and dry and eventually flew out on the previous evening to Madrid booking our own hotel. Iberia couldn't care less and offered no help or explanation. Just to add insult to injury they use an 0870 number so it cost every time I called them.

MAD-TFN-MAD. Check in and security at Madrid was fine fast and easy. All flights departed on time early arrival both cases. Boarding by groups it was time Iberia started this since always boarding with them is chaotic. On board seat comfortable small legroom no service no IFE food for purchase. FA very nice and accommodating.

### Iberia customer review
Very unimpressed with Iberia long haul flight from London to Quito via Madrid. It was like stepping back to the 1990s travelling on a flight with no seat back screens only 3 drop down TVs per cabin showing 3 films on the outbound journey and 2 on the return. Outbound films didn't even start until over 4 hours into the 10 hour+ flight. The only screen I could see on the return flight was not working meaning that not only could I not watch the film but it flashed on and off throughout the entire flight meaning I couldn't sleep either. The inflight meal was poor but the wine was ok (only one was offered). No water or snacks brought through the cabin between meals. Return flight was a shambles. It was delayed but no announcement made until after the time the flight should have departed. Then told we'd have an hour to wait due to a security issue so everybody left the queue. A couple of minutes later it was announced that the flight was boarding resulting in a scrum as everybody charged for the gate!

### Iberia customer review
Internal flight Bilbao to Alicante operated by Air Nostrum a subsidiary. Bought the ticket online but instead of receiving an eticket in return I got an itinerary headed "When the charge to your credit card has been made we will send you a new email with the information about the tickets issued. Fare was charged to my card immediately but no further email with eticket arrived. After a week I phoned the number in Madrid as the number of their helpline. Nobody spoke English but I managed enough Spanish to explain the situation. The employee was curt and unhelpful even when I asked her to speak more slowly. I then discovered that Iberia had refunded my account the fare days after the first payment and Iberia had taken a further amount of double the fare. I have had enormous trouble sorting this out and getting a refund. A call to the same "helpdesk" in Madrid resulted in the insisting that the problem was with my (Spanish) bank and that there was nothing further she could (or would) do. Of course my (Spanish) bank disagreed and said I needed to deal with Iberia. Very stressful for someone whose Spanish is not fluent. The actual flight was fine. Air Nostrum planes are small a 2x2 configuration but leg room was adequate. No free food or drink but available at a price as in low cost airlines. A late departure resulted in a late arrival. Just beware booking through their website.

### Iberia customer review
Wheelchair was not available upon arrival as requested in Madrid. First request we were told it was not their job. Second request to flight attendant we were told they would call. The third request was to the Captain who told us it was taken care of as he walked off. Not one time did any of these individuals ever off me a seat until a chair arrived. It was very evident that they did not care.

### Iberia customer review
London - Sao Paolo flight change in Madrid. Departed London late as needed to take off missing passengers luggage. Pay as you eat 'Tu Menu' service served courteously. Boarding went quite well at Madrid but delayed departure due to taking off more missing passengers luggage. From Madrid meal was a good example of airline food and the wine was agreeable. Crew delighted to offer me a second wine. This was a modern Airbus but no individual television screens two dated films shown along with was an interesting Iberia magazine programme. Surprised that staff did make 2 rounds giving out water and chocolate biscuits during the flight. Good attention to use of seat belts through turbulence and announcements in English clear. Wash rooms do not appear to get sufficient if any attention during this 10 hour flight and became rather smelly. Sao Paolo - London. On departure the plane was clean and pleasant smelling. Cabin crew greeted passengers with a mixture of surly indifference and pleasant smiles but didn't see much in the way of assistance to find seats or storing hand luggage. Meal good but I made the mistake of asking for an additional wine! The reply came 'I am very busy collecting. If you want more wine wait until we are finished and come to the back of the plane'. This time one reasonably recent film. Again wash rooms became smelly and lacked attention during the flight. This was 24th December and the crew could not have been less festive. Madrid - London was code share with BA and what a contrast to the Iberia leg.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-CPH. Operated by Iberia Express. Flight departed 5 minutes early and arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Check-in was fast with no issues and VIP lounge was excellent with plenty of food and space. Only 6 seats in Business Class so service was attentive and friendly. Meal served onboard was nice. The seat was okay but legroom was tighter than Iberia mainline. In conclusion it was a pleasant experience.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-ALG and ALG-MAD. Impressed with the punctuality with the departure and arrival time. The quality of the service was very good in terms of staff on board and on the ground. FA's were attentive. I flew them again from SFO-ORD-MAD with the second leg with Iberia and again I was not disappointed. My only complaint is Madrid Barajas Airport. At the airport there are no real amenities for the long haulers. Will fly Iberia again.

### Iberia customer review
Crew from BRA to TLV were abrasive in their enforcement of airline policies and regulations. Aircraft itself was an Airbus A319. Economy seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Definitely not where I want to spend 4 hours. The food itself was acceptable as far as airline food is concerned. In-flight entertainment was non- existent. In short a terrible flight experience.

### Iberia customer review
MUC-MAD return (twice): I am getting the impression that Iberia has increased its service quality. The ground and onboard staff were very friendly all 4 flights nearly on time and the cabin of the Airbus clean. When seated in one of the front rows space is ample otherwise quite cramped. The disadvantage is that Iberia charges for food and beverages even on continental flights.

### Iberia customer review
We've been flying international for over 25 years and never had such a bad experience! Unfortunately we had decided to go to Madrid from Los Angeles and we were looking for the shortest flight with the least number of connections. Hence we flew American Airlines to Chicago and from there Iberia to Madrid. The crew were rude. My husband pressed the hostess button twice and both times the guy came and from behind us stretched his arm and pressed the button 'off' without even asking why he was being called! Then when my husband went to get a glass of water he was rudely informed that 'the fasten seat belt sign' was on. We knew that and that's why we called for service! The plane was an old plane with no individual TVs and hence no entertainment! The crew acted or actually didn't understand much English. The food was awful and their attitude was 'take it or leave it'. We've never seen this kind of service.

LHR-MAD LIM-MAD MAD-LHR. Excellent experience of Iberia Business Class. A340-300 on LHR-MAD route was a bonus with loads of room. Superb VIP lounge at Madrid T4S with plenty of space food and self-service wine bar. Long haul flight on A340-600 was very comfortable with completely lie-flat seats. Cabin crew very friendly and food was delicious throughout.

### Iberia customer review
TLV-MAD-TLV Dec 6-9. On the outbound I was offered an upgrade to business for $150 which I gladly accepted. Even though it was a small A319 it had the big reclining business class seats and the service was wonderful. Luggage took less than 5 minutes to arrive on the belt. On the return no upgrade this time but I was lucky to get the emergency exit seat and had plenty of room the flight was only 40% full which helps. Would gladly fly them again.

My husband and I flew from ORD to Madrid and onto Barcelona. We were very hesitant about our flight but found the crew to be very helpful. Impressed with the wine served and the meals were quite good. Our flights departed and arrived on time! We would not hesitate to fly Iberia again. The only disappointment was the lack of leg room and no IFE.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to Santiago [Chile] on 3/11/12. Forced to sit in 31E for 13.5 hours despite paying for an aisle seat. The seat was awful in every way. When the passenger in front reclined their seat they sat on my outstretched legs. Only when the passenger beside me got up could I fold my legs under my seat as it was so cramped. FA's vanished after serving poor meals. Offering water during such a long trip especially to those trapped in the centre of the 'plane should be part of the job/service. Avoid.

My wife and I were going to my sons wedding in San Juan Puerto Rico and were then planning a US holiday afterwards so we booked with BA in Feb for BOD-LGW-SJU followed by SFO-LHR-CDG for flights commencing in November. Outbound flights were cancelled without us being informed. Was offered the routing BOD-LGW then a coach transfer to LHR at our own expense followed by LHR-JFK then JFK-SJU on American domestic. I did not think this was a reasonable re-routing. Finally offered ORY-MAD-SJU with Iberia. We checked in and given Fast Track security pass and went directly to the lounge. When the flight was ready for boarding we were escorted by a member of staff to Fast Track security and onto the boarding gate where we had priority boarding. Greeted by the Captain and cabin crew. Pre-departure drinks served and we departed on time. The breakfast meal was fine and we arrived in Madrid early and transferred directly to the Iberia lounge. Directed to the boarding gate where we were given priority boarding and were quickly settled into the spacious cabin. Pre flight drinks served and after departure the Purser came around and took our meal orders. There then followed a drinks service with nuts. We both enjoyed our food and the excellent wines on offer. After the meal I reclined the seat and had a good sleep before watching a film - the choice was limited as an English speaker but perfectly adequate. 90 mins out of SJU given a light meal and bar service. Arrived 10 mins early and were swiftly off the aircraft. Our bags were amongst the first off the carrousel. A very pleasant flight.

Madrid to Rome roundtrip with an 8 year old child and an 87 year old. It is true that you need to pay for food in short flights. It's already been several years where I have had to pay for drinks on short US based airlines and they offer no paid food at all. Flights attendants are excellent and professional.

Alicante-Madrid-Chicago-San Francisco (ALC-MAD-ORD-SFO). All legs were excellent. Alicante to Madrid short hop on A320. At Madrid Barajas airport Terminal 4-S American Airlines has a desk which is very useful for code-sharing situations. Layover in Madrid 90 minutes. Madrid to Chicago was 9 hours on A340-300 plane was clean although seats were narrow. Left about on time personnel very good service with good attitude they gave extra wine bread rolls etc. Only complaint is no personal television sets. However airline magazine is bilingual English-Spanish giving extensive opportunity to work on Spanish with excellent articles. Layover in Chicago 2 hours. Flight Chicago to San Francisco on American Airlines Boeing 737 nothing special but got me home. Luggage made it all the way to SFO on time despite short layovers.

FCO-MAD-SCL. First leg Rome-Madrid more than 3 hours delayed then on board on an quite old and dirty A321. We arrived in Madrid having just 40 mins to change the terminal and take the second leg to Santiago de Chile. Aircraft was a new and really clean A340-600. 13 hours non-stop flight without any major trouble landed in Santiago 20 minutes after the scheduled time. Food and beverage excellent staff helpful and professional but no IFE so take a book or a kindle with you.

### Iberia customer review
Very disappointed with IB especially as they are part of the BA/IAG group. I booked on their website and went out to MAD with BA - at least we got a sandwich and free drink. Onward to Las Palmas boarding was chaotic too much hand luggage allowed on board and they charge for all refreshments. Return flight to London both sectors on IB no boarding by seat rows so aisles congested far too much hand luggage allowed so overhead bins full before all had boarded. Steward tried to take our coats and bag and put them elsewhere to accommodate an oversized bag - not acceptable. If I book with 1world again I will make sure that we do not fly IB they have a lot to put right.

### Iberia customer review
ORD-MAD-BLQ. From previous reviews I was dreading this flight. but very happily surprised! On-time boarding efficient and smiling staff but the best was one the most comfortable Economy seat. A new clean A340-600 - catering good and plentiful. There is a total lack of IFE although in 2012 with a bit of pre- preparation on the iPad that's not such an issue. The ability to sleep in comfortable seats makes up for the lack of IFE. Madrid Airport is modern its also massive and transiting involves an incredible mix of travelators elevators train and walking long distances. Its a downside few people speak English and they're quite surly. CRJ to Bologna on-time and half empty. Luggage was out quickly. A very pleasant surprise and would definitely do this again.

### Iberia customer review
BRU-MAD-MVD-MAD-BRU C Class old tatty planes. Still better service within their inter Europe legs. They should not be allowed to call that Airbus A340 business class service. Vile lounge managed by rude staff. Once on board service is done by an ill treating cabin crew. Tasteless and Vile food which I have had the unfortunate opportunity to taste 6 times this year alone and have twice yet again to fly with them and of course once upon arrival found out they have lost my suitcase. Have repeatedly complained about their service both written and orally on board to HQ and they just nod and agree.

Having purchased through tickets for all six members of my family Toulouse to Lanzarote via Madrid I checked my luggage allowance at the desk at Toulouse Airport two weeks before the flight and was told that as a British Airways gold executive card holder I was entitled to an additional piece of luggage for each of my family members travelling with me; the agent even updated the reservation system to show this. Checking in with only one extra bag the check in agent firstly was not aware of the family allowance which is the same as for Iberia Plus high tier cardholders but did give me my extra bag - but as second leg was to be with Iberia Express the system would not allow them to include the extra bag on the second leg nor check any bags through to Lanzarote. At Madrid they checked my bags in and tried to charge me EUR60for the extra bag. I refuted this and they checked in the bags with no extra charge only following discussion. I had further discussions with very responsive transfer agents at Madrid who explained that this is a major issue with Iberia Express connecting flights. I am expecting to have the unfortunate experience on my return journey. If Iberia cannot provide the same service on all subsidiary companies they should not sell tickets for the through journey without making it abundantly clear on the that Iberia Express operates to entirely different rules and is not accepting other high tier OneWorld frequent flyer cardholders' allowances. May I add that at Madrid my lounge access was permitted for the and that both lounge and transfer desk agents were very sympathetic to my predicament and tried their best to penetrate the Iberia Express barriers in the system although to no avail.

We flew Business Plus from LAX to Madrid return in Oct 2012. I was nervous about Iberia given poor reviews. The flat bed seats were great and the food good on the outbound but very good on the return. The service was fine. We took a flight from Madrid to Rome and from Barcelona to Madrid. Business was fine. We wouldn't hesitate to fly Iberia again. The entertainment systems don't have many good movies so bring your kindle.

Frankfurt to Gran Canaria via Madrid. Check-in in Frankfurt very smooth but my wife and I couldn't get seats together. Seats were quite comfy made of leather but head rest wasn't movable so was hard to sleep. All flights on time. The biggest thing to complain about is the service in Economy class. Drinks and snacks are available for cash only. Most passengers brought their own meals on board. FAs were friendly. From Madrid to Gran Canaria we sat together. Service again was cash only. From Gran Canaria to Madrid we couldn't sit together. FAs were unfriendly. Would use Iberia only if there is no other choice.

Rio - Madrid - Geneva. Flight from Rio was one hour late but the staff onboard were perfect. The food was excellent and the Airbus 340 seemed less noisy than others. Breakfast served one hour prior to landing so we had plenty of time to sleep with no silly announcements. Second leg was very smooth as well. The only glitch is the poor onboard entertainment with very little choice. Overall I would recommend them again.

This is for Iberia Express who are a new subsidiary of Iberia. I flew IBS (IB Express) between SVQ and MAD recently on this new part of Iberia. The flight was on time on a relatively new aircraft. I should say however that they do not use mainline Iberia planes they have their own fleet of A320s now and they have been configured for IB Express. They have a tiny business section and a larger economy section with the same moving curtain configuration as IB and BA. They use the same Recaro seats as IB but the legroom is atrocious - it must be the legal minimum even the business rows had hardly any legroom. It's explained by the fact that the IB Express A320s have at least one extra row vs. Iberia which is already pretty tight. Passengers had to sit legs apart to get in to their seats. The rest of the flight was mostly comparable to standard Iberia - paying for drinks/snacks (not good). The legroom though really is awful and I would avoid them for anything except internal flights within Spain.

MAD-CPH-MAD. Outbound flight was excellent: fast check-in organized boarding friendly crew comfortable seating and on time arrival. Inbound flight was interesting we were supposed to leave on time but there was a technical problem and we were told that the flight was delayed for two hours minimum. We were given a meal voucher and after waiting for four hours the flight was postponed for the following day and they took us to the Hilton hotel at the airport that was really good. Next day we departed in the morning and everything went smooth. In spite of the heavy delay they managed well the situation so I don't have any major complaint.

London Heathrow to Gran Canaria via Madrid return. Boarding fast and fuss free food and drinks served quickly after take off with refills for those that wanted. Ample seating with a good level of service provided and all flights departed and arrived to schedule. A very pleasant experience.

FRA-ORD via MAD in Business Class. The European segment was fine. No complaints no problems. Transatlantic flight was a major letdown. Uncomfortable hard seat and very mediocre food. One expects more when flying in Business Class.

### Iberia customer review
Recently flew MAD-SCL in economy. Very long flight in an old A340 aircraft. Toilets were smelly and not maintained. Seating clearly was old and showed signs of wear. It is amazing how little service was offered on such a long flight (13.5 hours). Only dinner at take off and until one hour before arrival there were no cabin crew to be seen. Staff didn't show any interest. One could get drinks in the galley. No snacks served in between. Food quality was very basic. In flight entertainment is prehistoric with only central TV monitor and a very poor audio choice. Besides the head sets provided in economy were terrible and started to hurt after 2 hours. At least both flights were in time so we arrived. But that's the only thing to be complemented.

Flew in this morning into Luanda from London via Madrid - Economy. (IB 3167 & IB 6321). The London-Madrid was like a low cost airline - however for economy I found it to be spacious compared to other carriers I have flown. I was very impressed by the cleanliness of facilities in Madrid - compared to other airports. In Terminal 4S however its not abundant in Duty Free but loads of seating and many clean restrooms. Economy - no frills but the seats very comfortable the aircraft restrooms clean and from Madrid to Luanda we were offered a good dinner - including a wholesome breakfast before landing. Staff were very attentive. If you want to get from A to B economically without the frills I would definitely choose them again.

MAD-JFK-MAD. Madrid check in business area as usual fast and easy. Used fast track for security and train to the satellite terminal. I was at the Business lounge short 15 min from check in. Lounge great with plenty of food drinks. Boarding on time separate area for business passengers. Once on board pre-flight drink crew nice departure on time. On board comfortable seating lots of space very nice lunch. The crew was very attentive and wine selection great. On arrival no fast track at JFK terminal 7 (shared with other oneworld partners) big line for passport. On return fast and easy check in at JFK airport fast track for security. Iberia uses the British lounge at terminal 7 very convenient and nice ambience not much food just few sandwiches. Flight again on time same service and nice crew. Early arrival at Madrid bags fast on belt.

Flying Miami-Madrid-Toulouse was marred by the starting point - Miami - in my view MIA being up with the worst anywhere. Will never go through this again. Iberia is so-so and dull. Check in was painful with unsmiling staff all through and all seemingly a hassle. My travel companion had his miles credited to his AA account but in opting for mine to be added to my Cathay Pacific Gold account the class was later deemed not eligible for award points. Arrival in Madrid was fine but we were glad it was over. Then the connecting flight to Toulouse was delayed several times with Iberia's Air Nostrum the culprit. There was never any explanation. Eventually we did get to Toulouse but much later than intended which then threw out all plans for the of the day. Never again.

BCN-GRU Economy Class. Old tired A340-300 woeful entertainment (no seat back TV). Got a bulkhead seat so reasonable space but behind appeared tight. Seats old and uncomfortable. Food was simply dreadful and this was flying out of a home airport. The only plus was a friendly crew not common with Iberia. Shared lounge at BCN showers not working limited food but comfortable seating but nothing like the lounge at Madrid which is one of my favourites.

Montevideo-Madrid. Check in very fast and easy. Lounge great at Montevideo airport. Flight departed on time boarding by rows and business boarding area separate. Once on board everything great. I was called by my name at all times food great. Manage good sleep. Breakfast before arrival. Bags on belt fast out on a taxi 35 min after arrival.

MAD-VGO operated by Iberia Express. Hassle free check-in and fast-track security was excellent. VIP lounge was great: spacious plenty of food and nice staff. Onboard seating was comfortable and only two rows of seats so ambience felt exclusive and service was attentive. We arrived to Vigo five minutes ahead of schedule. Overall a pleasant experience and I will fly with them again.

### Iberia customer review
Having returned from Peru to Glasgow I have nothing but praise for the efficient boarding at all airports. The food was as good as any other airline and staff were excellent. The only negative was the lack of individual monitors. I don't think the general comments prior to my flight were helpful as I approach my flights with unfounded trepidation.

### Iberia customer review
MAD-MAN-MAN. Hour plus delay on both sectors no explanation from ground staff or flight crew and a long long wait for bags to come through at Barajas T4 on the return. Air Nostrum have started to charge for catering like their parent company and on the return sector the FAs said they'd run out of all food on the outbound flight. The aircraft was a new and surprisingly spacious CRJ1000 and the cabin crew were smart efficient friendly and spoke excellent English as well as Spanish.

### Iberia customer review
LIM-MAD. Cannot compliment Iberia enough. Staff at office in Lima and at LIM airport incredibly helpful and friendly regarding an issue with our booking which had prevented us from checking in online. Flight boarded on time and departed early. Seats on A340-600 absolutely adequate and provided an inch more legroom than BA. Yes no individual seatback TV but large LCD screens around aircraft more than adequate and most people wanted to sleep overnight anyway. Crew mature and efficient but still charming. Plenty of food (and dinner typical airline fare but tasty and hot) and drinks freely available from crew in galley. Arrived early into MAD. Genuinely couldn't have asked for more and very surprised. Will certainly fly IB to South America in future.

### Iberia customer review
Flight from Lima to Heathrow changing planes at Madrid. Old planes no seatback TVs couldn't even see one of the 2 or 3 drop down TV's they were showing a film on. Staff were helpful but food awful. Flight was late so only 1 hour between flights. Needless to say our luggage didn't arrive. Nobody even told all the Lima passengers the luggage hadn't been put on our flight and everyone was waiting at the carousel. British Airways who were dealing with it were really helpful - Iberia when we phoned weren't. My husband's bag arrived the next day and mine the day after.

ALC-MAD-LHR in Business class and first leg operated by Iberia Express. All flights on time small business class cabin attentive service I was served a small tasty snack together with a glass of cava on the first leg of the journey. On the MAD-LHR great purser very attentive constant rounds of water great food choices of entrees great wines and spirits. Bang on time. Must be my luck but I find Iberia faultless. The Dali Lounge in Madrid is comfortable with great food offerings less crowded than the BA Galleries in T5.

### Iberia customer review
Vigo-MAD-JFK. Still waiting for my luggage to arrive in NYC. The food was beyond terrible - they served some awful pasta with a white gloopy cold sauce. When I couldn't eat that they brought the so-called hamburger. Absolutely disgusting. The airline personnel is as always more interested in talking among themselves than serving. The whole experience is deficient. Why fly them? The connections w/in Spain make it cost efficient. But I am going to rethink this. Business Plus has better seating: not much else.

### Iberia customer review
Miami to Madrid and then from Madrid to Turin. We tried to check in online from Miami but the system became unresponsive before we could select our seats and we were allocated seats automatically. At Miami airport we tried to change as our seats were at the rear of the plane but the assistant ignored our request and gave us our boarding passes with the same seat numbers. When I tried to explain again another assistant arrived and told us it was too late without even looking. Shortly after take off I went to the toilet where there was no soap when I asked a surly male flight attendant he handed me a refill without saying a word. That refill remained there the whole flight. When I was served a cup of coffee a tray wasn't used and I had to hold my cup while it was poured in all my many years of flying that has never happened before. When something fell off the trolley a lady attendant simply pushed it under a seat with her foot and there it remained for the rest of the flight. No screen was visible from my seat as a tall gentleman was blocking any view I may have had. During the second flight we were astonished to learn that any refreshments had to be paid for just like on a low-cost airline.

### Iberia customer review
Having now been back for month I still feel very upset. I booked my flight with British Airways from Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro which was a direct flight which was fine. Return trip turned out to be with Iberia we checked in online to be able to sit close to our daughter and son-in-law. On boarding we discovered that one of the seats was stained. The stewardess when I brought it to her attention moved myself and wife to another seat constantly apologising. We landed at Madrid where we caught a connecting flight to Heathrow when further insult was added - we wanted a drink of water on the flight and was told that we had to pay for it as this was part of or long haul flight this we feel was outrageous.

### Iberia customer review
JFK-MAD-LHR BCN-MAD-JFK. My expectation was low so the experience was not bad. Business Plus seats between New York and Madrid are not really flat and are not really designed for a tall person. I am 6'2" and couldn't sleep well at all. Business seats on domestic and inter Europe flights were the same as economy class with the middle seat unoccupied. Flight attendants were inattentive. One female attendant even unplugged the headphone without asking me first while she tried to collect it back. The noise cancellation headphone was cheap and didn't work functionally. Entertainment system was at the lower end of industry standard. There were probably only four new movies available. Food and wines choices very good. Lounge in Barcelona was horrible. Be prepared to pay 10 euros to get towels before heading to the shower. Lounge in Madrid was better but still no hair dryer. I probably will use Iberia in the future only when the price is competitive.

Madrid to Gran Canaria connecting from a BA CityFlyer flight from London City. I booked via British Airways and discovered by chance that online advance seat selection on connecting Iberia flights is not available on ba.com but can be done via the Iberia website using the same booking reference number. Online check in a breeze 24 hours before departure at ba.com and I had already selected the seats via Iberia.com weeks in advance seats 1A/C have great legroom (seat B is left vacant in Business Class) but is next to the galley so if want peace and quiet don’t select these. Our bags had been checked-in all the way through from London so can’t comment on the bag drop or check-in facilities. The Iberia lounge at terminal 4 is airy bright and clean and being on the upper level means it’s closer to the ceiling air conditioning outlets and so was nice and cool on this 36*C day! Great selection of food and drink which was constantly re-stocked and fresh. Boarding was nothing short of shambolic! There was no pre-boarding for Business Class passengers and there was a scrum at the boarding gate with just one person checking boarding cards and passports. We were then herded onto a bus with less than adequate air conditioning and waited for about fifteen minutes before being driven two minutes around the corner to a different gate on the same wing of the terminal! A simple gate change to the opposite side of the lounge seating would have been the better option! The A321 aircraft looked a bit dilapidated outside with faded and flaking paint. The cabin was clean and all in order and with the middle seat left vacant we had plenty of room. Departure was over an hour behind schedule 45 minutes late leaving the terminal and 15 minutes sitting in a queue to take off. There was a message from the cockpit in Spanish and English but it was garbled so no chance to hear what was said. No hot or cold towel round was made which I thought was unusual for Business Class. Newspapers offered just before take- off but that was the last we saw of the crew for over an hour no drink rounds or any form of contact until lunch suddenly arrived. No food options were offered the tray just arrived. It was served with a foil cover over the main plastic packet over the cutlery and cling film wrap over the salad and desert. All was on china crockery with metal cutlery but no table cloth and with paper napkins. The tray remained on my table for about 30 minutes after I had finished and only then was I offered tea / coffee or a drink from the bar. No top-ups forthcoming and any further drinks requests had to be made via the call button which seemed to be chore for the crew. Didn’t feel welcome or valued at all and the false smiles from the stern female crew member upon disembarking were not appreciated. Arrival at Gran Canaria was over an hour late but we were quickly off the plane and through to baggage reclaim where our bags were amongst the first few to arrive. From plane to taxi rank took about 20minutes. My connecting BA CityFlyer flight was far superior to the Iberia Business Class segment. As the two airlines are under the same umbrella now I think Iberia really need to improve the standard of their product.

ORD-MAD MAD-PAM (Pamplona) was a tight connection but was at the gate 25 minutes before boarding only to learn the plane had taken off 30 minutes early than the scheduled departure time. Ran into some trouble rebooking on the next flight however did make it to Pamplona 3 hours behind schedule. On our return flight in Barcelona we were at the gate 2 hours before departure back to the states. The information on the screen at the gate was incorrect and when questioned the Iberia representative explained that our flight was next and that the current flight was a different flight. Ourselves and 3 other couples missed the flight as that was our plane. We tried to rebook and the Iberia personnel accused us of not being at the gate on time. When we escalated the issue to management she was worse. Told us she would be happy to help if we paid her an additional 3000 euros for a new ticket to the states. We had to purchase new tickets home from Delta.

JFK to Madrid. Plane was a clean A340-300. I got the window seat and no one sat next to me so I had extra space. The air conditioner was broken so when we got on it was about 90 degrees. The seats were very comfortable with a headrest that moved up and down. They fixed the air conditioner. Inflight meal was great and the movie up on the shared screens which you could see very well. Flight Attendants spoke perfect English and were nice and helpful. I slept for 3 hours woke up just in time for breakfast. We were late because of the whole air conditioner incident and almost missed our connection to Rome. The plane was an A321. Flight was uneventful and was not particularly good or bad. They did charge for drinks in economy class around $3 or 2.50 Euros which I thought was like something from a very low budget carrier.

### Iberia customer review
Madrid to New York in Business class. A wonderful plane and seat. The seat went flat into a bed had many functions electrically went down into any position had a massage function and a footrest. The Personal TV was great with lots of movies and TV shows. My main course was good. The business class lounge at Madrid was nice. From Venice to Madrid we were in business class and it was good with comfortable seats and good food. No TV's though and the seats weren't much different from economy but they don't sell the middle seat so you have more room. On both flights the crew were nice.

### Iberia customer review
I flew non stop from Los Angeles LAX to MAD Barajas. Flight was full the seat was ok but I was shocked to see that they didn't have any seatback TVs in economy. The service was good and the food was nice but as soon as the service is finished you need to get up and go to the galley if you want anything else. The crew don't seen to come through the cabin unlike BA where they come around with trays offering water or juice.

Madrid to Malabo Equatorial Guinea. My flight was very pleasant as was the flight crew. Upon arrival at the airport in Malabo I had trouble contacting the client office that was to meet me at the airport. Iberia Public Relations supervisor offered to assist me. Like myself he was not successful. As it was near midnight he departed for the day and I remained at the airport continuing to attempt to contact my clients. The following day found me still at the airport. The Pubic Relations Supervisor returned and on finding I was still at the airport he took it upon himself to locate the office facility of the persons I had been unable to contact then took the time to transport me in his personal vehicle to that location.

This was my first time using S7. Their online ticket sale works fine you are sent e-ticket in pdf which is great for printing. At the airport check-in was ok but you got no smile from their agents. Onboard you are met by unsmiling crew who look tired. The plane was a320 in very good condition clean and with great legroom. Food was hot lunch which was nice for 1 hr flight in economy. We took off on time and landed ahead of schedule. My bag was on the belt when I was off immigration. S7 is a great choice for family travel. My ticket was a great deal. S7 is the second best airline between Kiev and Moscow. Gloomy and robotic agents and crews and strange schedule are the only minuses.

Moscow-Ekaterinburg. Had a fairly good experience with S7. Check-in and take off was on time. The plane was new and in good condition. Attendants spoke English quite well and friendly which is not usual in Russia and especially not on this route. Food cheap but plenty and convenient. Looking at the price/value ratio I recommend this airline on domestic flights in Russia.

DME-LED-DME. Good value for money. Excellent option for those making connection in Domodedovo. First leg operated by Globus (subsidiary I guess). Even though it's only 1h flight a small snack has been provided (and newspapers in Russian). Clean new planes (B738 and A319). Big delay on way back but not the airlines' fault. Would use again.

### Iberia customer review
Moscow-Volgograd used check-in kiosks but still had to go to the desk to drop off baggage. A319 clean and comfortable. After take-off flight attendants came around with newspapers (only Russian) then a meal and drink service. Main flight attendant spoke perfect english. Return trip also on A319 aircraft but different interiors - looked very much like Northwest airlines so probably where the plane came from. Chicken or fish dinner served and food delicious. Flight attendants smiling and friendly. In Moscow we were lucky enough to get a gate at the terminal and had our bags within 15 minutes. S7 really does a nice job.

### Iberia customer review
Beijing-Novosibirsk. The flight experience was awful. Flight time 6-05am but gates weren't open even there was no crew in check-in till like 6-00 check-in delayed no reason given no one cared it finally started at 6-15am and took another half an hour for the plane to depart. When you get onboard it feels like you've gone back to 90's. The plane is really really old. No tv no radio no nothing. I was not expecting much from this airline but it was way worse - however the food was good and there were two choices.

### Iberia customer review
Domodedovo - Barnaul. Night flight in a new A320 seating better than Niki. Surprising amount of food (satisfying quality) for a 4-hour night flight. No onboard entertainment. Online booking and check in at DME went well (we had backpacks and were asked to a separate counter as the regular checkin counters can only handle suitcases). Most S7 staff speak only basic English. Flying to Russian destinations via Domodedovo is recommended because things there go much smoother than at Sheremetyevo where you have to wait a long time and take a bus to change terminals.

### Iberia customer review
Moscow-Rimini return (charter economy). Outbound flight was delayed for 45 minutes but we were warned about this fact by check-in attendants who were very nice and friendly (unusual for Moscow). Boarding normally organised then the bus to our plane A310 inside was bright and clean seats were ok (I'm 192 cm tall). Soon after departure drinks were served - only juices or water. The meal service was fantastic. I must admit that the meal service took them more than 15 hour. Inflight magazine interesting. Return flight departed earlier than expected boarding swift seating was more comfy. Flight attendants were better : very helpful and delivered what you need with a smile.

### Iberia customer review
Domodedovo - BAX Barnaul return. S7 has been hyping their newer aircraft in their advertising but still use their older Soviet planes on most routes. Aeroflot is better but you have to change airports if you fly into SVO Shermetyevo to catch a domestic flight which is not for the faint of heart and not inexpensive ($40 or more) unless you know how to use the cheap bus between terminals. DME is more modern than SVO 2 (but no less a madhouse in the ticketing area) and is organized mass confusion at the domestic passenger x-ray area - keep your boarding pass and your ticket in your hand or say "e-ticket" if you only have a boarding pass and bought on-line; the international departure area is much better especially for those folks with western passports. At DME all the passengers sardined into a bus with no seats to the ancient Tupolev and had to walk up stairs. On the way back however the plane returned to a jetway thankfully. DME was a hellhole a decade ago but has been totally rebuilt (and remains under construction). Seats are extremely tight especially for my 6' 7" frame so I grabbed an empty bulkhead seat and was able to get the spacious emergency exit on the return flight with help from my Russian friend. Announcements on the plane are in Russian and heavily accented English. The emergency exits in the TU are partially blocked by the seats in front of the doors and the seat belts are not like the ones on western aircraft - some kind of loop system that is almost impossible to figure out how to make smaller or larger. The emergency exits have an obvious failure-prone system that is not idiot-proof. The TU also cannot support as much heavy or large luggage in the overheads as a modern western aircraft; they advise only using them for coats and small items. Barnaul is a small regional airport; no English announcements or signage. Upon arrival you need to enter a very small room and show your ticket with the matching luggage stickers to the attendant before you're allowed to leave with your bags. Unlike most American airlines they actually give you food during a 4-hour flight and it's not bad. Upon landing before the seat belt sign is off and even before the plane is even completely stopped at the gate Russians have already been into the overhead compartments and standing. I notice this on international flights with a lot of Russians on board too where exasperated Western flight attendants plead for people to sit down to no avail. Ticketing: they now have e-tickets since 2006. However you can't see the full terms and conditions until AFTER you bought the ticket. Almost all low fares are completely non-refundable and non- changeable when bought on-line. Even if the price goes lower after you bought they will not credit you the difference unlike a western airline.

Moscow to Novosibirsk return Economy class. Aircraft IL86 (about 350 passengers). Transfer from Moscow to the airport (Demodedovo) long but well organized (subway green line + microbus). In the airport the flight was not shown in the departure list. I had to contact the information desk. The staff in the airport is generally available in Russian only. Foreigners who are not Russian fluent may encounter problems in this matter. On the other hand flying conditions were much better than I supposed. Chair comfort fair; much better in comparison to those I encountered during KLM flights from Amsterdam to Singapore and from Amsterdam to Delhi. Meals were quite good. Aircraft clean. Foreign passengers may encounter difficulties to contact stewardesses. Only one of them was able to speak English. During the return flight old aircraft chartered form another local airline and flying conditions worse than during onbound flight. General impression: better than I supposed "three stars".

Moscow DME to Nizhniy Novgorod. Check-in at DME fast the agent couldn't really handle my swiss passport and was unable to find my e-ticket in the system and called someone else. In the end 3 people were searching me in the system. After a few minutes some staff member took my passport and disappeared - eventually she came back saying "everything's ok" and gave me the passport and the boarding pass. My Russian is as bad as their English so it was a bit hard to communicate but they were very friendly and not at all "sovietish". A fourth young employee came and asked if I spoke French so we could speak to each other. Basically everything was settled. I don't think that people working on check-in counters of Russian domestic flights need to speak English so I wasn't disappointed or stressed by this fact. Flight was on a relatively old B737-500 with new style interior. My seat was a bit broken it automatically reclined. Security instructions professional in English and Russian. Security card original looked like a folded menu card in a restaurant. Service prompt and friendly. Served a drink of choice and no meal as it was only a short one-hour flight. Flight price was about USD 40.00 booked conveniently online.

St. Pete to Novosibirsk on a Tu-154 and apart from the fact that the plane was old everything about the service from the food to the quality of the inflight magazine shows how Russian airlines have progressed of late. Novosibirsk airport is a small gem with its final stages of reconstruction now underway. From Novosibirsk to Moscow then on an Airbus A319 S7 Airlines really shows many other airlines what they should be. Despite discounted airfares full service provided here as well including drinks full meal and a glass of water at the end of the flight. Service was also very friendly and attentive and unique compared with many of the quality legacy European carriers where staff no longer seem as committed to their work as in generations past.

FRA-DME-OVB. FRA to DME was very good staff could have spoken english. This is the only gripe I have with the FRA-DME leg of the trip the DME - OVB leg however was worse. DME airport was packed I was charged for overweight baggage - even though I was within the limits. Their staff at DME don't speak English and I had to run to the gate. The flight was delayed by an hour because the FRA-DME flight was delayed (and customs took well over an hour). The plane to Novosibirsk was scary to say the least. The only way I can describe it is as a flying train. No overhead bins in the middle aisle staff didn't speak english seats were all torn and well past their life.

Domedovo-Khujand return. The plane wasn't new but seemed sturdy! I don't think much English was spoken in the plane but in the airport it was fine helpful (if slow) assistance in the transit area of DME. Lots of pushing on and off the planes but seems unnecessary as there are seats for everyone. Watch out for the surprise 20 kg weight limit per passenger (INCLUDING HAND BAGGAGE) when leaving Khujand. ($5 per extra kg - maybe if you speak Russian you can talk your way out of this one.)

Domodoevo - Osh Kyrgyzstan. Online booking is great although little English spoken at their ticket desk. I would say they were great except the Kyrgyz refuse to queue and staff wouldn't or couldn't control them. Inflight one decided to change seats to the empty one next to me and piled so much baggage under and over his seat he could hardly sit down - and I was crowded as well. He then nursed a bottle of vodka he had brought on board throughout the flight and was getting rather difficult by the end.

Moscow-Novosibirsk-Moscow flights by A310 (going there) and A319 (coming back). The seats in the A310 were a little cramped but the cabin was spotless and felt fresh the cabin was clearly more roomy on the A319. The food on is a lot better than Aeroflot and the flight attendants seem eager to please the passengers. The crew spoke very good English on the flight to Moscow but not as much on the flight to Novosibirsk. S7 is a jewel among its competitors. They have more western aircraft than other Russian carriers and the service is better.

Moscow DME-OSS return on Tupolev TU 154M. DME-OSS left on time. Staff at the Domodedovo Airport friendly. Crew only made announcements in Russian. All magazines were in Russian. It was 5-hour flight and some snack/drink given after we took off. Staff in OSS were very unprofessional. Luggage was just thrown on the floor for passengers to pick up. Immigration was not organized. On the way back we booked the VIP lounge and nothing except tea was served there. Flight from OSS to DME was delayed due to the airline's failure to extend their contract with the ground fuel supplier. So plane flew to Bishkek's Manas FRU airport. Passengers were not allowed to leave the aircraft while it was being refuelled. It took 2 hours. Cabin was very warm staff did not speak English. Food was cold. We were delayed. Staff at DME was very slow. Luggage was delayed immigration was very slow. Time in line was about 2 hours.

Peking - Novosibirisk return. Older A310 spotlessly clean service and food good. Have used S-7 many times and consider they stack up very well with the major carriers. I note the flight routes are beginning to expand and I wish the company success. Good no frills airline that will develop further in the coming years.

Moscow-Irkutsk-Ulan-Ude economy return. The flight was meant to be a direct DME-UUD but the airport at Ulan-Ude was closed for repairs so I flew to Irkutsk and travelled to Ulan-Ude on a specially organised bus (it took 8 hours!). Despite this setback which wasn't S7 Airlines fault and the fact I was delayed both ways due to the weather the flight was uneventful and the meal service has improved considerably since I last flew with them - and it wasn't even bad before! There was a choice of hot meal and as much free soft drink as you wished though alcoholic drinks must be paid for. There was also tea and coffee and before landing in Irkutsk a breakfast snack was served. It was much the same on the return leg. The seats were a little cramped (it was a Russian Tupolev Tu-154) and I suppose the decor was a little dated (though I liked the multi-coloured headrests) but that didn't matter much. The cabin crew were smiling and courteous a lot and announcements were given both in Russian and (very good) English. After the plance crash that happened the previous week the crew remained very competent and professional as I am sure it must have been a difficult time for them too. Although the crash in Irkutsk affected this airline it didn't put me off flying with them and it would not stop me from flying with them again in the future. They will always be my first choice when flying Trans-Siberian routes.

Munich-Moscow. The aircraft was operated by a new(ish) 737. Aircraft was painted in a bright green livery and the cabin looked very fresh with a number of colours. All passengers were served a hot meal with free non- alcoholic drinks. The captain only made announcements in russian and the cabin crew although friendly spoke almost no english or german.

Frankfurt--Novosibirsk. It`s been the first time that I flew with a Russian company. Airbus A 320 was very clean old but good. The service was excellent. The staff friendly and helpful but only one person were able to speak a little bit English. To me it was not a problem because I speak Russian but normally they should have English speaking staff when flying from an international airport. The meals were delicious in the middle of the plane in a small kitchen they served mineral water and different sorts of lemonade. Every passenger could take as much and as often he wants. They offered regularly tea or coffee I think every hour. For me it was an interesting experience and I think some European companies especially Lufthansa can learn a lot from Siberia.

Domodoevo-Novokutnetzk. Flight operated by Tu-154 very worn and dated but makes for an interesting ride. Aircraft noisy and the interior clearly 70's. Flight very uneventful with business and economy class in the same section of the plane. Food okay on par or better than many European airlines will serve - with three choices. Crew poor at English but messages get across. No free alcohol but other drinks available. Recommend but then again they have monopoly on several routes.
