### "might give them another chance"
Zhuhai to Jinan. The flight was delayed for nearly 4 hours with no real explanation. They told us it was due to traffic control. After a 2 hour delay we finally board the plane, but after the safety demonstration, we were told that we are again delayed and that they will start serving food and drinks while we are waiting. Another 2 hours on the tarmac. I am not a fuzzy eater and I just couldn't eat the beef rice - a concoction that tasted like plastic. My travel companion opted for the pork noodles - also he couldn't eat his meal. plane is fairly new - a Boeing 737-800 with personal TV screens (the first I've seen on a Chinese domestic airline) but they didn't work, so no inflight entertainment during our delay as well as for the duration of the flight. The tray tables were dirty and sticky. No magazine or safety card in my seat pocket. The cabin crew was friendly and fairly patient (although tired looking) dealing with the angry passengers. Also good English skills from both the cabin crew as well as the captain. Seat pitch is good, even for me (6'2 tall) - better than most domestic airlines in China. It might have been just a bad day flying with them and I might give them another chance.
