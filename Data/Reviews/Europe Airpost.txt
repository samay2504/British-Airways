### Europe Airpost customer review
I flew from Glasgow to Halifax in August 2014 with Europe Airpost. I was attracted by the great ticket price and a direct flight to Halifax Nova Scotia. The ticket was almost half the price of the major international airlines. An extra leg room seat cost 19 Euro each outward and 7 Euro return each fantastic value. The flight was very pleasant a clean aircraft complimentary newspapers headsets and meals. The crew was pleasant but unobtrusive. Flights in both directions departed and arrived on time. It is the first transatlantic flight I have made in a small aircraft like this Boeing 737 it resulted in smaller than normal queues to embark and disembark and also to reclaim baggage. Not much else can be said except great flight great price I wish air travel was always like this.
