### "fly with another airline"
I booked a flight with NAM (sriwjaya air group) flight IN-281 expecting a smooth journey, but instead, I got a disaster from start to finish. NAM canceled my flight and dumped me on Sriwijaya Air. Sriwijaya Air's flight SJ-9281 was supposed to leave at 17:45. It didn't. It got pushed back to midnight, leaving us stranded at a closed Denpasar Airport with no food or drink options. Adding insult to injury, they moved the gate last minute just to mess with us more. Did they apologize? Offer compensation? Nope. The ground staff were okay, but they could only do so much with an airline that clearly doesn't give a damn about its passengers. There were no rescheduling options, and refunds are supposed to take 90 days. When we finally got on the plane, it was like stepping into a time machine—straight to an aircraft museum. The seats were just okay, but there was no in-flight entertainment. Snacks were there, but they didn't make up for the overall misery. We landed at 01:30AM Jakarta time in a remote parking spot. Then, in drizzling rain, we had to deplane using stairs without umbrellas and walk to the arrival terminal. I'd recommend to avoid NAM and Sriwijaya Air like the plague. The constant delays, lack of communication, ancient planes, and utter disregard for passenger comfort make these airlines a complete joke. Do yourself a favor and fly with another airline.

### "I still don’t have my money back"
I booked a flight and one day before they cancelled the flight. I went to several offices of Sriwijaya but they told I have to go to the booking intermediate. They tell me that the company did not refund it. It was 4 months ago and I still don’t have my money back. Never book a ticket with them, they take your money and never do any refunds.

### "No customer support"
Not Verified |  We have taken two legged flight with this airline and first one departed with 1h delay and second leg is first postponed by one hour and then by two hour delay. Second leg was delayed by 3h in total so we missed the connection boat. No customer support, no explanation.

### "bad experience with this company"
I wanted to alert other users of our bad experience with this company. In the absence of 15 days to fly, they have canceled the flight that we had reserved due to operational changes and we found all kinds of problems for the refund of the money that the tickets cost us. We have offered to be put on another airline but they tell us that they cannot do that. The response by mail is always through pre-written without giving a solution or refund. As we have been informed, this airline is canceling multiple flights, generating this problem for customers.

### "this company is total joke"
Absolute disaster. First after buying e-ticket I didnt received any confirmation or e-ticket. After few emails they send me my ticket. On the airport when my luggage was on the way to airplane some woman behind counter told her colleague that we can not fly to Sorong. No closer explanation and send us away. We came to Sriwinaya office on the airport. Again no closer explanation. She just showed me picture in her phone in Indonesian language. When I translated it by my self I found out Sorong airport is closed. They asked me if I want refund but when I told them: Ok make a refund she told me oh sorry I dont know how. You have to send email. So I send email but answer was "You have to call us if you want cancel flight. So I called them 5 times. In last call they told me there will be 30 USD fee for transaction and also 15% fee for cancellation. Transaction time is 2-3 months. So I asked for some credit or maybe change date of flights but there is no other option. 15% fee and 30 USD fee is only option. For me this company is total joke.

### "Sriwijaya just don't care"
Sorong to Ambon. I bought a flight 2 months before the departure date, and they cancelled it just one week before, with just a simple email : your flight is cancelled. 2 weeks after, no news, no refund, nothing. In conclusion Sriwijaya just don't care, they take your money and keep it.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  Siborong-Borong to Jakarta. Hotline of this one is almost impossible to reach. for 25 kg extra luggage from DTB airport to Jakarta they want 3.1 million IDR extra - more than for the original flight. if I prepay. I don't want to know how much it is when I am paying at the airport .. already cancelled the second flight with them and booked a flight with AirAsia. This was cheaper than to pay extra luggage. Stay away from this airline or just travel with max 15 kg checked-in luggage. We are doing 12 months world trip so not possible for us.

### "haven’t answered our request"
We can’t believe that they have canceled the 2 trips we had with them. First to go to Borneo to Sorong and then to go from Sorong a Denpasar. They owe us more than 800€. They say they can pay up to 3 months later. But as today (2 weeks after the cancelation) they haven’t answered our request for a refund. They only want to refund one flight without the connecting ones.

### "clean and comfortable"
Sorong to Jayapura. Flight left almost on time. Aircraft clean and comfortable with friendly crew and many empty seats at the back. Inflight meal only a cup of water and a little breadroll.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Manado to Sorong. Flight left about 20 mins late. Seats were comfortable, with entire empty rows at the back. A very basic breakfast of water and a spongy bread roll served.

### "journey went smoothly"
Yogyakarta to Ternate via Makassar with Sriwijaya Air. Both legs of the journey went smoothly. No significant delays, comfortable seats and decent hot meals provided, with a 15 kg free checked-in luggage allowance.

### "never fly with them again"
Sorong to Makassar. This company is an absolute joke and I will never fly with them again. They keep modifying the schedule without letting the travellers know. Ridiculously overpriced for a domestic flight in Indonesia. Same your time, money and sanity and fly with another company!

### "recommend it"
Jayapura to Jakarta. I've flown with Sriwijaya Air several times even before they're under Garuda Indonesia's maintenance. And I could feel the differences before and after the merging. I love their time management and of course their meals. I would fly again with Sriwijaya Air and recommend it to my family and friends

### "hows very poor management"
With less than 24 hours received a notification of change time of flight from 13.35 to 8.40 I tried to contact numoreous of time from noon till 8pm and still cant find answer to resolve my situation instead is either you take the condition or just refund attitude from the CS I think as customer if given reasonable reason e.g. whether condition, etc I can still accept it. But this is outregous the reason is 'rescheduled from HQ', that's it! Me as customer has to be the one cancelled my schedule work without clear reason. I feel this one of the most unfulfilling service experience a customer can get with the unprofesionalism (no call backs, I am the one who needs to call so many times to find out my status, but they did call once to 'inform'. And by the sound of it he is just a pity junior staff who cant answer anything - this shows very poor management, the call ended by promisiing I will be called back which 5 hours pass and no call backs). I wont recommend this airline at all! !

### "overall experience is nice"
Flew from Jakarta to Makassar, my overall experience is nice, the flight is on-time, maybe because my flight is the earliest flight of the day. The staff is fine, and the flight is rather boring. But on my 2 hours and 20 minutes flight hot food was distributed. The food is rather bland but hot food is still a hot food. Overall, I could recommend. My tip for Sriwijaya is select the earliest flight out.

### "Never again"
I booked a flight with Sriwijaya for a 10.30am departure from Jakarta to Pontianak. I turn up at the airport at 9am, check in and then hang around. Then I notice that the flight is not actually due to depart until 11am. It was always an 11am departure and their website had got it wrong when it stated 10.30. But leaving at 11 would still get me Pontianak at 12.25. A bit tight for my meeting, but doable. So while I waited, I checked out some stats for the flight I was about to take. Over the last ten days, almost every flight was delayed. Sometimes by up to two hours. This concerned me and so I checked the whereabouts of the incoming flight. It was presently flying from Malang to Jakarta. And it was on time. So no delays. And then it lands and I’m very happy. So I wait and wait and there are lots of announcements in Indonesian (I’m a Brit) which I couldn’t understand. But I could tell my fellow passengers were a bit annoyed and so I went up to the desk. ‘I’m sorry, sir,’ said the young lady. ‘Two hour delay.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Operational reason.’ So that was that. Meeting cancelled and I didn’t bother taking the flight. When I went back to get a refund for their misery making, I received the final sting on Sriwijaya Air’s tail: instead of a full refund of 1.4 million rupiah, they gave me 541,00. Lesson learned: I should have flown Garuda rather than chancing it with these jokers. Never again.

### "disgusted with this airline"
Palembang to Jakarta. Absolutely disgusted with this airline. I arrived at 5.00pm for my 6.40pm flight and was shocked to see it rescheduled for 9.15pm. When I spoke to the CS, they informed me that they had "just" got the information and that is the reason why nobody was informed. They directed me to their ticket office to air my complaint. There were 2 young women in there, I proceeded to ask one of them if there was an earlier flight, she said she would check and walked out. The other one quietly informed me that there was no other flight. The other one came back (as though she had consulted someone) and said she checked and there were no more flights. I then left to check in and was shocked that the BP said boarding time was 8.45pm, meaning they had known long enough to print it out on the BP. My checks revealed the plane had not been on time for the past 3 weeks. Very disappointed with the horrible service and lack of empathy.

### "flights are outdated"
Sorong to Makassar. This month, I flew four times with this airline and and all four times we started late. The delay was on average one hour. The flights are outdated and the food was not good either.

### "Horrendous passenger relations"
Flew Jakarta to Denpasar with Sriwijaya Air. Over 7.5 hours total delay. After 2 hour delay boarded aircraft and had to return after technical problem. Waited another 4+ hours. Very little information. Horrendous passenger relations. Worst carrier in Indonesia.

### "poor customer practices"
This is a review to make sure everyone is aware of the poor customer practices this company uses. I was supposed to get reimbursement for my flight back in July and had to provide all my bank information to the company's customer service department so that this would be done quickly (after having to call them in person for 2-3 weeks since they wouldnt pick up a single phone call for a while). It's been 3 months now and the customer service department decided to start ignoring my emails as they still haven't paid me back while they said it would take a month for me to receive payment.

### "I was very satisfied"
Flew with Sriwijaya Air from Sorong to Makassar September 6th, 2018. Check in was a little chaotic and it only opens two hours prior to flight departure, however after checking in I was able to go the lounge. The lounge is pretty basic, however there were snacks available and there was a good Wi-Fi connection. The flight itself was on schedule and the onboard cabin crew were very attentive. The meal provided was good and tasty as was the service. After arrival in Sorong my baggage was ready to collect within 5 minutes of me arriving in baggage area, which I consider excellent. Overall, I was very satisfied with the services that Sriwijaya Air provided on this flight.

### "Sriwijaya Air never again"
We booked a flight from Denpansar to Sorong with transit in Makassar. The transit was supposed to be 8.5 hours over night so we booked a transit hotel in Makassar with free cancellation until one day before. Today when we arrived at the airport we were told that our flight to Makassar had been cancelled already weeks ago and that we can take another flight 5 hours later. They insisted that they had informed us via SMS but it never arrived, other tourist had exactly the same problem. I showed them my phone for proof, still the only thing they offered was refunding the ticket so we can book with another airline. This didn’t make sense because all other options did not save us much time (especially with the luggage check-through) and were more expensive. I expected them to at least refund our hotel that we could not cancel anymore (in Europe you even get money if you have no damage claims and a delay; just for the inconvenience). They also called me but only short beforehand with an unknown number, when I tried to call back, nobody answered. In the end all we got was an indifferent apology and two boxes of plane food. Oh and the flight we got in exchange was also delayed for one hour - this time I got an SMS. Thank you Sriwijaya Air, never again.

### "avoid this airline"
Jakarta to Sorong. Avoid this airline if you don't live in Jakarta! Flight was cancelled a month before scheduled departure. When I called for a refund for my Sriwijaya Air website credit card purchase, I was told that I had to go to the Jakarta main office to process a refund. As I live in the US, this is obviously a problem. No explanation why they can't just refund my credit card like a normal company. So I will spend my one day in Jakarta going to their head office--needless to say I am not optimistic I will get my US$700 back. Lesson learned--never fly Sriwijaya Air!

### "not a bad service"
Flew on Sriwijaya Air from Sorong to Ujung Pandang on July 23rd. The flight took off behind schedule due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft. The ground crew tried to turn around the plane quickly so as not to delay too further. Check in at Sorong was quick and the staff were very helpful. The flight itself was good and the cabin crew were attentive. Overall not a bad service for a low cost airline.

### "a professional attitude"
My flight with Sriwijaya Air is a connecting flight from Pontianak to Solo via Jakarta. The first flight was being delayed for 1,5 hours. The second flight is better than the first one. The flight attendant is turning on reading lamp for the passenger who is still reading when the plane is preparing to take off before the plane's light is being dimmed. It's a professional attitude from the flight attendant.

### "Sriwijaya is not recommended"
Jakarta to Denpasar. Sriwijaya is not recommended for your business/holiday trip. They reschedule my flight without my agreement. The customer service told me that it was canceled and reschedule to earlier flight. My friends bought the same flight, and their flight isn't canceled, because they have transit flight (Medan to Jakarta then Jakarta to Denpasar) so if their flight changed or reschedule, Sriwijaya will be a failure. Sriwijaya customer service very hard to be reached, in my 10th or more attempt, i just can get connected to the person (customer service). I'm really disappointed. I know there is an event on Bali on the date, i am attending it with my friends. The reasons i bought the same flight so i can together with my friends. How come people booked earlier and Sriwijaya changed the flight without my agreement.

### "further delayed by another 5 hours"
Denpasar to Sorong via Makassar. Horrible service!! The flight to Sorong was delayed by one hour in the beginning. At the time of boarding it was told that the flight was further delayed by another 5 hours! This is ridiculous. No information was given to customers before arrival at the boarding gate, to plan accordingly. Moreover due to this, my connecting transportation got missed and the airline did not agree to compensate for that.

### "totally useless"
Jakarta to Denpasar. Late due incoming. Being in the industry this is an excuse for every flight of the day running late and progressively getting later. It is the hallmark of an airline that is typical of the bottom feeder that is Sriwijaya; totally inadequate to operate. CGK - DPS, 3 hour delay incoming. DPS - CGK 2.5 hour delay incoming. Would not fly this airline, and I use the term loosely, ever again. Rumours of their impending bankruptcy is now generally accepted as only a matter of time and now can confirm why. Totally useless!

### "terrible customer service"
Surabaya to Jakarta. I have not flown with this airline before. Check in experience was smooth and fast at T1 Juanda Airport. However, things got bad quickly as the flight was delayed by 15 minutes and two flights were in one departure gate, making it very crowded. People were sitting on the floor, which was horrible. When the time arrived the ground crew shouted over and over again, telling people to hurry. What terrible customer service! The food was only one tiny horrible bread and mineral water. The plane was dirty, the seat pockets were filthy as well as the floor. Baggage claim was delayed because of the slow ground crew. For me, this middle service airline is worse than Citilink, which claims to be a budget airline.

### "the experience was a good one"
We arrived at Surabaya Juanda International airport where we found our flight would be delayed for 1 hour. We were not too happy because we were early. We checked in and headed to our gate were we found out that we would be delayed for another hour, I got restless and decided that we would visit the "Blue Sky" lounge. We boarded 2 hours and 30 minutes late, with friendly smiles, we got to our seat. One flight attended was wearing a hijab which was very unusual for an Indonesian carrier. The snack service began and in the paper bag contained a cheese sandwich and water. We landed in Jakarta Soekarno Hatta T2 3 hours late. All in all the Sriwijaya experience was a good one, the only problem is the delay.

### "staff would not allow us to check"
Bali to Dili. The counter staff would not allow us to check in without pre-arrival visa. Even thought I show her the information on Timor Leste Consulate website: passenger traveling to Timor Lester via Dili International Aiport or Dili Seaport on business or travel purpose can apply for visa on arrival. I require to meet her manager but she told he/she wasn't there. I require her to show the official regulation from Timor Lester but she failed to do so and asked ourselves to contact the Consulate. We were unable to contact the Consulate as they were on holiday. I wrote the email to complain and require the explanation but they didn't reply. The second email was sent after a week waiting but they also didn't reply. That's the worst service.

### "attendants wearing Hijab"
Surabaya to Yogyakarta. Boarding delayed about 45 minutes due waiting for passengers transfer from Kupang Ground staff informed us and give us snack for delay. Flight attendants wearing Hijab, thats very different with other airlines in Indonesia. They have a smile when served snack cookies. The cabin and toilet also pretty clean. Landing in JOG delayed about 20 minutes due traffic on Yogyakarta. Flight attendant give announcement in Bahasa Indonesia / English / Java.

### "missed our flight home"
Yogyakarta to Jakarta. I am an American and was traveling through Indonesia. I stayed for 2 weeks and booked a flight with Sriwijaya Air from Jogja to Jakarta before my flight home. My flight home was scheduled with plenty of time to spare in Jakarta after I would have landed from my flight with Sriwijaya. In Jogja, myself and my fiancé were waiting for our flight to Jakarta with Sriwijaya. We were in the terminal waiting and realized we hadn't boarded the plane and it was already after our scheduled take off time. We asked the airport staff if we were delayed. They said yes and that we were delayed an hour and a half. An hour and a half passed and we asked again and they said there was another 30 minute delay. 30 minutes passed and we asked again, and once again there was another delay. This continued for about 3 hours and we missed our flight home. Other flights were leaving on time except for Sriwijaya's flights. There were no other flights home for 2 days so we had to stay 2 extra days in Indonesia.

### "dirtiest plane I have ever been"
Jakarta to Medan with Sriwijaya Air. This was the dirtiest plane I have ever been on, and I have travelled a lot. It smelled bad, there was dirt and crumbs all over the seats, it was disgusting. Such poor quality for any airline, and very uncomfortable to be on such a flight. Will never fly this airline again.

### "quite good value of money"
Sriwijaya Air have quite good value of money for this flight from Silangit to Jakarta. There are other airlines with better amenities flying the same route, but Sriwijaya is one of the few who is doing the direct flight. The worst gripe is that some of the flight attendants are really not professional. The flight attendants generally is bugging the passengers to buy from the inflight shop, which costs lots of money. One of them even sit beside the passenger to ask the passenger to buy the item. While the passenger is also on fault for not rejecting this behavior, the actions of the FAs are not professional at all. The food is not good. The seats are pretty standard in Indonesia. The ground staff at DTB is quite nice and quite quick in checking us in.

### "this new route is promising"
Tanjung Karang to Yogyakarta is actually a new route. I was required to fly from Bandung to Yogyakarta, but as an aviation geek, of course I wanted to fly the longest and farthest. I found that an early flight to Tanjung Karang from Bandung is possible to be connected with Sriwijaya Air's flight to Yogyakarta. So I booked it. How was my flight? Departure time was 15.20 LT. But when I arrived at 13.20 LT to secure my favorite seat (emergency exit, window), I was told that there would be a delay. I was expected to fly at 17.00 LT. I didn't mind, especially as beside me, there were 150+ passengers of Lion Air who were supposed to fly at 08.00 LT to Jakarta but still stranded at the airport. A 1 hour 40 minutes of delay for me was fine. Check in went smoothly. I got my favorite seat. The ground crew gave me snacks for the delay compensation. I boarded first. The flight went okay. The food was nice (a cup of water and a slice of cheese bun). Getting my baggage was another story. The conveyor belt was merged with NAM Air's flight from Jakarta. It took 35 minutes for me to grab my luggage. Overall, this new route is promising.

### "better airlines to use"
Denpasar to Jakarta. Terrible service. Was supposed to depart at 4.20 pm from Bali and arrive in Jakarta around 5.20 pm local time. However when I arrived at the check in counter at Denpasar Bali Airport they told me the flight had 1.5 hour delay. I thought OK not too bad as my international flight that I was supposed to get from Jakarta to Istanbul will be at 8.30 pm so even if the time will be tight I could still make it if I arrive in Jakarta at 7 pm. However the flight then had two hours delay at the end and left Bali airport around 7 pm. Obviously I lost my connection to Istanbul from Jakarta. I went straight to the customer service of Sriwijaya airport based at Jakarta airport and they gave me no apologies regarding this matter - no compensation, no help to get me a hotel to stay overnight in order to take another plane to get me back to Europe the next day. They simply said they cannot do anything about it. I can understand 30 minutes or one hour delay but two hours is a bit too much and such a bad customer service I have never experienced in my whole life and I travelled a lot. There are so many other better airlines to use like Garuda or AirAsia and so on. Don't rely on this airline!

### "price is quite affordable"
I had a flight last week from Yogyakarta to Jakarta with Sriwijaya Air. Check in staff are very friendly. I asked where the airplane coming from and she replied with a smile. The flight was delayed about 10 or 15 minutes due the traffic congestion in Yogya. With an hour flight, I got a tango snack and a cup of mineral water. The seat was good, and the airplane little bit hot at that time. My main criticism is to their cabin crew, which is not quite friendly enough. One of the staff doing the safety demonstration did not have any smile or attract any attention from the passengers. I think they should smile a lot during the flight. Overall, the flight is good and the price is quite affordable.

### "great service for low cost carrier"
Jakarta to Pangkalpinang with Sriwijaya Air. Great service for low cost carrier. 30 minutes before flying we are already asked to boarding and push back on time, but due the traffic in Jakarta we are delayed 10 minute for landing Cabin staff very friendly, warm smile and helpful. They help passengger to find their seats, and help to put on the hand baggage to the compartment, its very effective to manage the crowded when the passenger get on board. The snack on board fair enough for less than 60 minutes flying (sweet bun and cup of mineral water). The entertainment on board is only a magazine and newspaper (for free). The services was more than I expected. The cabin clean enough, and for the leg room is better than Lion air / Air Asia. The inflight shopping cost is reasonably priced. Cheap, great, touching and humble airline.

### "precisely on time"
First time flying on Sriwijaya Air from Surabaya to Jakarta. The flight was precisely on time. Surprisingly inflight the cabin crew distribute some snacks for us. Previously we never thought that Sriwijaya Air give snacks on their flights. Their inflight shop items also reasonably priced.

### "no notification flight changed"
I had a flight to Jakarta that arrived at the airport at 12am, so I intended to wait until my 6:40am departure flight at the airport. When I arrived at the terminal I wasn't allowed to enter yet to check my bag, so I spent the night outside the terminal. The update beside my flight never said 'gate open' or 'now boarding' as some of the others did, so finally at 6:00am I went into the terminal, where I was told my flight was not going to the city (Malang) I had paid for because their airport was closed, so I'd be taken to Surubaya instead. Because there was no update outside I didn't even have time to ask questions as the check in clerk took my bag and told me to run because boarding had already started. I just made my flight (ironic since I'd been at the airport for almost 6 hours at this point). Once onboard, there was no mention of the new destination or what was going to be done for passengers. As I de-planed, I asked the stewardesses, who told me I simply needed to find my way to Malang myself. I paid for a flight to a city, you gave me no warning  that I would not arrive there, and then you tell me 'too bad, figure it out? After I collected my bag (which had tags to Malang by the way), I found the Sriwijaya office and asked the man working there what the airline was going to do for me. His limited English made it a problem to communicate, but essentially he said the same thing as the stewardesses. When I approached him again to ask if he could at least tell me how to get to Malang, he couldn't help me. Thank goodness for another traveller that was in the same boat as me - he 'took me under his wing' and helped me get on a shuttle to the bus terminal (one hour), then through the madness at the terminal and onto the bus for Malang (2.5 hrs), and then to a taxi to my hotel (20 mins). Meaning that not only did I receive no notification that my flight had been changed, no assistance in reaching my actual destination, but it added almost 4 hours to my already 20 hour long commute from the Philippines.

### "cabin crew are friendly"
Denpasar to Jakarta on Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-800 with registration PK-CLT. Also my second flight with Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-800. The flight was full. Departed from Denpasar on-time. Cabin crew are friendly with passengers and helpful. As usual when you fly with Sriwijaya Air, you will got some snacks or meal too (depending on distance, on this flight is a cheese bread and a mineral water). The cabin are clean, with comfortable seats, about 30 or 31 inch seat pitch.

### "seat was comfortable"
Short flight with Sriwijaya Air, on a Boeing 737-800NG. The seat was comfortable with good legroom and with headrest. Even less than one hour flight, cabin crews still distributing us a snack (a muffin and mineral water) and also offering inflight-shop. The flight itself was smooth with nice takeoff and smooth landing. Recommended this airline.

### "flights running several hours late"
In our experience the flights are usually running several hours late. We recently lost half a day of our holiday in Bali because of Sriwijaya Air delays - supposed to arrive early afternoon, but arrived late at night. You might need assistance from staff (eg families with young children, elderly people). We arrived at the (domestic) check-in 35 mins prior to departure, struggling with bags and two toddlers. We eventually got the attention of one of the ground staff, who told us we were too late (official policy is you should arrive 45 mins prior) and had missed the flight. Then he walked off and just left us. No help rescheduling to another flight, etc. Thankfully there is now a lot of competition in the low budget airline industry in Indonesia, so shop around. In this price range, we would recommend Citilink, which in our experience doesn't have the above problems.

### "really disappointing experience"
A friend and I were due to fly Sriwijaya Air from Jakarta to Makassar. We arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and were told the flight (which was due to leave at 09.20) had been delayed until 10.00. All the information boards said 'departure now at 10.00' and the check-in staff confirmed this and wrote 'Be at gate for 9.25' on our boarding passes. We went for a coffee and turned up at the gate at 09.25 as instructed to be told the flight had left on time in the end. We were then told the check-in staff must be wrong and "you should never check the information boards" (which still read delayed until 10.00). The management staff refused to look at the boards and eventually blamed the airport authorities. No announcements were made or efforts to find us despite us sitting in the only cafe inside the terminal. The attitude from the staff was really poor and they were totally unhelpful. Their only suggestion was to book another flight with the airline - which was 12 hours later and we would have to pay again. No refund or further help was offered and the staff would walk away after shouting at us and then return unable to have a sensible conversation. We submitted a complaint since arriving home - I would advise avoiding this airline if possible as there are plenty of other domestic Indonesian airlines that are fair and Sriwijaya really let us down. A really disappointing experience.

### "fairly new aircraft and good staff"
Denpasar to Dili with Sriwijaya Air, and mostly okay. Check-in in Bali was a bit disorganised but once I got to the front of the line, I was dealt with quickly. Inflight staff were generally good and professional, speaking Indonesian and English. The only problem being their aggressive promotion of duty free goods, including leaning across me for long periods while their scarfs fell all over the place. Also offsetting the service was the worst inflight meal I've ever had. I think it was a battered fish fillet but it was so tough it could also have been chicken. It came with cold fries and some tinned vegetables that were the best part of the meal. Doesn't matter, it was a short flight. With fairly new aircraft and good staff, Sriwijaya Air probably one of the best Indonesian regional airlines.

### "inside the plane was very hot"
Sriwijaya Air flight from Denpasar to Jakarta. Took about 40 mins delay for the plane take off. We could see some maintenance staff going inside the pilot cabin but none informed about what was happening. While we wait inside the plane was very hot, even after asking the flight attendant to lower the temperature. They offered a pack with bread and water.

### Sriwijaya Air customer review
An old aircraft but well maintained, free snacks and water, smooth landing. Impressed with their service and price.

### Sriwijaya Air customer review
JOG-CGK with 737-300 SJ231. Delayed about 20 min due to military training above JOG. The flight itself quite smooth with excellent crews and well-maintained aircraft. Additionally they also done a very smooth landing. Surely recommend this airline.

### Sriwijaya Air customer review
PLM-CGK with Boeing 737-500. The flight was on time. Good ticket prices. No IFE but it was fair enough for a 50 minute flight. They provided a bread and a cup of mineral water during flight. The cabin staff were friendly enough.

### Sriwijaya Air customer review
Went from DPS to DIL with old Boeing 737. My tray table lock was barely functional and scotch tape was all over it. Other than that everything met the standard and surprisingly the food was not disappointing at all.

### Sriwijaya Air customer review
I often fly Dili-Denpasar. In comparison to Merpati the big thing is that they have newer more comfortable aircraft's. Otherwise they seem the same as Merpati: frequent delays (allow a lot of time if you're connecting through Bali) poor ground staff and co-ordination ok in-flight service and meals.

Flew CGK-SIN with Sriwijaya Air to make a change from the usual Lion Air Air Asia etc. Booked online only 48 hours before for the bargain price of 40 USD one-way. Check-in was fine with no queue and was lucky to get a retro boarding pass from a dot-matrix printer. We left 45 mins late but they apologised profusely Only about 20 passengers on the flight however the cabin crew told me the return flight from SIN was full. Aircraft was a Boeing 737-300 in surprisingly good condition and the captain was Australian. The only disappointment was the food - a strange combination of scrambled egg half frozen French fries and carrots. However it was still edible and at least food is free unlike the LCCs. I'd use Sriwijaya Air again.

Flight SJ099 from TKG-CGK was planned at 16.40 local time. Then my wife received short message informing that the flight will be delayed to 17.15 without any reason. We arrived on the TKG airport at 16.15 and my wife checked-in. The staff at check-in counter informing again that the flight will be delayed to 17.40. My wife then waited at the lounge and another announcement sounded another delayed flight for SJ099 to 18.40. The delay was going through 19.15 when my wife was finally boarding. The good thing was they informed about the delay the worst thing was the delay itself.

Flight from Batam to Padang. The check-in counter was so slow they should provide online check-in which will make it easier for those who doesn't need to drop luggage. Check-in staff were not polite and don't speak English. But inside the cabin the FA's were good and smiled. They still gave out a snack and drink on such a low cost price.

Tanjung Pandan to Jakarta in early July. Stewardess service is quite good food is just snacks but are tolerable. Flight was delayed almost an hour. During the flight stewardesses were busy selling rather than serving passengers.
