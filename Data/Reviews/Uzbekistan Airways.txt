### "Shaky seats, stale food, rude staff"
The Mineralnye Vody to Tashkent flight was best, but Tashkent to Delhi was disappointing. Shaky seats, stale food, rude staff, and poor service requiring repeated requests.

### "complete lack of organization"
Not Verified |  My experience with Uzbekistan Airways was extremely frustrating due to the complete lack of organization during the boarding process. At the airport, there was no clear line or queue system for check-in and baggage drop-off. Passengers were crowding chaotically, and the staff did nothing to manage the situation or maintain order. As a result, we waited for over 2 hours just to drop off our luggage and get our boarding passes. The disorganization continued inside the plane. Passengers were not guided properly, leading to confusion and delays during boarding. The cabin crew seemed overwhelmed and did little to assist or streamline the process. This lack of efficiency made the entire experience stressful and exhausting. I travel frequently, and I have never encountered such poor management at an airport or on a flight. Uzbekistan Airways needs to improve its ground and onboard operations significantly to provide a better experience for passengers. Clear lines, better staff training, and effective communication would go a long way in resolving these issues. I hope the airline takes this feedback seriously and works on improving its services. Until then, I would hesitate to fly with Uzbekistan Airways again.

### “seat belt sign was on the whole flight”
This is by far the worst airline I have flown with. I travel extensively and have flown with many different airlines. The captain switched on the seat belt sign the whole flight and the cabin crew locked the toilets and refused to let passengers use them. About 5 hours to the flight I needed to use the toilet and told the crew to open the toilet. The cabin crew shouted at me and pointed to my seat and asked me to return to the seat. There was no turbulence the whole flight but the seat belt sign was on. I told them I needed to use the toilet. While the male cabin crew was shouting at me the other female cabin crew was laughing. Throughout the whole, because the seat belt sign was on, the cabin crew conveniently sat in the galley and were not seen walking down the aisle offering drinks during the flight. The whole flight, nobody felt any turbulence at all. Yet the seat belt sign was on the whole flight, probably just a convenient excuse for the cabin crew not to work. During the meal service, the female cabin crew who recognised me, just slammed the cup on my tray table and walked away. I wrote to the airline to complain and nobody even replied to my email. I have flown with Air Koryo from North Korea. Trust me, they are better than Uzbekistan Airway. If given a choice, I would never want to fly with Uzbekistan Airway. Unfortunately, there are just two airlines flying to Tashkent.

### “It's basically extortion”
Checked in online but was unable to add checked baggage. The cost if done through the app is 50 euros for 2 checked bags. At check in, I told them and showed them a screen capture of the apps error message. They had me make a payment of 189.37 euros. I had no option but to pay this. It's basically extortion.

### "By far the worst airline"
By far the worst airline! I fly 6-7 times per year and have tried many, many airlines. This flight was a bit cheaper than the others so I wanted to try this, but this is by far the worst airline and I regret booking this flight. The first thing already started with the online check in not being available. I tried to check at what time I need to check in at the airport then. I searched and searched but couldn't find anything on it. On the day of the flight we went there an hour early. When I arrived they said the staff of Uzbekistan airways left a minute ago already. I tried to get ahold of someone who could help me, they called the staff and they just said they can't do anything about it anymore! There was still a lot of time left till the departure. I tried to call seat24 but they said I need to call the Uzbekistan airways directly. I called them for 45 minutes and no one even took the call. It said on the website that the support is available 24/7. I spend hundreds on this 45 minute phone call! The Communication and Support is absolutely non existent. I just had to go home and book another expensive flight a few days later. This mistake of booking with Uzbekistan airlines cost me almost 2000 euros. As a student this was so unnecessary. Please consider booking with a different airline. I am pretty sure with emirates for example something like this would have never happened or it would have been fixed in minutes.

### “really nice level of customer service”
As a well travelled Belgian who has been to 96 countries and used over 55 different airlines world wide, I can tell, Uzbekistan Airways really satifisfied me despite the negative reviews I have read over here and other websites. Due to the fact that the online checkin wasn't possible, not on the website nor on their app, we had to be early at the airport to make sure, we were seated next to each other. From the moment, my girlfriend and I, entered the air vessel, we were welcomed with a smile and notice some Spanish extra cabin crew members to the staff of the flight HY272 as well as the Uzbeki who also served us in English. Our 2 seats, on the left side, were spacious, the meal was suprisingly very varied and rich of side dishes such as extra fruit, dessert, some burek, sauces such as ketchup, olive oil and mustard. We were served many times with drinks during the flight. The cabin crew were very available, very caring and had a really nice level of customer service. This air vessel had the problem of non working screen entertainments. Keep that in mind if you are taking a 4,5 hour flight or longer. Also some of the locals don't really care about queueing  correctly, as entering the plane as well as embarking the plane, even we noticed them being a bit rude towards the airplane staff. Also I have to confirm, the entire staff showed the safety flight procedures, so they value the safety on board. If the screens would have been worked, I would give a 10.

### "Boarding efficient"
Check-in prolonged because their system was not updated concerning visa regulations. Boarding efficient, with bus transfer. Cabin crew - nice ladies, with friendly approach. Free drinks were served. There was free wi-if onboard. Flight was on time. Entertainment without headsets.

### "they served free drinks"
Check-in was fast but they gave me the boarding card of another passenger, which ended in switching our luggage. A security guard in the hall had a military approach to me when I asked about lounge access, like nobody taught him good manners. Boarding and departure were late about 30 minutes. Cabin crew was nice, they served free drinks. Standard seat, enough space. Entertainment screen available with movies but no headsets provided.

### "Extremely rude cabin supervisor"
Not Verified | Extremely rude cabin supervisor. I explained her that was pregnant and and needed cabin crew assistance to stow my hand luggage into overhead stowage. To what she replied with extremely aggressive body language “my male cabin crew are not your concierge boys”. I fly very often and it is scary to observe (as I am ex-cabin crew) how often cabin crew do not follow safety rules. It is scary and unpleasant to fly with them always.

### "Exceeded my expectations"
Overall everything went well on the 3.25 hour flight to Dubai. A large meal was presented. The small entertainment screen however did not work. But flight was uneventful and arrived on time. Exceeded my expectations

### "Absolutely brilliant service"
Andrey and his crew was fantastic. Absolutely brilliant service, they did it effortlessly and effectively. I would recommend family and friends. The toilets were kept clean. The only thing I would say there should be tv on long flights. That the staff can do nothing about.

### "a wonderful journey"
Not Verified |  I experienced a wonderful journey with Uzbekistan Airways. My flight is from Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul and we transit at Tashkent airport for 9 hours. We can only be able to enter a business lounge 3 hours before our flight, so we just sat around the airport, performed our prayers as a muslim, and they have comfortable praying areas at the airport. The business lounge check in was fast and excellent.

### "did not generate any reservation number"
Not Verified |  My problem begins with my reservation. I am planning to go to Uzbekistan with my family in Sept. 2022. I booked my tickets on line with Uzbekistan Air on their own website and paid in full via Visa card. The UZ Air system did not generate any reservation number. There is no active phone listing for the airline in USA. I tried to call Tashkent office to confirm my booking but none picks up the phone there. I tried to contact Uzbekistan Consulate in NYC, same thing. Phone rings for more than 20 minutes, wait music on but can not speak to anyone. Extremely disappointed with there customer (no) service. No one has contacted my via email/phone. What can one do in this situation. Who to complain. They have my money Can anyone help.

### "Avoid using this horrible airline"
Avoid this airline. Regular delays. Soviet style terrible service. So unprofessional! Too bad that this is the only one national airline of Uzbekistan. Avoid using this horrible airline at all cost!

### "Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight"
Very disappointed with Uzbekistan Airways service, from boarding until landing in Tashkent. Booked flight with my kids from DXB-TAS on the 7th of November. It started at the airport in DXB, where I requested to get seats in the forward cabin, as it is challenging with small kids to move with luggage all the way to the end of the cabin. The ground staff asked the supervisor if he could offer us forward cabin seats, he refused. He was rude not only with me but with the poor ground staff who was trying to tell him the correct procedure. I have flown many times with Uzbekistan Airways and I have noticed that he has been super rude with passengers and staff at all times (in Dubai and Sharjah). When I came onboard, surprisingly I noticed that there were so many empty seats in the forward cabin! So why did he refuse a mother with 2 small kids to offer a comfort? I assume he is backed up by someone, because this kind of unacceptable attitude for so many years and nobody takes any action! Inflight: - Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight, for take off some windows were dimmed, some were bright - I had two obese passengers sitting through the aisle (35E,F) for take off with their seatbelts were not fastened. Grooming of the crew was extremely poor, especially 2 crew who were seated in L3/R3 door. Male crew who worked from the AFT was not interested to serve us and other passengers, he spoke to us as if we were at the military and he was the general with us, soldiers. When he was serving lunch, somebody asked him for a glass of water, he said that he only has white wine on top of his cart. When I asked him what chicken was served with, he had difficulty in answering. He saw me struggling during disembarkation with kids and my luggage, he didn't even offer to assist us to disembark the aircraft - Not to mention that lavatories were dirty throughout the flight. On this flight the crew didn't smile and welcome guests, they all gave impression that they were forced to come and do this flight, except one who was super positive and welcoming from boarding. During the flight she came and checked on us if we needed anything. Sadly, she was the only crew who worked and valued her job. Don't fly Uzbekistan Airways, unless you really don't have any option to choose from.

### "it proved to be a fine experience"
I flew from KL to Tashkent economy class, 7.5 hours each way, departing late November 2019 and returning mid December 2019. I had some apprehension about the flight but it proved to be a fine experience. The well experienced 767s were smooth and comfortable and on the first flight had a rudimentary IFE system which had its quirks that nearly resulted in a finger tip blister! (On the return flight on another 767 there was no seat back screen but instead had roof mounted screens that were quite useless). The cabin crew were friendly and the meal service was very adequate and I certainly wasn't hungry afterwards. Perhaps because of the age of the aircraft I felt that there was more room as they had a 2-3-2 seating configuration and on both flights there were many unused seats and even complete center rows of 3 seats left vacant for sleepers had I wanted to. All in all a good experience with Uzbekistan Airways.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Tashkent to London Heathrow. I was pleasantly surprised by Uzbekistan Airways for this recent flight. Boarding was smooth and prompt (probably helps the flight was only half full), we pushed back near enough bang on time and from there had a very efficient flight to London, landing circa 35 minutes early. As mentioned the flight was only half full, it regardless there was plenty of legroom, over head lockers are very large, the whole cabin felt spacious. The only problem was the temperature, the plane felt like an oven for the entire journey. The in flight entertainment, whilst not particularly extensive, had enough to keep you entertained with a decent selection. The food and drink offerings were the only real negative. As a nation famed for its food I think Uzbekistan Airways can manage more than plain boiled white rice and a fried chicken breast, couple that with no beer or sparkling water available onboard led to the only real disappointment.

### "not been worth the flight"
Paris to Delhi via Tashkent. Ground staff at Paris didnt know well to operate the systems to generate boarding pass resulting into start of boarding procedures late by an hour, no response or information to passengers resulting into chaos. Inflight staff - rude behaviour, gave water after 20 mins of asking and later denied for water when asked for 3rd time. Veg food not available and food available only as per counting, if extra food asked for, denied. Even fruits were denied stating that only the packet of nonveg available if required could be given and separately fruits cant be given. Pillow and blanket was denied stating that you have neck rest which works as pillow so not needed and you have jacket which could be warm enough so blanket is not required. Alcohol (only red / white wine available) which was denied when asked for 2nd time stating that the flight had only 1 bottle (of white wine) which is finished so cant be served repeated later on however 1 glass of red wine was offered stating that only 1 extra glass can be given. Peanuts denied 2nd time stating that per passenger gets only 1 packed and that's finished. I was first time international traveller I was not aware how to order veg food for flight online due to which I asked for Support for getting veg food for connecting flight which was replied that it's not their job to guide how to order veg food, their job is just to serve what ever is ordered. The staff was talking to passengers with rude tone with the ones who tried changing seat as the flight was empty. At Tashkent Airport, the transfers staff in charge of issuing boarding pass didnt know how to process the boarding pass taking about an hour for completing the process resulting into delay in flight. The inflight staff in connecting flight from Tashkent to Delhi was decent, they even offered alternative as fruits as veg food was not ordered. Overall the behaviour and experience has not been worth the flight.

### "Disorganised boarding"
Tashkent to Istanbul. Disorganised boarding. Passengers were not called by rows. It was a free for all with a long queue. Good cabin service. Limited options for entertainment. Only 3 or 4 films available. No music, etc.

### "Antiquated, surly govt owned airline"
Kuala Lumpur to Tashkent. It is like going back in time, about 30 years back. Our departure from Kuala Lumpur was 1 hour 50 late, dep Tashkent on time. I cannot believe this airline does not serve beer, only white or red wine is only alcohol available, they also have no diet beverages, the very limited choice dies not even come with ice so fruit juices are warm . On the return trip we bought cold beer at the airport to drink Food on both flights was terrible, very limited choices, served by surly unhelpful staff. The good thing was the generous recline of the seats Entertainment was a joke, flight out had screens in the roof, so 80's, return had seat back screens which were a waste of space, latest movie in english fir over 10 year olds was 7 years old. I watched my tablet on both flights. Blankets and pillows ran out after 10 people on the early evening outbound flight, return had enough for a quarter of the plane and very begrudgingly given out. Antiquated, surly govt owned airline.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. We traveled by this from St Petersburg to Tashkent. That flight was good but the flight from Tashkent to Delhi number 421 was very old, no screens on seats, no pillows only child and women got pillows, no blankets for all, no wine or whisky, not enough flight attendants. Worst ever experience.

### "Crew very attentive"
Paris to Tashkent. Check in counters are located in CDG 2A terminal very quiet in the afternoon. Business tickets allow us to make a stop in the glamorous Cathay Pacific lounge : Champagne. And again Champagne as a welcome drink (Uzbek cuvée on the return ), warm nuts as an aperitif. Full dinner service, three choice). Light breakfast served before landing. Seats are 2-1-2, comfortable, amenities in a nice travel kit, IPad provided. Crew very attentive during all the flight, same for the return from Tashkent.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Moscow to Tashkent. I did not expect much from this airline, however I was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft seemed to be new and the interior was very clean. The boarding started on time, well organized. Both flights departed and arrived on time. I paid a little extra for the exit seat and got a huge space for legs, etc. The personnel on board was average but meals were excellent and abundant, the in-flight entertainment system worked well (funny English dubbing by a Russian speaker, one voice for all actors in movies). The overall experience is naturally not comparable to companies like Qatar or Emirates but nobody expected that quality either. All in all this airline exceeded my expectations and can recommend it to other passengers.

### "crew were not friendly"
Tashkent to Kuala Lumpur. The worst airline taken in all of my holidays. A week before we departed Singapore they sent an email to inform that flights home to Singapore are cancelled. We wrote in 3 times with no reply, called the Singapore office and the guy was impossibly unhelpful. We had no choice but to make our trip blindly and hope for it to get settled over in Tashkent. Our flight departing Singapore was delayed by an hour plus, and transit in KL, it was again delayed another hour. It happened the same for our flights home whereby new transit was in Jakarta, it got delayed an hour an half. We barely made it to catch our flight home with MH that the airline booked us home on. My luggage was left behind because of this. Flight crew were not friendly, barely smiled no matter how polite we tried to be. And they never once served water after the meal service. We had to keep going to ask for it and they always gave an unhappy look. Seriously, I don't know what kind of service industry this airline is in, because there wasn't any at all. The food from Singapore was okay, but the food from Tashkent was awful. Tasteless and dry. Our flight home was a night flight, yet the lights were not switched off for sleeping. It was a really suffering 18 hours journey home, with no food and no sleep and with unconfortable seats. Such a pity because the country is so beautiful and the Uzbeks are really nice people. The airline crew need to undergo intensive service training for sure.

### "experience was terrible"
Tel Aviv to Bangkok via Tashkent. The whole family - we are with two young children - 3 years and one year. We were preparing for this flight for long time, because flying with so little children is not a simple task. Before us there was a considerable selection of companies that offer the flight to Bangkok including some Israeli companies with flights even cheaper than Uzbekistan Airways. After much deliberation, we did choose to fly with Uzbekistan Airways because we also realized that the company has improved in recent years, and in terms of flight time with small children it suited and it was important for us to land early in Bangkok, since we had a flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui Island. And from there boat to Koh Phangan Island. The last boat leaves at 16, so landing in Bangkok at 6:40 am promised us an early arrival to Samui without having to stay there overnight but straight to continue to Koh Phangan. I would like to point out that on this journey we left with the full weight, since we are planning a long stay on the island. So it was very important for us that the road be continuous and without unnecessary stops with children and so many luggage. In practice everything happened the opposite! The flight from TLV was delayed in 5 hours. Not speaking about the food and the bad service during the flights, we arrived very exhausted to Bangkok at 13pm. We waited for 3 hours for the next flight (Our flight was at 9:40). We arrived to Samui much later after last boat to Pangan. We had to search for a hotel, carry all the suitcases and children. We arrive to Phangan in delay of day, which included all unexpected and unwanted expenses for taxi, food, lodging, not to mention the levels of fatigue we all came to. I was sorry for the moment when we decided to fly with this company. The experience was terrible, I do not wish anyone!

### "a horrible experience"
London to Amritsar via Tashkent. It was a horrible experience with Uzbekistan Airways. The in flight attendants were inexperienced. They burned my arm and leg in departure and arrival flights with hot coffee. The staff even didn’t knew how to serve coffee in flight. Then the worse part was that they didn’t even offer First Aid. The food quality, inflight entertainment, broken seats is not worth mentioning.

### "cabin clean and bright"
An internal flight from Urgench to Tashkent, As the airport is small has only 4 flights a day, check in was simple and fast, no chances of getting lost. You walk out to the plane on the tarmac Ryanair style. The cabin is clean and bright. With simple economy seats on a 3 - 3 fashion. The 4 staff soon had people on board and bags stored. The pre flight briefing was from drop down screens, that then showed a 15 minute video of Uzbekistan in flight. The crew served a selection of cold drinks after take off and this time no one was able to get tea from the business class section of the plane. The flight was straight forward and took around 50 minutes, landing in Tashkent was quick and we were taken from a remote stand to the terminal by bus. Bags where on the belt when we arrived.

### "crew were pleasant"
Tashkent to Urgench. Check in for this flight was simple and straight forward at the domestic terminal in Tashkent. Collecting a boarding pass and passing security took less than 10 minutes. We were bussed to the plane and boarding was simple and straight forward. The 4 crew were pleasant and spoke in 3 languages. Drop down screens gave the pre flight safety presentation, which 20% of the passengers ignored. Take off was swift and the captain gave a simple on board welcome in 3 languages. The cabin crew did not enforce seat belt rule on passengers not using them, but quickly stopped a person having lighting up a cigarette. Cold refreshment's (coke, sprite, juice and water) where served straight after take off, but people in economy walked into the business class section for hot tea. The 1 hour flight was in good weather and a low cruising altitude gave good views from the windows. The cabin was 3 - 3 seats and the interior was clean and bright. The cabin was a bit like Wizz Air. There was no IFE other than drop down screens that played a video of Uzbekistan. The landing was good and the empty airport was simple to navigate. Bags arrived within 10 minutes and we were out of the door into the clutch's of taxi drivers.

### "recommend Uzbekistan Airways"
Moscow to Tashkent. Fast and efficient check in at the Domodedovo airport with a ample lounge to relax before boarding with great drinks and food choices. Boarding process was a bit chaotic, the plane was full and there was no separate line for business class so it took a while for agents to check documents and boarding passes of everyone in the long queues until I was allowed to board. 3 friendly flight attendants greeted me aboard the beautiful cabin of their new Boeing 787, took me to my assigned seat, hung my jacket, and offered me some champagne, with a refill shortly after. They spoke very good English and were genuine friendly and courteous. They distributed noise-canceling headphones, newspapers and magazines, a cool amenities kit - a nice touch since this was a 5-hours flight - and the landing forms, plus informed lunch would be served shortly after takeoff. Cabin was very nice with ambient lighting and logos and touches of Uzbekistan Airways. Seat was very comfortable but not as private as if it was on a 2-2-2 configuration. Since I had an empty seat next to me, I had all the privacy plus lots of additional space. Right after takeoff, a flight attendant came to offer hot towels, additional drinks with a few small plates, and a food feast began. Several courses were served and I was very impressed by the quantity and quality of the food presented. Even though they did not offer a printed menu, stewardess brought several choices of appetizers, salads, soups, main courses, and encouraged me to try different combinations. Also the desserts, I agreed with two choices, but they brought more and everything was high quality and well prepared and presented in porcelain with Uzbekistan colors and logos, very classy. Shortly after lunch, they offered a tablet with several movies and music programs to choose from. Flight attendants keept checking passengers by offering more drinks, blankets, etc. until Captain has announced the approach to Tashkent. After landing, they went to every passenger to thank them for flying with Uzbekistan and to welcome to their country. As the airplane parked at a remote stand, a bus assigned to business class passengers took us to a private arrival lounge, where private immigration and customs facilities were offered, and the whole process went quite fast. I was very impressed with the warm and professional service provided along with excellence and attention to details. Only aspect to be improved would be the boarding process for premium classes. I recommend Uzbekistan Airways and I am willing to fly with them again

### "a rude attitude towards us"
Tel Aviv to Bangkok via Tashkent. From the very beginning at check-in, we felt a rude attitude towards us, but that was just the beginning. We got a place in the middle of the plane and not like in almost all other airlines passengers with children gets seats in the front with more space. Space between the seats in our place was not more than 20 centimeters (with a 9-month-old baby)! 6 hours flight from Tashkent to Bangkok The air conditioner did not work ! The toilet was located next to the business class and when I went to the toilet I was shocked to discover that in the business class the air conditioner was working and even felt the smell of cigarettes from there - unbelievable - the plane was very old and dirty no entertainment systems. The attitude of the staff was not patient and sometimes even rude. The connection in Tashkent was as bad as the flight everything processed very slow the passport check the security check was so slow and not professional. The air conditioner at the airport did not work It was very very hot. There is no normal food to eat, There are only 3 cells in the toilet with a huge queue and the smells were horrible, and finally, they lost our baby stroller!

### "don't expect much"
New York to Tashkent. Uzbekistan Airways offers direct flights from JFK. The fleet has some relatively new Boeing 787, but don't expect much beyond knowing you'll get there relatively quickly. There's no online check-in on the website, so arrive at least 3 hours early for international flights and expect to queue. Food is ok coming from NYC, very mediocre coming from Tashkent. Lots of screaming kids running laps in the aisles, so bring earplugs or music. Entertainment system has lots of Russian/Uzbek movies, but the worst dubbing I've ever encountered. Rather than removing the Russian soundtrack, they simply put the English translation over it so that both play simultaneously. The English translation is just that: one guy reading all the male character parts with a Russian accent, and a woman doing all the female parts.

### "26 hours in airport"
Moscow to Tashkent. Our plane was broken. We were 26 hours in airport without hotel and proper food. We could not leave the airport because flight was delayed every 30 min. They promised to fly immediately during 26 hours! We even could not finally enter the plane, which came instead of our one: Uzbekistan Airways simply forgot to re-issue our boarding passes. We had a nightmare crush during boarding, because new plane was smaller vs previous one. We even had an issues with police! finally air company refused us in any compensation.

### "a bit too rough and ready"
London to Tashkent. Plane left and arrived roughly on time. Very old, tatty and worn out Boeing 757 with very uncomfortable seat for a night flight and limited leg-room. Cabin crew were friendly but with limited English. Food was tasty. First time flying with Uzbekistan Airways and wouldn't do it again if there were any other direct flights available. All a bit too rough and ready for a 7 hour overnight flight.

### "rude customer service"
Riga to New York. Uzbekistan Airways is the worst airline ever. They are all rude - starting from the customer service via mail to staff on board! They don’t care about customer at all and do/say whatever they like. Do not recommend. The food is okay, enterteinment on board is okay but English is terrible..

### "their rude flight attendants"
Kuala Lumpur to Tashkent. Worst airline ever with their rude flight attendants and ground staff. It’s the only airline in Uzbekistan and no competition, that’s why they act whatever they want. You can’t complain to anyone because no one going to listen to you! I don’t recommend at all. But food is good.

### "cheap seat with extra legroom"
Beijing to Frankfurt via Tashkent. Check in at T2 in Beijing was easy and staff where giving priority to business classs passsengers. Lounge was okay even so I would not be happy if I was hungry. Boarding and flight were almost on time whichbin Beijing is almost like a miracle. Flight attendants were not over the top but decent and friendly. Food was not my taste but I guess this is a matter of what you prefer. Transit experience was nice for the lounge but transit staff at Taschkent were not so helpful and for some reason kept me waiting in a corner and could not tell me what for only to tell me then I could walk on now. Lounge run out of beer and food were snacks at best which you have to heat up by yourself. Internet was not working for me. On the leg to Frankfurt last minute change to Boeing 757 rather 767. Plenty of upgrades as a result as economy overbooked. The plane was old not very comfy for sleeping. The 767 before was much better and even so not a full flat seat it was alright to sleep. So seats are dependent on aircraft used. B767 is okay B757 is not. Guess 787 would be okay as well. Things are kept clean, IFE is utterly useless. Transfer in TAS easy if they do or tell you to wait for no good reason. Staff is average, which means like they seem to do their job alright but there was no pleasant surprises in service concept at all. Well considering they were cheap I would say I recommend to fly if all you are really after is a cheap seat with extra legroom. If you want a full business class experience I would avoid them.

### "very attentive and pleasant staff"
My wife and I flew Business Class out and return because of poor reviews. We were part of a group of holidaymakers. The Skyteam Lounge at Heathrow can not be faulted. We found the aircraft to be like many others, with the odd fault - my wife's inflight entertainment selector wasn't working on the return journey but she sleeps so it wasn't a problem. We had very attentive and pleasant staff with a choice of meals and drinks. Alcoholic drinks are available on request. The seats were very comfortable and reclined not too far from flat. On the return journey the Lounge at Tashkent had limited snacks available and alcoholic drinks had to be purchased. Boarding was swift and efficient. TIp - the Duty Free shop on landing is much cheaper than the Duty Free in Departures. We have absolutely no complaints about Uzbekistan Airways. Our fellow travellers in Economy were pleased with their journeys except that they had no choice of food. On the outward and return journeys there were not many Economy passengers. As a result they were able to sleep across three seats. Business Class was full. We read dire reviews of Uzbekistan Hotels too that were completely unfounded. The City Palace Hotel in Tashkent was excellent by any standards. The Asia Hotel in Fargana was another excellent hotel in rooms away from the noisy road. Don't believe everything that you read about Uzbekistan transport or hotels. I hesitate to label previous contributors as 'moaners', but that passes through my mind. Hotels tend not to supply plugs for basins and baths - take your own. Uzbekistan is a developing country and making a good job of it. They do need to make a good push to improve the quality and cleanliness of public toilets, which in some cases can only be described as dreadful. The i.pad has films but even if you choose English language, you get Russian.

### "behavior of stewardess amazed me"
This was my 9th trip on Uzbekistan Airways on the route Delhi to Tashkent return. I read many adverse review about this airline, but my experience was generally good. All this, however, changed on my last trip TAS-DEL on 26 October 2016. After taking my seat in the business class, I plugged my mobile phone's charger into the power socket on the seat panel. When charging was completed, I pulled out my charger, but, along with it, the plastic front of the socket too came off. One of the stewardesses straightaway told me that I damaged it because it cannot come off on its own, and that I was not careful. This behavior of a stewardess amazed me. This apart, it is unusual that business class passengers would be told something like this. I checked the Uzbekistan Airways web page for a feedback page, but, there was none. They have phone numbers, but no email address for contacting them. No web page like Contact us. As far as I am concerned, they lost me as a passenger.

### "uncomfortable sleepless night flight"
We flew to Tashkent on 11 October 2016 from London. This was a night flight of 7.5 hours and we wanted to sleep but it was not to be! This was an ancient plane whose business class seats reclined only a few degrees, it was 2x2 seating, did not taste the food as wanted to sleep. Tablets with pre loaded entertainment was offered. I don't understand why such ancient planes are used on such a route, they have Boeing 787 but these are not thought to be worthy of this route. The washrooms were sparsely equipped. A very uncomfortable sleepless night flight?

### "IFE was the flying map"
Tashkent to London. After having flown their Boeing 757 this flight was much better. The check in at Tashkent is a dedicated business class area and security clearance. The flight was on schedule. The aircraft was clean with comfortable seats with reasonable recline. The best IFE was the flying map! The wash room was sparsely equipped, with only Air freshener. The food was average. FA spoke reasonably good English.

### "this is a terrible airline"
New York JFK to Riga. This is a terrible airline. I asked the check-in desk staff about buying an upgrade to business class - they claimed that cannot be done, told me I’d need to buy a whole new ticket. The staff is so incompetent the company actually loses money. Trying to get assistance any from either Air Baltic or Uzbekistan Air both tell you to call the other and claim they cannot help. This is my first and last time choosing Uzbekistan Airways, I blame myself for believing some of these Eastern country airlines would compare to the western airlines. There was no power / USB outlet, no personal tv, and they give you about 6-8oz of water for the 8 hour flight. You have to harass the staff to get more tiny glasses of water.

### "seat cramped, cabin crew unfriendly"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with Uzbekistan Airways (HY551). I travel frequently between Singapore and KL, and I can say that it was my worst flight experience on this route. The boarding process was chaotic, I queued for at least 15 mins before boarding. The seat was very cramped and the cabin crew were unfriendly. The cabin was very stuffy before the takeoff. During the flight, there was no refreshment at all, apart from the welcome drink which was served before takeoff. There were PTVs available at every seat but it took me ages even to switch the language to English. I'm very disappointed at this airline, I paid SGD141 for this one way ticket (which is three times the price for AirAsia) and get this kind of horrible service. I will avoid this airline at all times.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Unfriendly staff broken seats not enough pillows for everyone one drinks service in 7 hours really bad food unclean toilets old movies (most of them in Russian or Uzbek). There was a drunk passenger onboard annoying other passengers and the staff could not handle this at all.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Bishkek to Tashkent then next day Tashkent to Urgench. Boarding was a trifle chaotic. Planes were clean. It was as good as many other airlines I have flown on. No IFE but who cares for short flights not me. It was a package tour so no idea of the "value for money" question.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
London Heathrow to Tashkent. 19 September. Flight 202. Returning 30 September. Staff were surly and unhelpful: one woman had a wet seat and was told tough - she moved herself. Food was diabolical and the worst I have eaten - well tried to. Inflight entertainment was a rubbish video played on an overhead screen too far away to watch.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I flew from Frankfurt to Tashkent and from Tashkent to Urumqi. These are out of the way airports but the service from Tashkent to Urumqi was fine. The counter at Frankfurt was very ill equipped to handle all the passengers and needs to be improved but overall the flights were fine. The inflight staff was very good.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I went on a packaged tour to Uzbekistan during October 2014 and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. We flew from Madrid to Tashkent and the airplanes were new with your own video (shame it only showed Uzbek films) and clean. We had the rudest stewardess I have met. Their English is good. The food was OK. Overall not bad. We also took smaller flights inside of Uzbekistan and they all left on time were clean the stewardesses were friendly and overall the experience was very good.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
LHR-TAS-LHR seat 3J (a window seat) in both directions. A good experience all-round and with a Business Class fare at a little over a thousand Pounds excellent value for money. My flight was operated by HY's latest 767s which come with comfy seats AVOD iPads loaded with films and games attentive service and excellent food. The cabin is decorated tastefully with a blue and cream theme. The eastbound flight is an overnight operation so I slept most of the way. The seats recline but do not go fully flat not even to angled lie-flat. Nevertheless they are comfortable enough and I achieved about six hours sleep so on arrival I was ready to dive straight in to activities on the ground. Breakfast was a choice of sushi and antipasti which were both of high quality. The westbound flight was operated in daylight hours and I enjoyed it a great deal. The stewardess was extremely attentive and the food including traditional Uzbek plov was excellent. Note that seats in row 1 do not offer stowage for slippers glasses books and so on whilst rows 2 and 3 do. Also note that the airline does not provide a toothbrush kit or other amenities so be sure to pick these up from the Skyteam lounge at LHR T4 ahead of departure.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
LHR-TAS-LHR September 2014. Step back in time with Uzbekistan Airways. Plus points - on-time in both directions reasonable ground experience felt safe some staff efficient and multilingual and completes London-Tashkent in half the time of the alternatives e.g. Aeroflot. Negative points - old 757 in both directions with fairly uncomfortable seats and limited legroom highly limited entertainment on small drop-down screens (e.g.dated film dubbed into Russian) and juddering audio channels food in generous quantities but mediocre tepid and tasteless tea some cabin crew rude and sighed heavily at minor requests from passengers or barked one word instructions random/unfair means of allocating front row seats once on board. One highlight is the bizarre video (played three times to cover Uzbek Russian and English) illustrating that passengers are prohibited from drinking duty free spirits fighting smoking playing with safety equipment or stealing airline property! In summary the airline does OK given their ageing fleet and the country's limited exposure to non-CIS countries. I would not actively choose this airline - especially for any connecting route on to India/Korea - but it was an acceptable means of getting to and from Tashkent.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Tashkent-Urgench September 2014. Very positive experience especially compared to experience on long haul services. Plane almost new with great legroom; departure on time; pleasant crew. This route probably prioritised to impress tourists but hopefully the airline will upgrade the rest of its fleet to the same standard and ensure all staff this well trained and pleasant to passengers. This means I could recommend HY for domestic services which use new Airbus aircraft.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
This airline is what most people say: it takes you from A to B. Don't expect anything more. I traveled from SHJ to TAS first class as there was no available seat in economy. Seats are old fashioned not flatbed but comfortable. Flight was 3.5 hours. Food was good and service was also good. Return was TAS to DXB economy. Seats were good typical for economy. Ticket is expensive (around 1100 US$ economy return) considering fight duration but I guess because it is the only airliner which operates direct flight from UAE to Uzbekistan.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I travelled from New Delhi to London via Tashkent on 23 Aug 2013. An untrained person was issuing boarding passes on check-in counter at IGIA taking ages for a routine task and asking his colleague for each and everything he was supposed to do. Flight from New Delhi to Tashkent (HY 422) was satisfactory. Extremely slow (waited for almost 2 hours in queue) check-in at Tashkent Airport. Check-in staff were talking on mobile phone while people were waiting in queue. In flight from Tashkent to LHR (HY 201 duration 8 hours) no vegetarian food was available. Food quality was very bad. Only cola and water was served in the second food serving. No TV no juice. Crew members don't say sorry or thank you.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I used to travel with my family (incl. children) on a regular basis from Geneva Switzerland to Tashkent and we are particularly satisfied with the quality of booking and ground services we receive from Uzbekistan Airways in Geneva as well with the flight conditions in general on this route.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
HY brings you from A to B. Best not to expect anything else. SHJ-TAS HY332 with A320. On time departure and arrival. No entertainment system. Poor food quality. Crew not motivated. Airplane more or less proper. Toilets rather dirty. Seats standard. TAS-DXB HY333 with B767. On time departure and arrival. IFE does not offer films in English. Poor food quality. Airplane proper except toilets. Blankets smelt. Crew unmotivated. Standard seats.

Flew from Tashkent to Almaty. Cabin conditions were ok staff were pretty uncaring with no genuine courtesy. Flight was on time.

Tashkent to Kuala Lumpur on 23/5/2013 at 22.15 by HY 551. One of the crew was very rude served coffee without creamer and sugar gave wrong drinks request blanket given after several requests no pillows given out. Seat was uncomfortable. Toilet and sink dirty. Most passengers did not finish the food.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Return flight London-Tashkent. Easy check in and access to Business Lounge at Heathrow good choice of food on board. Cabin Crew very friendly. Both flights on time. Given Fast Track voucher on arrival to LHR which saved me a good hour avoiding the queue. The only complaint - I could not get miles for Star Alliance.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
TAS-UGC (Urgench) domestic flight on an almost new A320. Everything clean and ok in the front cabin. Flight was fully booked but all procedures at the airport started early so boarding and take off were early too. In the front cabin they had a kind of welcome drink (non-alcoholic) before takeoff and coffee/tea during the flight of 75 minutes. No meal available but this was the only reason for criticism the other marks for Uzbekistan Airlines are (surprisingly) high. Good plane safe procedures (although time consuming at the airport) excellent on time performance - good value for money.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I traveled Kuala Lumpur to Almaty on 24 Oct. For the transit at Tashkent I requested for wheelchair assistant as I had a surgery and was unable to walk long distant nor carry my laptop bag. The airline didn't provide the service when I was at Tashkent boarding the plane to Almaty. When I requested for the service the staff instead asked a passenger flying to Almaty to carry my bag (he had to carry his own laptop bag as well) and I need to walk at the new terminal. I'm very disappointed with the service of the airline.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I flew to Tashkent on 5 October return on 12 October. Flights both ways were excellent. Boeing 757 on the way out and Boeing 767 on return. Planes were clean the flight crew helpful and friendly. Neither flight was full to capacity and thus I was able to have the entire seating row to myself each way. Was served dinner on both flights they were substantial and satisfying nice warm blankets were also on the seats on boarding. Both flights took off and landed at time. My only criticism is that the inflight entertainment was in Uzbek/Russian even though the films being shown were English/American. I would recommend this airline.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
BKK-TAS. Plane interior was yellow with age and quite filthy Toilet paper on the floor and a garbage bag just behind a passenger seat. I was horrified at the conditions. The food was decent but there not much inflight entertainment to speak of - in fact the screens on the left side of the plane weren't working.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
TelAviv-Tashkent-Tokyo Osaka-Tashkent-TLV plus TLV-Tashkent-BKK-Tashkent-TLV coach on all legs. Low cost airline means low maintenance in the planes the seats were coming apart the inflight entertainment was only in Uzbek (or Russian). We didn't try their food but the special meals we ordered were awful. Out of the 8 legs only one (the last thankfully) did we feel unsafe and that was because of turbulence. We flew high season and paid about 40% of the regular fare so cannot complain. I would not fly with them if the difference in price was not so huge.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Delhi-Tashkent-LHR - flew first class as was half the price of usual business class DEL to LHR. Had first class to myself. Old style reclining sprung seats in 767 - reasonable room but not lie flat. No power at seat so laptop ran out of battery which is a shame because in flight entertainment is a couple of poor films on overhead screen. Flight staff excellent even encouraging a visit to Uzbekhistan and showing the best tourist sites. Plenty of food and drinks on tap. Everything to time. Rather bizarrely the only delay was at Terminal Four when had to wait on the air-bridge for 30 minutes until someone opened the door! Overall felt budget compared with traditional carriers but very comfortable which is what I paid for.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Tashkent to Nukus (domestic) - was scared to board the old TU 154. Seemed to be patched up on the outside no one seems to acknowledge seat allocation and I think I caused an onboard fight by making this woman move from my seat who yelled at me and then the woman in her seat who took it out on the person in her seat and so on. But they did move. Wasn't that cheap considering the plane we were in. Couldn't relax until we arrived. Had some peanuts and flavoured water served to us. Seats folded down forwards when we got off the plane. Security guards in the baggage collection area checking our tickets when we collected our bags. Still it beats the 14 hours train ride when you're on a tight schedule.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Bangkok-Tashkent-Bishkek. Flight attendants great. An older plane but was comfortable in Business Class with no other passengers.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Lahore - Tashkent - Frankfurt in Business. First of all I'd like to acknowledge the work of the flight attendants. They do an excellent job friendly and quite service minded despite the dated equipment. Lahore - Tashkent food is - well that is the question. Supposedly chicken but it could have been anything. Tea was served in a plastic cup with broken ear. But with a smile. Some sort of business-class package given with slippers and sleeping mask. Tashkent - Frankfurt service fine only overhead IFE. I managed to fold down my chair to almost lie-flat - before realising it was because it was broken. My fellow passenger behind me protested with a moan (I would have been louder actually). Planes are old. They were nice 18 years ago when UA started their service. Nowadays it's not so good. But they get the job done. In conclusion it's fortunate I didn't have to pay these tickets out of my own pocket.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
If you book your flight in Tashkent you get what you pay for - basic service that will get you from A to B with no frills. However if you book your flight outside of Uzbekistan the flight prices are ridiculous. I regularly fly LHR-TAS-LHR. If I have my ticket booked in Tashkent it costs approx $350 return - if booked in London costs me about £550 from the airline. I take great issue with the check in at Heathrow. There are 3 check in desks to check in about 300 people. Many of those 300 speak little or no English which makes the process more prolonged and agonising. There is a screen that says "Tashkent- Business class check in". This isn't used for Business class only and even those paying a premium price can expect to wait up to 2 hours to check in. Boarding is as expected - everyone pushes but my experience has been that everyone sits in their allocated seats. Inflight entertainment is poor seats are comfortable and cleanliness is acceptable. Staff vary from helpful to uncooperative. A bribe can be paid ($50-$100) to cabin crew to sit in business class.

Tashkent - Istanbul - Tashkent. Outbound flight went to plan - satisfactory and no more: a small miracle for this outfit! Then turned up at 12:45 this past Sunday for the return flight only to see nothing listed on the departure board! The Uzbek Air desk at the airport was unmanned and the airport information desk said there was no flight - as printed on my ticket - it did not exist! After wasting the day at the airport turned up at my hotel again and eventually found the city office for the airline on Tuesday - an obscure office tucked away in a dark and dingy building. They photocopied my ticket and said it would be sent to Tashkent for "investigation. How much of an investigation is there for a ticket printed for a flight that does not exist? Phoned them back yesterday (Friday) as they had not called me back as promised! I can indeed fly - but for a fee of 25 Euro! In their view it was my error not to turn up to their office on Monday given that I arrived "late" on the Tuesday. I had not contacted them "immediately". Never mind that nobody was at their airport desk and that airport information tried hard to reach them. Worse the flight that I should have been on - has my ticket been printed correctly- has been cancelled anyway. So either way I would have been inconvenienced! This is an airline that hides behind its books at every corner where customer service is an inside joke. The airline is a microcosm of its country itself.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
LHR-Tashkent-LHR. Check in staff at Heathrow explained as the flight was not full we could have a row to ourselves. Food service okay - lots of it but low quality. Wine was local. Seats okay. IFE very poor. On return the flight was filled with those transferring from Dehli so the plane was full.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
LHR-TAS-LHR economy. When checking in at LHR I was informed that the flight would be making an unscheduled stopover at Paris CDG. The rumour had it that it was to pick up the UZB president's daughter. All this meant the flight to TAS would take 9hrs long 2 hrs longer than normal. Some people confirmed such unscheduled stopovers were quite commonplace. I was not impressed. Inflight service is pretty bad. So bad that when you call the stewardess they do not turn up. Even when they turn up they are so unhappy to be serving you so rude it is quite unbelievable. I did not eat the food that was served so can not comment on that. On the way back I paid the head stewardess $100 to sit in business class. Seats are good not flat bed but of large size.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
LHR-TAS return and UGC-TAS. International flight operated by B757. Legroom poor by scheduled flight standard more like charter. Plane only half full both ways so room to spread out. Food and drinks service okay. Both flights on time. Internal flight by Ilyshin 114no problems. No food but 2 drinks on 1hr 45min leg. My concern is security at Uzbeck airports - people allowed through security with all manner of liquids sealed and open. Security appears second to form filling and stamping.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Riga to Tashkent then on to Lahore and back. This airline's routes are excellent. Food excellent with copious amounts. Service fine and nice to get different tasting beers than the usual. FAs fine once they trust you are not going to be another difficult passenger. Uzbekistan Airways suffers from poor ground operations and officialdom at their airports which means that by the time people board the craft they are not always at their best. This is taxing on cabin crew who respond with professionalism even if they are not the greatest smilers. I understand Uzbekistan Airways are joining Skyteam. They are easily in the class of some other members of Skyteam now so hopefully this will mean more good connections in an area of the world they serve well.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Two stars is an average of 3 stars for international a 1 star for national flights. I experienced Frankfurt-Tashkent-Frankfurt Tashkent-Chiva-Tashkent and Tashkent-Bukhara- Tashkent. Airplanes on international flights are mainly Boeings 757 quite new ones national manly Tupolevs 155M probably from 80´s. Space in planes is comparable to any other airlines service is quite pure. Local people do not look for right seats very carefully so the staff ask you to sit anywhere at the end of boarding. You also have to know that there are two separate buildings at the airport – national and international. The business lounge at Tashkent airport has improved a lot – if you travel in business or with gold cards look for business check-in counter which is located in the corridor next to main hall.

Took two flights with this outfit a return TAS-ALA-TAS. The outbound flight went well booked it online via Opodo and was given an E-ticket. The aircraft was a Boeing 757. The return was a different matter and it all went wrong from here! I was not able to get the return flight I wanted but was advised to go to the airport in Almaty before the flight as they usually hold a couple of seats for every plane. My girlfriend is Russian and spoke to the staff on our behalf. We were informed that we could have two seats - but we would have to pay a bribe on top on the standard seat charges! I took exception at first but then worked out that it would be cheaper than paying an additional day for accommodation. However it then transpired that the staff were in-fact refusing seats to another couple telling them that check-in had closed for them when in reality there was 30 minutes left for check-in. Clearly they were being denied boarding so that the airline staff could collect my bribe! I felt terrible but did not have to cancel my deal with the staff as the couple being denied boarding work out that they would need to bribe the staff too! They did so and where allowed to proceed to check-in my girlfriend was then told the seats were not available after-all! She also informed me that they ground staff were really very rude indeed to this couple having threatened them with “trouble” if they complained about the flight being closed early! We went to a travel agent and book a normal ticket on a later flight without any bribes! That flight to Tashkent was then not on a nice 757 but on a Russian Tupolev 155 aircraft. While it is quite special in a way to have the full Soviet Union flying experience it is not comfortable quite or smooth! With no turbulence this thing rockets up and down like a fighter jet; the noise is such that you may as well be sitting on the wing! While we took off on-time we were met with fog in Tashkent and diverted to Sarmankand only landing in Tashkent some hours late. As such I missed my Aeroflot connection to Moscow and spent hours killing time in the airport. The funny thing was the only bar in the departure lounge does not take the national currency – just Russian Rubles and dollars! The cherry on the cake was again the ground staff coming back for bribes! I was well overweight for my Moscow connecting Aeroflot flight but $50.00 was exchanged and the matter resolved! In London the extra weight had cost me $300 which Aeroflot lost on my return thanks to the Uzbek business culture. Corruption has two sides it can be very disruptive and also very convenient but on the whole I can do without it in future.

TAS-FRA surprisingly was on time. Old A-310 was put for this flight with old seats and poor entertainment. Entertainment always a lack of Uzbekistan Service. Crew was ok they were friendly enough but nothing extraordinary. For money they charge Uzbekistan Airways can be bit more concerned about their services.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
London to Tashkent and back. Once again the inflight experience was OK. Flights were on time both ways despite the usual Heathrow problems. The aircraft interiors are getting a little scruffy especially the seats. They have upgraded the IFE to a DVD system. According to their magazine they have ordered 2 Dreamliners and 6 A320's so things could improve after a couple of years.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
Tashkent-Urgench-Tashkent. Staff try to get your money for everything even if most of them knows me personally after 5 years of same destination - extra baggage better seat etc. When you want to reserve a seat mostly you'll get a negative answer first. They will tell you that flight is full. What they do is reserve some seats for artificial names. That way the flight seems full when you attempt a reservation. If you pay an under-the-counter fee she will change the name on the reservation on your name and you got your seat. Same during check-in : they will ask you to put your hand bag/computer/whatever on to the scale. If you are somehow +20 they will start to make faces and convince you that it will be too expensive if you pay official fee. They will ask you to pay half of the money that you'll pay officially directly to check in staff. I don't do that now as the official fee is also is not that much. I simply ask them to write the extra weight which I check each time and go to pay to the counter. The officer in the counter is also surprised as this is not very common. If you'll ask for a specific seat they will make you understand that it is available against a small tip (2-3 USD). Don't as usually no one sits in accordance with the assigned seats and it is almost impossible to convince the person who have sit to your place to move. In the past you might also tip (20-50 USD) in the cabin and ask for a Business Class seat but I do not know if this is still possible.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
I have flown Uzbek air extensively including international regional and domestic flights. They are not a great airline by world standards but are great by regional standards. That said if you want to fly to Uzbekistan or fly within Uzbekistan you probably won’t have much of a choice but to fly Uzbek Air. If Uzbekistan is not a destination then they are probably overpriced for the service and I would use another carrier unless your schedule requires a transit though Tashkent. For international I would give them a 3 star overall and a 2 star for domestic flights.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
ATH-TAS return. Both flights on time. The personnel were friendly enough and eager to help you. The food was good only food presentation and trays were standard. There were two servings of drinks on each flight. The only complaint - inflight entertainment system was outdated (overhead screens with two outdated movies and some channels with music). The planes were old but clean. Overall a good experience with no troubles.

### Uzbekistan Airways customer review
LHR-TAS. My experience with this airline has been OK. They seem to keep to the flight times reasonably well at least out of Tashkent. There are some problems with the cabin crew - using mobile phones during take off being one example. A real issue I have with them is the chaotic check in at LHR. The last two times at LHR the queue has filled one end of terminal 2 and takes 2-3 hours to get through. The flight is typically delayed by an hour because of this.
