### "worst and non-reliable airline"
This is by far the worst and non-reliable airline I've ever used. They departed 3 hours before the departing time shown on the ticket without notice. When I asked for the refund, they are keep saying we will pass this email to specialist but didn't hear from specialist for almost one months. Of course they did not refund the ticket. Do not use this airline if you want to ruin your holiday. Also, whatever they say, you won't get the money back since they will never reply your email.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline I had experience with. My flight was cancelled so that I wasn't informed about it. Employees of the company office located in Yerevan are so much unprofessional that it's better not to ask them even elementary question as their answer anyway will be - "I don't know". They don't speak English at all and their Russian is totally impossible to understand. When you call to their office, minimum 10-12 times you should call to be answered once, messenger works terribly, nobody gives you proper replies. This is the company with non-professional, irresponsible and incompetent staff with incompliant service and terrible attitude to their customers.
