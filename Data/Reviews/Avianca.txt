### “I'll choose differently moving forward”
Have flown with Avianca maybe 5 times. Flown total maybe 25-30 times otherwise. Today will be the last with them. They are generally unconcerned with customer satisfaction from what I can tell. I asked to change my seat on a basic fare at the gate. (I've done this with every airline. The only one other to say no was Spirit) they wouldn't let me change on the plane to open seats that no one purchased either. When the lady said no to me at the gate and I was surprised I said "okay well thanks" her response was a big smile and "my pleasure" (after telling me no) idk about you but it felt incredibly rude. I said it was your pleasure? And she didnt say anything or change her smile. Who says my pleasure after telling you no with a big smile on their face? Been in customer service for years. It's okay to follow the rules. It's not okay to demean your customers cause they have less money, just say no I'm sorry. Thanks Avianca, I'll choose differently moving forward.

### “frustrating and costly experience”
Not Verified | I had a truly frustrating and costly experience with Avianca. I booked round-trip tickets in December for myself and my child to fly from Quito to the Galápagos in April. A month before departure, Avianca unilaterally changed our flight to a different day, added a stop, and never requested my consent. This disrupted our carefully planned trip, which included prepaid ferries, tours, and hotels. After contacting customer service, I was told the flight was “overbooked,” yet others in my group were still on the original flight. Avianca refused to offer a viable solution and claimed I agreed to the change, which I clearly did not. I asked for a refund, but as of late April, it still hasn’t been processed. I had to purchase alternate tickets through another airline for over $1,700. Ironically, that airline later rebooked us—on the exact Avianca flight I was told was full. That same flight had six empty seats when I boarded. To make matters worse, Avianca flights offer no complimentary snacks, drinks, or entertainment, and some seats don’t even recline. This airline is unreliable and showed a complete lack of accountability and transparency. I would strongly caution others before booking with Avianca.

### “customer service is absolutely awful”
Terrible customer service and disorganized procedures. The customer service is absolutely awful. The staff have a terrible attitude and act like they’re half-asleep. They offer no quick solutions, and every interaction feels like a waste of time. They force passengers to arrive 2 hours early for domestic flights — which is already excessive — and then close the gate 1 hour before departure, making the whole process frustrating and inefficient. It’s a complete disregard for people’s time and comfort. I do not recommend flying with this airline unless you enjoy delays, poor service, and unnecessary hassle.

### "not up the airline to compensate us"
Not Verified |  This was our first time flying with Avianca airline and to San Andres Columbia. Flying from JFk to Bogota flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight to San Andres. Which was fine it wasn’t a huge delay but we still missed few hours of our vacation. When it got worse is returning home. Our flight from san Andres to Bogota was suppose to depart at 10:52am which was pushed by 2 hrs to 12:52. Which then got delayed again to 2:05pm. Of course we were going to miss our connecting flight to JFK. When i asked for them to book me a hotel in San Andres and put me on a flight next day they refused and said it would be up to me if i want to change my flight. I explained that my husband had injured his back and cant sit on the airport seats for so long. The attendant didn't care and said its not up the airline to compensate us so if we choice to stay an extra day. When asked for a food voucher since I have young kids with me I was told they will give them out. Its close to lunch time and no voucher. So now we will not get in to JFK till 6:05 am the next day so at this rate we will be sitting at the Airport for 13hrs and wont get to JFK for another 7hrs. Even worse is when you contact

### "Absolute worst experience"
Not Verified |  Absolute worst experience in my life! First time flying Avianca because of the times of the flights worked well for me but it was the worst mistake I've ever made. Horrible customer service, wanted to charge me $1,800 for carry on bags. Horrible WhatsApp and phone service. They are unethical. Delays on flights, cancellations. Added so much stress to my travels. I will never ever fly with this terrible company and I will never recommend it to anyone.

### "I didn‘t use my first flight"
First ignore my request to change my flight so I was forced to buy a new one. When I wanted fly back I was told at the airport that I couldn‘t use my return flight because I didn‘t use my first flight and I‘m not getting a refund. I was stuck in San Juan having to pay for a fourth flight, food, taxi and hotel. I had to call them for months and get rejected several times until I finally got my incomplete refund.

### "terrible service all with a cost"
Not Verified |  It use to be a proud Colombian airline. Now is a cheap airline charging as normal airline they want you to pay for everything. Not even water is offered, the cabin crew is rude, terrible service all with a cost.

### "cancelled all my subsequent flights"
I booked a multi trip, and because of a separate flight being delayed, I missed one leg. Avianca, without any communication, then cancelled all my subsequent flights, including my flight home. Left me stranded abroad. A rude phone operator offered me a replacement flight for double what I could get it for on Skyscanner. Even then, I am $900 down and they could resell my original seat. Food was terrible. Entertainment didn't work on my long flight out. The plane was filthy. Phone help line took ages and was no help. No communication from them at all.

### "argue with a nasty attitude"
Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport an hour and a half before the departure and only then we received an email from the airline that our flight was cancelled. Who cancels the flight an hour and a half prior to departure? Staff at the counter told us that flight was cancelled because one of the flight attendant got sick. Aren’t they supposed to have an extra staff for situations like these? We were told that we will be placed on the next flight which is 14 hours later! Our entire 1st day of vacation is ruined including the cost of our first night at the hotel in Lima. Additionally, we paid 140$ for taxi to get to the airport and back home, then, 12 hours later we had to pay another 70$ to get to the airport so 140$ wasted and the airline refused to take any responsibility for this financial loss. We arrive at the airport the next day 1.5 hours prior to departure. We couldn’t find the airline because they didn’t put a proper logo on the monitor (like all other airlines). We were running back and forth in the airport and 10 minutes later finally found their screen with a tiny logo somewhere in the corner of the screen. The “supervisor” starts yelling at us that the flight registration is closed. We pointed out that hey didn’t display proper logo and we still have at least 20 minutes before the flight closes. The supervisor continues to argue with a nasty attitude. When I ask her to show their policy regarding international flights and she tells me that she doesn’t know exactly but keeps insisting we are late! After arguing for another 10 minutes they put us on a flight. During 6 hours flight they didn’t give us even a little snack! Only water. We call customer service to request to change our return flight to make up for one lost day but they refused. I requested customer service supervisor and I was told there is no English speaking supervisor available. By the way all communication with the airline was in Spanish even though we requested English multiple times. Long story short: we were told it is impossible to change our return flights without additional fees (which was 500$ for both of us). We said “no thank you, we will keep it”, requesting to at least compensate us for the taxi on the day we had to return home. Few days later we received compensation of 50$ instead of requested 140$. Whatever, we decided not to waste the rest of our vacation and move on. If we only knew that the real nightmare is ahead of us. On the day of our return flight we arrive at the airport 5 hours prior to departure. I printed out my boarding pass but wasn’t able to print out my husband. The airline counter wasn’t open yet so we had to wait for another 1.5 before they show up. The first staff told us that the problem was with my husband ID verification and t will be easily fixed. 45 minutes later another staff tells us that my husband’s flight was cancelled by the airline, they have no idea why and we have to wait because they are “ working on this issue”. The staff at the counter also told us that my husband didn’t fly from Chicago with me and instead flew from Orlando. I told them that we have confirmation of purchase for tickets from Chicago and we also have boarding passes confirming that he flew from Chicago but as the only answer we heard was : “In my system .. he flew from Orlando”.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. I've never been treated so poorly by a company before. We had a problem with our domestic flight, the plane was broken, which was supposed to get in 6 hours before our Avianca flight, and as we waited and waited we realized we weren't going to make our international flight. We had only added luggage a couple hours before when we checked in online, and it cost us $130 for one checked bag with Avianca. We called Avianca, knowing that we wouldn't get our flight money back because it was a non-refundable flight, but we just wanted our luggage money back since we wouldn't be on the flight. Instead of even being nice about it but refusing, the customer service agent blatantly argued with me and tried to make me look stupid for thinking I should get my luggage money back when I had purchased a non-refundable flight. This is only part 1, though. We had expected that we would still have our return flight in place since we were only missing our flight out (and we were purchasing a new flight to Guatemala). No one from Avianca said otherwise in the 45 minutes I spent on the phone with them. The night before my flight home from Guatemala I realized I hadn't gotten an email to check in. I called them and they said that if you don't show up for one end of the flight you automatically cancel the other as well. They refused to put me on the same flight I had already purchased a ticket for and instead told me I could purchase a new ticket for $600 (one way, on the flight I was already supposed to be on). I will never be purchasing from Avianca again. I will actively spend more money to purchase a ticket from a different airline.

### “rude and uncaring about my situation”
Not Verified | If you thought that Spirit Airlines was the worst, it is only because you have not taken a ride with Avianca. If you are in the mood to inflict some form of self-hate, I would suggest engaging with Avianca. If you feel that you need to punish yourself for some reason, please engage with Avianca. If there is someone that you would like to play and April fool's joke on this year OR if there is a person that you authentically HATE, offer to buy them a flight somewhere and buy the ticket with Avianca. Avianca is masquerading as an airline. I purchased a ticket with them, as I have for many tickets going to different countries on many different airlines. I book my tickets months in advance going from country to country. When I booked a ticket going from Brazil to Spain I was given a quote. I agreed to pay the price, (I live in the US, and I was making the reservation on my computer in the US). It then changes from US dollars to Brazilian real. When they changed it to the Brazilian real, they changed the price, (which I had no knowledge of). I only discovered that they charged me more after I was checking something else on my online bank statement. I called them to ask about it. The payment was still being processed. I was told because the point of departure was Brazil, they had to convert my US dollar to the Brazilian real and I incurred a currency exchange. I informed them in all my years of traveling and using many different airlines, but also, if that is a policy of theirs there should be a disclaimer that states that possible fees maybe incurred on international flights for various reasons, please see our policies. There was nothing to that affect anywhere on their website. I explained that to them, they said we are sorry that is something I have to take up with my bank. My bank informed me that charge did not come from them if came from Avianca. Another situation, I was supposed to go from Rio in Brazil to Paris, France. My flight was at 1:24am. When I got to the airport to check-in at Avianca there was no one at the desk to check-in with. I checked in with the kiosk, it told me to see an agent, again, there was no agent present. My flight left, I had to stay in Brazil, I lost the money for that flight, lost the money for the hotel in Paris, and lost the money for the flight back to the US. When I called Avianca the agent was beyond rude and uncaring about my situation. He lied throughout the call and refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor, when I asked multiple times, plus he did not allow me to take the survey that I was supposed to take to rate his service. I had to speak to four other agents between five days just to get to a point of filing a complaint, and Avianca has still done nothing, in both cases. I beg you please do not be fooled.

### "Definitely, never again"
It is the worst airline I have ever travel with. The last 3 times I try to travel was on 2020-2019 and not the best experience. First, they left my bags for a week in the departure place. The second time, they left me 2 day on the airport because of snow, but one of my sisters was able to travel same day, with same airline, and with the snow. The third time, they delayed my flight because they had problems with the airplane. So after 3 year I decide to give Avianca a try. What a mistake! They cancel my flight because the plane is not working properly. So I do not understand how this airline Avianca works. Let’s look at this service wise: no food, no water, no space, but look at the prices of the tickets. They are insane of expensive to get the worst service. Definitely, never again.

### "Very dissatisfied"
Not Verified |  Very dissatisfied. They are expensive and treat passenger like animal. We flew 7 hours with nothing to eat or drink. Air hostesses are very rude. Travel with passenger with mobility problems and they do not care. We have to lift my mom off the aircraft onto a bus and everyone from the crew looking as they do not care.

### “Very low value for money”
Not Verified | I have been Executive Platinum with American Airlines (AA) for at least 15 consecutive years, and have flown close to 2.5 million miles with AA for the past two decades. I have also flown with countless other Airlines across the world. Avianca has to be the worst airline I have ever flown in my life. Very low value for money and bad customer service. Please avoid at all costs!

### "website didn't work for refunds"
We purchased a direct flight. Months later, they changed the flight to have a layover in a different country and lengthened the travel time by 3 fold. That was unacceptable to us. They would not refund us. Their website wouldn't work for refunds (isn't THAT convenient), so called all of their customer service numbers which just directed us to WhatsApp and answered only by AI, and that told us to use the website, the non-working website. We emailed support, and they told us to use website even though I told them the website didn't work for refunds.

### "$100 is the hand luggage price"
$100 is the hand luggage price for flying with a company who doesn't provide you any water in 5 hours fly. This is worse than a low-cost airline. Never again

### "runs now as a low budget airline"
Not Verified |  I paid for Premium seats and there is no space. I am 5.6 foot and my knees were almost touching the front seat. Drinks and food is available for purchase only. There are no free drinks (Water or soda or juice). I had a flight from 8pm to 2am and Airline never shut off the cabin lights, could not sleep on the plane. I had a better flight on Spirit than Avianca. Avianca runs now as a low budget airline but charges tickets as a premium airline. I will try to avoid this airline as much as possible. My flight to Cartagena was by Copa Air and it was great. Decent size economy seat, good food and snacks (included in the ticket), we had to stop in Panama but layover was only 2 hours. Thank you Copa.

### "every single flight was delayed"
How this airline stays in build beyond me. I’ve flown this route 5 times over the last 9 months and every single flight was delayed. Once you start getting messages from them the flight is delayed it’s all over. They keep sending delay after delay. Twice it’s been after a grueling 25+ hours flight. So all I want to do is get home to my bed. But they have to add another 3-5 hours plus layovers to my already long trip.

### "The crew was rude"
Not Verified |  The seats are so close you can't move in any direction, and I was in Row 5 a plus seat. nothing is served, I mean nothing, not even water which I was denied, and I had to take medicine. The crew was rude. apparently, they had family members who were on the flight, and they were served beverages and snacks the entire trip they were behind me. also, there was a blind girl who had to use the bathroom she was sitting in Row 4 and was sent to the back of the plane because the crew were taking pictures eating and joking around. That's just unacceptable and disgraceful. How they are in business is beyond me. In addition, no Wi-Fi service and no TV if you don't have anything to entertain yourself you will definitely be in a bad mood.

### "This airline doesn't care"
Not Verified |  Been sitting here for over 12 hrs with no information on my flight. Two fights have broken out and this airline is a dumpster fire, save your time and money and pick either LATAM. This has to be the worst airline on the planet ... read the reviews. This airline doesn't care. I would give zeros in every category if the rating score was that low.

### "I am now demanding compensation"
Not Verified |  Avianca canceled our flight on Friday, 3rd January 2024, at 15:56 without even notifying us via email or the app. We arrived at the airport completely unaware of the cancellation and found no information available. The ground staff’s behavior was appalling—rude, unhelpful, and completely inflexible. They rebooked us for the following day without offering any compensation, no hotel, no taxi, nothing. To make matters worse, they failed to provide clear information about the situation, leaving us stranded and confused. As a pregnant woman, this experience was physically and emotionally exhausting. The lack of care and basic customer service was shocking, and I am now demanding compensation for the psychological distress and inconvenience caused. Avianca, your treatment of customers is unacceptable, and I will never fly with your airline again.

### "Never again"
It began in the waiting lounge, where passengers stood with carry-ons, blissfully unaware of the battle royale about to unfold. Avianca staff, fully aware the flight was overbooked and the overhead bins were destined to overflow, didn’t even bother offering to check bags proactively. The boarding process was next, and let’s just say “organized” wasn’t on the menu. Boarding groups? Pure fiction. The announcement was made, and it was every passenger for themselves. Once onboard, there was a 20-minute wait in the jet bridge. The seat barely had enough legroom to accommodate a hamster, and the cushion was so thin. The overhead bins reserved for suitcases with wheels. Winter coats are apparently considered unworthy of such luxury. The flight attendants weren’t in the mood for smiles or pleasantries. There was complimentary water but only if you were brave enough to venture to the back of the plane and help yourself. The paid menu was so uninspired. The highlight of the service was the single crew member responsible for selling the menu items. Needless to say, by the time my turn came around, I’d lost the will to gamble on an overpriced sandwich. By the end of this six-hour endurance test, I was questioning every life choice that led me to book this flight. Yes, Air Canada was $300 more, but in hindsight, those $300 might have been the cost of sanity. In conclusion: Avianca, you’ve taught me patience, resilience, and the importance of researching airline reviews. Never again.

### "never fly Avianca again"
I purchase a biz class ticket, supposedly a flat bed from Bogota to São Paulo on a 787. But Avianca change the plane configuration and biz class was worst than a premier economy seat. Not a flat bed. Small leg rest. Impossible to get out of the window seat without having the other passenger standing up. Will never fly Avianca again.

### “an incredibly disappointing experience”
Flying business class with Avianca Airlines was an incredibly disappointing experience and certainly not worth the extra money. The inflight service was subpar, with flight attendants going out of their way to be unfriendly and unhelpful. Smiles were nonexistent, and basic courtesy seemed like a struggle for the crew. The worst part of my journey was the second leg of my trip, a short one-and-a-half-hour flight. Astonishingly, not even a glass of water was offered unless I paid for it. This level of service is unacceptable, especially in business class, where basic amenities should be a given. Overall, Avianca Airlines failed to deliver on even the most basic expectations for business class service. I would not recommend paying the premium for this experience.

### “don't bother with business for domestic”
Online check-in is often broken. If you are savvy enough you will find a recommendation to make a screenshot of how broken it is to present it at the counter at the airport so they can consider waiving the at-counter check in charge. That is, if your booking even truly exists. I was booked on a codeshare flight that did not exist and that has happened twice already. So let's say you get to the counter and your flight actually does exist, the next thing you can enjoy is the check-in agent trying to shake a few pesitos out of you if you are the wrong colour and speak the wrong language. The baggage limits get made up on the spot and the most significant carrier rule is always being spat on. Regarding cabin class, don't even bother with business for domestic. It simply does not exist (lie), you will be bumped back to economy and will be able to enjoy buying an reserved seat for abysmal prices. The "business" class does exist, it just doesn't matter if your codeshare flight booking says it or not. In Avianca's eyes, if you didn't book with them and didn't pay them directly, you should be taped to the wing or fly in the cargo hold. They will very vocally deny that there is a business class, any and all complaints about downgrade will be suggested to be printed out, folded several times, oiled up and stuck up an orifice of choice. Before departing the counter, if your check in agent is honest enough, you will have the actual departure time handwritten on your boarding pass. They know they are departing hours late - good luck with your short layover, if applicable. Next, you will indeed find out that the actual departure times are a mystery only known do masters of dark arcane magic and forest sages. If your flight exists and is scheduled to depart at all on that day, that is. It's not only when, but also a matter of if the plane departs, you see. Mild riots at departure gates are a common sight in Colombian airports for Avianca. If you have somehow survived this far, you will see a very proud sticker on the plane, saying they are the most punctual airline according to whatchamacallit. I can't help but wonder how massive the bribe was in this case. I have never seen an Avianca flight depart on time and the times I have unfortunately been on one must be over 10 by now. I had a small chuckle, followed by despair since I knew what was coming next. What follows is a very disorganized and stretched out boarding, filling an A320 can take close to an hour sometimes. I don't even know how. And for whatever reason someone always gets deboarded close to door closure. Waiting for you inside is a chair that is just not meant for anyone not suffering from dwarfism or having a spinal column. A burlap sack of field rocks would make a better seat honestly. The overhead bins will be full of luggage unless you somehow manage to be one of the first few people to get on board, so you have to chuck your belongings under the seat. Again, unless you are fun sized, this will cause legroom issues. Even the emergency row can have anyone taller than 170 to have their kneecaps smashed in by the seat in front even without reclining. Speaking of cramped, the restroom is behind one of the jumpseats so the cabin crew will make it visibly and audibly clear to you that you are not welcome there - since they have to stand up for your relief break. And I had my shoulders touch walls in the restroom - I am a humble 180cm and in normal bodyweight.

### “the worst airline experience”
Not Verified | Worst Airline Experience Ever. My flight was delayed or canceled 4 separate times, causing my original flight to be moved back from Monday until Saturday. No compensation or refunds were allowed on the first 3 cancellations due to what they called “external issues”. For my 5 extra days spent here involuntarily they were only able to compensate me for 2 nights stay at a terrible hotel of their choosing after hours of speaking with their team. Terrible online service (including website and app). Just a terrible airline that should not be in business. Look for other options as Avianca has provided me with the worst airline experience I’ve ever had and has ruined what was supposed to be a great trip for me. If I could give them a 0 I would. Never again.

### "the worst travel experience"
Not Verified |  Last night I had the worst travel experience of my life with Avianca. The Avianca staff repeatedly misinformed us and showed no interest in finding any reasonable solution to the disaster they created - for us or the many other passengers, including children and elderly folks who had already spent hours stranded in the airport late at night. Our flight from Bogotá to Armenia was cancelled and automatically re-scheduled for a flight 48 hours later, which was of no use to us as our trip was only 72 hours in total and we had already paid for lodging and transport among other expenses in Armenia. We attempted to resolve the issue through the call center, but the response we received was that it would be easier to find an earlier flight by going directly to the airport. We were willing to take an overnight bus to Armenia if we could obtain a refund, but the call center and airport staff insisted that the flight had been cancelled for an external reason, and as such we could not obtain a refund. It's important to note that the nature of this supposed "external reason" changed three times in the various explanations we received: initially we were told the cancellation was due to backed up air traffic, then we were told that the Civil Aviation agency had done a technical inspection that caused the delay, and finally we were told that it was due to inclement conditions at our destination - the inconsistent stories combined with Avianca's systematic practice of over-selling flights leaves me doubting the above excuses. After over an hour in various lines in the airport, and after much insistence that we be changed to another flight ASAP - even to a different destination that was relatively close to Armenia (Pereira in this case) - and being told that no flights to Armenia nor Pereira were available - we were given tickets for a flight to Pereira later in the night. When we arrived at the gate for the flight to Pereira I attempted several times to confirm with the Avianca staff that the Pereira flight was scheduled to go ahead and that our seats had not been double-booked (something that Avianca is known to do) - the Avianca staff offered no response whatsoever. Eventually, after the Avianca staff had left - and with no verbal announcement or electronic notification - the screen indicated a gate change and then the flight simply disappeared from the screen. The desperate passengers were then directed to a Connections counter that Avianca had in the terminal. We waited over an hour to be attended - only to be told that the Connections counter could offer no assistance - and were then sent to another line, elsewhere in the terminal. After waiting in that line, we spoke to a supervisor who told us that they could only offer an assistance voucher to people who lost connections, but not to those of us departing from Bogotá directly. At this point we had already spent 5 hours in the airport being misinformed and treated with absolutely no concern or respect. I was traveling with a 7 year old who was sleep-deprived and very upset. We were told that refund requests could only be managed through the call center - which we already knew to be of no use - and that waitlists (with no guarantee of a seat) were available for the following day if we wanted to return to go through the same experience again. In short - Avianca took our money, cancelled our flight, repeatedly misinformed us, and offered no reasonable alternative flight nor a refund.

### "service went from bad to worse"
Not Verified |  I recently traveled business class with Avianca from JFK to Bogotá to La Paz, expecting a premium experience, but I was sorely disappointed. For an airline claiming to offer a business class, the lack of lie-flat seats on the JFK - Bogotá leg was shocking and uncomfortable. Sitting upright for hours in what's supposed to be a premium cabin was incredibly frustrating, especially on a long-haul international flight where a bit of comfort should be a given. But the issues didn’t stop there. During the Bogotá to La Paz leg, the service went from bad to worse. Basic amenities were missing — no blankets offered, even with the cabin feeling cold and uncomfortable. To top it off, they didn’t even offer a simple cup of coffee for free. Instead of attentive, thoughtful service, the cabin crew appeared rushed and indifferent, with little concern for the passengers’ comfort. It felt more like an economy-class experience, certainly not the premium touch you'd expect when booking business class. Overall, Avianca's business class on this route felt misleading and frustrating, lacking the comfort, service, and amenities that are typically standard in business class. For those considering paying extra for an upgraded experience, be warned: it’s simply not worth it with Avianca.

### “Everything costs”
Not Verified | Very poor class Airline. Doesn't even provide complimentary water! Everything costs, and on the menu they mark up the exchange rate in US Dollars. No onboard entertainment or WIFI that works or gives you any options to buy or text. Some of the staff are rude! The flight fares may be a little lower than Latam and others, But they charge you exorbitant high prices for the carry-on bag and check bags. I carry-on bag cost $120 one way! That's ridiculous! And then when we got to San Francisco we had to wait 45 minutes before our bags came out and we were the only ones in the international baggage area. Don't fly on this airline!! !

### "our seat selection had been cancelled"
We booked and paid for "business class" seats on the flight from La Paz to Bogota to Miami back in January of 2024. Business class" is more like economy plus (at best) with the middle seat blocked. In any event, when we went to check in we were told that there was a "problem" with our payment and that our seat selection had been cancelled. When I produced documents showing acceptance of my payment, and my ticket with the assigned business class seat, the story changed and "somehow" Avianca had cancelled out seats and given them away to another customer while retaining our $75 per person seat fee. Therefore, we learned at 1:00 AM that we had no assigned seat on the 3:15 AM flight! The gate agent informed us that no business class seats remained and put us in a regular economy row with no middle seat between us, as the best he could do. Somehow, on the same transaction, they managed to assign us the exit row seats we had paid for on the Bogota to Miami leg of the journey. Of course I notified Avianca on our return for the $75 per person refund, and they have yet to respond. Since I charged the tickets (of course!) I am also disputing it with the credit card company, and if Avianca does not respond to them by a certain date, the amount will be refunded to us. In this case it is not the amount so much as the sheer incompetency of Avianca. I have never heard of anyone having upgraded seats cancelled on one leg of a flight with no real explanation except "something happened" and of course, no subsequent communication from the airline. We were limited in choices flying out of La Paz, but if there is a next time I will take my chances on Boliviana. Most unpleasant any time of day but the worst on a 3:15 AM flight!

### “legroom is painfully tight”
In the competitive Colombia-Europe route, Avianca fails to hold up to other airlines’ prices, services, and overall customer service. An overbooked flight made a rocky start for AV26 to Madrid, in which there was somewhat of a brawl between airline staff and passengers who had the misfortune of being randomly selected to be offloaded and rebooked in AV10, a flight which departed around 6 hours later. Anyway, I was lucky to get to keep in the crammed seat that I had payed for, and although the 787 is a comfortable plane, avianca’s recent densification of the plane means that legroom is painfully tight for me (182 cms) and padding is practically nonexistent. In other words, getting up from the seat is a pain, but so is staying on it! Food was exceptionally dreadful (like 80’s bad) and the crew also went out of their way to be as rude and unfriendly as they possibly could. Either the call buttons are broken, or nobody bothers to go see the passenger in need of something. Avianca is unable to compete with Lufthansa, Iberia, AirFrance, KLM and even AirEuropa on any aspect of their service, so I would only choose them if they were very the cheapest option, though the case is normally the opposite - and they are the most expensive.

### “I can’t move”
I’m sitting here in a seat I paid extra for, with my back totally against the wall the seat and my knees smashed by the person front of me. I can’t move. My seat doesn’t recline. Why did this seat cost extra? Why is this airline so horrible? This is simply an unacceptable way to treat people.

### "deeply unpleasant travel experience"
I am an Avianca star alliance gold member. Over the years, I have seen previously good service decay into mediocrity. But today was different. I’ve had enough, and am now looking looking for status match options with competitors. Today, booked from Orlando to Bogotá in “Flex” (Avianca’s most expensive fare for this specific route/ $620 round trip/ 3.5h flights), I was greeted by some extremely rude staff at Avianca’s check in at Orlando Airport. Although, thanks to my Star Alliance Gold (Avianca Diamond) status I have a complimentary sports equipment, for the first time ever, I was ordered to open the wakeboard’s case and show it. Afterwards, I was told that, due to the fact that in the wakeboard’s case there also were a couple of damp swimsuits, this was no longer considered a sports equipment and therefore would be charged as an oversized bag ($100). In order to comply with the rude employee’s nonsensical and ridiculous requirement that there only fly the sports equipment within the case, I asked her to check it in. At that point she stopped again, this time to take out a measuring tape and ask me for the $100 oversize fee anyway, as the wakeboard exceeded allowed measurements by about two inches. After asking for some rationality, I was insulted by the supervisor, threatened to have my reservation canceled, and forced into oblivion. Upon boarding, even in the Star Alliance Gold line, me and my fellow frequent flyers were barked at by another equally rude employee into measuring our luggage in a low cost airline-style fitter. After my “personal item” (an average sized backpack) barely exceeded the allowed measurements and would be of no difference to anyone, as it flies under the seat in front, I was ordered to gate-check it for the hefty fee of another $120. After mentioning, once again my status, the unnoticeability of the excess in size, and the cost of the fare I had purchased, I was told literally that they “couldn't care less” and that, should I not pay immediately, I would be reported as an unruly passenger and be denied boarding. Apart from the absolute antithesis of basic costumer service, the outrageousness of the employee’s blatant lack of respect, and the little to no courtesy Avianca showed towards me and other costumers, I wound up paying $840 dollars for a round trip of 3.5h flights on a painfully uncomfortable economy seat with unnoticeable recline with a blocked middle, and absolutely no complimentary service (even water was charged) and a couple of insults. I have flown low cost airlines extensively both in Europe and the US. I have never had such a terrible experience, let alone for the price and frequent flyer status I hold. I would suggest fellow travelers to go out of their way in avoiding Avianca: If you’ve purchased one of their more “permissive fares” or got frequent flyer status with them or any Star Alliance partner, they “couldn’t care less about it”. And regardless if you have it or not, you’re guaranteed to have an expensive, uncomfortable, and deeply unpleasant travel experience both in the ground and air.

### “Mediocre airline”
Mediocre airline, in a 5 hrs flight from SCL-BOG-SCL on a A320, there was no inflight service. Only buy menu. Crew was professional but not something special. Both flights were on time. Aircraft was clean and legroom was standard for A320 but not fitted for that mid-range flight. I noticed that the 3 first rows were in 2-2 configuration with a blocked middle seat. It was business class but I think is not worth the U$300 one way upgrade charge. I was thinking of do it but when I saw was was offered I changed my mind. No IFE during the flight. Seat allocation was done by the airline and if you wanted to change, you had to pay extra.

### "has been nothing but chaos"
Not Verified | I highly recommend using a different airline. It has been nothing but chaos on my departure flight as well as my return flight. They start boarding 45 min AFTER the departure time, with not room for those with short departures. Currently I am waiting for a flight to NYC because somehow I was able to book a flight through them that doesn't exist. I flew in from Rio on my way back to D.C. and they said the 11:55 departure time I had on my itinerary didn't match the 7:40 AM time on my layover boarding pass. I landed in Bogota at 11 am. How is that even possible that I was able to book one flight but then given another a day later? They didn't even offer to put me up in a hotel. Instead I had to beg for them to at least get me on a flight as close to my destination as possible (NYC). I guess from there, I'm on my own. This is so unprofessional. I would not be writing this review if there was some compassion. Why would anyone want to spend 20-something hours in an airport to no fault of their own?

### "missing a vaccine document"
They would not let us get on a flight because we were missing a vaccine document. I had refundable fare and was promised by the check in agent if I contacted their help desk within 10 days I would get a full refund. To this day Avianca says I should have done it there before the flight and refuses to refund $2572 except $104. I battled for 6 months with them stating I was working off their employees statement.

### "as uncomfortable as possible"
Every step of the way the make the flight as uncomfortable as possible to provoke costumers to upgrade. They purposely have seats that don’t recline at all or have a headrest in economy, bus seats are more comfortable. On the flight I asked for a pillow or blanket to use as cushion on the bench seats and they charge 11$ for that. They don’t hand out any beverages on an international flight at all. No entertainment systems they supposedly have a streaming website but it won’t load, just says server not found. But the worst is the hidden fees. On an economy flight international you apparently have to reserve a 50$ carry on ticket 48 hours in advance. If you don’t they will charge you 120$ at the gate. This is a hidden fee and I didn’t see any hint of this until I was checking in online in the 24 hour window to do so (24 hours to late to adjust the ticket) and if you flight have a layover you have to pay this fee each time. They will not have pity on you and demand the money or offer you to ditch your luggage. Even single step of the way they are trying to get more money out of you. Do not fly this Airline thinking it’s economical because the hidden fees add up fast and you will not actually save money. Buy yourself the comfort of a regular airline. There was even an airport waiting area fee attached to my ticket!

### "one of the worst airlines"
In terms of service and quality of the staff, Avianca is one of the worst airlines I have ever used. I used it multiple times for different travels within Colombia and Costa Rica between July and August 2024. The personal is very unfriendly, passive aggressive with the passengers and not very caring of special situations. The personal at the front desk of the lounge is rude and judging. I am about the believe that Avianca trains their personal to behave in that way and treat passengers poorly. They don’t offer a glass of water even during international trips. I am highly disappointed with the poor service offered and hope Colombia will have more options for airlines in the future so people can choose from.

### "177$ CND for a carry on"
We had to pay 177$ CND for a carry on. Never i had to pay this with any airline. Its clearly an hidden fee. I will not travel with them again.

### "wanted to use my return flight"
I bought a flight on Avianca and due to health problems I was not able to travel on the indicated date, however, I wanted to use my return flight according to my itinerary and it turns out that the airline completely canceled my round trip flight and did not provide compensation or flexibility responses through your customer service in the call center. I can understand that if you do not show up for your flight and do not manage the change, you will lose it, but if the airline cancels your return without even notifying you, it means that they are stealing from me because I will not be able to use the service. Compré un vuelo en Avianca y por problemas de salud no logré viajar en la fecha indicada, sin embargo, quise utilizar mi vuelo de regreso según mi itinerario y resulta que la aerolínea canceló completamente mi vuelo redondo ni dando respuestas de compensación o flexibilidad a través de su atención al cliente en el call center. Puedo comprender que si no te presentas a tu vuelo y no gestionas el cambio lo pierdes, pero que la aerolínea te cancele tu regreso sin siquiera avisarte significa que me están robando porque no podré hacer uso del servicio.

### “customer service is a nightmare”
Not Verified | I have flown with Avianca for many years, and I have enjoyed its services in the past being an Elite member. However, the new Avianca is not my cup of tea. They have cut almost all benefits for Elite with (still) expensive tickets; even when there are benefits, they are not working. For example, priority luggage delivery rarely works, and often, the luggage is delivered one of the last ones even though it has been marked as "priority. Food (when offered) is barely edible, the planes are old, and I happened to fly the same plane a few times this year between Bogota and Madrid, with a toilet not working already in March. I flew the same plane in July, and the toilet was still not operational. The customer service is a nightmare. Long talks and inefficient. I was overcharged twice for luggage and am still waiting for compensation. Their website often does not work properly, and when one calls them, the customer representative would say, "We are out of the system", "the system does not work", "call again": It has been a pity how, under the lemma "The skies are for everyone", avianca has become a low-cost airline with prices of legacy airlines. There are many more options for almost all the routes served by avianca. I am now avoiding this airline.

### "a bureaucratic nightmare"
Future passengers : avoid this company, which allows itself the luxury of refusing passengers for false reasons. It's truly impressive how your outdated passport scanners managed to turn a simple boarding process into a bureaucratic nightmare. Because the company is old and doesn't meet technology standards : they REFUSED us on the pretext that we didn't have the required documents to enter Canada. In fact, we have all the documents we need: you can scan our passport and find out everything you need to know! My 2 cents : Invest in some equipment that belongs in this decade so you can actually read your passengers' information properly.

### "the worst flying experience"
Not Verified |   Without doubt, the worst flying experience I’ve ever had. 120 minutes waiting to drop bags. 46kgs of baggage paid for between 2. Only brought one bag which had 25kgs. The troll of a hostess first said we had not paid for baggage. Then, when I showed her the tickets, she said needed i to pay 100usd for the extra 2 KGs. What a sham! What other airline would do this. She was shameless and rude. Clearly looking to gain from us and get a nice 10% finders fee on the luggage charge. How Avianca are still operating is beyond me. Terrible inefficiencies, delayed flights. rude staff, no food on long hauls, etc. The start of a holiday is the airport and the flight. If airlines ruin this it sours the whole holiday experience. I have a few more flights with Avianca on this trip and expect the exact same garbage. I will never fly with them again. I’d love to speak to a customer service manager to explain how poorly the individual staff member acted and how bad the entire experience was.

### "haven't reimbursed me for the flight"
Not Verified |   I bought 3 tickets, May 2023; My mom passed away on August 6, 2023; My sister and I are flying in October 2023; I requested a refund for a ticket that belonged to my mom, I have more than 20 emails and today is July 25, 2024 and they still haven't reimbursed me for the flight; They take advantage of other people's pain, thieves with a license, and the seat was occupied by someone else, the line lost nothing. Compré 3 boletos, mayo 2023; mi mami falleció en agosto 6 2023; volamos mi hna y yo en octubre 2023; reclamé la devolución de un boleto que correspondía a mi mami, tengo más de 20 correos electrónicos y hoy es Julio 25 2024 y aún no me reembolsan lo del vuelo; se aprovechan del dolor ajeno, ladrones con licencia, y el asiento lo ocupó otra persona, la linea no perdió nada.

### "gone from bad to horrible"
This airline has gone from bad to horrible. Many low cost are much better. The seating is horrible packed in like sardines. It has become a bad low cost airline and is very expensive for what you get. 5 hour international class no business class. Business class is the same uncomfortable seat but with the middle seat free. No beverages

### "Row 11 does not recline"
These observations apply to Avianca, flights 202 and 203, between Medellin and Orlando (I have flown on Avianca before from Bogota, and I get the distinct impression that they treat their passengers boarding in Bogota much better. Unfortunately we chose row 11. Row 11 does not recline. However, row 10 does. (Think about that before choosing a row 11 seat on this A320.) The designers did not take this into consideration when deciding on how much legroom to give the passengers seated in row 11. Apparently none of the economy seats recline (those are the ones beyond the 10th row). So rows 12 to 30 do not suffer from reduced legroom when the passengers in front of them recline their seats, because the passengers in front of them can’t recline their seats. Avianca does not serve a meal on this flight, we talking about an international flight, that takes off at 10 AM and lands at 2PM (as in: “lunchtime”). Sure, this is becoming a common theme with airlines, but most offer food for purchase. Avianca did offer some snacks and sandwiches for sale, but only stocked enough for the first 9 rows. By the time the attendants got their cart to the 11th row they were out of all the sandwiches and croissants. Keep in mind that this A320 has 30 rows… The movie and TV selections were very limited. I usually fly AA which by comparison offers a wide selection of entertainment. On this trip we connected with a United flight to Cleveland, which, even with a delay of 2 hours on the tarmac due to weather, was still more comfortable than our Avianca experience.

### "$102 to take my checked bag"
Not Verified |   I flew this airline with one checked bag for the baggage cost of $40. I online thought I booked it back as a checked bag for $95 .At the airport, they claimed it was for a carry on which I had none. They charged me an additional $102 to take my checked bag on I thought was already paid for. So , I paid $40 for one checked bag going, and $197 to take the exact same bag back. Their customer service online is a joke, You can’t speak with anyone. Only a fool would fly this airline.

### "unhelpful, officious and rude agents"
Like so many other passengers I've had other bad experiences with this carrier but what has me writing this review was a terrible early-gate-close experience I've never had before in decades of international flights: For my flight from Bogota to Santa Marta Avianca made no final boarding announcement and unnecessarily closed a gate early just seconds after other passengers entered the gangway leaving me and at least two Colombian passengers stranded and no doubt also ended up delaying the flight for all the passengers that did board since they now unnecessarily needed to remove and reroute checked luggage off the flight. After dealing with relatively unhelpful, officious and rude agents each of the three of us were only grudgingly given the option to rebook to a much later flight for a "penalty" that was almost the cost of a whole new ticket. I have never had such an early-gate-close experience before, but if I somehow experience anything close to it again with a reputable carrier I'd anticipate helpful customer service and extra recompense rather than rudeness and excessive penalties.

### "avoid Avianca at all costs"
Not Verified |   My experience was absolute hell. My siblings say that this airline back in the days was good. Never saw that in this flight. You’d expect nice treatment, that was not what I experienced in Avianca. The legroom was horrible, no recline whatsoever, and it was really uncomfortable for a 5 hour international flight back home. Also the amount of money just to pay for a meal was horrendous. It cost me like $10 for a Mac and Cheese, also water was not complimentary. I do not recommend using Avianca, use Delta, JetBlue, or any other airline that’s better than Avianca. The only good thing about Avianca was the Cabin Crew, really friendly and courteous. Other than that, avoid Avianca at all costs.

### "never use this airline"
Not Verified |   I requested a luggage charge refund and was told in writing I would get it. But in order to get the refund Avianca requested information and financial details that were totally irrelevant would comprise my privacy and subject me to potential fraud. They wanted certified Banking details, ID’s and certified letters from me (ticket buyer) and my mother (the passenger). All irrelevant information as the original form of payment was an Amex card. Dealt with airline for several months and could not resolve. My credit card company got involved and after many back and forth emails they also could not resolve it. Finally I was given a credit by my credit card company not Avianca. The cc company took the loss because Avianca was requesting customer information that was irrelevant and could be susceptible to fraud. Frustrating and unnecessary experience over a simple credit. I will never use this airline.

### "worst of all airlines"
Not Verified |   We travelled to Argentina from Toronto on 2024-04-23 on Air Canada and return was from Chile - Bogota- Toronto on 2024-05-05 on AC 6153 & AC99. We each carried 1 checked baggage approx. weight under 15-17 kgs each in regular checked smaller bags - The weight was limited due to internal flight restrictions. On our return Journey we checked in at Santiago (SCL) @ 23.55 for our return flight home. Santiago to Toronto, things did not go well at the Santiago airport, Avianca charged us USD $380.15 for two checked bags for me & my wife in total. checked in bags (all 5 to 17 KGs) and smaller bags. These charges are far more expensive than the normal or reasonable fees charged by any airline and these amounts to a day-light robbery. I would think charge of USD$190.00 per bag is good to go around the world at least two times. Air Canada baggage fees is on CAD $75.00 per bag to and from Toronto to Buenos Arise and from Santiago to Toronto CAD $75.00. Please save your grief do not fly on Avianca. Our Flight was 11.55 PM from Chile to Bogota arrival at 5.00AM +1 Day. Terrible inflight service and not even water was offered on this international flight. I have travelled in so many airlines around the world and Avianca is worst of all airlines.

### "it is always bad"
I have flown with Avianca before, and it is always bad, but nothing like this one. I was traveling with two members of my family. On the day of check-in, I tried to add my TSA Known Traveler Number through the website, but the website denied the number; this was not the first time that'd happened. I called customer service to add this since that was what I did last time. Customer service said that they could not add it, and that I would have to go directly to the counter at the airport (let it be known that they added it the previous couple of times with minimal problem). On the day of the flight, we got to the counter, and as always, the staff on the counter seemed to have a bad day so far. We had one checked bag and were only allowed one personal item; the lady on the counter "nicely" checked what kind of personal items we had, and we were ready to go. I asked if I could add my TSA number, but the lady said that the system was not allowing her to add it and that I would have to speak directly with TSA (no problem-solving whatsoever). I asked TSA and they said that the airline had to deal with that. I did not want more problems, so I went with my family through regular TSA. We got to the gate and were waiting to board the plane; one of my family members has a back problem, so she took a backpack with rollers. Once we started boarding, the lady at the gate stopped my family member and said she could not board the plane. We got checked in with my other family member and waited in the hall before entering the plane. Staff started complaining about her personal item, stating it was a carry-on. I asked them to measure the backpack because it was a personal item. There was another lady at the counter of the gate yelling at me that my family member would not board and fly; I told her multiple times it was a backpack and to measure it, but she was rubbing her face, annoyed, and responding that she would not board the plane, she was responding with an attitude and with annoyed faces. I tried to exit the hall, but the lady at the gate stopped me, saying that I would be off-boarded off the plane and that they would call the police; they told us several times they'd call the police (I'm unsure why, but anyhow). I asked her to measure the backpack, and her response was to recite the measurements and that they would take care of it, and we needed to board the plane. We left my family member at the gate and boarded the plane. My family member then told us they were asking for $150.00 for the personal item (as usual), and my family member asked to speak with the manager. The manager came out saying that the backpack was again a carry-on, but she proceeded to measure it. To their not-so-surprise, the backpack was the measurement of a carry on. Then they complained about why the tickets were bought separately and why she was separated from the family. To this point, I think they were stretching it. My family member told them that that had nothing to do with her not boarding the plane. The staff then asked my family member to remove some stuff from her bag because it was too big, saying she'd leave it. My family member asked if we could store her stuff in our bags.

### “paid for Business Class, get Economy”
The worst airline in the world - paid for Business Class, get Economy” I purchased and paid premium price for the seat 1B (2-seat row, aisle seat) at the first row on the airplane. I have the receipt. I checked online and have the boarding pass with the seat 1B. I went to the airport. At the gate, right before getting on the airplane, the gate staff stop me and gave me the new boarding pass with the seat 25B at the end of the airplane, middle seat in the 3-seat row. Photo are attached. I complained to the gate staff. She said go home and contact customer service. I complained to the flight attendant. They said they can not issue or change the boarding pass. I called the hotline, waited 30 minutes only answering machine. I contacted the WhatsApp number only BOT replied. I wrote emails. Only the automatic replied that they received my emails. Today, I received an email from a gentleman name David Steven Aguirre Villa from Avianca. He said that "the seat is subject to availability". What kind of service is that? IT'S A SCAM when customer have to pay for the seat and the airline just took the money and do not provide the service. They do not pay back you the money. They do not say Sorry or anything. They just took your money.

### "Total scam company"
Not Verified |   When we bought this ticket we had a 1 hr layover in Guatemala. By the time we flew Avianca had turned that into a 10 hr layover with 3 kids. At check in Avianca offered lounge access for an extra $150. Arriving in Guatemala we found out there was no lounge. When I contacted Avianca, which is really hard to do, we were told that lounge access was not refundable. Total scam company.

### "Avoid this dishonest company"
Avianca have a dishonest policy on compensation, that is illegal in the EU. A 20 hour delay of my MAD-BOG-MDE flight in October 2022 and Avianca still owes me the legal compensation after 18 months despite being requested time and again; they have refused to pay and I have to sue them. Avoid this dishonest company Avianca.

### “Terrible experience”
Terrible experience, wasted days of my life on a simple trip. I expected the no-frills, but it went way beyond that: 1. They didn't accept my travel documentation returning to Colombia, even though it was accepted by Colombian customs officials. I was forced to stay several extra days and pay for a ticket upgrade. 2. They booked a connecting flight that was impossible for any foreigner to make, because the immigration line in Bogota was longer than the time allotted. When I asked them for support making the connection, they refused. When I missed it (as did every other foreigner), they wouldn't put me on the next flight without more money. 3. Every time I had a question - like "what documents do you need"? I had to spend over an hour of wait time on their help line, and ultimately it seemed like every process was up to the mood of whoever was in charge that day. I got conflicting information and wasted time getting vaccines that I was later told I shouldn't have gotten. I fly on budget airlines all the time, but this was literally the worst airline experience I've ever seen. Would not fly again on this airline even if it were free.

### "ultra low cost service"
Flight 1/3 full and asked at check whether kindly enough they could put me a couple of rows more in front as the seats after the emergency exits have less seat pitch and aren’t reclinable. One thinks that holding a Star Alliance Gold Status such thing could be granted, but the friendly check in agent said it was possible only at a 30 USD fee. Upon boarding, flight remains with 1/3 passenger load and when boarding completed, no one is sitting at any emergency exit row. Me sitting first row after emergency exit with lesser seat pitch and non reclining seat (which you get when not wanting to pay extra for a regular coach seat) didn’t even bother, but a fellow passenger asked crew whether he could move one row up, where no one was sitting. The answer was yes but with payment of 50 USD as it is a comfort seat (emergency exit rows). Now, not to comment here Avianca’s tacky approach, but rather the fact we left, flew and landed with no one sitting any emergency exit row. This obviously because of some money making policy. Even with the ultra low cost airlines in Europe, flights don’t leave if no one is seated (at least one per row) at the emergency exit. Besides the flight was uneventful and I could enjoy the no frill ultra low cost service with this full member of Star Alliance, this safety issue left me a little puzzled.

### "worst airline to travel with"
I flew NYC to Guatemala and back in premium economy to NYC via El salvador. They weighed hand luggage and made a stink. Mind you I paid for a carry-on piece. In premium economy they give you not even water to drink. I flew economy going and realized that the seats don't recline. On premium coming back, it was nothing special. Not even a cup of water. I was in row 1 and didn't realize I wont have space to stretch my feet out. The bathroom of the plane was dirt on the return flight. The airline is no difference from other low end budget carriers. This is the worst airline to travel with.

### "Awful airline with subpar service"
Awful airline with subpar service. We booked all our flights with this airline and all of them were a disaster. One had no food on board to purchase except for instant noodles and mind you this was a 4hr flight. The second one was delayed 2 hrs because there was no crew available to staff the aircraft! And lastly we wanted to spend more time in one city and they wouldn’t allow us to cancel, rebook or change flights, so we asked if it was ok to just book a different flight and then still use the connecting flight we had booked to the second destination. They said yes, but the only thing is you won’t get a refund for that flight you are missing but you can check in for the connecting flight. The when we went to check in for our connecting flight they had cancelled the reservation since according to them we were no shows!! Appalling service and rude customer service blaming the customer for their shortcomings will never fly with them again.

### "Don't Fly Avianca"
The Avianca app crashes, making it impossible to check in ahead of time and add luggage. Was charged $220 for a small 2nd bag, and that is extortion. The 2nd bag charges for Avianca have always been an issue. The app customarily crashes during check in, directing the passenger to address the issue at the airport counter. That's so they can extort you. You're already there, what are you going to do other than hand over your credit card? On my latest trip I unsuccessfully attempted to log my 2nd bag 5 days prior to my Avianca flight, before leaving home on United, and was charged $50 for my 2nd (small) bag to Houston. Go to the airport counter" is always the default non-answer from the app. At online check-in, both with mobile app and on my laptop I got the same answer, even after enduring multiple crashes and reinstalling the mobile app. At the airport counter bag drop I was charged $220 for the 2nd bag. It's a small and light carry-on size, and tiny compared to the large 2nd bags that other passengers were dropping off. The agent stated that passengers are supposed to inform Avianca 48 hrs in advance to receive a special 2nd bag fee of $100  which is already crazy expensive. If you check in at 24 hrs preflight you're unable to log any extra bags and must go to the counter, however I am doubtful the app would have worked at 48 hrs prior, because it never works. The young agent at the counter was difficult and unyielding. She coldly informed me it's their policy, and told me I should have called the 800 number when the app crashed, or gone to the airport at that point. Who makes their way to the airport counter 48 or 24 hrs pre-flight to address an extra bag.. Once you're at the counter, you have no choice but to hand over the credit card -  it's outrageous they are allowed to charge these exorbitant fees. Don't Fly Avianca.

### "worst airline I have ever taken"
Not Verified |   This is the worst airline I have ever taken. I had purchased a package through priceline that included one checked bag for $60. When I got to the ticket counter, they didn't honor that and made me pay an extra $180! They were rude and unaccomodating. Even when I called Priceline to verify, instead of talking to the agent they continued to deny my claim. Apart from that there was no food or beverages served, customer service was awful, and the seats uncomfortable. They are clearly only about the money.

### "strives to give you a bad experience"
Avianca strives to give you a bad experience, from the people who serve you at the counter, to the uncomfortable seats for the simple fact of being in an economy seat, it does not include a neck rest and for flights it becomes unbearable. Avianca se empeña por dar una mala experiencia, desde las personas que te atienden en el counter, hasta los asientos ( nefastos) incómodos por el simple hecho de estar en silla económica no incluye reposa cuello y para los vuelos se vuelve insoportable.

### "not use this airline again"
Not Verified |   Horrible experience. I would not use this airline again. They want to charge for everything and they don't help put one last name instead of both and they wanted me to change everything and call the airline because I couldn't change it with them at the airport. I called the airline and they were not helpful at all they transferred me several times and i asked the guy so your basically telling me you cant help me? I spoke to a supervisor and he hung up on me after me waiting for 45minutes. When he first got on he was already rude and had an attitude.

### "A truly depressing experience"
A truly depressing experience. Economy seating has an incredibly tight seat pitch, even worse than budget US airlines like Allegiant, and the seats themselves are miserable with minimal padding and no comfort. Everything, even water, is buy on board. Cabin service was at least polite if indifferent but $14 US for a warm beer and very sad ham sandwich. No in-flight entertainment or functioning WiFi. On the second leg SAL-LAX of this return flight we were able to upgrade to premium seating which was at least tolerable, but outbound 5+ hours LAX-SAL in economy was unbearable. We last flew Avianca in 2018 and the quality and comfort has definitely gone downhill. The aircraft on all flight segments were worn and showing age. In fairness, ground staff in both SJO and LAX were great and all flight segments were on time or early arrival, the only positives.

### "Avoid Avianca at all cost"
Not Verified |  This has been my absolute worst experience at an airport. Avianca has to be the very worst customer service in the airline industry. Check-in people are absolutely rude. Avoid Avianca at all cost.

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
By far the worst airline I’ve ever flown. I’m a Star Alliance Gold customer and typically a ticket in any fair includes checked luggage. Apparently, Avianca changed their baggage policy without informing us. This led to one of our legs (SFO-BOG) having a checked bag included and The other led (BOG-MDE) to have no bags included because we bought the tickets a few weeks apart during which the airline decided to change the baggage policy. Avianca is heavy on their A320 usage also for medium haul flights. Sitting 6 hours in small seats is a pain. Even worse: the seats don’t have any headrest and the seats don’t recline. Additionally, there are no free drinks or snacks served - even on longer routes. This airline is a disgrace for star alliance

### "worst airline experience"
I have been traveling since Saturday 03/09/24 and it is Monday 03/11/24 at 12:00pm and I am not at my destination yet. I have been sleeping in an airport for two days now as they messed up all of my connecting flights. They got me a hotel for the first night, but the checkout was at 1pm and my flight was at 10pm that night. I got into this hotel at 3am thanks to Avianca. Then they rescheduled my two connecting flights only to have the last one scheduled 20 mins after arriving to the gate (which I missed thanks to their incompetence). The Avianca employee told me to check in when I got to Rio for this flight, but didn’t mention that they close check in one hour before, and I arrived 20 mins before. I had to force GOL to reschedule this flight with Avianca because they wouldn’t pick up the phone or respond to my instant messaging for customer service. I then slept in the airport for the second time as the only flight was 8 hours later to my final destination. This has ruined my trip and I just received word that my family member I was traveling to see who was in critical condition passed away before I could make it down there. I am sitting in the airport on day 3 and still not at my final destination. The lack of communication is unbelievable from such a large airline. Sincerely, worst airline experience of all time.

### "even worse than a budget airline"
It’s such a pity that Avianca is still part of Star Alliance. We booked RTW Star Alliance ticket and took Avianca for the Bogota to Toronto route. It was around 6 hours of flight and to our dismay, the level of service is even worse than a budget airline. All meal and beverages are sold separately (even water), and seats are non reclinable from the exit row onwards. In flight entertainment wasn’t working throughout the flight. The card machine to make payment didn’t work at all and the crew decided not to sell anything (they can’t accept cash either), but they at least decided to provide water and coffee for free (but imagine if you didn’t have any lunch nor bring any food, you are forced to starve throughout the flight). The crew also ignored the service call from the passengers. If you have other options, do not ever fly Avianca.

### "bag hanging on the door"
Although I take many flights a year I always politely follow the safety instructions. As a passenger we have to stay informed as well. That’s why I am shocked when I went to the toilet in the front (my seat was row 1) curtains were closed. All crew was chatting and laughing in the back of the airplane. That’s when I saw the bag hanging on the door like in the picture. This is a security breach that with all safety checks is just unacceptable.

### "Horrible customer service"
We purchased the base fare ticket back in August for a trip to Ecuador in March. However, in January our friends in Ecuador warned us of internal conflict in the country, they advised us that flights were being cancelled and they were trying to get out. To be proactive, we cancelled our flights, believing that due to extenuating circumstances we would receive a full refund and/or could modify our flight to Chile. Instead, they 'approved' our request and only send us $164 CAD, instead of the $1800 USD for our flights. We are so disappointed and they are telling us there is nothing they can do to undo our flight cancellation. So they get to keep our $1800 USD and we're left without flights. Horrible customer service. They were not pleasant to speak to over the phone and kept repeating legalities instead of speaking to me as a human being. All we want is to modify our flight destination to another place in South America. We're extremely disappointed with Avianca and will not be flying with them again.

### " become a miserable airline"
At first glance it seems fantastic to have bought a round trip ticket to Miami - Santiago de Chile - Miami at such an affordable price. But it was a trip full of unpleasant surprises. They charge you to choose your seats, a payment for each flight. In my case there were 4 flights due to the stopovers in Bogota. They charge you for the “carry-on” suitcase (the one you take on board the cabin). The price varies depending on whether you make the payment online and also depending on how close to the date of your trip you do it. One way (MIA-SCL) I paid U$D 65 - for my small suitcase in the cabin. On the way back (SCL-MIA) they charged me U$D 123 to carry my suitcase in the cabin. If I had checked it as luggage it would have been even more expensive. During the trip there are no food or drinks included. You have to pay for some sandwiches, some junk foods, coffee, drinks and even bottles of water. During the Bogota - Santiago flight, they offered me water in a glass as an option… as long as I went to look for it in the back of the plane. The seats are not reclining (unless you pay an additional cost), they have no padding or anything to support your head. In 2017 I traveled on Avianca and it was a decent airline. Today it has become a miserable airline. I will never fly with them again.

### "never been treated that badly"
Incredibly rude, while boarding, they kept asking me if I was Russian or if I was flying there (even though I showed my non-Russian passport and my flight info). Singled me out for additional checks and kept asking me to indicate my whereabouts! They took a picture of my passport and sent it somewhere through WhatsApp! No idea who has my data and what will they use it for. I kept contacting the airline for an explanation but no response. No one told me what was wrong they were just rude and very clearly kept an eye on me as if I were a criminal. I was so scared and the entire experience was traumatising. I have never been treated that badly and would rather take a bus across the continent than fly with them again!

### "I was really disappointed"
I was really disappointed flying Avianca internationally from Bogota to NYC. Never in my life have I been on an international flight that charges for water, let alone anything to eat or drink. It was not advertised or clear that the flight did not provide a meal or any free beverage service, which is unacceptable. Only once onboard and in the air did they tell us that not only was it required for us to purchase anything to drink, but that there weren’t full meals available for a 6 hour flight during dinner time. Further, when I purchased food, I was given an inedible instant Mac and cheese (improperly made, don’t offer it if you can’t prepare it). I flew Avianca in 2019 and had a completely different experience. This flight left a really bad taste in my mouth after an incredible trip in Colombia… a really sad way to end vacation. I will not fly Avianca again.

### “no Avianca staff”
Not Verified |  My booking ticket clearly states $30 for first check bag and thats all I checked-in at the airport on a self check-in kiosk, no Avianca staff available in sight. The kiosk charged me $180USD for the checked bag. These crooks have designed this system to rob people at the airport for checked bags.

### "I would avoid flying with Avianca"
We chose "plus sized" seats for our flight, but when I boarded this seemed like some sort of bad joke. I am 6'3" / 190cm, but my knees touched the back of the seat in front. If this is "plus" legroom, I hate to think how spending 3.5 hours in a standard legroom seat would feel. There were 3 flight stewards, and whilst the younger 2 were smiley, friendly and helpful, the older (more senior?) member of staff seemed to go out of his way to order passengers around in a surly manner during the flight. Maybe he was having a bad day, but this was not appreciated, and felt like particularly bad customer service. The flight took off slightly late, but landed early by a good margin. Finally, I am not sure where the responsibility for this lies, but one of our suitcases had been opened, unpacked and then the contents thrown back in in a random manner so that various items were crushed and had minor damage. There was a note placed inside the bag from Avianca that simply stated that the bag had been opened and checked etc, but there were no contact details to complain about the bad and careless re-packing of the suitcase. If I have a choice of airlines on a particular route in the future, I would avoid flying with Avianca again.

### "It was a nightmare"
It was a nightmare, first complaint was that they charged me 200 dollars for my second luggage, my seat didn’t recline it , from Lima to Bogota my connection was limited time to catch my fly I just made it. When I and other passengers say something about the connection to the crew didn’t respond. Lima to Bogota 2 hours flying they didn’t give us even a glass of water, from Bogota to New York they charged the food, I got a ramen cup for 4 dollars in the plane they didn’t take cash. They have no TV in the plane, connecting for a movie online was another problem a total nightmare. I do not recommend this airline.

### “Avianca is the worst”
Not Verified | Avianca is the worst, they always oversell their flights and you have to pay for food. Today while I was traveling I got kicked out because they oversold. Today on my flight they didn’t let someone on because she had a red eye, also on the same flight they gave a ticket to a standby when the lady who owned the seat saw that they gave to her because she was absent when she clearly was there in the flight next to us. Avianca flight attendant got in a fight with an old lady. Please don’t fly Avianca.

### "a terrible experience"
Not Verified | Third time flying with Avianca and overall it was a terrible experience. We were charged extra for our bag (recently travelled with different airlines who did not charge for the same bag). Then flight was overbooked, staff rude etc. Safe to say that we will not travel with Avianca anymore!

### "the most uncomfortable seat"
We sat in the plane from Bogotá to Santiago for over 7 hours, in the most uncomfortable seat I can remember. Onboard, we were neither served drinks nor food; one could only purchase unpalatable sandwiches or instant soups for a high price. No entertainment at all on board. The seat no longer had a pouch attached to it where one could store items like glasses or a phone, but just an open net at the bottom, which is hardly suitable for storing anything. By the way, the ticket price was not lower than what the competition charges. Low cost with this airline apparently means that they hardly value a comfortable travel experience anymore, which used to be the case, yet they still charge a price for tickets as if that were the case. On the return flight to Bogotá, many passengers were asked to check their carry-on suitcases. This could be an unpleasant surprise if you're not prepared for the fact that no food or drinks are served on board and you had a snack or something similar in your suitcase, which you then sorely miss for hours on board. Good luck with this strategy, dear Avianca management. If a miracle happens, it might continue to go well for a while.

### "an additional $120 for my carry on"
Not Verified |  Overcharging for checked bags. They charged me $120 for each checked bag plus an additional $120 for my carry on which wasn’t included even in premium economy? This is insane. I didn’t pay for the baggage in advance because I didn’t know yet if I would have to check a bag or not. Usually this results in a moderate increase in baggage fee ($60 instead of $45) but when I got to the airport I was stunned to find out that I had to pay $240 to check my luggage (including my compliant carry-on, which is well within the maximum dimensions).

### "mastered the art of terrible service"
Not Verified | My recent encounter with Avianca customer service was a nightmare. They managed to excel in incompetence and indifference. Representatives were clueless, unhelpful, and seemed more interested in avoiding responsibility than assisting passengers. It's astounding how they've mastered the art of terrible service. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "Avianca is the new low-cost airline"
My recent journey with Avianca on flight AV218 from Buenos Aires to Bogota in December 2023 left me thoroughly dissatisfied. The economy ticket I purchased felt like a blatant overcharge considering the absence of basic in-flight amenities. Shockingly, Avianca failed to provide even complimentary water, a standard expectation on any flight. The lack of consideration for passengers' well-being was striking, and the overall experience left much to be desired. Adding to the disappointment was Avianca's carry-on baggage policy. Passengers were not permitted to bring any carry-on items unless they paid a hefty fee of US$90, allowing for a mere 8 kgs. This policy felt more like a money-making scheme than a reasonable regulation. All in all, my experience with Avianca was marred by overpricing, a dearth of basic services, and an unjust carry-on policy, making it hard to recommend the airline to others. In brief, Avianca is the new low-cost airline in the Latin American market, but they still market themselves as the good airline it used to be and we all long for.

### "this airline is such a scam"
Terrible customer service. Called to extend my stay with representative. Updated details to return on December 25th instead of the 23rd. Via phone imputed my debit card details representative said it was 197 dólars for update which I agreed and the representative affirmed that it was updated and everything was clear that I only had to wait 4-8 hours for bank to get transactions. This attempt was Saturday December 16th. My Avianca schedule trip was updated online. Supervisor as well notified me that representative had to charge me 200 dollar fee plus flight if I had no I would have never changed anything or just bought a ticket from somewhere else or returned that Saturday. Well on Monday I had to add bags and was curios transactions was never made on my account. It was giving me issues to check in. I call and was notified that I no longer have flight. I was not aware that if payment was not taken out full flight was canceled. I called stating that I was not informed correctly and to review the call. I would have never risked to lose my direct flight to Medellin. I would have bought a one way from any other airline or them. Multiple supervisors tried to escalate the case but was never informed of anything or refund or rebooking. They told Me that I had to wait 6 hours before flight to review call or Avianca to take any actions. I called Monday, multiple times and even took a hour drive the airport to try to resolve and was notified that call center malpractice and it’s affecting airlines image and that I had to call due to the fact that no flight was available. Tuesday manager notified me that within four hours I will be contacted in regards of the case. That never happened I called in the afternoon and explained to representative that a call back or email was going to be sent. Keep in mind I leave the next day. They told me that I had to wait 72 hours for a response which is impossible due to the fact that I had to fly. I spoke to manager she told me she can’t do anything and disconnected the call in my face. I processed a purchase later on with Copa airlines for 400 dollars. At this moment I have yet to hear anything or get my credit or refund on that terrible negligence and misinformation by the representative or Avianca's system . I called my bank and no attempts were made to take out the 197 dollars for the requested date of return change. Flight changes in this airline is such a scam they wanted me to buy another full flight

### "facilities and service were terrible"
Worst long distance flying experience in my life. I reserved a window seat when I checked in and they changed it. I wasn’t even given a new boarding pass with the new seat number which meant I got on the plane not even knowing where to sit. They told me I needed proof of an onward flight before they would let me board (I’m travelling South America by bus and hitchhiking so I didn’t have), and that this was obligatory to enter Colombia. It’s not. It’s just a way for them to make sure they don’t have to deport you at their costs. When I argued this with the guy he was rude and dismissive. After I spent my money paying for onward travel they let me on without even checking it, so I wasted my money (I was right, I didn’t need it to enter the country). On the flight the facilities and service were terrible. The toilet light wasn’t working and it was covered in urine and used papers and wasn’t cleaned once during the flight (wish I had taken a picture, absolutely disgusting). The steward also told me if I wanted a glass of wine I’d have to get up and get it, which meant not only me getting up, but also meant disturbing the people in my row. When I asked him why he couldn’t bring it like on any other flight he told me “because then everyone will want me to bring them a glass of wine"!

### "it became a disgrace"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately, what I considered to be the representative airline of Colombia is now a shame. The changes introduced in the planes and service to lower the cost have not reflected a decrease in ticket prices but have had a huge impact on the comfort of traveling, especially on international trips. The most worrying thing is the aspect of food or drinks on planes. Even on the lowest-cost airlines, they offer packets of peanuts or some snacks, and constantly water. In Avianca it is terrible that you have to pay for water or move out of your chair to serve yourself to the bottom of the aircraft. Now, the seats are terribly uncomfortable, there is no way to endure a trip of more than 2 hours sitting, not only because they do not recline but because there is no space to accommodate your legs. Now imagine yourself in a window seat, moving all your companions to go back to the plane to ask for water! I hope Avianca reconsiders and changes again and puts the capital "A" in its logo out of pride and not the lowercase "a" because it became a disgrace.

### "A terrible experience"
A terrible experience. Never again, if I can avoid it. Customer service is non existent! Both airport staff and flight attendants seem like they are doing passengers a favor and are extremely unfriendly. Meals and menus on board have to be paid for, including water. If you do not want to pay for water, you need to get up from your seat and go to the back or front of the plane and ask for it. What kind of airline service is this, after you have paid for a full ticket and it is not that cheap. Passengers with pace-makers and or other disabilities, even with proper identification are disregarded and in my specific case, had to argue with the staff to allow me to embark priority. There is a sense of complete staff incompetence, not knowing English or any other language for that matter very well, with the exception of Spanish!! Regarding and ID travel documents, they mix up dates of issuance and expiration. I have never seen anything like this before. A nightmare that has us land exhausted and disheartened with this travel experience.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. Attendants  at you. When connecting be side my flight was 2 hours late because the plane arriving to LAX was late and there was a TSA issue, Avianca attendant tried to make me pay a penalty fee. Being late was out of my control. They charged me $100.00 for one suitcase and then when I checked it in they charged me another $95 for it being 7 pounds overweight. Never again. I will take any airline to Colombia but this one. Horrible experience.

### “terrible customer service”
Not Verified | Absolutely terrible customer service. They are completely unresponsive and completely ignore your requests. I've been screwed over multiple multiple times by them. I only fly with them if I have no other choice.

### "Do not use Avianca for any reason"
Do not use Avianca for any reason. This is the worst airline I've ever set foot on. Their flight was just about the same price as with any other airline that flies to South America, but since they are the only company that will fly you to Bogotá from abroad, you're stuck with their horrible excuse for a service. The planes are junk, with no legroom at all, no amenities (even some that shouldn't be considered that, like simple water, where if you want some, you'll have to pay 5USD for or be forced to go to the back of the plane to get tap water which if you're a frequent traveler, will understand is alright in paper only). It's dirty, and the seats don't recline (this is not hyperbole, they are physically not built to do so), unless you pay for their "business economy" (which is a joke of course). These are 5+ hour flights and they won't even do peanuts or a bottle of water. Their in-flight entertainment has to be through YOUR OWN devices, which I understand is the way all airlines are going, but good luck trying to watch any of their 2 Friends episodes with their bad service and a broken outlet to charge your Ipad. The staff is alright, I guess. They think they can get away with this nonsense by saying stuff like "We know we suck, we're working on it" (for real, read any of their ads), but the reality is that they should have not been bailed out by the Colombian government. Just let them go under. They are the epitome of a masterclass in doing everything wrong. Avoid at all costs. It is not worth it whatsoever.

### "worst airline I ever flew with"
Not Verified |  I have been been travelling for 27 years and Avianca has been by far the worst airline I ever flew with! I took 3 Avianca flights : two were really late, one was cancelled and I had to sleep in a very dirty hotel they paid for. The aircraft is so dirty, the crew never talks to you and never helps you when you ask anything. They didn’t even explain why our flight had been cancelled and we had to wait for hours until they gave us a voucher to go sleep in a very bad hotel. On my way back to Costa Rica, Avianca gave me wrong information about my flights, my board gate and the time of boarding and I almost lost my flight. I ended up having a panic attack because everybody was giving me different information and I thought I would have lost my flight.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Avoid at all costs. This airline chose to be the worst (not to be confused with low-cost) airline in South America. I have flown many regular and low-cost airlines and this is by far the worst - absolutely no space in the seat, which I could survive for a 2-3 h flight, not 5.5h. On top of this, there was nothing - no low price, no hot tee/coffee (even to buy), no food to purchase, no screens or entertainment. I fly a lot (30-60 flights a year, all over the world) and this is by far the worst service I got.

### "the quality decreased extremely"
Avianca is in my Top 3 of the worst airlines of the world. Every second flight is delayed up to 2 hours. Our last flight to Barranquilla was delayed while we were already sitting in the airplane, one of the reasons was that they had to calculated the fuel again to see if it's enough to get to our destination. Food during our flight from Barcelona to Bogotá was poor and for our toddler they only had some ice cold porridge. They also made you enter the planes almost an hour earlier, to just have you wait inside the planes Overall the quality decreased extremely during the last years. I hope a better competitor appears to destroy their current monopoly.

### "changed into a low cost airline"
My flight was moved from November 16th to 17th early in the morning. In the counter only 4 attendants registering more than 200 passengers. I only was ticketing my luggage it took 45 minutes and additionally my seat though reserved was changed from 6C to 22A. I also had to pay my stay for that night in Medellin. I’ve been traveling with Avianca the whole year - more than 30 flights mostly international. Despite my gold status, terrible seats, service in general. Avianca changed into a low cost airline at high ticket rates as they have a regional monopoly.

### "standing in line for over 2 hours"
Arrived LAX four hours before my flight so I could eat dinner before traveling. Checked in at kiosk and tagged my bags. That went smooth. Have been now standing in line for over 2 hours to drop my bags. Have moved about half way towards the counter in 2 hours. What a mess. Will for sure not get a chance to eat now and have another 12 hours of travel ahead of me. As a side note, their charges for carry on and checked luggage are ridiculously high. But all the American airlines seems to be doing that now.

### "downgrade from Business to Economy!"
Avianca did the impossible and managed to give me a downgrade from Business to Economy! I purchased a business class trip from Ecuador to Brazil through Colombia, whilst waiting at the gate of my first leg flight I found out it has a 6 hours and 40 minutes delay! I had to go back to check in, stay in line for 1 hour where they gave me a new flight to Colombia in order to catch my original flight to Brazil. One minor detail: my flight was now um Economy, despite my flight to Brazil was still the same. The local staff told me to solve this matter with the Colombian Staff, once I got in Bogotá I had to go to 4 different desks all saying that it was weird and told me to go to a different desk. Long story short: I received no explanation, no compensation and I flew economy but was charged business. If you’re a business man flying for work stay away from this company, the staff is totally unprepared and not willing to help, hotline doesn’t work, I’m a Lufthansa frequent traveler but didn’t make any difference.

### "I feel scammed"
The worst airline in the world. I had the worst experience with Avianca in my travels from LAX to Layover El Salvador for 4 hours then to Honduras, customer service is a scam, no one who works there even wants to help you from online help to call centre (they hang up on you, never answer) to front desk to the air plane staff/servers! They are miserable and have no training in customer service. Worst watered down coffee ever and then she wouldn't even give me a cheap add packet of instant powder to fix it, can't believe I paid for all of this! Not sure I'd even fly with them if it were free. I feel scammed.

### "Service is very poor"
Not Verified |  They will make their own rules to charge you for everything. Bags, food even a simple name change now is a nightmare. Even when you get the most expensive ticket they will still charge you for the seat. Service is very poor, do not fly.

### "the worst major South American airline"
This is by far the worst major South American airline! Avoid at all costs. There is no free service on 5-6 hrs flights. Not even coffee / water. The seats on A320 are extremely uncomfortable and it's not possible to adjust them. Their app was just horrible. I wasn't able to check in using the app on any of the flights (5 flights total). Which leads us to their service quality. They refused to do a check in at the counter claiming it wasn't the app that wasn't working, they said it must have been an internet connection issue (everything else worked perfectly). After 30 minutes of pointless conversation in Spanish (no one spoke English at the airport on Galapagos Islands) they finally agreed to check me in at the counter. They do their best do charge on everything, even if they don't have the right to do so. The check in online wasn't available on Sao Paulo - Miami flight, and the Avianca website said I had to check in at the airport. I then went to the airport and showed the info from the website, which explicitly said online check in wasn't available. To my astonishment their staff outrageously demanded a fee for check in at the counter, claiming I should have checked in online .. when I refused to pay and said this option just wasn't available for my flight they said I wouldn't be able to board my flight if I didn't pay. No on board entertainment on A320 (again, these are 6-hours flights), just the app. The 'map' and 'flight info' were always 'temporarily' unavailable. In comparison, other airlines like LATAM and Aerolineas Argentinas were pretty decent, with drinks and food inclued, great service, no-hassle online check in and comfy seats. I will never fly with Avianca again.

### "charged over $200 for one bag"
Not Verified |  Was a decent airline up to this flight. Seems the seat spacing has decreased. No food or water on flight. Could not buy extra bag online. Tried by phone took 45 minutes was told everything was good, went through the payment process portal was accepted but received no confirming email. At the airport charged over $200 for one bag. Will avoid this airline unless they change.

### "now one of those cheap airlines"
I used to like this Airline, a lot. This last time I felt like I was flying on something else, $100 to check a bag, no hand carry-on and if I wanted one $90, no business class and this new bizarre premium whatever, yet I got emails about make an upgrade to Business. No food or drink not even water. So this airline is another of those cheap "we charge you for everything" type of business. The seats were changed for this so thin that you feel like it is gonna break, and no entertainment. In short Avianca is now one of those cheap airlines so don't use them, there are other cheap ones that are better and won't make you feel like they will be charging you per minute you are seating next.

### "their quality is really low"
Please avoid this airline. If you have to travel to Latin America better use Copa Airlines or Latam. I have the most uncomfortable flight with Avianca. The chairs are super uncomfortable, for a flight of more than 6 hours they didn’t offer any drinks or water. They charge for everything!! The worst part of all, they damaged my luggage and answered me that they won’t pay for this damage, because according to their policies the luggage can still function without a wheel. Their ticket prices are super expensive but their quality is really low.

### "What a horrible airline"
What a horrible airline. Avoid at all costs. We even purchased a plus fare for our 6.5 hour journey thinking it was an overnight flight and we'd get a more comfortable journey, what a farce. I'm a female and 5'6 in plus fare (extra leg room) my knees were touching the seat in front of me. 6.5 hour flight and they don't even offer complimentary water. I don't even know why they have flight attendants on the plane as they do nothing - water, snacks are all additional costs. There isn't even a USB charger, no TV entertainment (not even old school screens that pop down). Never will I book this airline again. Extortion is what this airline offers!

### "one-stop shop for disappointment"
When it comes to flying, you'd expect basic comforts, right? Well, Avianca will redefine your expectations. Let's embark on a turbulent journey through the skies of disappointment and frustration. First off, the seats. If you're anything taller than an average garden gnome, you might as well prepare to fold yourself into a pretzel. Legroom? What's that? Unless you're part of the elite business class, your legs will have a more meaningful conversation with the seat in front of you than any in-flight entertainment could provide. But the economy plus style seats come to the rescue, promising the luxury of an adjustable headrest and proximity to the entrance. You'll be so close to boarding you'll feel like a part of the cabin crew, yet you'll still yearn for an inch of legroom. Now, let's talk about business class. Oh, the promise of luxury! Imagine my surprise when, on my flight from Bogota to Cancun, I discovered that Avianca's version of business class is "business  unclass". No food, no drinks, and to add a cherry on top, the power point for charging devices decided to take a vacation of its own. The flight attendants' indifference was breathtaking, I thought they might have mistaken the cabin for a meditation retreat. While their tickets come with a price tag that could rival a Michelin-star restaurant bill, the service is more budget buffet than fine dining. And Avianca possesses a unique talent for canceling tickets that were purchased early to save you money. I generously bought tickets for my family. Avianca sent me an email, claiming "inconsistencies" and promising a refund. When I checked online, everything was hunky-dory, tickets marked as "Confirmed. A call to customer service, was like navigating a maze with no exit. Rounds of pressing buttons and fruitless conversations later, I finally managed to get an answer from a Spanish-speaking agent, who assured me everything was fine, just as the website indicated. But oh, the website! Desperate for clarity, I submitted a support request through Avianca's website, complete with a list of questions and details. What did I receive in return? Silence, punctuated only by the closing of my support request. Undeterred, I called customer service yet again. This time, an agent kindly recreated my support request. I thought, surely, this time I'd receive a response. Wrong again! Days later, déjà vu – the support request was closed, and my questions remained unanswered. Frustrated and with no funds allocated for the ticket purchase, I turned to my bank, who confirmed Avianca hadn't taken a cent. I had to wrestle Avianca for written confirmation that the tickets were indeed canceled and beg for another support request, all while longing for a straightforward answer. In the end, I had to physically visit an Avianca office and buy a more expensive ticket, all thanks to their baffling customer service and ticket-cancellation antics. If you're looking for an airline experience that combines cramped seats, non-existent customer service, and ticket-cancellation acrobatics, Avianca is your one-stop shop for disappointment.

### "Stewardess was beyond rude"
Stewardess was beyond rude. A large man was sitting in middle seat and asked to sit next to a man who had 2 empty seats to himself, and she responded “no because I want to sit there” she didn’t sit there and allowed a man who was not large to sit there. Staff should be retrained, because she is lacking basic skills needed for her job.

### "Terrible airline"
The flight was cancelled last night, they give us a new flight at 5:15 am, the flight was late for almost one hour, and also the luggage for all people traveling never came. Service on board for international flights doesn't exist, they don't offer even coffee, you need to pay. Terrible airline, before was very nice, not anymore. Don't recommend to travel with them.

### "Terrible service on an old plane"
Not Verified | I had the reservation to travel from Lima to Washington DC with a stopover in Bogota on September 13, 2023. I had the right to carry one hand luggage, one carry-on and a first suitcase without any additional payment. They offered me to put the Carry on in the cellar but I didn't accept because it gets too mistreated. My Carry on (with which I made many trips on different airlines without problems) at the moment before boarding they told me that it was too big to carry in the cabin. I went back to the counter to have it sent to the warehouse but they told me I had to pay $150.00. I complained in a thousand ways without positive results and I had to pay an additional $150.00 to have my Carry on put in the warehouse. TERRIBLE AND ABUSIVE SERVICE! Then on the trip from Lima to Bogota and Bogota Washington DC they did not give us snacks or water. Terrible service on an old plane. I will not travel on Avianca again. Other passengers were also treated badly, generating very aggressive reactions.

### "Sadly Avianca gets worse and worse"
Sadly Avianca gets worse and worse. New airlines with no space, seats which don't recline, only paid food (not even a glass of water for free), in flight entertainment only using your personal device, etc. The toilets are tiny and not for oversized people and the area for cabin crew at the back now that they don't need all the trolleys and storage space is also minuscule. I notice the cabin crew having to stand most of the flight. I made 4 journeys recently with Avianca - 2 of which were between 5 and 6 hours. (on one plane there were people who had come from Costa Rica on the same plane and had to suffer over 8 hours in these cell-like conditions. The austerity is OK for a low cost flight of 2 hours or less. It is not all right for flights of 5 and 6 hours plus paying full-fare. Conditions are very unhealthy when you can't even stretch your legs a bit when seated. The food served on board is largely packaged stuff or white bread sandwiches, no health considerations there either. Not surprisingly the crew looked rather grim.

### "cabin service is basically non existent"
Last flight out of three I had in three days with Avianca. Mixed feelings as cabin service is basically non existent. On the other hand planes our relatively new, comfortable (depending where one is seated) and safety standards. Pilots keep passengers well informed and crew is friendly. A pity (and shame) Avianca chose to reduce any service in the cabin to zero; you even can’t get a water for free.

### "Great follow up and customer service"
I left Chicago on American and because of the weather my flight was delayed 45 minutes causing to loose my connection in Miami. American put me in Avianca thru Medellin to reach Cali Upon arrival at the Cali airport on Sept 6, 2023 I learned my luggage was left behind but I was kept informed from Avianca the status of my luggage. My luggage was sent to the hotel in Centenario. Great follow up and customer service. I appreciated very much.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Lost my original flight due to small accident and tried to fly back as soon as I was able to. I tried to buy a ticket on the website and my payment was declined, however I got a reservation number. With that reservation number call the customer service line and asked how could I pay for it. The guy on the line said "the recovery department will call me" to recover the ticket and allow me to pay. I talked to 12 different people (literally as I have a record of all the calls after the first day) during three days trying just to pay for my ticket and the answer was always the same. Please wait for our recovery department and they will call you back to sort this out". I received a couple of emails indicating to buy again the ticket but they were not related to the complain reference I got and explained so to the person in the line who repeatedly said "just wait for the call from the recovery department". Three days in the same dynamic, six hour before the flight and circa 4-5 hours with different people on the phone to have someone telling me finally that I would have to buy the ticket at the new price in the website (three times the agreed price in the reservation). People on the other side of the line was nice and respectful even when I lost my temper and raised my voice our of desperation, however, there was never a solution or way forward. The people may be nice but the processes in Avianca are just a joke. The fact that the person you talk to can not do anything but escalate to the other department that after three days never called back make it pointless to try to get any help on the phone. If you have issues that need some help, Avianca is not an option as the airline of choice.

### "no idea an airline this bad could exist"
I had no idea an airline this bad could even exist. I booked via Aeroplan a flight from Guatemala to Toronto with a stop over in Columbia. Not very direct, but worked for us. The planes are so cramped and seats do not recline, as other have said. Not only do they charge for water and soft drinks, they told us they don't take Canadian visa cards so could not even get that. So no food or drinks on the flight for us. No screens, but they had WiFi streaming. On both flights the USB chargers on the seats did not work. We had portal chargers. Worst was when we got to Bogota to get our connection, we were denied boarding. They overbooked the flight on the connection! We kept asking for information, offering to pay for an upgrade etc and they were so rude and obnoxious it was shocking. Just "we overbooked, you fly tomorrow". So got delayed 24 hours, would not rebook on another airline or anything. I know the people at the gates are not responsible for overbooking, but that made a bad thing a million times worse.

### "flights are abysmal"
I agree this airline medium and short haul flights are abysmal. The economy seats have no headrest and don’t recline. I’m 5’ tall and I felt claustrophobic my knees were almost hitting the seat in front. The service…well what service? It’s a 5+ hour flight and you get no snacks or drinks unless you pay for a drink and this includes water. Premium economy isn’t much better but the seats do recline a bit. I Avianca is by far the worst, only fly this airline if you have no choice. Their customer service is also horrible, even if you buy a refundable flight you have to wait 6 weeks for a refund. Furthermore you have to chase them several times to get it. Their technology is lacking many things cannot be taken care of online and require a call with the inefficient customer service. Lastly if flying into Colombia with a different airline then avianca but your connecting flight is avianca they make you reclaim your luggage at first entry point instead of final destination, which may cause you to miss your connecting flight.

### "service very poor"
Not Verified |  Very disappointing. I used to love Avianca it was my airline to go to travel to Colombia but my latest experience was not better than traveling in Spirit Airlines. The seats in business or preferencial were identical than the ones in economy, the service very poor and the food that we have to pay for without comments. Unfortunately I cannot give him zero stars.

### "nickel and dime attitude"
Not Verified | Worst airline on the continent, staff unfriendly, nickel and dime attitude, charged for carry on 130 CAD, checked baggage 95 USD, water for 2.50 USD. Uncomfortable seats. Wrong carrousel given for luggage claim. Find another airline that will make the effort to service its customers

### "my seat does not recline"
Not Verified |  I have just been surprised to get on the plane and realize that my seat does not recline. I am 1.90 cm tall and this was never told to me when purchasing the ticket. They ask me if I have a suitcase, if I want an upgrade, etc. But at no time was I told about this change. I will no longer fly with this company, this is disrespectful to customers. Acabo de me surprender ao entrar no aviao e perceber que minha poltrona nao recline. Tenho 1.90 cm e em momento algum isso foi me dito no momento da compra do bilhete. Me perguntam se tenho Mala, se quero upgrade etc Mas em momento nenhum foi me dito Dessa mudança. Nao voarei mais nessa compania , isso é um desrespeito com os clientes

### "It's disgusting to be treated like this"
Travelling with Avianca was awful. I flew from Toronto to Sao Paulo via Bogota on a plane that was so uncomfortable that I got to my final destination completely sore and broken. I paid for better seats and could still barely fit into the seat. I'm a fairly skinny and am 6'0 so I usually pay for more legroom so that I can travel more comfortably. With these "premium" seats, my knees were still touching the front seat and I was extremely squished. The seats were so uncomfortable. 12 hours flying in one of the worst planes I have ever been on. The onboard wifi didn't work on either flight. Two different planes and no one on either flight could connect to the wifi. This was the highlight of their service and they couldn't even get that right. As for onboard services, I was appalled that not even water was offered to guests. Again, I paid for a "premium service" and not even water was offered. They were selling water for $5 a bottle onboard. It's disgusting to be treated like this. Lastly, I. have called their call centre several times and I can never speak with an agent. I just keep waiting and waiting and no one answers the phone. I don't know how this company is a star alliance member.

### "Unfriendly and incompetent ground staff"
Unfriendly and incompetent ground staff members. The manager was arrogant and not efficient at all (made me wait more than 20min for nothing without informing what she was doing). Regarding the flight of 3.5hours not a single drop of water provided. Avianca is a star alliance member? This is a joke. Can't believe what I experienced.

### "they don't serve anything to eat"
Not Verified |  Do not buy tickets from Avianca. It's a cheap fake that comes out much more expensive later. I've never seen such an uncomfortable plane, the chairs don't recline at all, there's no headrest and if you're over 1.75 you won't have room for your legs. Even on long flights (mine lasted more than 5 hours) they don't serve anything to eat, if you beg a lot you can get a glass of water of about 50 ml. Now the worst part of all is about luggage. I went on the outward flight with hand luggage, which is what was included in the ticket, and on the return flight they told me that I would not be entitled to carry-on luggage, but only a bag or backpack (even small hand-held bags were not allowed) . I was forced to pay 700 reais to take one hand bag. Não compre passagens da avianca. É um falso barato que sai muito mais caro depois. Nunca vi avião tão desconfortável, as cadeiras não reclinanam absolutamente nada, nao tem apoio para a cabeca e se você mede mais de 1.75 não vai ter espaço para suas pernas. Mesmo em voos longos (o meu durou mais de 5h) não servem nada para comer, se implorar muito consegue um copo de água de cerca de 50 ml. Agora a piora parte de todas é em relação às bagagens. Fui no voo de ida com bagagem de mão, que é oq estava incluído na passagem, e no voo de volta me falaram que não teria direito a bagagem de mão, mas apenas a uma bolsa ou mochila (mesmo malas pequenas de mão não podiam). Fui obrigada a pagar 700 reais para levar uma mala de mao.

### "denied boarding 20 minutes before take-off"
I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received from the staff and the functionality of the app during my recent travel experience. My encounter with Avivanca has left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. Upon arriving at LAX for my flight, I was met with an unhelpful and rude attitude from the  staff. Not only were they unresponsive to my questions and concerns, but they also provided no assistance when the app failed to work properly for check-in. This lack of support only added to my mounting frustration. What compounded my disappointment further was being denied boarding 20 minutes before take-off. I had engaged with three different attendees from Avianca, and while the on-site manager at LAX, handed me an 800 number to call, the other staff members not only brushed me off but also walked away while I was still seeking assistance. As a paying customer, I deserve to be treated with respect and provided with the necessary help to ensure a smooth travel experience. The dismissive behavior and lack of cooperation from staff were not only disrespectful but also a clear violation of the level of service that should be expected from an airline.

### "Extremely unfriendly staff"
Not Verified |  Extremely unfriendly staff, not treating you as a client but rather something they have to deal with. Seats are extremely small. No food service at all. Not worthy of a “Star Alliance” member. Dirty cabin.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified | Horrible experience. They took us on a bus to get on the plane. People needed to climb the stairs even elderly people. Almost a five hour trip with no food and water. They sell everything even water. They were offering people to buy pringles, nuts and even Maruchan soups. Incredible!

### "the worst I ever flew on"
Not Verified |  Used to be good, now I would never fly with them again. 6-hour flight and you do not even get a glass of water. Forced to buy food or drink and they even ran out of food. On the return flight they sold drinks right outside the boarding door and then once you entered they said no drinks on the plane and took them. I spent hours on the phone because we had a group of 13 they said we could not do online check-in. I was told extra bags would be $60 and my wife's medical supplies would be free. We had 2 extra bags they charged us $160 per bag and $160 for the medical equipment. You need to use your own phone or tablet for onboard Entertainment. The movies they offered were all like 10 years old or older. This airline is the worst I ever flew on, the stewardess were unpleasant, the counter people were downright nasty.

### "9 hours with no food/water"
Not Verified |  We had a stop over in Bogota from Costa Rica. Little did we know how awful our experience would be flying from Bogota to Toronto on a Avianca flight. Firstly, our flight was delayed by 2 hours, no explanation why. Then we sat in a very gas fumed bus on the tarmac for 1 more hour. Our flight was suppose to be 6 hours but due to a storm in Toronto we landed in Buffalo for 1.5 hours and sat on the tarmac. There was very little updates along the way, no food or water was offered during the flight unless you paid for it. The garbage cans in the washrooms were overflowing and they didn't empty them. We were on this plane for a total of 9 hours with no food/water. The flight attendants did next to nothing! The plane was also freezing cold. The flight attendants only spoke Spanish. Only the captain would occasionally update us in English. Never in my life will I fly this airline again or advise anyone to take it. It was literally torture. I understand weather is out of everyone's control but to be in a plane for so long without a free beverage and snack even without these delays is not right at all! How is this legal? Please don't fly this airline.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Avoid this airline at all costs if you have other options. We took a flight with stops both ways cause there was no other option by the time we book our vacation to Cartagena with a stop in Bogota. Family of 4, 2 kids. We were very surprised when we realized they charge everything on board even a bottle of water, only tap water is free and you need to be specific, though I wouldn't recommend it. On top of that, no American Express is allowed inside the plane. When we landed in Bogota we had to take the plane stairs and take a bus full of people with doors that were not closing, it was cold, like 56 degrees Fahrenheit. We travel with a stroller, and even after being very specific that we needed it during our stop, they send it straight to the destination there was no way to get it back during the stop. The second flight was delayed by an hour after we were waiting already 20 minutes in the boarding line we returned to the gate, with no explanation given, after the hour they advised us to move immediately to the new gate and we walk in a rush to make us wait another 30 minutes. The outbound flight was the worse of all, my daughter was feeling ill cause of bad digestion and I asked for a wheelchair at check-in so she didn't have to walk in Bogota airport, they couldn't fulfill my request, no apology, they asked me to wait around 15 minutes for someone to come up with the wheelchair and believe me for them 15 minutes is more like half an hour waiting, in my personal experience (for the record we did not have a bad experience during our vacation at the city, on the contrary, everyone was very polite), my daughter had to walk or we were going to lose our flight home. Last but not least they called my name on the loudspeaker and at the counter they told me I was selected for the security verification, I was set aside with another group of people and they did not let me talk to my family after that and they took my passport. They did not care and were very rude, I was carrying their documents at the time and I they also took it from me when I told them in a very rude way too. I had to make signs to my family through a glass from the distance to hardly explain what happened. They treat me in a very very unprofessional way with no consideration at all. Worse airline experience in my entire life. Had to pay for our luggage too, the carry-on was not free either so we decided to check two suitcases which were cheaper at the end. After seat number 10 the seats don't have an incorporated pillow and won't recline, and their entertainment selection is very very poor ... for kids, there are only 6 options. No Wi-Fi is available.

### "experience was very disappointing"
Not Verified | I purchased 3 tickets in USD, but unfortunately, I was charged in BGP instead. When I contacted customer service for a refund, the experience was very disappointing. They provided poor service and even hung up on me. This company relies on travelers, so it's time to voice our dissatisfaction and demand better service for everyone.

### "Worst airline ever"
We are extremely disappointed with Avianca. We are frequent flyers and have been good customers but Avianca has really let us down. We booked our flights from Montreal to Bogota with Copa, which were great, but get from Bogota to Armenia (AXM) on June 25th, at first Avianca said that the flight was delayed, saying that the problem was not on their side. And then kept us waiting in the room until about 11:30 pm when they admitted that they had no staff to fly the plane. We were traveling with an emotional support animal, and the Avianca policy is highly inappropriate for the person who needs this service. We did not receive any compensation even though the problem was clearly within the control of Avianca. On the return leg, from Armenia (AXM) to Bogota, we were scheduled to leave around 10:30 to make a connecting flight in Bogota with Copa. Again the flight was canceled, and there was not alternative but to reschedule all our flights. We needed to pay $150 in change fees with COPA as well as the fare difference. Avianca takes no responsibility for these charges. Avianca made things so much more stressful than they needed to be. They have a clearly serious management and scheduling problems and take no responsibility for the impact on the live their customers. Worst airline ever.

### "We came across numerous issues"
After they emerged from the bankruptcy during the pandemic, they totally don't deserve to be in Star Alliance. It's now a worse possible discounter. We came across numerous issues: - The website, which reverts to Spanish-only on many occasions, could not ticket us. After going all the way through when buying tickets and clicking Buy button, the website would just kick us out. So we had to purchase the same tickets via a reseller at a higher price. Perhaps it's just an unfair practice of Avianca of advertising via Kayak/Booking.com prices that they don't really have. - Sales (ticketing) tech support is impossible to access - I guess they fired all support tickets during restructuring so after we sent them emails we got response back in exactly 24 hours saying they are still working "hard" to resolve the issue with the promise to address it within 12 hours - it has never been addressed. - There is NO food on a 7.5 hr Quito-JFK flight! Only sandwiches for sale, which were uneatable. - They charged us $95 per bag of luggage, carry-on or checked. - They charged $10 extra for checking at the airport, while they did not have any self-service check-in kiosks at the airport that we would have used. - The entertainment is via WiFi only, and the movies we tried to watch had corrupted files - would play 30 min and they would stop.

### "No information from staff"
Not Verified | I’m sitting on a plane that was to depart at 5:20pm. It is now 8:20 pm and plane has not left yet. No information from staff or captain until many of us demanded to know what was going on. We were told an hour ago we were leaving but captain just announced another hour is needed. It rained with thunder earlier but sun is now out and we still have not left. DO NOT fly with them! Absolutely the worst experience on an airline. This plane is awful along with the airline. NEVER AGAIN!

### "The payment system did not work"
Not Verified |  I tried to buy extra luggage from Europe (Holland) on top of my regular day pack. The payment system did not work. I tried multiple cards my master card and visa and both gave the same error. I created a ticket, I called many different numbers and in the end they let me pay 120 euro's instead of the 85 that was shown initially on the website. Budget airline no coffee, food or whatever is all fine for me, but letting the customers pay for errors on your website in my opinion is incredibly inappropriate.

### "airline is mediocre at best"
Not Verified |  I have been flying this airline since I was a kid for over 20 years. It used to be one of the best airlines but the last few trips have proven that this airline is mediocre at best. They provide no food or drink for an international 5.5 hour flight between NYC to BOG, you pay for a carry on and they force you to check it because they claim to have no space. They have no WiFi, no screens, no entertainment and no outlets. You pay premium prices for a budget airline. Their counter staff and flight attendants had attitudes and were genuinely unhelpful. I felt like I had a paid ticket but wasn’t entitled to anything. Like I had to thank them to even let me on the plane. That’s how worthless I felt as a customer. They’re making money off of everyone with their fares being so pricey and not including a carry on. They wanted to charge me for a duffel bag because they said it wouldn’t fit under my seat yet they let people on with HUGE shopping bags that took up overhead space. Suffice to say I’m no longer a customer of this airline. They aren’t what they used to be

### "do not recommend to fly Avianca"
Not Verified |  Needless to say Avianca has the worst customer service. My family flew from New York to Bogota. As they were doing the check ins we had to go to one of the counters because we needed to pay for one of the suitcases. The suitcases were oversized so we had to go back and arrange everything. We did it and were ready to check the suitcases back again. As we were waiting in line, one of the personal from Avianca told us to come with him that he would check the suitcases that were ready and instructed to leave the suitcase that we had to pay in line. As I followed him and showed him the suitcases he immediately told us “Where are the passengers, I also need the passports to check in the suitcases” mind you as he said this he said it in a very rude way giving us orders as we were animals or something like that. I instantly got tired of his attitude and told him to calm down and not to talk to us that way. He started acting as if he didn’t know what I was talking about, so one of my family members (my uncle) went to him and told him that it was unbelievable the way that he was acting. As he said that another personal from Avianca had the audacity to tell my uncle that if he wanted to be respected he had to respect other. Definitely it was a very bad experience and do not recommend to fly Avianca.

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Unbelievable! Never in my 30 years of flights have I encountered such a horrible experience. I booked one way (thank God) to Ecuador and they had us waiting for about an hour before take off without any info. There was not even a cup of water available. The air vents above our seats dispenses hot air in an already hot cabin. The directions to access the wifi were clear, but no service was ever available. Overall a horrible experience.

### "Avianca canceled our reservation"
I am writing to express my profound disappointment with Avianca's handling of two of my trips. The sole purpose of booking the second trip was to utilize the credits provided as compensation for the previous disastrous experience. Avianca canceled our reservation without any prior notification or approval after we submitted a refund request to modify the final leg of our flight. They refunded a mere $387, disregarding the $1,132 we had originally paid and cancelled the entire flight without approval. Furthermore, the refund request email actually said “rejected” so we showed up to the airport thinking nothing changed from our original plans. The lack of communication regarding this refund and the cancellation of our trip is completely unacceptable. Avianca's incompetence and failure to communicate are deeply concerning. The airline's subpar customer support and inefficient processes are costing both customers and the company unnecessary time and money. This issue should have been resolved within a reasonable timeframe, not after spending over five hours discussing it without resolution. In total, I’ve spent over 15 hrs with their support team including my first initial experience. I would advice all customers, employees and investors to stay away from this terrible company.

### "sub charges for carry on luggage"
Not Verified |  This is a terrible company to fly with, when you purchase a ticket you are no advise to upgrade anything but you get hit with sub charges for carry on luggage. I would not use this company (Avianca) for any reason any longer.

### "Terrible airline in every way"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline in every way. I hope this so called airline goes out of business. It will be a great opportunity for Colombia to really have an airline that truly represents such a beautiful country. Their prices are equal to a big carrier but in reality they are a low quality budget airline. No food or water, very uncomfortable seats that don’t recline and zero entertainment. Their so call Wi-if and entertainment connection don’t work and their onboard staff are rude and careless. This is literally Greyhound with wings. I will do everything on my power to never fly with them ever again. Save your money and go for a better carrier.

### "tell us we are late for check in"
Purchased tickets via Priceline. Brought tickets months in advance so we did not see the warning to arrive between 1-3 hours before the flight departure. However, we still arrived on time (1 hour a few minutes before flight departure). Our passports were scanned, the agent walked away to speak with his manager for a few minutes and returned to tell us we are late for check in and cannot get on our flight in an hour. Attempted to force us to pay 200 per passenger to change the flight for the next day online since they can not change ticket reservations for some odd reason in person. Told us to go to a different area to call customer service, customer service not only gave us a run around but hung up the phone a few times while he tried figuring everything out. Was able to speak to a manger who informed us to contact Priceline. Contacted Priceline and they refused a refund unless Avianca approved. However, they refused to speak with price line on our behalf or give us an email address of direct line for a refund. Will never recommend doing business with this company especially now that I’m seeing all these horrible reviews. I wish I did my research earlier.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Don’t fly Avianca. Paid $1200 a ticket and didn’t even get a drink or a snack. They didn’t even have everything on their menu. Seats didn’t recline, no tv screens at each seat, no internet. Crew didn’t know what they were doing. The flight was from 9:15 pm -2:15 am. They handed out forms to fill out like 1:45am to fill out and the crew was no help filling them out. Then 10 minutes later they announce all trays up. How stupid how can you fill out the forms. Why didn’t they hand the forms out at the beginning of the flight when everyone was awake. They deserve to go out of business and I hope they do.

### "Really a disaster"
Not Verified |  No food, drinks offered unless you buy it. They did not have everything offered in the menu, in particular no sandwichs. The airport staff in Miami was unfriendly, no ear sets offered and you have to use your phone to use the multimedia that was not working 100%. Really a disaster!

### "as uncomfortable as possible"
Not Verified | After checking in at the gate. On the return from Guatemala Avianca employees there took from us carry-on water and other beverages that we had just purchased before allowing us onto the plane. Then the flight attendants waited an hour or so later an hour or so later, to pass out beverages for purchase. Seems the airline is inventing security concerns just so it can squeeze an extra buck from customers while making those of us taking the flight feel as uncomfortable as possible. The flight delay of an hour meant connecting flights were nearly missed. Message from captain made it sound like they thought they were on time.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever. Flew from NY to Medellin. Absolutely no entertainment. They don’t even offer you water for a 5+ hour flight. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and very tight. I chose Avianca because I didn’t want to connect but next time I’ll pay extra $$ for better service and comfort. Upon arrival to MDE they let someone leave the airport with my luggage and they had no urgency in getting my bag back. I waited 4 hours at the airport and finally got my things back on my own. Then returning from MDE to JFK I was flagged with “SSSS” (first time ever) and they couldn’t even explain why I was on the line waiting or what was the proper protocol. They were very nasty and I would never fly with them. Would not recommend.

### "Inadequate customer service"
The worst customer service! My friend and I were traveling to Lima. On our way to Lima, our flight was delayed for almost 12 hours, we were supposed to land at 09.00 and instead came to Lima very late, after 01.00 in the morning the next day. My luggage was also damaged on the way. While I was returning to LA. I had a checked luggage, it was a small carry on, 12.5 kg, I had another carry on with me (even smaller). While I was boarding, the representative for Avianca at Lima Airport was very rude and inappropriate and kept arguing that I had to pay for that small carry on and charged me 80$. Her attitude was very bad and inappropriate. Our plane was almost empty and there was space for every customer to take carry-ons. I flew so many times, and this has never happened to me. Inadequate customer service! Stay away from this company!

### "Absolutely horrible staff"
Flight AV651 departing from Cancun at 1410 June 11th. Absolutely horrible staff within every department. We spent our entire holiday in Cancun trying to get in contact with your customer service in order to add baggage for our flight. Obviously this was made impossible and the customer service reps let me know that the option was apparently “not available”. I was made to pay an additional $140 for checked baggage which ended up costing more than our flight! Boarding the plane, we were hit by the rudest flight attendants we have ever encountered on our last 18 months of our travel. Absolutely terrible, either Avianca can’t train their employees or isn’t paying them enough. Go figure! Nothing was sanitised, they couldn’t even take the time to refill toilet paper and hand soap in the bathrooms. You’d think the “Avianca” experience is over at this point. But no, we landed in beautiful SJU and found that our $140 checked baggage that again. Cost us more than the tickets themselves was damaged. We haven’t yet assessed the contents of the bag. But it looks like it’s been dropped from a two storey building and wheels are broken. It’s worth noting, this bag had a fragile tag on it. Just going to show how much Avianca really cares! Scam of a lifetime, will opt to walk over using Avianca in the future!

### "refused to provide a refund"
While we were at the check-in counter, the customer service agent questioned whether I had a "medical permit" to fly because of the bandages around my head. Unfortunately, she assumed that I had undergone a surgical procedure when it was actually a minor medical treatment involving stitches. The stitches had been removed by the doctor three days ago, and I had been cleared to travel. Despite explaining the situation to the agent, she insisted on the necessity of a "medical permit" and refused to allow me to board without one. Notably, Avianca's website does not mention this minor medical procedure as a requirement for a medical permit. This mishandling of the situation by Avianca resulted in us missing our flight. They made no attempt to rebook us on the next available flight and instead provided us with a piece of paper instructing us to contact their corporate office. Additionally, they have refused to provide a refund, even though we had paid to upgrade to Business Class the previous night, and they have not offered any flight credit to compensate for their error. As a result, we had to spend $2700 to book a flight with Delta Airlines, which had no issue with allowing us to board. During our 15-hour wait at Terminal 3 in GRU, we decided to inquire with ticket agents from other airlines if they required a "medical permit. Out of the four airlines, we asked, none of them required such documentation and we boarded our Delta Airlines flight with no problem. Avianca's customer service sucks.

### "This was my worst experience"
This was my worst experience with this airline, 6 hours international flight, no light meal or even a cup of water. Even you want purchase of food, not everyone has credit card, Chair uncomfortable. No toilet paper on WC, the flight attendant are lazy to clean up or put some toilet paper, when I asked for toilet paper one of the flight attendant she just passed me a toilet paper with wrap around of plastic so I had to do her job and put toilet paper in bathroom. If that airline was cheap like many other airlines in world they are cheap and don’t provided food and that is okay, but they price is same as Canadian or US airlines.

### "I did not receive water or food"
On my first trip to Canada traveling with paid assistance by Air Canada from Cali to Toronto on June 4th 2023 which I had to make a connection with Bogota I had a very unpleasant experience with this airline. Taking my flight on June 4 2023 from Bogota to Toronto flight  is a long flight at my age of 75 years. I did not receive water or food on the plane. On arrival at the Toronto YYZ airport and immigration with assistance, the lady in charge told me that I would claim my suitcase here and she left me there and left, where I lasted more than half an hour looking for my suitcase that, because it was a carry-on, was supposed to have been with me at all times. When this lady from the airline left me alone in the luggage section.

### "Avianca has declined in the service"
The service provided by the Wamos crew was amazing however it is extremely disappointing that Avianca has declined in the service they provide to their patrons. The food is awful, I am a vegetarian and there are zero options for me on this flight. It is a 7 hour flight and this is simply disappointing. Further, water, coffee and tea…really Avianca. I understand that you are one of the few airlines that manages a direct flight to Bogotá but this is outright ridiculous. It’s a shame you allow Wamos staff to have to take the brunt of the blame when it is actually the airline that is lacking in providing the customer service. Shame on you! I will not fly your airline again and I will not recommend your airline to anyone I know. It’s simply unacceptable customer service and a complete slip from the excellence that Avianca provided pre-pandemic.

### "This company is terrible"
This company is terrible, there was a mistake in my parent’s name, they got to the airport 3 hours before their flight, the people at the window were not able to fix their ticket. They were told only way they could have the name corrected was by calling customer service, so they called but never got to talk to anyone, they were offered another flight in 3 days. The whole family was already waiting for them and it was impossible for them to wait 3 days. I can’t understand why if their seats were already confirmed why they couldn’t do the simple name change? We lost that money and Avianca won’t refund anything or at least offer a voucher for future travel. They had to buy a whole new ticket with another company and we did enjoy our vacation but not thanks to Avianca.

### "did not offer any drinks or food"
Avianca is a shame! In an international six-hour flight they did not offer any drinks or food. Not even a glass of water! Everything had to be purchased and payment could only be done with a credit card. No earphones were offered, so no one could use the entertainment system. My fellow Argentinean passengers - many of them elders or people with infants - deplaned in a serious state of exhaustion, dehydration, and frustration. I found out about this horrific service in advance, from a Colombian friend, and so I was well prepared with large water bottles and sandwiches. If anyone has to fly Avianca, let's all bring on board smelly fried chicken, boiled eggs, and let's all purposely be messy, let's leave their planes full of grease and wrappers and egg shells - a small act of resistance!

### "first and my last trip with them"
Not Verified |  This airline is one of my worst experience. The customer service is not good. My flight got cancelled and I didn’t receive any emails from them. My next flight was the next day and they charged me &100 dollars for a carry on. Never again. It was my first and my last trip with them.

### "don't give a drop of water"
Avianca I traveled to Colombia from Canada, a 6-hour flight one way on an 320 and back on an A319. I paid $1,150 dollars and they don't give a drop of water, the seats are super uncomfortable. Avianca viajé a Colombia desde Canadá, un vuelo de 6 horas a la ida en un A320 y de regreso en A319. Pagué $1,150 dollares y no dan ni una gota de agua, los puestos super incómodos. Es el colmo con esta compañía como abusa de sus usuarios. Invito a no volar con ellos

### "The whole experience was atrocious"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline! Our flight from Costa Rica to El Salvador was delayed. When we got to the connecting flight to Los Angeles that we barely made, they notified us that they had changed our seats which we had booked for an additional price. They told us with an attitude to get a refund. They declined the request claiming seat upgrade purchases are not refundable even when the airline made the change. Only after I followed up, they gave me a credit that can only be used on future seat purchases but it's practically money lost since I'm never, ever going to fly with them again! The reason why we upgraded our seats was because on the way to Costa Rica the flight was so terrible, we felt we couldn't take it on the way back. The whole experience was atrocious. From the service, to their old falling apart planes, to the miserable flight attendants, to their subpar website. Avoid it all! My 1/10 rating is generous.

### "Terrible experience"
I do not recommend flying with Avianca! Flight delayed for more than eight hours without any compensation. We had to spend the night in the airport. Terrible experience.

### "not recommend this airline"
I just landed Toronto from Lima via Bogota using Avianca. The lady in Lima airport was very rude. I requested her to allow to take my small luggage as a carry on but she refused. When I on board the plane AV74, I saw there are at least 10 percent luggage bigger than mine. I have decided not to use this Airline in future, not recommend this airline to anybody.

### "The worst airline experience"
The worst airline experience we have encountered in 40 years as a tour operator with thousands of flights under our belt. Horribly slow check in (hidden baggage costs in excess of $500), unfriendly and rude staff, ridiculous deplane and third security check in San Salvador. Onboard the seats are tiny, don’t tilt and have no headrests. There was no control about the boarding process and seat selections were not honoured or followed. Essentially a free for all. There are no inflight movies and they charge $3US for water and serve instant coffee for a fee. The only food available was an inedible wrap or sugar foods. I booked my flight through Air Canada and was surprised they partner with Avianca who should be removed from the Star Alliance as they do not honour status. Overall the worst flight and airline company.

### "Terrible customer service"
They almost charged me $85 dollars because I couldn’t fit my book in my bag which I was carrying in my hand. Absolutely ridiculous. Terrible customer service they really don’t care and just want you to pay them. Mean people and treat you poorly.

### "absolute worst airline"
Not Verified |  This is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown.. Each of the 4 legs of our trip had tremendous issues, inconvenience, and staff who are rude and don't seem to care. The ultra-short layover seems to be intentional to cause people to miss their flights. We watched another flight leave half a plane of people behind in their rush to close the doors, knowing there was another connecting flight. When I say zero amenities, I mean absolutely nothing.

### "flight service is horrible"
Not Verified | Prices are horrible, in flight service is horrible. Just a terrible airline. It's also impossible to resolve anything with them. It's an embarrassment that this it the main Colombian airline.

### "the fees are insane"
Not Verified |  Booked round trip Toronto-Costa Rica and forgot to add Carry on luggage. Upon boarding the plane in Toronto I was pull aside to pay for carry on and the cost was $120 USD one way! Without much to do; I paid. On the way back I called in advance to add carry on at a cost of 55 USD and the customer service person confirmed payment was completed. Days later I arrived to the airport and once again was pull aside during boarding; apparently my transaction didn't go thru despite the fact customer service confirmed it was; and was asked to pay $95 USD. I submitted a complain and got confirmation that my transaction was booked but apparently was cancelled after the fact; although they acknowledge that it was an issue on their end; they still would not reimburse the cost difference. Regardless of the cost difference; the fees are insane. Can airlines just include all in the base fare and don't surprise customers with those crazy fees? Airlines just get away with a lot of customer abuse.

### "incompetent and frustrating"
Not Verified | Avianca failed to take me to my final destination and refused to take responsibility for my travel. I purchased a round trip ticket with them from IAD to LPB. Instead of going LPB to IAD via Bogota I was rerouted due to their delays. They rerouted me to LIMA and then LAX and left me there after 30h of travel! I had to purchase a last minute one way ticket on AA for $678 and am dealing with endless portals for complaints with Avianca and no one can take responsibility for the inconvenience and cost out of my pocket due to their mistakes! Incredibly incompetent and frustrating! Never fly them again! Btw - On the way to LPB bathrooms didn’t have toilet paper?

### "the worst airline ever flown"
The worst crew, the worst airline ever flown. USA has a requirement of bags being rechecked at the aircraft and all airport bought drinks had to be thrown out - why do they do that when in the USA you can buy drinks at the airport and take them on board. I asked for water 4 times and the stewardess refused to bring me water. I went to the galley and asked for water and she started at me then got up from her playing on the phone and gave me half a cup. When I was done and returned the cup to her she asked me to wait on line for the toilet and put it in there. Is this how you train your staff. If I had a choice of airline or seat this would not be the one I would choose - this was part of a package I bought and my flight was changed later after the booking, now know better in the future.

### "really low cost airline"
Not Verified |  This is the second time that I experience a very long delay and airport staff does not seem to care since they are used to this. This is the last time that I am using Avianca. Thankfully I managed to change my return with a different airline. Avianca is now functioning as a really low cost airline charging prices as if they were a premium one. It is shameful and I hope soon enough they close it down or sell it to a company that will manage it properly.

### "no engagement nor understanding"
I have a "Lifetime Gold Membership" and a Diamond card with Star Alliance, so you can imagine how much I travel for work. Note that I will avoid flying Avianca in the future. Setting out to work in Quito I booked Avianca for part of my trip. Multiple changes were made to my route during the flight, with no reasons given by Avianca why the changes took place. Where should I begin: 1) My outbound ticket was from Bogota to Quito; "Route changed notification". In Bogota I went to the gate where my original (direct) flight was, and it was scheduled as planned. But I had no seat. No further reason was given. My new ticket flew me to Guayaquil airport where I spent the whole night in the entrance area of the airport. I lost a whole working day in Quito. Again, no reason given; no engagement nor understanding of the customer situation was shown. 2) My return flight from Bogota to Miami; "Flight changed notification". Flight delayed, and according to the pilot it was because of internal issues. I ended up missing my connection flight in Miami (direct flight to Stockholm). Avianca re-booked me for a later flight and down grading me from Business to Economy without even informing me. Swiss Air came to my aid and helped me to get back into Business as this was what I had paid several thousand dollars for. Thank you, Swiss Air! For more than one hour I argued with Avianca in both Bogota and Miami for getting the class which I had paid for. No engagement nor understanding shown. The only comment I received was; "If you want to make a complaint then go to our homepage". Again, I ended up 12 hours late and missing whole working day in Sweden. And once more; no information has been given why all of this happened. I can only summarize this as pure ignorance and not being able to put customers as a priority.

### "chain of terrible experiences"
The name Avianca used to be associated with something special. My last flights were a chain of terrible experiences due to the new policies of the airline very randomly implemented by the employees. I brought an overweight suitcase and they made me pay an additional $120 USD. That's crazy. I also had to pay $80 for two very small boxes that I planned to bring as a personal item. Interestingly, people who were traveling with much larger items were allowed to proceed without purchasing additional luggage (i.e. guitars). During the ticketing process, Avianca employees were forcing passengers with suspected personal items "too large" to get out of the ticketing line to measure their items, in an attempt to extort more money (similar to other cheap airlines). Avianca is poorly executing a "reset" of itself, and they are not doing a good job. Avianca is now the worst airline in LATAM, not the best. I will only fly with Avianca if there are no other options.

### "Not worth the $100 savings"
Do not fly this airline! My daughter flew from DC to Buenos Aires for a week. The day of her return flight she received an email notifying her that her flight had been canceled and she was rebooked on a different flight that would mean she would miss her connection. Upon talking to customer service, they did not have a new flight out for 5 days and would not offer her a flight on a different airline. Eventually they claimed that they had rebooked her on the original flight which was showing online as delayed. Customer service claimed that was an error so she showed up for her flight, but that flight did not exist and the flight she was booked on is the one that means she will miss her flight. She is stuck in Buenos Aires for 5 days. Customer service has started hanging up when we call to try to get this sorted out. Not worth the $100 savings.

### " definitely will not refund money"
We have tried to get a refund for fully refundable tickets we purchased way back in 2020, for a trip that was canceled by the airline. It has been a very difficult process, very hard to reach any live help. We paid $2293 for a trip that never materialized, and after 3 years, I am about to give up. It seems they definitely will not refund money unless they are forced.

### "charged me 225U$ for my luggage"
Coming back from San Salvador they charged me 225U$ for my luggage that was included in my ticket cost. I showed them but they refuse to recognize. They were not able to print a receipt, insisting they gave me one. Avianca is the worst airline i was using. They did not serve even a glass of water, only offer a 3$ bottle to persons having a credit card.

### "customer service was terrible"
Not Verified |  The customer service was terrible, they were very rude to us and showed no interest in helping us. Be careful when purchasing something, they will not refund your money no matter the circumstance. We purchased a ticket and canceled it right away, they only refunded 75% of our money. If you try to call the airline they will not pick up, it is only an answering machine. On the flight, they do not provide water or snacks unless you are willing to pay for them. Overall, we had a very bad experience with this airline. We will not be flying with them again.

### "wouldn't allow a refund"
They scammed me out of my airline ticket, lost over 1k. They marketed my flight as direct on google and on their website, then they delay the flight 30 minutes. I filed asking for a refund given they changed my flight itinerary and were not honest. Took my ticket and wouldn't allow a refund.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified | This was the worst airline I had ever been on in my entire life and I’m a frequent traveler. First, we drank our waters before going through security and purchased new water to take on the plane. Our boarding passes were scanned and just as we were about to walk on the plane, we noticed the flight attendants were searching everyone’s bags. They were looking for water. They confiscated it!! Then on the plane they would not give you any water for free. The flight attendant laughed at me when I asked for a small cup of water. He said I had to buy it for $3.00, but here’s the thing, credit card only and not one of my 4 US credit cards would work. 6 hour flight with no water. Awful. Seats were terrible. My whole row wouldn’t recline, so you could imagine the space I had when the person in front of me did recline. No on flight entertainment on any of the 8 Avianca flights we took while visiting the Galapagos. They said they were giving us free wifi which didn’t work on any flight. Our travel agent booked us meals which we never got. Half the crew didn’t speak English and the ones that did spoke broken English that was difficult to understand. The staff seemed very rude to non Spanish speaking guests. Beverage carts went up and down the aisle once during the 6 hour flight, one cart from the rear and one from the front. It took the cart 2 hours to cover half the plane, because no one’s credit card would work on their machine. Everyone was attempting multiple credit cards. This airline is a joke, I would NEVER recommend them, and I would urge all fellow travelers to go out of their way to avoid this airline at all costs.

### "never ride with this airline again"
I will never ride with this airline again. Their employees are rude, unhelpful, and don't care about assisting their customer's. We arrived at the airport 3 hours ahead of our flight and went to their front desk to check in 2.5 hours prior. We were unable to self-check in or pre-check in as their machine/system didn't like my husband's documents so we had to actually speak with someone to check in. 2.5 hours early and they told us they closed down and that they are unable to check us in. We asked what they expected us to do, and they said that it is our fault and that we are out of luck. We were provided their customer service line (which wasn't working for the first few hours even though we constantly called) and we asked for a supervisor and was denied because their supervisor is in a different part of the airport and won't do anything for us. We were told to just call the service line and that they will not help us as they walked away from us. Mind you I am not from this country and was essentially abandoned there which they again said was my fault for not coming even earlier (even though they were only there 3.5 hours ahead so only allowing a 1-hour window to get checked in. When we called, they said that we would have to pay $200 extra per ticket to rebook on a different flight since they can't verify or do anything on their end. We missed our flight and attempted to get the supervisor for the next shift (almost 4 hours later) who was barely able to get us on their next flight only because 2 of the passenger's hadn't checked in an hour prior to the flight- otherwise we were out of luck and would have missed our connecting flight with a different airline. On the phone they said that they have nothing to do with it, that they can't reimburse me later on a supervisor side of things and that they should have been there up to an hour before the flight leaves but they left 2 hours before. Other passengers ended up having to take their checked bags past security only because they were able to check in online. They were ok with me being stranded and stuck there and blamed us even though they say nothing about when the latest you can check in. On top of that you need to make sure you bring a card to purchase water, drinks, or food as they dont allow you to bring any onto the plane. The seats are small, the employees are rude and unhelpful. I would much rather spend more money in order to not have the stress or worry again then to have to have this be even a remote possibility in the future. They were overall horrible and did nothing to really fix the situation. Take my warning and don't take them unless you like being even more stressed when you fly. If I could give 0 stars for all of them I would because everything was poor, and you dont get any wifi or way to watch the in flight entertainment unless you bring your own old fashioned headphones,

### "worst airline company"
Terrible service and worst airline company I've ever seen. No food or snacks for 5 h flight, ok, but charging for water on board. I’m 180cm, and my knees were touching front seat. At the same time my seat was not adjustable. I felt claustrophobic. Who on this earth in 2023 has such a glitchy web-site? Forget about online registration, buying extra luggage or so. Cabin crew was so rude. You still need to wear mask, but no one will tell you in advance, you will be notified right at the gate and no one cares if you don’t have one - it’s your problem. And a cherry on top - they’ve damaged my luggage and for a refund (actually i’m quite surprised they’ve answered to the claim), offered me 70 usd deposit for Avianca services. Should i accept it and just buy 23 bottles of water during my next flight? Oh, wait, there won’t be any “next flight” with Avianca.

### "$80 additional for a carry-on bag"
They charge $80 additional for a carry-on bag. There is language in the email communication I received and on the website stating that If your carry-on is in compliance with the size restrictions, you can have it sent to the hold at no additional charge. I deliberately down-sized, and traveled with just the carry-on, and had it sent to the hold but they insisted on charging me 80.00 each way despite my protestations. When searching for flights by price, this charge is not reflected in the quote, so add another 160.00 to get your actual price. How is this not a scam? Also, they charge extra for everything.

### "refused to give me a refund"
The worst experience on an airline ever! Complicated and stressful experience when dropping off baggage. The mandatory self-service counters would not work. Rude and unhelpful staff on the ground. Chaotic boarding experience. The plane was dirty, tired with seats falling apart. The cabin crew were rude and miserable *he food was awful. Drinks selection very poor. Inflight entertainment broken. No Wi-Fi or internet connection. My bag was destroyed whilst in transit. Avianca accepted liability but they have refused my refund countless times - nearly 5 months have passed and still nothing! My card got charged by Avianca and I arrived at the airport with my boarding pass and I was not booked on to the flight. Avianca denied taking payment from me and they have refused to give me a refund. Because of this, I had to buy a single ticket. I have pushed Avianca about this but they do not respond to emails and they hang up the phone.

### "new Premium seat was comfortable"
Flew from PEI to BOG in economy class. I booked the new Premium seat which was comfortable: the middle seat has been replaced by a central console, giving lots of space. They also have a handy tray/stand built into the back of the seat in front, on which you can rest your mobile phone while you watch movies, etc. As usual with short hop flights in Colombia, very speedy boarding, slightly delayed departure but on time arrival. Not much else to say

### "Unbelievably poor showing"
Not Verified | I booked a connecting flight from Vancouver to Mexico City and then San Salvador. When I went to board in Mexico city I was told I had to pay $314 for my guitar, which I have always gate checked for free for the last 10 years. Not only was I charged, but the most outrageous fee. Unbelievably poor showing by this airline. I'll never fly with them again. What a contrast to how I was treated on the first leg of my flight with Air Canada.

### "extremely poor value for money"
The flight experience on this flight AV121 and the return AV120 was very disappointing and reflects badly on the image of Avianca, Star Alliance and Colombia. Inappropriate main meals were served for these night flights. Breakfasts were poor, small and tasteless. The crew were unwelcoming and rushed (training needed) and did not seem interested in giving a good customer experience. The ticket cost more than other airlines on this route, and was extremely poor value for money. Seats are at an angle, and not as good a configuration as other airlines.

### "I was happy to use Avianca"
Not Verified |  Flew San Jose-Bogota-Medellin-Cartagena on economy flights - apart from one issue with trying to pay for a seating upgrade (service centre did not respond so did it at airport) all flights were very punctual, boarding process worked so the airline delivered what was promised. Seating and service was basic economy standard with service offered even on very short Bog-Med flight. I was happy to use Avianca and would do so again.

### "the worst airline company I’ve ever flown with"
This is the worst airline company I’ve ever flown with. They have an absolutely terrible menu, no reclining seats, no snacks/meals handed out for long flights and if you purchase water (or any other beverage) at your gate, they make you throw it away before boarding the plane - I guess all in the name of spending money with them instead. I flew Avianca for the first leg my first flight and unfortunately had to continue flying with them for the second part of my trip. The first flight was delayed causing us to miss our second flight and the next flight was scheduled to depart in 7 hours. Avianca in no way compensated us for this extremely terrible inconvenience. I will never fly with them again.

### "never fly Avianca ever again"
Seats are extremely uncomfortable, you have to pay for everything extra (reclining seats, water, snacks, choosing your seat). Airline oversold flight and put us on waiting list (Standby) even though we had paid very expensive ticket. They did it twice in two separate consecutive times we flew with them. They are late, you miss connections. Terrible terrible airline, I will never fly Avianca ever again. Stay away and pay extra for peace of mind and basic level customer service and respect.

### " no food or drink is provided"
Not Verified |  We booked award tickets to EZE in December with very low expectations. Seat assignment could not occur until 24 hours before the flight. We were happily surprised to find that we were able to move to business class seats when we checked in at the airport. All 3 bags flew free. Avianca has no customer service, no food or drink is provided free of charge. We had decent snacks at the lounge in Bogota and purchased snacks on board the plane.

### "space was extremely tight"
I paid $1,100 for a flight from JFK to Guayaquil, with a layover in Bogota. The planes did not offer even a cup of water for free. No snack whatsoever either. The seats did not recline at ALL. The space was extremely tight and uncomfortable. The aircraft was hot and stuffy. I had to go to the bathroom repeatedly just to get some fresh air. The staff were rude. My husband and I were asked to check our carry on bags because there was supposedly “no space” for them on the plane. However, we saw that the overhead cabins were mainly empty. People even put their personal bags in the overhead compartments because there was so much space left.

### "absolute garbage quality"
Terrible airline - not sure why they come across as a major airline, absolute garbage quality. Zero recline on the seats and no neck support, which is shocking. No snack service on a 6.5 hour flight, not even a pack of peanuts. Even water costs money. Stay away if possible.

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever! Disorganized check-in process during all my trip (LIM-BOG-MED-BOG-LIM). Staff is never around immigration areas to help. Really uncomfortable seats, hard and do not recline. No onboard service even though it was an international flight. Avianca prides itself on having gone low cost but I can only say it will be their end - as always - 100 years of just failures! I will never fly them again nor transit through Bogota - another comment will be made.

### "last time I will ever fly Avianca"
I was able to get a digital boarding pass online. When I was able to board, I was told I have to get a physical pass. Why would they issued me a digital boarding pass and then required a physical one. No free food, no free drink for 5 hours flight to San Salvador. Not even one drop of water. You want it, you pay for it. I can’t believe for such a long flight, Avianca can’t even provide water. I flew back from San José to Los Angeles on Delta. It used 757. It has a screen for every seat. The flight attendants rolled down the cart twice offering snacks and free drinks 1 hour after departure and 1 hour before landing (no alcohol which is fine) for a 5 hours 45 minutes fight. In between a flight attendance has a tray with many cups of water walking down the aisle. I don’t like airline that nickel and dime me. That was the last time I will ever fly Avianca.

### "airline has consistently failed me"
Over the years this airline has consistently failed me and I only use it occasionally (2 times a year) when I have no other good choice for flights to Colombia. They consistently hit a new grim milestone every time I travel to them: flights canceled last minute, many hour delays (they give you a worthless voucher with poor conditions that make it unredeemable), horrible customer service keeping on the phone for hours, and arbitrary charges on luggage or other things that will always make you regret buying a ticket with them

### "do not recommend this airline"
They are always trying to scam you in every single way and their customer service is garbage. On a six hour flight they don't even offer water for free. I do not recommend this airline.

### "recommend not to use Avianca"
From Pearson Airport when Avianca made us to pay $320 for two carry on we realized we have made big mistake with choice of airline that did not end just there, the staff were kind of rude. The level of the rudeness was tripled in the return flight to Toronto on Feb 1 2023 they seated us in middle seat in three rows when I complained they completely ignored me. I strongly recommend not to use Avianca as your way of transportation.

### "staff were sassy, rude and ignorant"
Not Verified | From Pearson Airport when Avianca made us to pay $320 for two carry on we realized we have made big mistake with choice of airline that did not end just there, the staff were kind of sassy, rude and ignorant. The level of the rudeness was tripled in the return flight 207 to the Toronto on Feb/13/2023 they seated us in middle seat in three roles when I complained they completely ignored me. The head stewardess was so rude and ignorant beyond endurance made a quite a few people upset. I strongly recommend NOT to use Avianca airline as your way of transportation. Avianca employees make to feel like you are no body and any service one askes for it is about $$$.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience. I got to Bogota at 21:00 and my next fly was at 6:00 am. Everything was closed so a was unable to buy anything. I was very thirsty when a got to the aircraft I ask for water’ they charge me for the cup of water and a cup of coffee $13. Shame on you. A Colombian airline can’t give a cup of coffee? Where you can buy for in Colombia for less than 25 cents. Colombia is NUMBER 1 in coffee production Avianca needs competition

### "probably my worst trip ever"
Worst service I've had. Paid an expensive fee, and got a low cost service. Ground service in Mexico was terrible. This is probably my worst trip ever.

### "not adjust the ticket price"
I paid extra for an upgrade. They gave me a seat of 9D. I complained at the airport. They told me to file on line. I did, and was told too bad since I took the flight and will not adjust the ticket price.

### "terrible and exhausting trip"
This trip was Lima Toronto and Toronto Lima with an stop in Bogota, the experience was just not what I expected. I purchased an economy ticket and Avianca didn’t provide me not even with a glass of water. At the time of arrival in Toronto we waited 2 hours in the airplane as saying that they don’t have any gate available and there was traffic. I know there are some changes with airlines and everything is charge now but water doesn’t cost a thing this is unacceptable and was not provided any apologies for waited so long in the airplane. It was a terrible and exhausting trip.

### "Very budget affair overall"
Avianca’s controversial race to the low fares bottom has also taken a hit on business class. No dedicated check in or boarding for business class in Bogotá. Complete rude-bordering-on- indifference from gate staff when I innocently asked why not. Onboard no pre flight drinks or nibbles for business, and other than dinner and mediocre breakfast staff just hid away all flight with no drinks or even water. Small touches that cost nothing but leave a mark when absent. Entertainment had limited films and TV, no music channels. Very budget affair overall - I was on miles, but for high paying pax it Makes no sense to cut back on premium classes even if economy is all low fares. Would rather take longer with better product e.g. on Iberia.

### "food really bad both ways"
Unfortunately Avianca is the only airline at the moment flying from London to Colombia direct. The fares are expensive due to having the monopoly of this route. Noticed since the visa requirement for Colombians entering the UK was relaxed they increased the price. The food was really bad both ways and served cold. The USB port was broken and the toilet seat would not stay up. On board they are still enforcing wearing masks when the bulk of the airlines stopped. I really do hope another airline flies to Colombia direct from the UK.

### "No help at all from the airline"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. I bought a ticket for my mom, and the airline cancelled my reservation, and I never got notified, yesterday I started to do the check it process and the ticket does not exist, I called and nothing they can do, I tried to buy a new ticket which it's extremely expensive for tourist class. Their website wasn't working so they did a reservation, my mom is now in the airport trying to pay and the second booking does not exist and her flight is today. No help at all from the airline or any of their agents.

### "It was a sardine can for a flight"
Avianca Airlines services are the worst. My husband and I paid for Premium Economy, with extra leg room, that was a joke, the seats are one on top of the other, my knee touched the seat in front of us, and when the passenger in front of us reclined his chair our leg were squeezed. The width of each seat is 14 1/2 inches max. I don’t know what is the deal of selling extra leg room and charged their customers more for something that is not accurate. It was a sardine can for a flight of 11 hrs. The crew members weren’t great either. There is no TV on board, expecting the passengers to watch their own electronic devices, what about older people, some aren’t technology savvy. Awful The food offered was a bread with 1 sliced of ham and 1 sliced of cheese, wasn’t free either. They sell those and even water, all that after charging one arm and a leg for the trip. My husband and I decided not to ever use Avianca again.

### "First and last time traveling this airline"
Worst airline ever! Just when you think it can’t get any worse it does. I paid for my suitcase when I purchased my ticket but because it was a little bigger they made me pay an additional fee as if it were sports equipment. I purchased water in the airport but they would not allow me to bring on plane. They don’t serve anything on the flight. Not even water, no TVs or any form of entertainment. First and last time traveling this airline. Horrible customer service!

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Terrible service. Overcharged for baggage despite published price. Horrible old plane with bad options to get drinks (water, soft drinks) without paying.

### "The service is very bad"
Avianca is a low cost airline with normal carrier ticket prices. The service is very bad, not even water in 5 hour flight. They change class of ticket without reimbursement.

### "Terrible airline and customer service"
Terrible airline and customer service! Tried checking in 24hrs prior the flight. The website did not work for an entire day, and took pictures of it to prove at the counter. The lady at the counter told us "it is what it is" but we had to pay $10 for check in. How in the world are you going to charge for checking in? Plus, we could not add a second luggage from the website, because it was giving errors in each try. I had to pay $250 for a second luggage when in the broken website it said $90 for the second one, just because it was at the counter. Avoid this airline at all costs, even if it is "cheaper" it will cost you more than other ones at the end. Save your money.

### "Terrible customer service"
I was standing in line to check in and was pulled out of line by n rude female agent. She looked at my ticket and told me that my carry-on bag (that I paid for) and that I would have to pay to check in the bag. I informed her that I had already paid for this bag. She refused to listen and forced me another $120 to check it in. They would not allow me to pay the difference. This is after paying nearly $500 for my tickets. Terrible customer service

### "Avoid this airline"
They take your reservation, payment, and just a few hours before the flight they email you saying that there was a problem with the payment and that your reservation has been cancelled. That forces you to renegotiate ticket price rate and tariff ending paying more for your ticket. I had the same twice in a period of 2 months and ended up flying LATAM. Contradictions in the scam: they tell you that there was a payment error to cancel the ticket. But then they tell you that “ticket price will be fully refunded”, so the question is did they had a payment problem or not ? It is just a scam. No calls from representatives, no excuses with strong arguments, just a scam. Avoid this airline.

### "not recommend this airline"
I'm very disappointed with Avianca Airlines. I have used this airline frequently. I was overcharged for $200.00 dollars and on top my flight was delayed. I will not recommend this airline, to anyone.

### "it is not what it used to be"
Not Verified |  I have flown with this airline when it was still a top airline choice for anyone traveling, offering two luggage's and a carry on, entertainment, and complimentary food and water. I just finished getting off my flight and I have have to say it is not what it used to be. We get there and only a carry-on is allowed, and there was no complimentary food or beverage options (on a non-stop 6-hour flight. Apart from that, the seats were extremely uncomfortable, and since I am of elderly age, I do not have a credit card and they do not accept cash for an outrageously small cup of water for $3.00. I believe that they should at least offer a complimentary cup of water in non-stop flights for the elderly aged since this is completely unacceptable and should be illegal.

### "appalled by my last experience"
I remember Avianca when it was an airline with top notch service and modern planes that offered comfortable seats, food and online entertainment -  not anymore. I was absolutely appalled by my last experience. We flew roundtrip to Cartagena with a stopover in Bogota from JFK. As mentioned in the previous reviews, zero food or beverages were served, the seats were the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat on in an airplane, with legroom that was barely large enough for my 5.5 height, seats that didn't recline, USB ports that didn't work and no inflight entertainment, no WiFi. I will never fly with that airline again. .

### "The seats are brutal"
Not Verified |  Abysmal service and highly overpriced. Please consider the following: Checking the second luggage on an international flight will cost you +250USD. They will not provide even a cup of water for a fight that is 6h long, from Bogota to Toronto nor from Bogota to Miami. No more complimentary water - it is a 6h flight for goodness sake! Avianca will not allow you to enter your own water on flights from Colombia to Miami. This should be illegal! The seats are brutal, the width of the seat does not cover the back of a male and there is no legroom even in an L tariff. They reserve the right to overbook the flight - this happens quite often.

### "staff was extremely unprofessional"
Our flight was first delayed by 3 hours only so that we were told at midnight that it was cancelled. Then we stood in line for 3 hours until 3 am to get a $20 taxi voucher but no hotel room! (Where were we supposed to go with it?) We received an amazing $100 voucher for the next flight with Avianca as compensation for having to wait 16 hours at the airport, having to book new connecting flights the next day for €400 at our own expense and arriving completely tired at the destination. The staff was extremely unprofessional. The employee complains to me that he is not in bed yet.. and refuses to speak to us in English, although he can and we have asked him to do so several times. Absolutely no solution or attempted arbitration was offered! Simply unthinkable in Europe.

### "does not offer vegetarian food"
The flight was fine and punctual and the service was good. It is incredible that an international airline does not offer vegetarian food. I tried to reserve it but the process was too complicated, and there were no options on the flight!

### "took too much for luggage delivery"
There was not enough space in the cabin neither on the plane hold for carry-on luggage according to the stressed cabin crew members and Avianca land staff, due to this passenger were forced to place their carryon under the seats in front of them. That is okay for a small bag but for a bigger bag is not only uncomfortable but unsafe. Avianca has became not only uncomfortable but unsafe. In addition it I took too much for luggage delivery, over an hour waiting for the first bag to deliver. Inflight entertainment doesn´t work well wifi has breakdowns making you wait a couple of minutes for be able to continue watching whatever you’re watching. Miserable movie selection and tv program selection, no inflight information.

### "worst airline I have ever seen"
It was the worst airline I have ever seen and never recommend it to anyone. First flight was 4 hours with no water, coffee or any other free beverage and I had to pay for any type of food. second flight was 7 hours with only a small portion of a mini lunch. headset was not provided to listen to what I watched. when I said I don't understand Spanish, the crew continued in Spanish without caring about my comment.

### "absolutely worse customer service"
Not Verified |  Avianca has the absolutely worse customer service in the industry and abysmal ticket policies. I booked 4 tickets from El Salvador to Toronto and back. I did not even consider that an error in country could be made. A few days before my travel date I noticed the ticket had the wrong originating country. I have tried calling, going online and visiting a local office. I am told that there is nothing than can be done. They said it could be a computer error on their part but offer no solution other than purchase new tickets at extreme high prices. I will be launching a complaint to the proper authorities.

### "uncomfortable and unbelievable experience"
Not Verified |  This was my first (and hopefully last) time flying with Avianca. First off, they charge you for any and every snack/beverage in-flight, even water! No matter how long the flight is (one leg of our flight was about 6 hours), they offer no complimentary refreshments. Secondly, if legroom is a concern of yours, I would aim for their highest level of seating, which they refer to as “Premium”. These are the only seats (besides the exit row seats) with the most legroom on the plane. Even their “Plus” seats don't have any extra legroom than Economy has. My boyfriend is 5’9” and his knees were uncomfortably touching the seat in front of him. Lastly, on our final leg of the journey from Bogota to JFK, they made my boyfriend place his duffel bag in the personal item size guide at the gate. When it wouldn’t fit because something was slightly (and I mean slightly because if he actually pushed down a bit on the bag it would have fit) poking out, they took us to a separate kiosk to try to make us pay $150. I ended up moving one of his items from his bag to my own, and that made it fit. To me it seemed like they wanted yet another way to make money that they’d charge $150 for a simple fix, and if I hadn’t moved his items, they would’ve actually suckered us into paying it. This was the most uncomfortable and unbelievable experience I’ve had with an airline so far. Definitely won’t be doing it again

### "do not fly them"
This was hopefully my last (and first) time flying with this airline. I have never, ever, flown internationally with a company that offers NO free beverages, no food, even on an overnight flight of over 6 hours. If you want water, you pay. If you want to eat, there are almost no options, and guess what, you pay. That is normal on domestic flights but on international flights, unheard of. No entertainment on a 6 hour flight from Bogota to Sao Paulo. I had premium seats on one leg, selected months ago, and with an email confirmation from them. When I show up at check-in, they say there are no seats available on that class. I showed them my email confirmation, and all the lady could say is "we are in Brazil, we have no customer service here, you have to take it up with Avianca when you get home". All in all - do not fly them, unless it is absolutely the last option. Plus, it wasn't cheap either.

### "A total nightmare"
A total nightmare. Very uncomfortable seats. No food, no blankets, no screens. They charge for every single thing. They won’t even offer you a cup of water at no charge. I’m not happy with their service. For a 6 hour flight they could do better, plus their fees are ridiculous. Avianca is the new spirit but 10 times worse.

### "This trip was a nightmare"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever. This trip was a nightmare from the early flight without water, coffee, food, to the very cramped seats even though we paid extra room for a "PLUS" to the flight without any type of entertainment or wifi / internet options. I've been using Avianca for more than 20 years in this type of flight and it used to be a very different story. I will never use this airline again and I'm not recommended to anyone right now!

### "everything about my experience was sour"
This airline has all the hallmarks of an airline emerging from bankruptcy. From the no in-flight meals, to the excess fees (boarding pass fees! ), to the glitchy online check-in process, all the way down to their water bottle policies. Before my flight they said the water limit is 100ml which everyone knows is basically one sip of water. Clearly this was intended to make you purchase in-flight water. So I had to throw away two entire bottles of water because of terrible corporate policies. Someone is gonna have to answer alot of questions on the day of judgment when they are asked about how much water they wasted for money. Also why do they have so many flight attendants if they aren't serving food and trying to boost revenue after emerging from bankruptcy? Classic corporate mismanagement across every level. Rock hard seats, poor technology, terrible fee policies - everything about my experience was sour.

### "experience wasn't a pleasant one"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately my experience wasn't a pleasant one. I wish it was for the amount of hours I had to spend on the plane. Anything, from water to a blanket, has a cost. No snacks,no drinks are served for free. If you buy the cheapest fare, your seat won't even recline, it wasn't mentioned online. My trip was 6 hours to Bogotà from Santiago, and a last 5 hours flight to Mexico city. Very badly organised during the embark and disembark periods, both take long time. Not recommended unless it's a really urgent flight or no better alternative.

### "catering is shameful"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Bogotá business class. Seats great, catering is shameful. Tiny portion of food and water. No coffee on a Colombian airline. Crew sat at front and chatted for hours. Bathrooms uncleaned. We got there and back largely on time but really the catering manager should be ashamed. Online side of operation is glitchy and tricky. Seatbelt signs kept on for no apparent reason.

### "now it is just a disaster"
I used to like Avianca now it is just a disaster, the service is horrible, the attendants are rude and seems to be against the traveler, even they now don't offer anything like water and snacks the sell everything but they dont even have a complete menu to offer.

### "3 hours delay. No food"
This was the worst experience ever. 3 hours delay. No food. No drinks. No blanket. It takes one hour to start to se the luggage come out. No explanations. No nothing and the staff just chilling all the flight .

### "This is a terrible airline"
Use Avianca fly from Quito to Buenos Aires and then return. The quality of seats are extremely poor for a 5-6 hours flights, in both flights our seats could not push back for sleeping and they said it is because it is in front of emergency exit row (not sure why but at least this should be mentioned when they are selling the seat), we paid for a seat which could not be pushed back down. The flight was 5-6 hours and they didn't offer anything to drink/eat, instead they were selling low quality food/drinks in the plane. That was a shame for a $900+ and 6 hours long ticket they don't offer absolutely nothing to eat/drink. This is a terrible airline, while few years before I had good experience travelling with Avianca. Will not use this airline anymore.

### "unpleasant and uncomfortable experience"
We flew Avianca from Washington DC to Sao Paulo, Brazil. We purchased the seats. On our way back, we learned at Sao Paulo airport that our seats are no longer available and sold to someone else. We needed seats with extra leg room due to medical condition. Two different Avianca staff offered two different reasons why the seats were no longer available to us (one staff said we may not have paid, even upon showing him the receipts with our seat numbers, he said he can not see that in the system), with a bit of rude attitude. The other staffer told us that its a different plane and seat selection were no longer valid. Communication in English was a challenge as the Avianca staff at Sao Paulo and Bogota do not seem to speak much of English. Our tickets mentioned in-flight meal as "snacks", but we actually had to buy snacks even water during the flight. Overall, quite an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience. We will never fly with Avianca again.

### "Will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly this airline again! Waited 5 hours at the airport, gate ready, deported plane once, reported - now sitting again one hour in the plane and waiting for new pilot. We got here and now they needed a new stewardess! They didn’t know this 2 hours ago? Very disorganized! no leg room, no in plane entertainment, seats don’t recline

### "Incredibly bad airline"
Not Verified |  Do not fly if alternatives are there. My travel companion was asked to pay $105 for cabin baggage within the specified limits. Also, he had to pay for the Boarding Pass. $15.00. This was on a Business Class. The seats were very worn and used. They gave us a bottle of water and a sandwich. No operating AV equipment nor was the seat charger working. This is unacceptable. On the way back, the check in people tried to charge us again. Incredibly bad airline and customer service.

### "only $92.15 was refunded"
I tried to change my flight from Guatemala to Sacramento and they canceled my flight, when the total cost of the flight was $461.00 in total. I tried to make the change and waited for some sort of email confirmation and even called them and spoke to customer support and they said the request was still under review and there was nothing I could do or from them, after I talked to them on the phone I waited a couple of days and decided to call back to find out the status of my request, and they told me that my flight was canceled and the refund had already been provided. I told them that I had already tried to find out about the application and if they had told me that the flight was going to be canceled and that it was going to lose almost all the value, I would have left the flight as it is. But they didn't care about my explanation and hung up. My credit card was charged $461 and only $92.15 was refunded. $368.85 that was what they stole from me, I'm going to contact my credit card to see if they can get my money back but I don't think they can. The online service is operating solely and exclusively for them with all the advantages and coldness of the case.

### "truly sad how bad this airline has become"
They actually tried charging me for changing my seat from 3C to 3D. Even when I said this has to be a system error, they answered that it’s the new rules and if I wanted to change seats I would have a charge. It’s truly sad how bad this airline has become (in all aspects). It’s a shame there is not many other airline options. Any somewhat good airline would be better to the options we find in Colombia lately. (Always travel with other airlines internationally because of how bad local ones have become).

### "turned into a very bad airline"
The was an agent at the boarding gate very rude to me. The flight was delay over an hour without any explanations from Avianca. The new seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they did not offer even a glass of water in a six-hour flight. It was impossible to sleep due to the hard seats. On arrival it took a very long time for the luggage to be deliver. I do not recommend this airline on this route or any other route longer than 3 hours. Avianca has turned into a very bad airline.

### "Do not fly this airline!"
The check in agent made a mistake in copying the number of the passport of my son, it took her 1.5 hrs until she called someone who told her you are missing a number. By the time she could do the check in she said "you can go without your bag the flight is closed". We ask her for solutions and she said leave your luggage. The airline has terrible customer service, no one helps you. Do not fly this airline!

### "Needless to say horrible airline"
Not Verified | Worst airline I’ve ever used (and I’ve used a lot). In recent months this airline went from decent to so bad I will do everything in my power to never fly with them again. They have the most uncomfortable seats I have ever used, with no recline unless you pay extra, which I did and got me about 6 inches of recline. I have absolutely no room for my legs in front of me. There is zero inflight entertainment (no screen, WiFi doesn’t work). They charge extra for everything (food, checked baggage, carry on). There is no food except to purchase but when I tried to buy a sandwich, they said they had none so I had to stick with purchasing peanuts. Mind you this is a 5.5 hour flight. When I was going to Bogota they asked for my vaccine. I showed them a photo of my 3 doses and they nearly didn’t let me on the flight (wanted the original card from over a year ago) even after I explained that I have entered Colombia multiple times in the last few years with a photo being totally sufficient (which it 100% was on arrival). Needless to say horrible airline. Don’t fly Avianca unless you absolutely have to.

### "plunged into the void of shame"
It terrifies me to think of such a stingy airline, when long ago it was synonymous with quality and generosity. Not a glass of water, not a reclining chair for a 5.5 flight, not a tiny suitcase, not anything. A prestige built for generations was diluted, a company that plunged into the void of shame hurts me. Me aterra pensar en una aerolínea tan mezquina, cuando tiempo atrás era sinónimo de calidad y generosidad. Ni un vaso de agua, ni una silla reclinable para un vuelo de 5 1/2 ni una maleta minúscula,ni nada… Se diluyó un prestigio construido por generaciones, me duele una compañía que se lanzó al vacío de la vergüenza

### "it was horribly uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  The worst thing! 10 hours! We bought our ticket with 4 months of anticipation, and we always use this airline so we got confident about food and space. We noticed the prices went high and we thought nothing changed, but it was horribly uncomfortable, the seats wont recline at all, the space between your legs and the front seat are minimum and now you have to pay for your food which is horrible and expensive for no reason. And only 1 checked bag per passenger on international flights.

### "the worst flight experience"
This was the worst flight experience in my whole life. It started with getting an email stating our flight is getting rescheduled 5 hours before departure. Our flight had one stop at SAL, and the new rescheduled flight arrived later than the next one departed. The email stated that I need to either confirm a new flight or “easily manage your change”. None of the links worked. I've tried to reach out to Avianca's customer support to get further instructions and raise concerns about the situation. Calling the number resulted in numerous minutes waiting and listening to a verbatim, and when finally selected to talk to a representative, call hanged up every time. The bot in WhatsApp is useless the same way: neither way to sort out rescheduling issue nor talking to the representative. In half an hour I've got another rescheduling message stating that instead of a trip with one stop and about 7 hours long trip it transformed into 31+ hour long trip with 2 stops including one overnight. No questions about whether it fits were asked. No ways to sort it out as well. Considering that there's no real customer support, my wife and I decided to go to airport and maybe find anyone there to shed the light on the situation. In the airport, we've met the whole line of confused people with the same issues we encountered. The lady on the counter even tried to charge us for not being checked-in and selected seats. Luckily, we've managed to convince her that it's all a big mistake. Asked her multiple times about the logistics of our luggage, and we were told to rest assured that we'll just need to pick it up at our final destination. We arrived at San Salvador by night, considering our next flight will be at 8am next day, we were proposed a hotel, transfer, dinner, and breakfast next day. Asked again about our luggage, got the same answer. When we arrived at the hotel the kitchen was closed and by the time we needed to leave (6am) it would be still closed, so food coupons were useless. Huge thanks to the hotel staff who realized how miserable the situation was, made for sandwiches for us and other people who ended up with the same situation. The next step was New Mexico, which airport doesn't have a real transit zone, so it's required to leave the airport and then reenter it again. We are not US citizens, it was pure luck that we had US and a Schengen visas, so we could leave airports in El Salvador and New Mexico. When finally arrived at Costa Rica, we realized that our baggage is lost. When filing a claim for Avianca to retrieve it, we were told that we should have taken our luggage in New Mexico, and we'll get it back the next morning. It didn't happen. Support phone line was useless again. WhatsApp's communication helped after a couple of hours of trying to reach out to them. Luggage should have been returned the next morning at 6am, and it was but to another hotel. Eventually, we've managed to get our luggage back. And after inspection of it, understood that it was looted. The only advice WhatsApp contact provided was to go to avianca.com, that has multiple times proved its uselessness. As a result, we've lost 2 days of our booked property without any compensation, ruined the beginning of our vacation by depriving sleep, lacking basic things that were in our luggage and ultimately looted raincoat from our luggage, that we really needed in our journey.

### "Truly the worst airline I have ever flown"
Truly the worst airline I have ever flown. They have no customer service phone in the USA - you deal with a chat bot that cannot help you and cannot connect you to a real person. The seat pitch was the shortest I have ever experienced (claimed to be 31 inches but I guarantee it is not). Refreshments, even in premium economy, was water and a cracker for a 2 hour flight with no option for anything better. I had no idea how bad these folks were. Highly recommend you choose another airline (LATAM in South America is pretty good).

### "economy class is very basic"
My worst airline experience has been with Avianca. The website does not function properly. When phoning the call center, calls are dropped frequently. There was an error in resolving an issue I had and on top of that significant delays for the resolution. On top of that the food on lengthy flights in economy class is very basic. For example we had a small sandwich and had to ask for water.

### "literally impossible to reach them"
Not Verified | I can’t send you any documentation nor paperwork because I can’t get a hold of Avianca call centers they never answer the telephone or emails. It is literally impossible to reach them. You try it see how it works for you, these third world countries companies are totally out of touch.

### "Very disappointing"
I was issued a boarding pass and thought I was all set. When I tried to board plane they refused because I am not vaccinated for Yellow fever. Very disappointing that one can get boarding pass with no mention of yellow fever issue traveling from Brazil to Columbia. The staff were not concerned with my situation and happy to send me on my way without a solution. Please make sure you know about the Yellow Fever.

### "offered me a miserable compensation"
This airline is probably one of the worst I’ve ever flown in. The service in cabin was alright, food was ok but the thing that really bothered me is that my bag was open and searched (leaving a mess by the way) and some items were stolen. I submitted a claim to the airline as soon as I arrived that day and the only thing they did was told me that those items were “personal” and should have been guarded by the passenger, so they didn’t do anything and only offered me a miserable compensation for items that were new and quite expensive. The worst of the worst.

### "They do not return your money"
In my last purchase of tickets for a family trip to Orlando they sent us a cancellation of the dates and that we had to accommodate the dates that it suggests when we already have hotel, park and car packages that are very difficult to modify. When requesting reimbursement, they rely on a supposed emergency law granted by the pandemic. but in reality what they are looking for is to cancel the tickets and force you to change your date and then open those dates at a higher price during the season. Definitely an abusive airline and very unreliable. Since the alleged refunds are made on a card to buy more tickets with them. They do not return your money, something very unfair since the cancellation is on their part without just cause. En mi ultima compra de ticketes para un viaje familiar a Orlando nos enviaron una cancelacion de las fechas y que debiamos acomodar a las fechas que ello sugieren cuando ya tenemos unos paquetes de hotel, parque y carros que es muy dificil modificar. Al solicitar el reembolso ellos se amparan en una supuesta ley de emergencia otorgada por la pandemia. pero en realidad lo que buscan es cancelar los ticketes y obligarte a cambiar tu fecha para luego abrir esas fechas a un mayor precio durante la temporada. Definitivamente una aerolinea abusiva y muy poco confiable. Ya que los supuestos reembolsos los hacen en una tarjeta para comprar mas ticketes con ellos. No devuelven tu dinero, algo muy injusto ya que la cancelacion es de parte de ellos sin una causa justa.

### "Seats are very basic"
Uneventful Flight. Modern plane flight and luggage arrived on time. Seats are very basic if you do not pay extra. There is no service at all on domestic flights, not even a water can be purchased.

### "This airline has the most unpleasant staff"
Not Verified |  This airline has the most unpleasant staff and customer service especially when you are checking bags in! They will do anything to overcharge you. They also don’t know what they are doing, if you asked them a question it is very likely they won’t have an answer. Very poorly trained.

### "Absolutely a disastrous airline"
Absolutely a disastrous airline. The worst thing you can have in airlines. My mom had a flight with a ticket and everything to get to the gate and be told that the flight is full. Not before first telling him that there were delays. Then Avianca representative proceeded to tell her that she was not going to travel and that they would return $95 dollars. That is a humiliation. Absolutely the worst airline can have. Absolutamente una aerolinea desastrosa. Lo peor que puede haver en aerolineas. Mi mama tenia un vuelo con ticket y todo para llegar a la puerta y que le digan que el vuelo esta lleno. No antes de primero metirle que havian retrasos. Luego representante de Avianca procedio a decirle que ella no iva a viajar y que le ivan a regresar $95 dolares. Eso es una humillacion. Absolutamente lo peor que puede haver de aerolineas.

### "Such rude staff"
It was my first time and my experience was the same - my 22-pound carryon bag was almost 150 dollars. Such rude staff, and I never thought that reaching El Salvador would be difficult. For my return, I had to canceled and they returned me on a North American Airline.

### "Seat space is very low"
Flight was changed after booking to an earlier flight. Not many option then just take this. This flight was delayed by an hour. Seat space is very low. But seats and cabin were new. No inflight service not even chance to buy water.

### "There are better airlines"
Not Verified |  I will never fly with Avianca again. The service is very poor! Customer service very deficient. They don’t know how to treat customers! They charge a lot of money for baggage! Think about it before buying your tickets. There are better airlines.

### "Bring you own food and snacks"
Bring you own food and snacks if you are vegan, lactose intolerant or don‘t eat pork for religious or whatever reason! The only snacks they give our (crackers and a nut bar) contain milk and the only served food on board was a ham sandwich, not even a vegetarian option available. We flew for almost 10 hours, both flight had no food for me, although you pay the same price as with any other airline flying this route. Service onboard 1/10/. Rather new airplanes but on some routes seats can‘t be reclined. Inflight entertainment only worked on one of two flights, no screens, bring your own device.

### "I will not fly with Avianca again"
Do not fly Business Class on Avianca. Avianca is in the process of reorganization to become a low cost carrier. In spite of having paid the cost of Business Class, the only benefits were more space in old seats in poor condition, a cold ham/cheese sandwich and access to a restroom of slightly less use. I will not fly with Avianca again.

### "worst airline we have experienced"
Avianca is the worst airline we have experienced. We had two connecting flights and one was delayed and another cancelled. The delayed flight was supposed to fly at 10pm and until 11pm no one has told us that we were not going to fly on the day, we were just being kept in a very long queue. They then took us to hotels at around 1am - everyone was exhausted and the bus driver took us to a wrong hotel first. What a mess. At the hotels no one told us when we were going to fly the next day. It has been 3 months and I am still fighting with Avianca for a refund (under UK law they must compensate £520 for delayed flights). Nothing nice to say about them. Complaints handling is poor. Service is poor. They have disgusting meals on the plane and a bad selection of films.

### "worst service I have received"
Flying from Bogota to London has to be some of the worst service I have received in years from Avianca. The food was off, it tasted like it was past its date and vinegarish. The food was also cold, the service was terrible.

### "I am not entitled to compensation"
I got a notification 20 hours before the flight that it was going to be delayed by 10 hours so would be flying the next day at 12pm instead of the night before at 10pm. Because of this I had to pay for a night's accommodation at Heathrow Airport. I contacted the airline to ask why the flight was delayed to see if I could claim compensation for the cost of the hotel. The companies response was the reason for the delay was an external issue so I am not entitled to compensation. They then went on to explain that one of the passengers due on the flight was ill. They rearranged the whole flight because one person was ill? Complete sham of a company, who took months to get back to me. Disgraceful

### "still no reply"
Booked this airline because it was cheap and the quickest time from San Francisco (SFO) to Costa Rica (SJO). We were supposed to arrive at 9:30 AM in December of 2022. They contacted me and said my flight was canceled but they can put me in a later flight around 11pm on the same day. I already got all the hotels and transportation booked. I requested refund but still haven't received it for almost close to a month. First they said they cannot refund to my credit card, and will have to transfer it through the bank. They requested my banking information and passport ID through email. Waited patiently for over a week, and still no reply. I contacted them on the phone today and the agent was kind enough to escalate the refund request but stated that it could take another 2-3 weeks for everything to be resolved. That will be close to a month and half since my initial request.

### "one of my worse experiences flying"
Not Verified |  First of all, it's impossible to accomplish anything beyond purchasing the ticket. I tried to upgrade my ticket for over a month. Everything on the website is in Spanish with no option to change the language. They charged me double the rate to check my bag. The representatives at the airport could be a lot nicer. The flight attendants were rude and on a 7 hour flight, there is no tv or entertainment. Needless to say, I will never fly this airline again. it was definitely one of my worse experiences flying and I am on my third passport so that should say a lot.

### "customer service of this airline is the worst ever"
Not Verified | I hate wasting my time giving ugly reviews. But, this is just other people don’t waste their time with this airline. The customer service of this airline is the worst ever, when you asked to speak with a manager they say there’s no manager. I have been asking for a refund of my accidental charges for extra luggage. It was charged 3 additional times for the same thing on 6/27/2021 is a year and a half later and they still can’t fix my issue. I have them all the information they have asked (charge dates, times, bank statement, etc) but nothing.

### "flight was cancelled without any explanation or recourse"
I booked a flight from Paris to Bogota via London in September 2022. The first flight was operated by British Airways but I booked the whole trip on the Avianca website. 5 hours before my flight, I was informed that the first flight from Paris to London was cancelled, without any explanation or recourse. So I obviously couldn't take my second flight from London to Bogota. After spending all day on the phone, Avianca was unable to find me another flight and ended up telling me to take another flight myself, and that they would reimburse me for the initial flight. I was only refunded 100€ out of 500€, without any explanation.

### "Will avoid this airline at all costs"
The check in was horrible. Couldn’t get the booking ticket myself online. So after showing my booking and reference number to the check in counter they said they have to charge me extra to check me in. They literally want to charge me extra if I don’t do their job of checking in for them. Almost missed my flight. Check in should be free and check in associates should be able to perform their job as stated in their name without extra fee. Ridiculous. The flights never brought water or food. And in 2022 please put a monitor on the seat in front of me. It should be well within the budget for aircraft now a days with the price spikes in our tickets. As all airlines prepare to have your knees in the seat in front of you if your 5’10’’ or taller. Wouldn’t have gone out of my way to write this if they just checked me in and did their job. Will avoid this airline at all costs and make sure to be vocal about their bad business.

### "recommend Volaris next time"
We called the call center to try and change a reservation only to discover the call center had us on hold the whole time and also charged us per minute more than 200 dollars to never coming on the line and assist us with the request. Definitely will only fly and recommend Volaris next time.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Slow, inefficient, terrible customer service. The only airline without a bag drop area took well over an hour to do a very simple bag drop. Agents were needlessly rude. Were not able to add my ktn to my boarding pass even though I have global entry.

### "Terrible seats"
Terrible seats, no entertainment at all. The cheapest as possible is what you get with seats that don’t even incline, no screen to tell travel progress.

### "very bad experience with Avianca"
Not Verified | I had a very bad experience with Avianca in which I bought a flight from Houston to Peru for November 18-26 2022 and I received an email saying that the flight had been changed immediately call the airline in which I don't have much flexibility and they told me that they could give me a refund since they were giving me so many long hours of flight 20 hours of travel and a short time of stay since it was changed leaving Sunday arriving Monday afternoon and returning Friday. The person told me that they will give you a refund and it will take a month, I had no problem with that, but how long are you going to fill out the information? They ask you for so many things, it has already been three weeks and they continue to ask for information and nothing they tell you that it is already done. processed - be very careful before going to buy flights with Avianca since they do NOT tell you that your flight can change at any time and long flight hours. And if it goes Going through the refund problem is a long wait and nothing at all. I have traveled on other airlines and I have never had problems with reimbursement, it has been easy and fast. Realmente e tenido una experiencia muy mala con Avianca en la cual compre un vuelo de Houston a peru para Noviembre del 18-26 022 en y recibí un correo electrónico diciendo que el vuelo había sido cambiado inmediatamente llame a la aerolínea en la cual no tengo mucha flexibilidad y me dijeron que me podían dar un reembolso ya que me estaban dando tantas largas horas de vuelo 20 horas de viaje y un corto tiempo de estadía ya que fue cambiado saliendo domingo llegando lunes por la tarde y regresando viernes. La persona me dijo se te va a dar un reembolso y se demorará un mes, no tenia problema de eso pero cuánto vas a llenar la información te piden tanta cosas ya an pasado tres semana a y siguen pidiendo información y nada que te dicen que ya está procesado… tengan mucho cuidado antes de ir a comprar vuelos con avianca ya que NO te dicen que tu vuelo puede hacer cambiando en cualquier momento y largas horas de vuelo. Y si va. A pasar por el problema de reembolso es una larga espera y nada de nada. Eh viajado en otras aerolíneas y nunca e tenido problemas de reembolso a sido fácil y rápido.

### "not be flying Avianca again"
We were given the wrong information at the airport by Avianca employees & manager regarding documentation, resulting in a missed flight for my aunt, who is elderly, when she returned with the additional documentation Avianca told her it was not needed, at this point Avianca required her to buy a new flight because she listened to the information provided by Avianca employees, the ticket being offered to her was over 1,000USD, thankfully my younger sister googled flights on her phone and was able to buy her a flight for under 300USD. Avianca took no responsibility over the situation and we were forced to buy 2 additional tickets, according to them, although she had the original return flight already purchased it was no longer valid because she had missed the departure flight (because she listened to Avianca staff) which made no sense to us. There was no apology for the misinformation shared by Avianca at any point. Not only that, we were on the phone over 4 hours to no avail. I will not be flying Avianca again. Also the food on the plane was horrible. & on the departure flight the entertainment screen did not work.

### "going from bad to worse"
I do not recommend this airline that is going from bad to worse with the services that they offer to their clients and now with those changes that they made to size the tickets as if they were shirts that one is buying. In case the service was already lousy and now they take away the opportunity to buy tickets in business class they are going to treat you worse. No recomiendo esta aerolínea que va de mal en peor con los servicios que le ofrecen a sus clientes y ahora con esos cambios que hicieron de ponerles tallas a los tickets como si fueran camisas las que uno está comprando. De por si ya estaba pésimo el servicio y ahora quitan la oportunidad de comprar tickets en clase ejecutiva lo van a tratar peor a uno.

### "Never flying with this airline again"
Never flying with this airline again. I booked a ticket from Santa Marta to bogota, I received a booking confirmation email stating that my payment was approved, an Eticket receipt, and my itinerary on the Avianca app. However, when I arrived at the airport I was refused boarding since apparently my payment wasn’t received and my ticket was never reserved. I never received a cancellation email from Avianca and there was no way that I could have known that my ticket was not reserved. The airline crew members tried to help me book another ticket for later that evening, but the Avianca site was not working, I tried to use three different credit cards, all of which were rejected for no apparent reason (these credit cards are international and my bank confirmed that there was no problem with the credit cards). I ended up taking out money from the ATM and paying the airline crew members directly to board the last flight of the night. I cannot stress how important it was for me to arrive in Bogota at the scheduled time, and this delay made me miss my ride to Anapoima and required me to book a hostel in bogota for the night. I also can’t explain how stressful it is to be randomly refused boarding, even after showing them the different receipts I received that verified my purchase. Still have no idea what the problem was and why they couldn’t inform me that my ticket was canceled… I sent them a complaint asking them for compensation and received an automated bot response. (I would like to note that the airline crew at Avianca tried their best to help and I really appreciated their assistance, particularly Darcy Forero and Lorraine Sanches).

### "really disappointed with this airline"
Houston to El Salvador. Typically I don’t do reviews for anything! But I’m really disappointed with this airline. I think most people know about Avianca this is the WORST airline I ever flown with!! Please people don’t ever fly with them this is worst then Spirit at least Spirit specifies that they charge for everything you’re aware of! But this airline hide the charges! Worst ever! !

### "they can not fulfil the tickets"
Sao Paulo to Pereira via Bogota. It seems like a lot of people here went through the same situation. I should have read the reviews before booking with this company. Bought a ticket in their website in 12/21/2021 for $2692.64 to have my parents fly from Brazil to Colombia. They processed the payment but didn't issue the tickets, three days later they emailed me saying they can not fulfil the tickets from that origin city (even though their website booked it). They advised me to book it from a different city so I went back to the site and booked it and had paid for that flight. So as of today 09/22/2022 after long phone calls (at least 3 a month) and many forms later submitted, usually the same forms again and again because they never have it, I am still out of $2692.64.

### "proof of an active yellow fever vaccine"
This is the second and last time that I have flown Avianca. The first was in early 2020 and we were upsold at every opportunity, including being told my personal item (laptop bag) needed to be paid for. On this occasion, country hopping across South America, Avianca implement a requirement for proof of an active yellow fever vaccine to board flights from Brazil to Colombia. In the months leading up to the flight, I was bombarded with emails about upgrading my flight but not a single one mentioning that they would be demanding this at the airport. The check-in agents at the airport said they would try to help then slinked off without even indicating that they were not able to or advising on what to do. Eventually I was able to speak to an agent who was incredibly rude but eventually said to call the customer service helpline. I did this, attempting to re-route my flights to stop at another country and on 6 occasions the agent would ask me to hold the line while they looked into the options and then the line would get disconnected. My signal was great and it happened with multiple agents so I know it is a deflection tactic that they were employing. In the end I had to figure out a new plan that couldn't even rely on using any of the flight credits. Horrible airline, staff and aggressive approach to taking your money in any way possible. T

### "Worse airline ever"
Worse airline ever, They double charge and don't reimburse. No kind of assistance at the airport and placed me as no show even though i was there for about 2hours arguing because they wanted me to purchase a ticket for my 2months old baby and i agreed but then they wanted me to cancel my ticket and purchase another again and moreover there were no more flights for that time. They charged me 80USD for a carryon and 79 for extra baggage and still didn't put me on the flight. So all that money went down the drain.

### "worst ever customer service"
My flight changed drastically I was entitled to a refund, I called and emailed Avianca combined no fewer than 75x to get my money back, but in order to have a refund, I need to fill several forms wait forever for a response and they keep saying I need additional information that I've provided ten times before. This company is awful - the worst ever customer service. I flew them one and I will say it was fine, but any issues/changes, beware.

### "Forget about this airline please"
Not Verified | If you searching for cheap ticket and you see this airline coming up please don't do it, because it will cost you as much as business class! They charged me $230 just for a small carry on and the plane they haven't outlets for phone charges! Forget about this airline please.

### "Terrible customer service"
Orlando to Sao Paulo via Bogota. Avianca sells in a very easy lounge service for the clients who will have a long connection throughout Bogotá. My son paid for the service, and there is no information regarding lounge usage time. I arrived in Bogotá at 6:20pm (09/10) and Avianca prohibited me to use the lounge until 4:00am (09/11), because my flight is in the next day at 6:14am (09/11). Believe or not. I called Avianca to get my money back, but in order to have a refund, I need to fill several forms wait forever for a response. This company is not serious. For me this lounge service is almost like a scam. Terrible customer service.

### "I would not trust this airline"
I paid extra to get a refundable ticket - but when I tried to refund, Avianca took me down this long, complicated form which asked for all of my bank information and a form to verify my banking status. Now, I've never been asked these questions before, typically if a company charges you, they have your information on file for a refund. I tried calling customer service and got an endless busy signal. SO, I guess the machine ate my money. Moral of the story, I would not trust this airline, even with a refundable ticket.

### "Do not use this airline"
Not Verified |  The worst airline. used on April 2022, I had previously pay my baggage fee with my ticket, when I got to the airport they could not find the baggage payment, I pay $ 130.00 the fist time, at the airport they charged me extra $ 305.00, so i ended paying $435.00 just for the baggage, I did a complaint the following week, up to 5 month they have not done any thing, they just contacted me 1 time asking for proof of my payments, I did send the proof of payment, never heard from them any more, I e-mail them a couple of times, they ignore my e-mails and never respond. Do not use this airline, save your self money and time, you will lose money with them.

### "One step above a scam"
One step above a scam. Our first flight out we showed up over 3 hours early to the terminal. The boarding crew announced that everyone needed to get in line and print out their boarding passes, no electronic passes would be allowed on the plane (suspicious already). When we got to the front of the hour long line, the boarding attendant asked us for our Peruvian COVID affidavit (something that can be filled out at your destination). When we said we didn't fill it out yet, they told us we would not be able to board the flight, as the affidavit needed to be filled out >48 hours before any flight (if you check the embassy requirements it needs to be LESS than 48 hours beforehand, obviously since its basically a symptom survey). We showed them the embassy page and they refused to believe us and pretended not to understand. The whole time they were having a side conversation in Spanish talking about how the plane was overbooked. Us gringos must've looked like an easy target, but unfortunately we were all fluent in Spanish. They sent us running all around pretending to help us until the flight took off (yes, 2 hours of sending us on errands), then told us we were out of luck. At this point we got angry and called them out on blatantly screwing us since they overbooked their flight. They originally tried to simply kick us off the plane and out the door, but we managed to make them book us another flight the next day (>48 hours beforehand, huh??). We missed a full day of our trip and wasted hundreds of dollars on missed hotel, ubers, not to mention the hours wasted in the airport. On the return trip, they cancelled two of our 'seats'. They said we had tickets, but no 'seats'. They tried to kick us off the return flight too, and made one of us get an onsite COVID test, even though this person had gotten and recovered from COVID as per the US embassy requirements. Even after getting their COVID test done on site, they were told they had no 'seat' and would have to shell out hundreds of dollars for first class if they wanted to board the flight. This friend had to resort to crying to manipulate the shady Avianca agents into letting her sit in her assigned, purchased seat. I spent hours on customer care the night before, each time getting to an automated line in the end that would 'call back in an hour', then the callback would be silent, tell me it couldn't understand me, and say 'try again in an hour'. Some sort of time-wasting bot to avoid having actual customer service. I tried both the Spanish and English Customer service lines. Luckily, I didn't 'need' to get a COVID test, but they did harass me and request tons of random personal information at their desk as well as ask me for multiple unnecessary affidavits (which I filled out this time, expecting a repeat of their antics) before reluctantly giving me a boarding pass. In the terminal for our return flight, I tried to request assistance in unloading since our layover was very short, and the boarding assistant tried to CANCEL my flight, since i 'seemed worried about the layover'. Then she wouldn't hand my ticket back until I had re-proved I had my affidavits and COVID test etc. They also came around the terminal and checked a ton of people's bags due to limited cabin space (not completely unusual, but added to the stress especially given our layover). TLDR: Borderline criminal airline, avoid at all costs

### "the worst airline I have flown with"
First came the surprise that I had to pay around $15 per person for checking in unless I checked in online so I told the agent I would check in online. When I tried to do this it said the action was closed and didn’t give me the option to check in so I had to pay the check in for my girlfriend and myself and then the agent told me I had to pay for small carry on bag which is the first time in my 20 plus years of flying I ever had to pay for a carry on. To top everything off I compared how much my friend paid for his checked luggage at the counter that was 50lbs and told me $19.33 while I paid around $22 for a small 10kg bag. After finding this out I went to talk to a supervisor and told me there was nothing he could do. By far Avianca is the worst airline I have flown with. If it’s not for their outrageous fees and charges for things other airlines don’t charge it’s their terrible customer service with their unwillingness to help.

### "furious over the baggage fees"
Panama to Punta Cana via Bogota. I am furious over the baggage fees charged by Avianca. We checked one bag under 23 kg and each had one small carry on size under 10 kg and proper size. The round trip airfare for two was $800. The baggage fees were $510. To make matters worse the checked bag was damaged upon arrival. I asked for a partial refund for the carry on size bags and was was refused. I have never been charged by any airline for a small carry on size bag to easily fit in overhead compartments. I WILL NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN! Also on one leg of the trip the rows of seats were so close that none of the seats could recline.

### "I will never go with them again"
Not Verified |  I was going to Columbia, nonstop ticket and Colombian company. I was happy to go with them until I face the reality of Avianca. I had terrible experience with them. When I talk to them on the phone to get information about my ticket they were not able to answer my questions, they are not well informed. They will try to find a reason to charge you extra money. They did not let us to take carry-on bag in the plane, at the end we did but we had to fight for it. Their seats are not comfortable. The food service was terrible. I will never go with them again. I’m willing to pay more and get a normal human being treatment.

### "Avianca has been sliding down"
Not Verified |  For years I preferred the ease of non-stop flights from DC to San Salvador with TACA (before merging with Avianca), and yes TACA was not perfect but their flight attendants were very good, same with the food and alcoholic drinks, and, again, the convenience of a non-stop flight made it the best choice over other carriers. Ever since the merger, Avianca has been sliding down on their service both sales and flight attendants. Food was not as good, then the pandemic came and they did away with the food service. So now, there is no business class, meaning no comfortable seats on a 4 and a half hour red-eye flight. So now the only thing they have going on for them is the direct flight ... wonder how long that is going to last as there are now other lower fare airline, Volaris, or maybe this is what Avianca is becoming. I for one, will certainly start looking at other options.

### "customer service is non existent"
Not Verified |  Avianca cancelled all three long haul ticket for my wife and two small children with only 2 weeks notice. They wouldn't even help find alternative flights and we had to rebook (with them actually) for £7000. Still my wife had to fly alone with two small children as they would not change my ticket either. They have so far refused to refund the new flights. Their customer service is non existent, it's literally people who seem to have no training reading from a script. They don't even respond to your questions properly. I waited 1.5 hours for someone to answer on one occasion. I must have spent 10 - 15 hours dealing with this, now it is with our insurance company.

### "Business class amenities were non existent"
I’d heard about Avianca’s troubles but I never imagined that the onboard experience would have deteriorated as much as it has. Other than a bit more space, Business class amenities were non existent. Beverages offered were water, apple juice, coffee, or tea. The one meal was a very bad turkey sandwich and chips and a popsicle. There was very limited inflight entertainment on the outbound flight, and none on the return (for a 5 hr. Flight).

### "stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  Worst ground and flight experience in years with Avianca. I cannot understand how a good airline of five years ago can become such a poor quality airline. We paid for Business Class, nonexistent because seats simply were slightly larger. Seats were in poor uncomfortable shape in our first flight. On board service was non existent. Food was awful in every flight ( a plastic wrapped soggy sandwich, a couple of cookies and drinks were non existent, a low quality coffee or a bottle of water) for five to six hour flights. Questionable Service with Pilot cabin door open and a Food trolley car across the corridor, disabling the bathroom use. They sent us in tiny uncomfortable narrow seats from Miami to Bogota, hiding the change of flight and at the Counter when discovered that Business Class was nonexistent, Avianca Counter Head Clerk stated they would reimburse the difference in three days, a complete lie because when requested after two weeks of no reimbursement, Avianca Claims refused to fulfill prior promises. Flying with Avianca was the worst part of a great trip. We wish other travelers a better choice of airline, if you wish a pleasant trip, stay away from this airline, because no bargain offer if any, is worth this very negative experience.

### "the worst experience we had"
Not Verified |  We as family decided to go to Colombia for the first time. Beautiful country but the airline is the worst experience we had as family. On our way back to New York, we were at the line to board the plane and once we got there the attendant said there is no more room in the airplane. I was like I wasn't sure if she was talking to us since she saw that we're right there. I smiled and said not we were not, we are right here. Short story, they made us lose our flight and said that our flight tickets can not be changed for another flight and we have to buy new tickets. At that point I wasn't sure if that was true, first the supervisor was extremely rude and he only said "sorry there is nothing I can do. We always over sell our flight for 10 extra seats in case there is people that are not on time. We were by the door getting ready to board how can we be late. He said "sorry nothing else I can do it's a policy of the airline and you will have to buy new tickets. so I asked him how much and he said $3500 dollars to go back home. At the end we bought the tickets back home and have to pay $2500 dollars to come back home.

### "our worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Lima to Frankfurt via Bogota & London. Never use this airline. We have just made our worst experience ever. After booking our flight via Expedia (Lima - Frankfurt), we wanted to add one big luggage for the price we could see during the booking process. It turned out that Avianca was unable to add that luggage because we had to change airplane in London - every airline on this world is able to book a luggage from the origin to the destination, but Avianca is not. The website does not work at all. We could not reach anyone on the phone. Finally, Expedia connected us with the Avianca staff, but they revealed themselves as totally incompetent, being unable to provide us with any information. Additionally, they offered a much higher price ($130), telling us this was due to calling them instead of booking via their website - but that website does not work. We call this a fraud. At the end, we had to cancel our flight and paid much more money for another airline - but believe us, it was worth it!

### "inform me that passport was deemed damaged"
Not Verified |  Trip from Cancun to Costa Rica, It was the time for check in luggage. Well first of all I travelled from Belize to Chetumal Quintana Roo with no problem. But at that airport (Cancun) the attendant inform me that passport was deemed damaged. I pass through Belize and Chetumal immigration without a hitch. The attendant continued by telling me that she contacted someone from Costa Rica and they said they would not let me in. She personally showed me the WhatsApp conversation. I asked for a documentation to state such so I can used as proof. She said she can’t forward the WhatsApp to me but can give me my ticket approval number. A supervisor came up to me to also inform me of such. Attendant should not be the one to say who is to travel they are to process ticket.

### "shocked by the way we were treated"
Not Verified |  I am absolutely shocked by the way we were treated today at Bogota Airport. The flight from PEI to BGT was on time. The thought it would be delayed but we made it on time for our connection. We ran from the plane to the gate number 71. in the same area. 2. We were on time at the gate but were denied access. We were not told why. We were completely ignored by the staff. Our three year old started crying. They closed the doors after fifteen minutes. So we would have had plenty of time. The supervisor told us that the decision was made before. But why? Why cant we go on the flight then? No explanation. We were given the most awful hotel in Bogota, the Habitel. The food; the service, the room. This is not even a 2 star rating, I have to fight for a piece of bread for my daughter. Because of the unprofessional staff of Avianca we are paying our hotel in Leticia for nothing.

### "worst experience I've ever had"
I've flown all different airlines around the world, from the USA, Europe, Africa, Caribbean, and South America. Avianca has been the worst experience I've ever had. I booked through Expedia and was automatically given an XS fare due to it being the only fare available. I've never flown this airline before, and had no idea about how the fares worked. I figured I could pay extra to upgrade my fare eventually like any other airline I've flown. Several weeks on the phone with Avianca customer support, and almost every agent I spoke to did not speak English at all, or well. I was unable to get any help from their support team. Emails never received a response. Due to the 24 hour window for refund expiring, I was locked in and had no choice but to take this flight. $1082 total for 2 tickets, on a 1 hour and 30 minutes flight, which did not include checked bags. I paid $70 online for the discounted checked luggage, and upon arrival at the airport was told I could not board unless I paid the full price of $161 for our checked bags. I explained that I paid already, and showed the transaction in my bank. They refused to listen, so I had to pay the extra $161 in order to board. The supervisor gave me a receipt and told me to get a refund once we landed. Once we landed we did as instructed, but we were told that they do not give refunds. After speaking to another supervisor she said I needed to get the refund through my bank. We came to colombia due to a K1 Visa. The embassy took long to process the visa and we could not reschedule the flight due to the XS fare. The $500+ ticket was wasted, and to make matters worse, I purchased the $70 bags online for this flight. $500+$161+70 thrown away for no good reason at all. I chose to fly back with Wingo which provides flight flexibility for $21, and includes checked bags for a similar price. This has got to be one of the most corrupt airlines in the world! Save yourself the nightmare and stress, do some research or pay a little extra. I chose to do some research and am now paying much less to fly back with a better airline.

### "The only flight I've ever missed"
Avianca went from being the best airline to worst than Spirit or any low cost airline. The only flight I've ever missed in my whole life (30+ years of flying several times a yr) because their check in took 2.5 hours. They also have hundreds of dollars of hidden fees, from printing your ticket to preventing you from taking a carry on bag. I've flown Spirit and Frontier dozens of times and know all about hidden costs so I always plan accordingly. But Avianca engages in false marketing, as their ticket says you can bring a carry on bag in economy but at the gate they will slap you with $120. Their tickets are not even cheap to start with. You could not pay me to use Avianca again.

### "charged my debit card three times"
They charged my debit card three times Finally, the transaction went through and they issued a plane ticket At 12 am they sent an email they have cancelled my ticket. Transactions went through and I am currently in a fight with my bank to get my funds back for the ticket they charged and cancelled.

### "deceptive with their hidden costs"
They will offer the cheapest flight options but they are extremely cunning and deceptive with their hidden costs. You will end up paying more! Guaranteed! I paid a fare of approx $225 pp but ended up paying an additional $150usd because I was a foreigner and only nationals can pay the fare that I had. The irony is, an Avianca agent booked this for me with my credit card and at no point did they mention any of this - to add insult to injury, I had to pay another $15 usd to print out my boarding pass when their website was not allowing me to process my online checkin. I showed the agent on how I was able to fill out all the online information to process my web checkin but when it got to the last page, the screen just hung and froze. She just shrugged her shoulders and said that I have to pay $165 usd. Either I take my chances and keep trying or I pay the fee to board the flight. At the gate, the agent said that I was on an S category ticket and had to pay for my carry on. I showed him that I was booked on M and he made me search for validation and ended up saying that I could not board without paying an additional $100 usd for my luggage. So the total fare ended up costing approx $600 usd which would have been better off paying much less with a more reputable airline such as Latam or Viva.

### "an uncalled for situation"
Not Verified |  After securing a place for my carryon in the above compartment, i sat in my seat and waited for take off. About 5 min later the stewardess took my carryon down and handed it to me. She replaced my carryon with another persons suitcase. When I pointed out that i already had a personal item below the seat in front of me and that the bag she handed to me was my carryon. She told me they have no space for carryon and walked off. I was left holding my carryon on my lap for the duration of the flight. My carryon gymbag is smaller than some of the other carryons on the flight. However my ticket assures that i would be able to stow that item. I am beyond annoyed and irritated with not only the i convenience of holding my bag but the rudeness of the stewardess. This was an uncalled for situation

### "told me that my ticket was in fact refunded"
I a purchased for 2 flight tickets from Miami to Medellin (round trip). A few weeks later I had a great job opportunity that was preventing me to go on the trip, I called Avianca support and I was told that the ticket was non-refundable and that no changes could be made. They also gave me the option to do a form online but that it would be of no use. However, I made the request form and submitted. The representative told me that I was going to get a response in the following days, a few days went by and I had no response. so I had to call once again to see what was the status on the request. I was told one more time that there was nothing they could do and that I had to take that flight, so I decided to cancel my business plans and go on the trip. On the day of the flight, when I got to the airport I went to do my check in and was told that my ticket was refunded and that I was unable to flight. I called Avianca support once again, and the representative told me that my booking was still valid and that there was no issue with the ticket, so I decided to go over to the front of the cashier at the airport and passed the phone over to the employee that was doing checkins, she told me that my ticket was in fact refunded and that’s when the person on the phone realized that my ticket was not in the system. I proceed to ask the representative about the refund and he stated that it was deposit on my account on June 8th, so I went and checked my transactions to make things worst , I was only refunded the amount for the taxes. So, out of a $386.57 ticket I received only $127, with no confirmation of my refund, never even received any emails with the prove or receipt. At the airport all I could do was ask for help, but to no surprise I got no concrete response on how I could solve my issue. I had to go online my self and pray that there was still a ticket available on that flight. Ironically enough, there was just 1 more ticket available.. probably the same one that was “refunded”. I had to spend $429.80 for a one way trip from Miami to Medellin. And not to mention the return flight ticket that I had to purchase for another $465.99  for the return flight to Miami, which I find only fair for Avainca to take full responsibility for.

### "I will never use Avianca again"
Worst customer service. I originally booked to go to El Salvador on August 4 and head back to MIA on 08/09 and purchased only 3 baggage, 2 for my husband (going and coming back) and only one for me (to go to El Salvador) which was purchased on May 19 a couple days later. But Avianca changed my flight so we had to change the new date to go to El Salvador to July 29. Once the changes were made, we noticed a week later none of the baggage were added. So I called customer services several times in one day because the call would always drop. After the 3rd attempt, they were able to find only the baggage that were purchased for my husband but not mine. They did an internal investigation and concluded it was never found. I sent them proof of purchase from my bank statement to an email they provided "[email protected]" and no response as of today. I called several times and there excuse to me to keep calling back because there system is currently down. I will never use Avianca again. I will say one thing positive, the cabin staff were very friendly and helpful and did provide beverages and sandwhich, no charge. But I do not recommend Avianca at all!

### "do not give me the full refund"
Terrible service with AVIANCA, I bought some flights for my parents, they were canceled by the airline on 02/15/2021 and to this day they still do not give me the full refund. I sent a claim and they answered me about 2 months later with an advisor and then with another, in the end only the tax refund was made. I sent another claim and it took me another 2 months to see a response and they tell me that it has already been returned to me! and they send me a photo of what has been returned to me... being that I claimed the entire amount. Does it really seem like they don't even read my emails and I get these kinds of responses months later? They tell me that I should have done it a year after the flights and so I did, they have problems with their website and they never have access to the requests. The only thing I am requesting is the return of what I have already paid. Pesimo servicio con AVIANCA, compre para mis papas unos vuelos, fueron cancelados por parte de la aerolinea el 15/02/2021 y hasta el día de hoy siguen sin darme la totalidad del rembolso. Mandé un reclamo y me contestaron como 2 meses después con un asesor y luego con otro, al final solo se hizo la devolucion de los impuestos. Mandé otro reclamo y tardé otros 2 meses en ver respuesta y me contestan que ya se me devolvió! y me mandan foto de lo que se me ha devuelto... siendo que yo reclamaba la totalidad. De verdad parece que ni siquiera leen mis correos y recibo este tipo de respuestas meses después? Me dicen que debi de hacerlo un año despues de los vuelos y asi lo hice, tienen problemas con su web y nunca tienen acceso a las solicitudes. Lo unico que estoy solicitando es la devolución de lo que ya he pagado.

### "charge you $120 for every single item"
Not Verified |  Beware of the size of your personal carry on. At the counter they will pass the measurements but boarding the plane they become extremely picky, and charge you $120 for every single item; even kids toys. What a rip off.

### "no customer service"
There are too many issues that my family of 7 had experienced across different legs of our family vacation. First, they will move your itinerary and charge you additional fees for luggage. They will also charge you an additional $150USD each way for purchasing an XS or S when you’re a foreigner and that it’s only reserved for nationals. Their website will not allow you to check in online and cause you to ask the ticket counter to print a boarding pass and charge you $15usd to print, they will stop you before you get on the gate while other passengers are waiting in line to board the plane holding you hostage and demanding that your fare does not include carry on luggage. We had to show them validation of payment before they were able to release us. When they change your flight itinerary and you can no longer travel due to the flight change, they will not give you a refund or offer an alternative because their call centre agents don’t pick up the phone. After waiting three hours to speak to an agent, they’d either hang up or transfer you to another agent that can speak English where you’d have to wait another three hours to get an agent. By the time you’re done waiting, you’re just so exhausted that you cut your losses and purchase a new ticket without seeking reimbursement. I can go on and on with over 25 different issues. Hidden costs, no customer service, lack of integrity, small print disclaimers on completely bs items, where we paid almost triple the original fair due to these hidden costs.

### "airline is absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  This airline is absolutely horrible. The website doesn’t work. The customer service is nonexistent. They don’t refund your money even when they say that your tickets are refundable. Don't bother trying to make a change in your itinerary. Is next to impossible to do so. They “lose“ your receipt of payment and supposedly don’t have them in the computer system. You can just an airline by how long the customer service line is at the airport. Avoid them at all cost. They don’t serve alcohol on their airplanes.

### "when you need help, they don't deliver"
San Jose to Toronto. After purchasing 5 business class tickets for my family I am trying to change the an existing reservation online through the Avianca website, it doesn't work. Then picked up the phone to call their 'support center' and press the English - 2 option. Spoke with 2 different customers agents and while they tried to help, they can not change the existing reservation, which requires a transfer to the 'Expert'. The Expert doesn't speak English and transfer me back to the beginning of the call. This is Avianca customer services, when you need help, they don't deliver. I am 2 million mile road warrior and have status on major airlines, visited and worked in 42 countries. This is the worst support that I have ever experience. Why can you buy the air route on Kayak but the Avianca's customer service representatives don't have access to change your flight and "the Expert" refuses to find anyone that can help. Wasted 30 mins of my life with this airline. Suggest anyone to stay away from this airline. If I can give a rate below 0, I would.

### "a bad experience due to delay"
We flew to San Jose  via El Salvador. Since the flight got delayed from San Francisco to El Salvador, we have to stay at the airport for the whole day at El Salvador. We got lounge access at El Salvador until the evening 6:00 p.m. The connecting flight was at 9:00 pm. We got the flight from El Salvador to San Jose. The flight landed at midnight. Since the delay in flights, our car rental was closed for the night so we have to stay at the airport for 7 hours. All hotel reservations were closed at that time. Since we have to stay at the airport. We got so tired. It was a bad experience due to delay in flight and there was no connecting flight available soon and no accommodation was offered at San Jose when it landed in the midnight.

### "my checked bag never made it"
I had a connecting flight in Bogota to Washington D.C with an hour and 15 minutes layover. However, immigration line extremely long and painfully slow at 7 am. There was no airport employee to be found and I ended up cutting the line myself because I knew I was going to cut it very close to my 7:50 am flight. I ran to my gate to find out they plane had already departed (30 mins before departure time) and there were a dozen other passengers who were in my exact same shoes. After running around the airport for an hour trying to speak to someone, they finally directed us back out to the counter where they had told us the next flight out was the following day, exact time. They gave us hotel, lunch, & dinner. Okay, no biggie it was Saturday I was very frustrated but at least it was accommodated. Waited 3 hours at the hotel to finally be ready and crashed. The following day I get up nice and early and board my plane and flew home to D.C to find my checked bag never made it. Looked like I wasn't the only one with the issue because there were 3 other individuals barking at the employee at the same time. They said IF they find it they would ship it to my address (3 hours away). 5 days later I get a suitcase that does not belong to me. It does not describe anything that was handwritten on the report (color, size, locks, etc.) and it even had another name on the handle tag. I am beyond myself at this point that my luggage is still lost and they sent me what is not mine. Honestly, this as been the worst customer service/flying experience of my life. I will never fly with Avianca again. When you call, you get transferred 10 times no one answers your question. They make you file claims online that most likely will never get resolved. All my keepsakes from the wedding are irreplaceable. All the new pieces of clothing and items I had purchased are probably lost gone as well if someone didn't steal them yet. I have no updated via email, text, phone call - utterly irresponsible of the airline.

### "poor customer service"
Heartless, money-grabbing policies and poor customer service. I understand you can put things in writing where people purchasing economy airfare relinquish their ability to reschedule their flight without fees, but you’d think that a $422 one-way 6-hour flight pre-purchased 1.5 months ahead of time, made by someone who’s flown with you before, who has had a family emergency where their father had a heart attack and is undergoing life-saving surgery, you would morally think charging them $962 dollars in penalties to reschedule their flight to same day is a little heartless and unethical, when there were open economy seats available on 3 flights leaving that same day. But no, I have to pay almost $1,000 in fees and penalties to upgrade myself to first class just to be able to change my flight since you treat S and XS ticket holders like trash. Icing on the cake is that you can clearly see on Google flights that it would only cost $600 for a one-way ticket if I’d wait 2 days to fly out. Their website is not user friendly, the customer hotline was very unhelpful, and I was told the supervisor didn’t have time to talk to me or there wasn't one available. My experience was similar when talking to the customer service department at the Managua Airport in Nicaragua and that a manager was unavailable. I was obviously pretty stressed and as a non-native Spanish speaker it was difficult to try and explain my situation in Spanish, but even when a bilingual American tried to help me they still weren’t willing to budge. Lastly their staff seems to be completely incompetent telling me I need to pay them $1200, when I can clearly do it online and get a result of $962 (still ridiculous). I highly recommend you choose another airline instead who would understand an emergency situation like this and not make it about squeezing you for over 300% of your original ticket price for a same-day flight.

### "This is the most stressed I’ve ever been for a flight"
This is one of the worst airline experiences ever, on the way to Bogotá and on the way back home to Chicago. I thought TAP Air Portugal was terrible, never fly with them either if you can help it, but Avianca definitely takes the crown for the most asinine airline I’ve ever had to fly with, and I fly at least 12+ times per year. We booked our tickets directly with Avianca over the phone with a voucher that we had from a trip that was cancelled due to the pandemic. Without making it clear over the phone or notifying us, they made our return flight from Bogota to Washington Dulles airport and had us go 1 hour away to Washington Reagan airport to connect to our flight back home to Chicago O’Hare. We had to run all the way to get to customs in time - did I mention I’m disabled? Then, we had to take a $50 Lyft all the way to Reagan airport, I’m writing this review in the Lyft as we speak. After being given the run-around by United (who our connecting flight is with) & Avianca ticketing agents at the counters, we only have 1.5 hours to make it to Reagan, check-in &, drop off our luggage, make it through security, and get to our gate. This is the most stressed I’ve ever been for a flight. Keeping my fingers crossed we make it to the gate in time. Next time, I will spend the extra money to fly with Delta or another slightly more reliable airline.

### "Absolute worst airline service"
I have flown numerous times with Avianca for business between Chile and Ecuador and the service continues to get worse with each flight - I have only been flying with Avianca because they are a Star Alliance partner. This was my 1st flight with them for a family vacation,2 adults & 3 teenagers - what a disaster. Great check in at the Santiago Airport and then just downhill from there. I am sure glad we were flying business class, terrible in flight service and lost luggage to top it all off. Filed a lost baggage claim and then Avianca seems to think that its ok that they do not have to reply or do anything of any sort to resolve the issues with the lost baggage for 15 days after the date the claim was filed. Absolute worst airline service I have experienced to date and do not recommend anyone travels with Avianca ever - terrible airline from top to bottom, last flight with these guys.

### "Business class is a joke"
Not Verified |  Business class is a joke. You get a box with a bottle of water, peanuts and a stale, bagged sandwich, same as the regular cabin. No blankets or any other type of drunks. No entertainment services at all. The old planes do not have charging ports so you can’t even play your own movies for long. We were forced to take Avianca due to Covid problems in Nicaragua. Avianca refused to refund the money paid for the business upgrade. It is a nightmare to call them and wait four minutes for everything. They refuse to let you speak with a supervisor.

### "has taken the low cost approach"
I've been flying this route before Avianca merged with TACA for the past 15 years. I used to enjoy flying Avianca compared to any American airline. Sadly this airline started going downhill in 2019 when they announced they were bankrupt, the service started to get reduced but was still good compared to what they offer today. After covid, this airline has taken the low cost approach. What they pass as "business" class is a complete joke. The same food they give to economy is the same meal they give to business. They no longer give you alcohol at all, nothing during the boarding process either. No blankets, pillows or kit. All of that is gone. You have to ask the FAs for any other drink which is boxed juice or coffee, some cans of coca cola or small bottles of water. The Flight Attendants were still nice like they always have been but they are noticeably not as visible as they used to. Not once did they check up on me during the flight like the used to, the lead FA did not introduce themselves to us either. Before covid they would greet us by name and ask if we wanted anything to drink or anything else. It looks like they are getting rid of business class altogether soon so I guess they don't care about business class customers at this point. It looks like they returned all their newer planes and only kept the older TACA fleet probably since they have already been paid off at this point. The first leg of my trip was on a newer A319 from 2014. But I got stuck with the same old A320 on the rest of my legs and this plane was from 2004. On one of the flights, the FA made an announcement that due to covid they were not going to have any in flight service so no movie being played on the overhead screens on this older plane allegedly because of covid. Seems like Avianca is using covid as an easy scapegoat for reducing any type of service and reducing costs. At the end of the day, I'm not a fan of the low cost approach. They are providing low cost service and product yet the airfares are not low cost fares. I paid more for my flight now than I did precovid. If they're going to switch to low cost it should also reflect on the airfare cost as well not just in the product they are offering. I don't understand how this supposed low cost airline is still part of Star Alliance. I'm sure they're going to get kicked out once they get rid of business class altogether. This airline went from a Skytrax award winning airline to a disgrace in a span of 3 years. If you flew this airline precovid and haven't flown it since then, please prepare yourself since it is not the same airline. If you can, fly a different airline that does not charge you legacy airline prices for a low cost product. One of the few positive things I can say about Avianca is that all my flights were on time or arrived earlier than originally estimated even despite leaving late from SAL It doesn't look like they are having any of the issues the american airlines are having with flights getting cancelled, labor shortages etc.

### "The most unfriendly crew"
We had a return flight between Los Angeles and Bogota. The most unfriendly crew. Instead of serving the passengers they were resting in the back seats. They don’t speak English even though the aviation industry language is in English all around the world. They have only a small sandwich and coffee for a 7.5 h flight. No soda. No juice. No alcohol. I had never seen such a cheap international flight.

### "friendly and professional"
Not Verified | San Salvador to Houston. Extremely helpful, friendly and professional. I traveled with my family and she really went out of her way to help us even one the young men helping elderly people with the wheel chairs let me use his phone to make 2 phone calls because we left one bag with the taxi. Would choose Avianca to travel again

### "Excellent customer service"
I travel on the 30/06 from Miami to Madrid and my luggage didn't appeared in Madrid, I made my claim in Barajas (01/07) and I took another flight to Copenhagen moments latter. Mi luggage was in Copenhagen the next day even though Avianca doesn't fly to Denmark they sent it by Iberia which by the way had my luggage and didn't even send me any notification. By the contrary, Avianca customer service wrote me several emails and tracked the luggage all the way. Excellent customer service skills Avianca Miami/Madrid.

### "their website doesn’t work"
Tried 4 times to book my bag online and their website doesn’t work so you can pay $105 at the airport versus $35 online. There is no customer service in the United States and you would have to call internationally to foreign countries, their whatsapp texting is robotic and no help.

### "waiting for 120 days+ now for a refund"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! The airline decided to change my flights to a completely different day, so  that was not going to work so. So now I've been currently been waiting for 120 days+ now for a refund. I've made many, many calls, and emails, and created case after case. Escalated said cases to the "supervisor of the department" that conveniently does not have a direct phone line (lies). A simple refund has turned into a whole event and hours and hours and months of my time wasted. If you like yourself and you want to enjoy your life, just do yourself and never use this airline for anything.

### "couldn't care less attitude from Avianca"
Not Verified |  Avianca lost our luggage on our route from Barcelona / Madrid / Bogota / Cartagena, they sub contracted our first part to Iberia and now say our journey started in Madrid (lies). Our luggage which should have been transferred from Barcelona to Cartagena did not arrive and they say they cannot find because the baggage ticket must have come off, so we arrived on our family visit without our clothes and presents for the family which we had bought. We have had to return to Cartagena airport twice in order to fill in their baggage reclaim form but they have not been in touch to say sorry or admit any responsibility. Poor service and couldn't care less attitude from Avianca.

### "fly a different airline"
They have single-handedly almost ruined my wedding . They have cancelled my entire families flights without any notification and changed them to days before. The App doesn’t work, the customer service reps don’t pick up the phone, even when you call the system constantly hangs up on you. The baggage fees are insane. 120 dollars per bag is ridiculous. My flight has been changed three times in the last 2 weeks without my consent and my fiancé is extremely sad and nervous to even fly with a company that does not care about its passengers =. Save yourself the headache and fly a different airline.

### "never fly again with this airline"
The worst airline that can rip you off when it comes to checking in and luggage as well. The app doesnt work therefore you cant check in your luggage. one rep told us to take screen shots of errors on the app, so we did, When we were on line to check the rep said that she could not do anything. I insisted to speak with a supervisor, none around. We had to check in 3 bags, they charged us $120 each total of $360, this was on our way to Honduras from Miami. We then return to Miami, and the same issue at check in, the app doesnt work, it took forever to check in, we almost missed our flight as i tried once again to check in. Our luggage was once again charged, this time with the effort of the rep gave us a 15% discount totaling $310. We spent $640 on luggage that we considered and used on other airlines with no issues as a carry on. They dont believe in carry on, they call it a personal bag. I will never fly again with this airline. I got better service w Spirit, Allegiant and Frontier as the most economical airlines around.

### "Wonderful experience"
Best customer service I've ever received. We didn't know a covid test was required. They gave me a lab to go to outside the airport and held a person at the counter for me when I returned to give me my boarding pass and then held the plane door open for me. They were kind and courteous the whole time. Wonderful experience.

### "I do NOT recommend"
London to Medellin via Bogota. It is sad to write this review since Avianca was my favorite airline, but many things have changed and not necessarily for the better. It should be noted that on the B787 aircraft, the seats in both, business and economy class are still very comfortable and on a par with other star alliance member airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Turkish, United, etc. The big difference is in the service and food on board. On this particular flight, the offer for business class was two kinds of pasta served on a plastic container, a sandwich for starters and an ice cream for dessert. When I asked the crew if there was any other option, with obvious embarrassment she told me that it was the only option since this was a temporary menu due to Covid. Curiously, other airlines have resumed and even improved their menu on board, which clearly indicates that this is just an excuse to cut costs. The airline has also introduced new fares (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) The only fare that still includes 2 pieces of baggage in business is XXL, which is the same as a full fare business. Back in 2019 you were able to check in 2 bags in both, business and economy (32kg each in business and 23kg in economy) Sadly now is all gone. Most tickets are Size S which means you still pay what you used to pay back in 2019 if not more, but if you want to check in even just one bag you are looking at least £100GBP. The frequent flyer program Life miles has also changed for the worst, Accrual was previously based on distance, now it is based of the price paid for the ticket, excluding any taxes. In this occasion I've earned a total of 920 miles for the LHR-BOG sector. If you consider that the fare often exceeds the £1300GBP for one way and that you need 11.500 to reach Silver, 80% of which must be flown with Avianca, it is almost impossible to achieve elite status and perhaps also the most difficult program to achieve status in any airline member of star alliance. The inflight entertainment has been reduced to just a few old movies, no music, no games. Apart from the 787 and a couple A330, all IFE screens are being gradually removed. The only saving grace is being the only airline to fly directly between the UK and Colombia, but apart from that there isn't much to look forward to. Sadly, I do NOT recommend Avianca, better service, baggage allowance, on board food, and reasonable prices to reach Colombia can be found by just having and extra stop in Madrid (Iberia, Air Europa), Frankfurt (Lufthansa), Paris (Air France), Amsterdam (KLM), and even in Istanbul with Turkish Airlines.

### "clearly they have repositioned themselves as a low cost carrier"
Not Verified |  Have been taking a few flights with AV recently, after this Covid panic has subdued. Very disappointing to see that AV is still using this as an excuse to absolutely cut costs. On close to 6 h flight they offer you a box of cold sandwich and 2 cakes plus a bottle of water and coffee. Nothing else. No juice, no alcoholic beverages, no hot food as it used to be before Covid. Must admit that AV is still trying to leave a seat next to you empty, if you are Star Gold, which is great. Also, there were no pillows neither blankets avail on this night flight. Be careful on taking AV - unless no other options avail. The company was in Chapter 11 protection 2 years ago, clearly they have repositioned themselves as a low cost carrier.

### "the worst airline"
Broken seats, broken ceiling panel, no air vent above you, and it was hot. It is the worst airline, I asked for water and they didn’t offer that on an international flight.

### "rip you off with your bags"
San Juan to Medellín via Bogotá. They rip you off with your bags (their system doesn't let you register them and then charge them more at the counter, they take us off a flight due to problems with the plane, we lost the connection and they left us in limbo. After asking 10 employees different each one with a different instruction, a supervisor tries to solve but they put us in the worst hotel, (the one they wanted) nothing compared to where I was staying. A problem to pick up the bags again, in short. ALL BAD. | LA PEOR EXPERIENCIA!!! Te timan con las maletas(e sistema de ellos no te deja registrarlas para luego cobrarlas más caras en el counter, nos bajan de un vuelo por problemas con el avión, perdimos la conexción y nos dejaron en el limbo. Luego de preguntarle a 10 empleados diferentes cada uno con una instrucción diferente, una supervisora intenta resolver pero nos pusieron en el peor hotel, (el q les dió la gana) nada comparado a donde me estaba quedando. Un problema para volver a recoger las maletas, en fin. TODO MAL...

### "pay a little extra to fly with a company who actually cares about their customers"
Not Verified |  Words cannot describe how truly awful my customer service experience with Avianca was. It was worse than any negative experience I have had with American and Spirit combined. First, my Avianca rep told me that I would need to pay an extra $150 in order to board my plane to leave Ecuador, a fee which my friends did not have to pay. After speaking with the manager, they dropped my cost to $80, which I paid so that way I could board my plane and not miss my flight. On top of that, I was told that my luggage could not be checked all the way to my final destination and instead I would have to grab my luggage, get a Covid test and then recheck my baggage at my next stop, something my friends also did not have to do. After completing everything I was told to do, I went to recheck my bag but was told I was too late and that baggage check had closed a couple minutes ago and there was nothing they could do to help me. I explained that I was following the orders from the previous Avianca rep, but they still would not assist me and my customer service rep was very rude. I asked to speak with the manager, who was also rude, disrespectful, unwilling to help, and unprofessional. I explained to the manager that I also would be missing two connecting flights and was to the point of tears asking for any sort of help. After arguing for almost an hour, my Avianca rep finally agreed to schedule a new flight for me and my friends, but wouldn’t leave until 4am, which was almost 12 hours after the time we were supposed to take off (around 5pm). Since I was in a foreign place where I don’t speak the language, I asked for any sort of accommodation for the next 12 hours to which we were immediately shut down. So, I paid an extra fee to board the plane, paid to change my connecting flights, and pay to get a hotel room, all thanks to Avianca who refused to be helpful in anyway. Once I thought my Avianca nightmare had finished, I unfortunately left a piece of luggage on their plane under my seat and when I asked to go back and get it right after disembarking, I was told that no one was allowed back on the plane and that was their policy. So, after once again doing what they told me to do, I went to a customer service rep to ask them to report the item and to get their help. Not only did the customer service rep practically refuse to help me, I was sent to three other reps before one would finally assist me and try to find my item. Sure enough, Avianca said they found nothing and that there was nothing they could do . Whatever you do, do not fly this airline, even if it is the cheapest option, pay a little extra to fly with a company who actually cares about their customers. I hope I help prevent this from happening to another person.

### "a lost customer forever"
Not Verified |  This airline cancelled my flight due to COVID 6/16/2021. I was informed I had 1 year to re-book. I just called in to book a flight on 6/03/2022 and I was informed I was supposed to call by 5/01/22 because that is the day I booked the flight. Seriously? I said to the lady, "are you sure you do not want to bend/flex by a matter of days to keep a loyal customer because as a home owner in CR I fly down there a lot and she said no. I am a lost customer forever.

### "indifferent and disregarding flight attendants"
Had to get to Curacao for a meeting. Had to be in person. The only airline available was/is Avianca, with whom I've never flown, as I haven't had the opportunity to go to South America to this point. I read reviews and watched one or two videos that showed a pretty ordinary but fairly typical business class experience in terms of food and drink. I took note of the 1990 - 2000-era business class seats and figured I could pretend it was still 2003 just this once. The flight out of YYZ to Bogota left after midnight Toronto time and they served a little box lunch with a small sandwich, a bag of plantain crisps, and a tiny Hostess-like chocolate cup cake. No wine, only a small bottle of water. I figured, OK, everyone just wants to sleep so nothing fancy is fine. we arrived in Bogota at 5am or so for a very long (9 hours) layover and, although I paid for a C-class ticket, the 2.00pm flight to Curacao was all economy, loaded from the tarmac after we all crammed into busses from the airport basement for the ride to the plane. Fast forward to yesterday's flight. This time there was business class out of Curacao but still had the crammed bus ride back to the basement at BOG. I went to the lounge where I'd spent some 9 hours on the way in, grabbed a glass of wine, and noticed that at 2.07pm, the 2.50pm flight to TTZ showed, "closed". Panicking, I ran to the plane and sat down. No, it wasn't closed, and we waited a good 40 minutes after I sat down before buttoning up. I was tired, frustrated, and really annoyed at this point. Now the fun part. This is a 6.5 hour flight. It starts after lunch and goes over dinner so I figured we'd have a nice 2003-era business class dinner with a glass of wine. Oh boy - did we ever not have that. Once again, the same pathetic little box lunch, this time with a tiny cheese sandwich, the requisite plantain chips and cupcake, and tiny bottle of water. The only time I ever saw a flight attendant after that (other than landing) was the one time I went to the washroom and, while standing right in front of the seated flight attendants, asked for more water. I cannot believe that I paid for C- and J-class tickets so I could ride in dilapidated blue leather seats with no footrest, and then be treated to the "service" provided by the indifferent and disregarding flight attendants and their poor box lunches. Unbelievable.

### "our reservation remains cancelled"
At the airport, my husband and I were late and we were told by Avianca to re-schedule our flight with the call center. We were calling back and forth, being tossed between Avianca at the airport telling us that our reservation doesn't require waiver and the Avianca call center telling us that Avianca at the airport needs to provide a waiver and at the very end, Avianca call center cancelling our entire reservation. The only thing we got was that Avianca airport telling us that the person/people we talk to at the call center doesn't know what's going on and the call center telling us to contact Avianca airport to have them change what's on the system, otherwise, our reservation remains cancelled. Even after we got Avianca at the airport to put in the system that we can reschedule, the call center still refuses to reschedule for us.

### "I had booked a vegetarian meal, it was inedible"
On short flight we had a nice wrap, very tasty but cold, warmed would be better. On the long haul I had booked a vegetarian meal, it was inedible. No salt or flavouring, just boiled pasta with two pieces of overcooked carrot and zucchini. I had no dessert which others did have, and was not meat! Why do they think vegetarians are sick and can't eat salt or pudding? Breakfast was a wrap with mushrooms, that was OK but why do they not give vegetarians a bread roll and just a dry cracker?

### "Terrible customer service"
The worst airline company I've ever had to deal with. Avoid at all costs! First, they lost my luggage on the flight from Toronto to San Jose. I received my luggage on the third day on the night of my 6-day trip. Terrible customer service, had to wait for hours in the airport to talk to a representative to file my missing luggage. Second, on the way back, when we arrived at the airport at 3 am, they notified us that our flight is full! This is ridiculous, it's not a bus, we bought tickets for the flight in advance, how can it be full? All they could offer as compensation is 80USD which can only be redeemed at their horrible company, which is totally useless, cause I will never fly with them again. Hope you find this review before you buy tickets and think seven times if you want to deal with this company. p.s. their fleet is very old.

### "customer service is just terrible"
I took Avianca from Bogota to New York on an overnight flight. The seats did not recline at all, there was no screen on the seat and the legroom was terribly tight (and I’m an average size person - 5’8” and 165 pounds). The plane we took was different from the one advertised when we booked - had I known I wouldn’t have booked with Avianca. Further, the food is terrible - it’s a small sandwich with white cheese and a piece of tomato with water and coffee on the sides no options, no proteins, no other drinks offered. Finally, customer service is just terrible. They differed me to a What’s App chat or a messenger chat (I tried both) and neither even responded to the message. Bottom line is, don’t trust anything you read on their website and keep your expectations at absolute minimum (you won’t have to stand on the flight).

### "taken the money from my account"
Flying to El Salvador and coming back to the LAX round-trip through Avianca. I had paid for my dad's seats and mine and a check in bag through Avianca website which offers you a great discount. I got to the airport the day of my flight thinking everything is paid for and the surprise was that they have no record of my payment but of course Avianca have taken the money from my account. I show the person that was helping me the transaction from my account and he said I need to make a claim and I need to pay for my check in luggage because they have no record, therefore while he was explaining me there is a worker who was very rude and told me with an very bad attitude "we can't do anything for you, the luggage needs to be pay for or go to the website and make a claim or go to the Avianca website there is a return button so you can get your money back, and told the guy that was helping me "if she doesn't wanna pay stop helping her and move the line". I asked for the manager which she told me nicely that I need to make a claim. I have sent 2 emails and I haven't gotten a response yet when I called customer service I could only get my money back through the website I sent one is Spanish and one in English and through this day still waiting, what kind of service is this?

### "I'll never fly these people2
I booked a flight with Avianca. I got confirmation saying my payment was approved with a booking code along with an Eitinerary. I called yesterday May 17th to select my seat only to find out I did not have a ticket. They told me I needed to contact my bank. My bank told me & sent me transaction that my purchase was approved on their end & basically the airline did not do their part. So this whole entire time for a couple months I thought I had a ticket only to find out I did not have a ticket a week before my flight. Needless to say I'll never fly these people. My bank has refunded my money because they see that the Avianca did not do their part. So needless to say I won't be going on this trip now

### "I was asked for private information"
Not Verified |  My boyfriend and I were traveling from Bogota to Madrid when we were stopped by the boarding stuff and asked for detailed information about our exit to Madrid. My boyfriend showed them the flight number from Madrid to Paris, which was for 1 day after the current flight and then I was asked for my return tickets to Chile, my home country. I found strange that the staff of an airline asked for that type of information. Anyway, I answered the question, saying that I will travel from Paris to India afterwards. It was then when I was asked for my flight from Paris to India, even though I wasn't flying with them! The excuse they gave to me was that they must ask to any tourist for their return tickets or after destinations. My boyfriend from Ireland wasn't asked at all, whereas I was asked for private information. I went to their website and isn't mentioned that the staff has the authority to ask for further information. For me, was an insult. Also, the stuff was rude, in particular the lady that typed the info on the PC.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Terrible costumer service. To every question you ask the answer is “I don’t know”. When we got to Costa Rica, my travel companion’s luggage was nowhere to be found. One of the Avianca rep’s gave us the claim form and disappeared. No one showed up to collect the form for over 2 hours so we left. It’s been over a month and still no word on the luggage nor they have compensated for it. Will never fly with them again.

### "they still haven't refunded me"
I bought a fully refundable ticket with Avianca on 17th March 2020. On 2nd April 2022, they finally got around to refunding me on 2nd April 2022, but it had been so long since I bought it, that the bank account I bought it in had closed. I sent them proof of this and proof of the fact the bank's clear policy is to return payments to sender when an account is closed but yet they still refuse to refund me. They say the bank needs to send me a letter, which the bank does not do anymore. Avianca refuse to show me evidence that the payment has not been returned like they claim. They are being highly unreasonable requesting a letter regardless of the fact I have sent them a bank closure statement and their policy on returned payments. Their service has been pitiful from start to finish. Don't ever pay more for a refundable ticket as it will take you more than two years battling to get it back. And they still haven't refunded me.

### "Total surprise and disappointment!"
Not Verified |  There are no business cabins or seats at all but the airline sold the tickets as business class. The seats are just premium seats in a small plane. No service at all let alone business class services. Total waste of money. This must be a fraudulent business practice. I have travelled in business class with Turkish Airlines. There must be a standard to verify the seats/services for a business class as Avianca claims. The airline advertises and sells “premium economy class” tickets as “business class”, which is fraudulent and nonprofessional practice. There is no business class boarding either. Total surprise and disappointment! Do not use this airline.

### "This is a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  This is a terrible airline. I have Global Entry, TSA pre-check. When I went to go through that line in Miami I was told there was something wrong with my boarding pass and I had to go stand on the line at the counter and get it fixed - I was never told what was wrong. When I got to the counter they literally shut down every single window to have a 20 minute "morning meeting". They had about 60 people in the line and completely shut the whole operation down for this "meeting". When I got to the counter I was issued a new boarding pass with no explanation as to what the problem was. On my return flight back all I had with me was a carry-on for me and a carry-on for my son. They told me I could pay $100 a bag to carry them on or $80 to check them on the plane! Absolutely nuts but there is nothing you can do as you are at their mercy. The one positive thing I can say is that the flights were on time - nothing else. The food was absolutely terrible and the customer service reps at the counter are rude. When I tried to add bags on line on their website before the flight it was absolutely impossible to do so. To try to call them and talk to a human was also impossible. I will never fly Avianca again.

### "staff aren’t kind or polite at all"
Avianca went from being one of the best airlines in Latin America to the very bottom of the list. The website and the App don’t have enough information or they don’t work, neither in Spanish nor English. Calling to the customer service department or talking to an agent is impossible. The lines are busy no matter what time I called and when you finally communicate with someone, the call gets cut. Tried to communicate with a representative for a week without success. I tried to purchase an extra piece of luggage before a flight and it was impossible, they said they couldn’t sell it to me and I’d have to pay in the airport where the costs is 3 times more expensive. This airline shouldn’t be operating. It’s abusive, their staff aren’t kind or polite at all and the fares aren’t even cheap. What a mess!

### "subject to change and no refund"
They are the only airline to offer nonstop flights to countries south of the US. They have changed their regulations where if you purchase a seat reservation or any additional service they are subject to change and no refund. They change flight schedules with no accommodating alternative. You can purchase a flight for 4 am and they will cancel and reissue a ticket for a flight at 6pm leaving you arriving at your destination past midnight. I purchased my flight and seats well before the time of my travel they issued me a new ticket as part of their schedule change but also gave the seats I purchased to different people putting my issued seat to the rear of the aircraft I called complained they said its all subject to change and availability but those seats should not have been "available" if they were purchased.

### "Charged me twice without refunding"
Charged me twice without refunding my money. Then when I tried to contact them they just ignore me. When trying to go to there physically, non of their representatives spoke English or able to help , they just give you other phone or email which will get you to nowhere. You should know that once you have credit charge problems you are on your own especially if you don’t speak Spanish.

### "One of the worst service"
Do not use this airline. We made an even bigger mistake by paying for business class flight! One of the worst service. Please don't waste your money. At least make us feel like it is worth the money. First of all, they don't even call boarding for business class. Both flights we had to go up front and ask if we can board yet since they are boarding the masses first. Then in El Salvador, the guy checking the tickets even made it a point to avoid us. In flight meal from SFO to SJO, a 5.5 hr flight was a soggy sandwich, a water bottle, a tiny bag of chips and nuts. No other drinks available other than coffee, coke and apple juice (like the one you get in the hospital). Seriously I hope you read this before throwing your money away on this airline.

### "It's all money and bad service all around"
Not Verified |  We are absolutely livid with Avianca's service! We bought our flights to El Salvador - 6 family members. Upon arrival to our terminal 1+ hour before the flight, we and about 20 passengers were told the flight was fully booked and that we need to purchase another flight to get to our destination. Everyone was so upset! We purchased our flights again and put them on a credit card, a huge extra expense! That delayed us 4+ hours to our destination. On our way back we were told that only 4 of the 6 family members had tickets to come back home and that the other two were not on their "list" of passengers - note that we bought all 6 tickets together. The 2 family members that stayed were delayed another day and had to stay at the airport and wait. We live over 73 miles from the international airport. We came home and now must drive back tonight to pick them up. That's 219+ miles counting our way back home last night. Who's going to pay for our gas? The inconvenience? The fact that 2 people had to miss work today because the airline did not have them on their "list"? This is ridiculous! On top of that, it's $80 per checked bag, about $25 if you want to sit at a window, and everything in between is an extra charge. It's all money and bad service all around. We will never fly with Avianca again! No responsibility at all! And now I have to figure out how to get our money back for the initial flights bought that we were not used because they overbooked a flight. The charge is there but the flights were not taken.

### "not going to be permitted on the plane"
I bought a ticket with Avianca April 1st 2022, to travel April 21st 2022, their policies I could Make changes two or so hours prior boarding which they did not honor even thought I tried changing my flight about 12 hours prior, with that being said, they did not communicate with me about the Covid requirements until 40 or so hours prior the boarding time, I had made my research that I needed test completed 72 hours prior landing to my destination and that I could send my results within 36 hours prior boarding which I did. My test exactly at the 72 hours prior landing to my destination so I could get my results within 36 hours after the test time frame, however at the 36 hours marks before boarding which is only about 24 hours after my test, I received an email stating that I was not going to be permitted on the plane, which is when I started to attempt to change my flight, I was notified by 5 different agents plus a supervisor that I had to pay 200 USD, plus the difference which after calculating it was only 350 USD however why did the total was coming up to over 600 USD, when asked them about it they couldn’t give me an answer. Then I looked for different dates and the fares that were given to me kept getting more expensive than that fares advertised in their sites. I’ve sent two complaints to their site and somehow now their customer service complaints is not working, then I tried calling several times and they hang up the phone.

### "terrible unprofessional customer service"
Not Verified |  I booked a return flight for my family (2 adults, 2 children) from London to Bogota. Flight from London was cancelled at the last minute, after we drove 3 hours to the airport (system said it was all ok). Avianca left us to chase public buses in the night to go to the mediocre hotel they provided. In-flight "meal" was a nasty "toastie" with fried onion and greasy cheese, gross. Who eats this on a transatlantic flight!, next "meal" : a wrap with broccoli (very popular with children) eith a nasty spicy curry goo. I asked an alternative for my children (9 and 12) and was given a baby food jar! Apalling. Return portion Bogota-London. Received many emails asking me to pay to "upgrade", what I did not get was any email telling me they has kicked us out if the flight as they oversold over 30 seats! Customer service desk is a circus, completely unprofessional people who do not give a damn to leave a family with 2 tired children stranded at the airport. They kicked other people out of the flight next day to fit us in surely to tell them the same rubbish they told us "they are allowed to sell more seats than available" and we have to just accept. They offered a half-mouthed "apology" and a lousy "compensation" that does not cover the loss of earnings and disruption to our arrangements, children missing school, transport, extra airport parking, even extra pet care back home. 2 flights with Avianca, 2 terrible experiences. Shame because it used to be a good airline, now it is not capable of providing the basics (a flight at the time and date booked), terrible unprofessional customer service, awful (disgusting) in flight food, they have gone to the bottom of the bottom. Avoid at all costs, don't bother. As a Colombian, I'm ashamed that the national airline has fallen this far.

### "They are not willing to help you"
Very bad customer service. My family and I traveled abroad (traveling with minors) and requested to seat together and they told us that the fight was full could not accommodate us unless I pay extra fee. I went only and was able to change it. They are not willing to help you.

### "same category in order to be refundable"
Not Verified |  I purchased the ticket via Avianca, to go visit my mother. I uploaded covid test and also the form required within 36 hours. I arrived at the airport to find out that my name was not on the list to travel to Managua. The customer's service did not offer any help to resolve the issue that day we were about 25, people who did not fly to their destination. So sad that airlines take advantage of people. I am trying to go to Nicaragua again in May I Purchased a ticket and I selected it to be refundable and I found today that both tickets need to be in the same category in order to be refundable but no information saying both need to be the same category in order to be refunded before is a purchase. Unfortunately is the only airline flying to Managua otherwise I will use a different airline.

### "we are so disappointed"
5th April 2022 my friend and I flew with Avianca from Miami to Managua, Nicaragua. At arrival both our luggage got lost, and when, we asked politely the Managua airport staff the procedure to retrieve our lost luggage we simply got handed over an incomplete Property Irregularity Form with a contact number from Avianca call center without additional information. Since then it's been 6 days and each time we are trying to reach out to the call center they either tell us that the luggage are nowhere to be found or they simply hang up on us after 1 hour of wait time. We are now in a foreign country without any luggage and a service provider not able to answer any of our inquiries. We will no longer use the services of Avianca, we are so disappointed from the behaviour of the service providers.

### "were to be re-routed to Bogota"
My wife and I were on Avianca air flight #203, 7pm EST, Orlando to Medellin on March 29, 2022. Evidently, the news media was there for the maiden voyage of the new route. Well at 2pm unknown to us, Medellin Airport was closed. Avianca had 5 hours to warn all of us (about over 60 people) to not to leave Orlando because we would be stranded in Bogota. We left Orlando at about 730PM. Over three hours and a half later, ten minutes before we landed, the captain of the Avianca flight came on and told us we were to be re-routed to Bogota. Then the captain said over the loud speaker, we would be taken care of with hotels or a flight arrangement. Later on we found this to be an absolute lie. We deplaned and went down to the immigration looking for staff to help. That never occurred. We were told to go to the Avianca podium, wear bewildered airport Avianca crew, knew nothing about what happened. Avianca stranded people with no offer to help. This was the most horrible stranding we have ever had to us. We had to find a bus to Medellin. We had to sleep in a bus station in Bogota for 8 hours, then get a 11 hour bus ride to Medellin. Avianca, never made any attempt to explain this or advise us.

### "First and last time that I will book Avianca"
Not Verified |  First and last time that I will book Avianca. Due to COVID, I had to change my ticket. Although I got a waiver number and I bought a flexible ticket, I was told to pay for the change, that said, I was not supposed to pay this. After accepting to pay for the change, I have been through the call center for 4 consecutive days, as the payment does not go through. Hours and hours with the call center in Colombia, as the number in England does not work. They cannot resolve the issue, incredible, in this era of digitalization! Customer service is the face of the customer, and so far, is has been terrible!

### "unpleasant and tiring experience"
Very disappointing airline. Would avoid if possible. An error in my ticket for checked luggage required that I pay £100 to have my luggage checked in and claim for a refund afterwards. Ludicrous. Poor service overall. Food was terrible, only a bit of chicken with mash potato and a sponge cake. No starter. No coffee offered. Seating was the tightest I have ever seen. Throughout the night there was no service at all. Needed to wait 10min for a glass of water. No snack served. Entertainment system very poor. A dozen of low-rated American action films. No headphones available so could not watch. Unfriendly staff. A unpleasant and tiring experience overall. Sad to end a holiday like this.

### "Customer service doesn't exist"
Only 1 good thing about Avianca: you have space in your seat, my knees wouldn't touch the front sit. I payed $1200 MIA-BOG-EZE-BOG-MIA and I only had a carry on allowed (Not cheap). So I tried to pay for luggage on the web site. The web site is the worst I've ever use, super complicated. Even when I changed the country to USA, they would charge in UK Pounds. So I didn't pay and explained the issue at the airport counter. They wouldn't pay me any attention and charged me $80 and $90 dollars for the luggage. When coming back I decided to pay in pounds. The food is sandwiches, but worst part is that they make a survey: what do you think about our food? 6.5 hour trip with a sandwich and a small bottle of soda. Customer service doesn't exist, its just an automated whatsapp, that doesn't solve anything. They don't answer the phone. Even now, I don't know where to call to ask for the money for my luggage back. Check in at the airport is disorganized. It would be OK paying 750 for the flight, but not $1200 + luggage

### "this airline heroically missed the mark!"
Not Verified |  If you plan in traveling business class with this airline, I strongly suggest you don't and save your money. You will pay a lot more for this class of ticket and get almost nothing in return. 1) They serve the same plain old sandwich as they do in coach. An upgraded ticket for no upgrade in meals. No business class drinks. None of that extra you expect for paying for a much higher priced ticket. 2) Modern business class seats are available in the short flights from Miami to Bogota (a hub for Avianca) but if Bogota is a connection to other South American countries (Buenos Aires, Argentina for example), the business class seats on the connecting flight are slightly larger that coach with a little more comfort but almost no extra legroom unless you sit in the two front seats behind the bulkhead. Also on the connecting flight, you get the same basic sandwich. 3) Another big negative is the airline does not have WIFI on their planes. If you are a business class person trying to catch up on corporate email communications, you're out of luck. In summary, the airline is a good discount airline like America's Spirit airlines but instead of charging an insane extra amount for a slightly bigger seat in their pitiful excuse for business class, they would serve travelers better for charging a little extra for the larger seat instead of ripping business class travelers off. People should get what they pay for and this airline heroically missed the mark!

### "the customer service was laughably bad"
I received confirmation from Avianca that my trip was booked. They issued me an Electronic Ticket Receipt complete with confirmation and e-ticket number. They send me multiple emails telling me to upgrade my service, and today sent me two emails to check-in to my flight. I can't check-in to my flight, so I call customer service. They had canceled my flight without notifying me in any way. The flights are now three times more expensive. I spent over an hour on the phone with a representative and the customer service was laughably bad. Blaming me for the situation - and then repeatedly transferring me to a Spanish only speaking representative who in broken English blamed me for selecting Spanish and then hung up on me.

### "double charges for 1 luggage"
Avianca airline is the worst airline. Dirty airplane, food one option I don’t eat pork, double charges for 1 luggage $180 just for 10kg. At airport none of the Avianca customer service speaks English.

### "now charges you $100 per carryon"
Avianca now charges you $100 per carryon. This is free on every other airlines. Ridiculous. Will never fly with them again for such blatant rip offs.

### "worst airline I ever flew with"
Avianca is the worst airline I ever flew with, a true nightmare. Can you imagine how it feels like, arriving after flying with Avianca till 3am in the morning, waiting for 12 hours for your next Avianca flight, having your boarding pass ready, and the Avianca lady tells you without any empathy, or willingness to help that you’re not on the list. I spend another night at the airport, because I booked the first possible flight to get out of there. I spent 600$ for a ticket that normally cost 150$.

### "Will never use them again"
80$ for a checked bag is an absolute joke, not to mention they also charge 80$ for hand luggage. Also, they wouldn't let us check in because we didn't have proof of onward travel from Colombia - (We are taking a slowboat into Peru and isn't available to book online anywhere, you have to pay cash at the Dock). They pushed us aside and told us to book a random flight or of the country before they would check us in. Needless to say we missed our flight and they just shrugged their shoulders. Will never use them again.

### "airline has not returned my money"
My experience was negative, because this airline has not returned my money for many months. It's been 5 months. They ignore all my messages. This is a real scam. I do not know who can help me in this matter.

### "$90 usd to check a regular size suitcase"
Not Verified |  Do not bother with this airline. They charge you $90 usd to check a regular size suitcase through. Despite the site saying $55 usd (which is still expensive, most expensive I have ever come across). Really, $90! I am still in shock. I have never paid for than $30 or 40 usd for suitcase case. When I told the airline at counter before I boarding I wanted assistance so I could write to the airline or customer service they ignored me a full five minutes. Then they eventually gave me the number and website address. They were extremely inattentive and unhelpful. They are losing customers. I for one would avoid purchasing from them

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever, do not fly with Avianca. It is the worst airline in terms of service, communication, policies etc. The staff was very rude and they don't speak English on international flights. The company tries to find a way to take your money and they don't care about the client. I wont be flying with Avianca again.

### "they didn't let me board"
They have this rule, you can check-in lap infants only up to 6 hours before departure. Otherwise they will make you buy a full priced adult ticket for your infant if you want to board your intended flight. Now that they didn't let me board, there is no full or partial refund, no credit, nothing. They stole $900 from me because I was traveling with a lap infant and arrived only 3 hours prior to departure at the airport.

### "Worse experience in booking a flight"
Worse experience in booking a flight I have ever had. They required me to call. Was put on hold. Booked the flight after a half hour. They made a mistake refunded my flight payment for no reason and I had to spend a hour on the phone with a person who ended up not helping and making a ref number instead of helping. Bought a new ticket for the same flight and got a email confirmation, but then I couldn't pay for a bag because the booking number didn't have the ability to remember my email despite sending me a email on it.

### "staff wasn't courteous"
Not punctual at all, staff wasn't courteous, every time i ask for something staff make faces like they were angry. It feels like they need lots of training and i was in XXL class maybe seat was worst. The other flight they lose my luggage. They change my flight going back and don't know if I'll make it at this point when the airlines say.

### "they have no customer service"
I had a flight on Jan 22 to go to Houston due to certain things out of my control I was not able to get to fly. I called this airline over 100 times literally leaving a call back number but their customers service is non-existent or they are taking advantage of the pandemic and stealing travelers money to keep their airline in business. I would not recommend anyone to fly with this Airline since they have no customer service relationship or business orientation and they do not respect people time or money.

### "zero refreshments or entertainment"
Decent on time flight that was nearly full. However zero refreshments or entertainment for a 2 hour flight. Flight attendants were busy gossiping much of the flight vs helping those on board.

### "unpleasant and horrific experience"
Avianca by far is the worst airline I have traveled with. I had the most unpleasant and horrific experience with regards to quality, standards, hygiene, and customer service.

### "they blind you with the price"
My flight cost $167 to book and my 1st checked bag cost 83 dollars. This is truly ridiculous. I should have read the fine print but just like Spirit, they blind you with the price.

### "fly with any other airline"
Not Verified | This airline owed me a credit due to a cancelled flight on their behalf. I tried to rebook a flight months later & wanted to use my $499 of credit which decreased to $307 magically. It took 5 days! For someone to even help me get my credit which had to be uploaded onto their special UATP card - once I had the credit onto this card & tried to purchase my flight it didn’t process. Once again I’m on the phone for hours, I got hung up multiple times & transferred to at least 6 people to “help” me. I was so frustrated why they couldn’t just do it themselves & do the booking for me since they see I have a credit! They then told me I had to convert my USA page to the Colombian page to that currency for the credit to work? So confusing. After days of trying they told me to try a different browser to purchase my flight using my UATP card so I did & it worked finally UNTIL the site basically robbed my credit money & I wasn’t able to purchase my flight because the page crashed! I called up again & all they can tell me was they’d file a claim that they’d get back to me in a few days like what a joke. After 6 days that was all they can do for me & from waiting so long the flight price increased so much I had to end up paying out of pocket for the flight. Never again will I go through this airline they are beyond untrained with customer service & can’t manage their own tasks or even know how to work their systems. That credit was owed to me & now it’s gone when it was originally $499 they decreased it to $307 which I feel was confusing since I knew how much money I was owed. Please fly with any other airline if you want to fly to Colombia because you will have a headache dealing with them honestly.

### "Overall a horrific experience"
Charges and more charges, money hungry airline. Not worth the stress or money to fly with Avianca. Luggage cost was much more than what was stated initially when 6 tickets where bought, a charge of $80 per luggage. Checking at airport had another $20 charge per person, despite Avianca check in Website webpage not working. The charges kept racking up. The airline front desk person was rude, unprofessional, and not helpful at all. We felt pushed aside, undervalued as a customer. Overall a horrific experience.

### "Think twice before booking with Avianca"
Not Verified | Booked a trip to Colombia with my family on business class. The experience started at the counter. The placed somebody training to take care of the business class line. When I asked about the lounge, she said that no lounge was available. She sent me to the food court if I needed something to eat. Fortunately, I checked with the Star Alliance lounge, and I was able to get in. Avianca decided to board the plane from the back. They claim it is due to Covid (even though business class is in the front of the plane, forward from the door). In a 7 hour flight, we only got one drink (water, soda, of juice, no alcohol) and a small box with a disgusting burrito and stale chips. What is worst, my seat was loose and every time I moved forward the seat will come forward with me. The entertainment was a joke. Very old movies. No TV options, no music options. Think twice before booking with Avianca. It used to be a great airline with fantastic service, but it is no longer the case. We will not be booking any trips on Avianca any more.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Horrible experience. I will never fly with this airline again. I paid to upgrade my seat to first class thinking it would make the trip more enjoyable. It did not. My seat was old, uncomfortable and broken. My seat was kicked from the person behind me (in the next class because the class was only divided by a curtain). My return flight did not have inflight entertainment (4 hour flight). The laughable excuse for food that was served was inedible. Nothing but a gluten filled box: pretzels, cookie and some type of meat (did not look cooked) and cheese in a croissant. I am allergic to gluten and was unable to eat anything. The fact that they also don't serve alcohol makes you wonder why anyone would fly with this airline, let alone pay to upgrade for an experience such as this.

### "told us our booking was cancelled"
We booked a flight and then try to request a change via their WhatsApp assistant. The assistant told us that it was in learning mode and couldn’t complete our request, from there we spend hours on the phone with their call center that was unable to make the change so we decide to keep the initial flight for which we had a ticket and that was paid for. At the airport they told us our booking was cancelled. I didn't receive any email notification nor a reimbursement for this. Their client service is really bad as they just repeat things like robots without being from any help.

### "refused to make any changes"
I booked flights to San Jose Costa Rica for July 2022 but my wife's work place canceled all vacations for July/August 2022 due to staff shortage. Tried to make changes on the website kept crashing lousy website though the app didn't work also. Two hours on the phone finally got to talk to an rude agent refused to make any changes or give us refund. I tried to reason by paying more for the trouble still refused. the cost of $837 gone. she canceled though knowing they can resell the seats and still no refund due to the conditions of purchase. Other airlines were a lot more reasonable.

### "never flying with Avianca again"
I had to reschedule my whole flight and all the tours I had plan because in trying to save time Due to the high traffic in Cali Colombia I attempted to sign in through the app. The app would not let me check in 2 hours before my flight! When I did it on line, same issue. So i tried the WhatsApp Avianca assistant that let me to the same online app that wouldn’t let me check in. When i showed up to the airport not only did i lose time explaining to them what was going on but i lost a ton of money for missing my flight due to Avianca's faulty check in process. After showing them so they could see with their own eyes what had happened, instead of just putting me on another flight for free to compensate for all the issues they charged me a “penalty” and the penalty cost literally the same price as my previous ticket. And they charged me to check in after having showed them the issues I had with their app. At this point I had to assume it was a scam. If it weren’t for the fact that I already have my flight booked to leave (and it’s non refundable of course) I would guarantee never flying with Avianca again.

### "staff cares that we wear masks at all time"
Not Verified | I have taken 4 flights with Avianca on 1 trip. Nobody can speak English, and they can barely understand. You can't expect that everyone traveling will understand Spanish. This is 21st century and the international language is English. Introduce normal meals, full meals on long international flights! Staff is not interested to hear or help out in any situation, and we were traveling with a kid and they still didn't care to accommodate anything. The only thing the staff cares about it that we all wear masks at all time, and that's it. They couldn't tell us when we were suppose to land. Leaving the aircraft row by row is very inefficient.

### "staff at check-in were very rude"
The staff at check-in were very rude and unhelpful. Acted like they wanted me to know that whether or not I made it onto my flight was in their hands. I paid for my ticket and luggage online, but when I went to check in they said I had not paid for my bag and they refused to check it in unless I paid again, to the point where I ended up missing my flight.

### "website does not accept payment with vouchers"
Not Verified |  After the pandemic we were issued vouchers for four tickets we could not use because of all the restrictions in travel. Now we are trying to rebook our dream vacation and it turns out their website does not accept payment with those vouchers issued by Avianca itself! Every time we call, we have to wait almost two hours to talk to a representative, only to be transferred over and over again. Finally yesterday they said we have to book our tickets in a travel agency. Absolutely ridiculous.

### "rude and unprofessional staff"
Not Verified |  Most careless rude and unprofessional staff I've ever encountered, wait times exceed 1 hour to speak to representatives. Paid $225 for seat selections to have my family of 7 seat together only to be spread amongst the entire plane, when attempting to resolve in a calm collective manner they simply told me to exit the plane if I didn't like it.

### "told us we could not board"
Not Verified |  This is hands down the worst company I have ever done business with. We arrived at the airport 3 hours in advance and their antiquated check in system caused us to wait in line for 2 hours and 15 minutes. We asked several times to be moved up since our flight time was coming up and we were assured that we would be ok. Needless to say once we got to the front of the line they told us we could not board. They offered no assistance with a flight change or even a credit to use on another flight. We were out of luck and had to book with another airline $400 down the drain.

### "What a disgrace of a company!"
Not Verified |  This is the most unprofessional airline. I purchased a ticket three months ago, then called to make a change and their system was not working. Long story short, they never processed my payment for the change because of their system, they did not communicate this issue to me but did send me a confirmation number. When checking in, they told me they couldn’t issue a ticket to me because it wasn’t activated so they sold my reservation but kept my $400. The check-in manager was rude and told me to call the call center which was also rude. They started blaming me for their system not working. Even Volaris has better customer service than this. What a disgrace of a company!

### "They need to get their act together"
Not a consistent airline. Check-in and lounge very professional. No onboard service whatsoever. In fact there was not attention at all. Not even a bottle of water on this hour long flight. The flight attendants spent the flight in the rear galley. Bags were waiting on belt. Avianca is removing business class from the 20th October so for my return flight I was downgraded without refund or compensation. To make matters ever more annoying, it is impossible to get hold of someone on the helpline. 2 hours waiting so I gave up. I need to change my return flight and, having gone to the airport, was told there is a penalty even though on the app it says I can make changes for free. They need to get their act together.

### "Totally indifferent cabin staff"
Avianca used to be quite a fairly good airline to travel with, but have things changed. To start off with, my wife and I paid as much for Avianca's Economy Class ticket as I have paid in the past for Business Class tickets. Did not really have a choice, though, due to US borders being closed and my wife not having a Canadian visa. Ground staff was good but unfortunately belonged to Lufthansa and not to Avianca, as we started our journey in Munich. And that's about it, other than the fact that we arrived in BOG on time. Horrible value for money. Very uncomfortable seats. Filthy bathroom that did not get cleaned even once during the whole flight. Totally indifferent cabin staff. A total of 2 bottles of water (150 ml) were given to passengers during 10 hours. Had to nag cabin crew in the back of the plane to get more water. Food was bad and really not enough for a 10 hour flight. Supposedly to protect passengers, due to COVID. I will let the photo attached to this review speak for itself. Yes, this was the food that was served on a 10+ hours transatlantic flight. Extremely reduced inflight entertainment system. Supposedly also due to COVID. - There is no more lounge access available in MAD. I used to travel with Avianca very frequently and I am still a LifeMiles Gold member, yet they feel like another airline now. Will avoid them in the future as much as I can and have already switched to another frequent flyer program.

### "didn't offer any change or refund"
They abandoned my 60 years old mother in the airport, they canceled the flight without warning or explanation, and therefore she lost the next connection. They don't answer any phones or chats, they didn't offer any change or refund, we had to go with another airline.

### "Dealing with Avianca has been an absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  Dealing with Avianca has been an absolute nightmare. Bought a ticket for my senior citizen mother, and 3 other tickets (total of 4), my mother missed her flight so I called to change it, to the same departure times as mine and the 2 other tickets, 3 hours later after my payment for the extra charge had been verified I hang up. When I get to the airport, they tell me that she doesn’t have a reservation that the ticket was ever processed, that there was nothing they could do there and that I needed to call the airline and to move out of the way because she needed to help the other customers, she was so extremely rude and not willing to help us out at all. I then asked for the manager on duty, the woman was even worse, she literally looked at me from head to toe and said don’t stand here, if you want something resolved call the airline. And she asked, are you going to get on the plane? I asked her, if this was your mother would you leave her stranded at an airport at 1am which is about to close? She says I don’t care what it is you want to do, I already said I can’t do anything about it. When I called the airline the next morning they told me they had a system error and that is why the payment had not processed. And they informed me that since we decided not to get on the plane and lave our mother there that our tickets were lost.

### "supervisor was very arrogant and dismissive"
By far the most horrible experience I've had, supervisor was very arrogant and dismissive. We where told to contact customer service to see what we could do after finding out that my 1yr old daughter was unable to fly because she needed a PCR covid test yet no where in the terms and conditions stated such!

### "$600 was for a cancelation fee"
Not Verified |  Bought 2 tickets totaling $1,064 flying in April. Postponed them to Sept 2021 because of Covid in my family around those days. Situation changed so I sent for cancelation and refund in April. I June they finally refunded $464 claiming that $600 was for a cancelation fee. This has to be illegal and they must be exposed! I've called them several time but have been hung up. Literally, the CS person (twice) have told me they can't escalate to supervisor and hang up. They don't realize that it takes North of 2 hours (136 minutes to be exact) of being on hold before a representative answers the phone. Again, they kept $600 out of a set of tickets worth $1,064 that was canceled 5 months before the flight. This has to be the worst CS case I've ever encountered.

### "turned away at ticket counter"
Was turned away at ticket counter due to my ticket being suspended. No advance notice was given of this and no one at the airport showed even a remote interest in helping me. They told me to call Avianca to deal with the issue. 24 hours later & numerous hours of calls Avianca explained to me that my bank would not release the payment even after I provided written confirmation from the bank that funds had been released and posted. They then informed me it would be impossible for me to book another flight because the previous flight had been suspended. My 36 hour grace period of Covid test viability had lapsed and that I should try another airline or a travel Agent meanwhile. It took 12 hours to just to get someone to talk to me about a solution to my travel situation. They have zero interest in helping fix the situation, have terrible customer service, are only I interested in pointing the finger, have no managers available even after a days worth of phone calls emails, filed complaints etc and are totally clueless.

### "they never responded"
On June 14 I flew from Sfo to Gua, I arrived at airport over 1hr 40 minutes before the flight time when I was in the line a lady (from Avianca) told me that the flight was closed and I needed to call a 1800 number to change my flight because it was my fault since they require to be at airport 3 hours before departure. I called that number waited over 30 minutes finally someone answer to tell me they need to transfer me to another department. I went back inside thank goodness there were electronic kiosk where I could get my ticket without any problem but I couldn’t register my bag so I flew without luggage thanks to this lady that closed the flight for 3 people including me just because there were 3 people family members of one guy of Avianca's crew, They still registered one lady that arrived 40 minutes later than me, and registered those 3 family members of that guy who where not paying a penny for their flight and didn’t care about us who were paying for our flight. I filled a claim and they never responded.

### "They make mistakes and don’t own up to them/fix anything"
Not Verified |  My parents bought flights from DC with a layover in El Salvador with a final destination to Honduras. My sister unfortunately couldn’t join anymore like originally planned so we postponed her flight. Day of the flight, our flights are nowhere to be found because they cancelled everyone’s flight. They rebook us for the next day at 4am to make our layover flight so we could use the same COVID test. When we get there at 2am, one of our names isn’t on the ticket, the name of my sister who isn't flying is. However, the itinerary they sent via email has the correct names. They’re not able to make the change for whatever reason and we lose our flights again and we can’t travel any time later because our COVID exam isn’t valid anymore. They make mistakes and don’t own up to them/fix anything.

### "Complete lack of customer oriented service"
Not Verified |  Complete lack of customer oriented service. The check-in personnel were of no help to many travelers (including myself) who were told at the last minute an additional form was necessary to travel. The form was not made available in hard-copy and we were simply told to go to the Avianca website to search for the needed form. We were also informed we would not be able to board without the form. Everyone of the check-in personnel were useless. My wife managed to convince the agent that checked us in to let us go to the gate without the form and, as we suspected, the gate agent said we could simply obtain the form once we arrived at our destination! This after spending one hour on our telephones trying to find the form so that we would be allowed by the check-in agent to proceed to the gate. I am appalled by the complete lack of customer service exhibited that day by Avianca. My experience was sufficient for me to decide to not fly with them again.

### "I still have had no response"
Avianca is hands down the worst airline I've ever flown with. If you want to talk to them, well too bad, no one gets to talk to them. After being on hold for hours, I spoke to a customer service rep, who hung up on me after I asked for a voucher for my flight. Costa Rica got shut down because of COVID, and they wouldn't even consider just giving me a voucher or rescheduling my flight. I tried chatting with these guys, they had an 8-hour wait limit, I sent in a voucher form, to which they said they would respond in 20 days, I still have had no response.

### "Absolutely frustrating trying to communicate with this Airline"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service. Four days in a row trying to make a change to my ticket and the answer was always “the system is down”, waiting time on ‎WhatsApp for at least 8 hours and on the phone for 45 minutes, once I went to 80 minutes. All that they have to say is “it’s not our fault”, “call back after 5 hours”, “Sorry we cannot help this time”. Absolutely frustrating trying to communicate with this airline. If you can avoid it please do so. Otherwise get ready to get forgotten by them in case you have trouble with your tickets

### "I hope I never have to use Avianca again"
I have never in my life wasted so much time with an Airline Customer Service. Our flight was cancelled due to the pandemic. In order to change or use the voucher I spent hours. Called but waiting time was 85 minutes. Via Whatsapp 8 hours response time. Then I spent about from 1.40 pm to 3.48 getting my voucher to be applied to a new airfare through an agent via whatsapp! That's just ridiculous. I hope I never have to use Avianca again.

### "miserable customer service"
The crew on Avianca planes must think they are better than the customers they are supposed to serve, what an arrogant and lazy bunch. After taking off they came around handing out some water bottles and then never walked through the plane until before arriving, some 5 hours later. Not even if you pressed the call bottom. All sitting on their seats at the back or front of the plane. The Toilets on the Plane were just filthy, almost unusable! I told one of them about it but he never looked up at me but kept reading. I think I should have made a complaint to the Authorities about these unsanitary conditions especially now during the health crisis. But this starts already on the ground, there is no number you can call, the only one to call is in Bogota and you need to call them by WhatsApp. What a miserable customer service this airline has.

### "Avianca absolutely has the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  I will never complain about Spirit or Frontier Airlines customer service. They are a 6 star service on a 5 star scale compared to Avianca. Avianca absolutely has the worst customer service I have dealt with in an airline. This is coming from someone who's line of work requires them to travel often. My mother in law's flight was canceled in October due to COVID. No problem, I get it. However, after several months and at least 20 attempts and probably close to 100 hours (email, phone, WhatsApp) I get a voucher. I'm thinking it will be smooth sailing after this. Nope...Avianca process to redeem your voucher is designed to make you give up and lose your voucher since you have a year to use. Here I am 7 months after the original flight and I am unable to get a hold of someone. I do not fly Avianca. It's not the Avianca of the 80s or 90s. The gold standard is non-existence and I agree with a previous comment. Avianca should not be a part of the Star Alliance.

### "customer service is appalling"
The absolute disregard for any kind of customer service is appalling. Their chat takes 2-6 hours to respond in whatsapp, almost as long on website chat, and I have never been able to get a human on the phone. I arrived at the airport early so I could checkin and grab a bite to eat without feeling rushed. That was an hour ago, they have a line of at least 50 people but none of their ticket counters are open. This will be the last time I fly with Avianca.

### "I will never fly with Avianca again"
Not Verified |  Avianca changed my flight by 4 hours and the flight no longer worked for us. I tried contacting Avianca through their call center, email and Whatsapp and this was my experience: 1) The call center had me wait for more than an hour many times and I was never able to talk to a human being. 2) I wrote dozens of emails (copying all their available email addresses) and not one of them were answered. 3) I used their WhatsApp robot and each time they asked me to stay online while a representative contacted me. Their response would normally come 4-12 hours later (sometimes while I was asleep). They would write two quick messages: the first one stating that they wanted to help me and the second one (immediately after the first one) stating that since I was not online they were ending our conversation. When I finally was able to answer the message within 30 seconds, the representative told me that he couldn't help me and that I needed to contact the call center. My conclusion: I will never fly with Avianca again, if I can help it.

### "pay $65.00 for the 22 pounds luggage"
Not Verified |  My parents went back to El Salvador this morning. When the attendance was checking their luggage, she started saying that they have to pay $65.00 for the 22 pounds luggage, she stated that it was oversized. They didn’t have any problems when they came last week, but apparently the luggage growths in 10 days. After a long arguing, my parents decided to paid the amount. While boarding the airplane, they also realized that other passengers luggage couldn’t even fit in the bag storage because their luggage were larger than my parent’s. Is this fair? This is really unacceptable.

### "waited for the refund for nearly a year"
We have requested a refund for our flights from Panama City to Bogota in April 2020, which were cancelled due to Covid-19, and have so far not received our money even though our refund request was confirmed in December 2020 and payment was meant to be transferred within 30 days. I have tried to contact Avianca via phone, e-mail, Facebook, Instagram and have not received one single response from them. I don't understand how this airline can be part of Star Alliance, in my view it is a complete scam. I do understand times are difficult for airlines but I have waited for the refund for nearly a year and it is simply inacceptable that there is not customer service whatsoever. Next thing I will have to do is instruct a lawyer overseas to claim my money back, which is really annoying.

### "Worst airline website and customer service"
Not Verified |  I can't book a flight on their website, round trip is cheaper than one way, why? I called their number to try to get the flight booked, no luck, no body answers, chatting is the same. Worst airline website and customer service, only using as it is the only airline going to my destination. The prices are too high.

### "Avianca you are a shame"
I had a ticket to fly to Cali back on July 2020 and because of the pandemic I was forced to change it and I decided as well change the destination country, so I picked Guatemala and I had to pay a difference in the cost, hence my trip was planned to happen March 5th to March 14th, 2021 and I paid in advance all the costs I will incur in Guatemala as it is normal in a situation of vacation out of the country. Yesterday February 19th, 2021 I got at least 14 emails from Avianca letting me know that my trip from March 5th were changed, and after I was aware of those emails, I called the airline and after 1 hour and 12 minutes of waiting in the Avianca customer service line, I was attended for a nicer Avianca's representative, but the options she gave me wasn't accepted for me, neither by my family. Avianca pretended that I arrived at San Salvador at 6:20 pm by March 5th and take our connexon to Guatemala next day at 8:15 AM and no paying us the night that we are forced to stay in San Salvador. I never been in San Salvador before, and I know nobody there, so the option of staying 14 hours in the airport was unacceptable. I requested to speak with a supervisor, and this guy took 20 minutes before passing to the phone, and instead of showing me compassion and kindness, the first word he spelled out from his mouth was telling me that customers think that asking for a supervisor will resolve all their problems. In fact, it is not a good beginning of a conversation with a customer that has been in the phone 1 hour and 32 minutes. Avianca needs to give training to their supervisors and make of those guys gentle and caring for its customers. In conclusion after my long call from yesterday late at night I resolved nothing and the solution from the supervisor was repeat what the representative have told me or request a refund from Avianca with not horizon when I will be getting back my money. Avianca you are a shame, indignity and a deceive company that doesn't respect the trust and confidence your customers has put in you. I just never will purchase another air-ticket with this airline and neither I will recommend this airline to someone.

### "if you can use another airline please do"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service, I was charged four times for the same flight, each time I submitted payment I was told that the payment didn’t go through until I eventually gave up and I was successful on my first attempt on another booking site. They really had the audacity to charge us for the same flight four times, if you can use another airline please do.

### "absolutely no customer service"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly out of NY on 1/14/21. I was going to do my check in when it said I had one of my flights canceled. Avianca did not notify me of this nor did it tell me on the app which flight was canceled. I was not able to get ahold of Avianca at all on the phone. I was waiting to speak to someone for 2 hours 53 minutes. I never got anyone on the phone and hung up. I was not able to travel and had to buy a new ticket through a different airline. I will 100% not use Avianca again. It is a horrible airline, unreliable, disrespectful to the customers. There is absolutely no customer service not through email, chat nor phone. People do not trust Avianca.

### "Requested a refund in June 20202
Terrible service. Due to pandemic our flight was cancelled. Requested a refund in June 2020 and still waiting. Impossible to reach anyone to progress our refund.

### "trying to get my refund for over 3 month"
I been trying to get my refund for over 3 months. My tickets are canceled and didn’t get to flight due to the pandemic. I understand that there’s problems due to the pandemic but every time I call I have to try multiple time to be able to talk to someone I wait over 3hrs to be able to talk to someone and every single time I do there representatives are extremely rude. I asked to get a supervisor and they always say that the supervisor will say the same thing there telling, I clearly asked to please get me supervisor always with respect because they’re only doing there job, but I been counting I need told they will get a supervisor 67 time and they always hang up on me and I never get to talk to them. We don’t deserve this service.

### "now it’s the worst airline ever"
Avianca used to be okay but now it’s the worst airline ever. They cancelled my trip for COVID related reason and I haven’t been able to receive any money and any voucher. Their customer service is awful, I have spoken only once to ha person nice out of the 10 calls and 10 WhatsApp messages. They are not willing to refund my ticket because they stated: “it’s not our fault. Due to COVID we needed to cancel the flight”. I will never pay and travel with them again.

### "Very dishonest penalty fees"
Not Verified |  I was not permitted to catch my flight to San Salvador due to not having the correct covid-19 test. I took the right test, got negative results, and tried to book another flight with them, for a $200 penalty fee, but could not get through to customer service after 3 hours trying. I booked a flight with another airline. To get back from El Salvador to the U.S., I tried to use my Avianca prepaid return flight ticket, but could not use it until I paid the $214 penalty fee per person. This is despite the fact that I was not requesting any changes to my flight and called in advance before the flight. No COVID-19 test was required to fly back. The customer service representative said that the system prevented her from taking any action to override the so called no show fee that never actually happened. Very dishonest penalty fees, never fly Avianca.

### "Horrific, non caring representatives at the ticket counter"
Absolutely the worst customer service in the airport. We arrived 4 hrs prior to the flight, had submitted all pertinent COVID documents via their requested email address. We had hard copy and email/pdf proof of proper CV testing negative. My wife and 12 others were pushed aside saying we were not on some “list” to enter Nicaragua. When asked when would their list be updated, “maybe tomorrow” was their answer. As the takeoff time neared, it was evident they weren’t going to even try to call someone to confirm our (and an elderly couple from Missouri + 8 others) documents were valid and factual. The “manager” would walk up to our group then disappear as is on the phone. Finally I approached the ticket counter and tried to get a refund after the last call for boarding passengers was made. The response was “you have to do it online”. Well when I looked online at the Avianca app, they had bumped our reservation off (as well as everyone else in the group of 12) not a hint that we had an arranged flight via our e-tix. I showed them that there was no record online and they told us to call a number that we had been trying to call previously to get to the root of the issue. One ticketed passenger had been on hold for over 1 hour 15 minutes, they would not issue me proof that I was there at the ticket counter, so I took a picture of our group as proof should they say we did not show up for the flight. As an American citizen, I should say all email responses from them were in Spanish. So if you happen to not speak a foreign language, you will need a translator to decipher. You’ll also be treated as a second class citizen in Miami airport. I stood very patiently trying to speak with either of the two line representatives, only to be overlooked by those speaking to her in Spanish. We drove the hour home, and promptly called the credit card company to get our money back. Thanks only to Chase credit card for getting this resolved. Avianca I would never use nor recommend your horrible airlines in the future. Horrible website GUI if you happen to be American and unable to speak Spanish. Horrific, non caring representatives at the ticket counter.

### "Terrible Customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible Customer service. I have flown with Avianca before and the flight itself has been average, cabin staff has always been attentive and friendly. My review today is based on their customer service. I had attempted to book a flight multiple times but after inputting all the information including payment information I kept getting an error message saying they were experiencing problems and to try again later. After successfully booking a flight on the 4th try I noticed I made a typo on the first name. I immediately tried to contact Avianca to make the change but I have been on hold for over 3 hours and when they finally responded the agent just said "Hello" and hung up without even giving me a chance to respond. I also attempted multiple times to reach them through WhatsApp and web messenger but is impossible to reach them. Doesn't matter if you ask for English or Spanish they will not respond.

### "I have been on hold from 3am until 8pm"
Not Verified |  Do not go to this airline under any circumstances or you will regret it. I have been trying to contact this airline by phone, email, WhatsApp every way possible and have been unable to. I have been on hold from 3am until 8pm at night and still haven’t been able to reach someone! All I am trying to do is change my flight. I will never ever again purchase any tickets from them!

### "there wasn't social distance whatsoever"
Not Verified |  I thought this company was following the guidelines that all airlines are supposed to be following right now but I was in shock when I got on the airplane and there wasn't social distance whatsoever. They seat everybody next to each other as though everything is back to normal. Shame on you Avianca. This company must get a huge fine.

### "Avianca is a joke"
Not Verified |  Avianca is a joke. I bought flights to Brazil with one hour layover in Colombia and they have changed to 11 hours layover. I have a baby and a toddler and can’t be in a airport for 11 hours, so I have been trying to contact them by phone for two weeks and they don’t answer the phone or when they answer, they transfer me to another department and nobody answers. I was able to talk to a person two different times and after the person told me she was going to make a change on my flight, the phone hung up and I lost my almost two hours talking to her.

### "Their issue is customer service"
Their issue is customer service - you can never get hold of them in English or Spanish during business hours or off business hours. Their website has good functionality so I can be pretty powerful for making changes and taking care of stuff but if you need to contact them you’re out of luck if you have an easy flight to book for just one person it’s probably a good idea, if you need a complex order I would not recommend

### "The issue is their customer service"
The flight service and plane are fine. The issue is their customer service. If there is a problem with your flight and you must call their telephone support number, it takes a very long time for anyone to answer and when they do, they rarely solve the booking issues. I spent over 30 hours on the phone with them over 5 days to get my seat allocated. (Essentially I was trying to upgrade my flight and they didn't process the card properly and didn't bother to inform, then later in the week I call them again and they tell me they've totally cancelled my flight and that I won't be able to fly with my wife and son - the story goes on but this is just part of it) It was one of the most stressful experiences I have gone through, when with other airlines the issue would have been resolved in a couple of hours. I strongly recommend avoiding Avianca.

### "nothing but disappointing and unsatisfactory"
Not Verified |  This is the first and last time we will fly with Avianca as long as there are are other options. I would strongly suggest flying Delta or JetBlue and dealing with a layover than dealing with Avianca. Our first experience with this airline has been nothing but disappointing and unsatisfactory. The agents working at the terminal (not all but I can count about 6) are rude, impatient, and lack basic customer service skills. In addition, to when you call Avianca they do not answer! I spent 5 hours trying to call, live chat and even used the WhatsApp messenger to try to get through to an agent and nothing. It is truly upsetting. We were forced to miss our flight due to something minor and were given no advice or direction. The agents tell you one thing and then another agent tells you another thing and then their website tells you something different. We tried to fly standby and it was such a terrible experience. First off, the agents at the same terminal told us the night before to come tomorrow so that we can accommodate you as standby. Well we get to the airport and the agent tells me we have to wait until 10pm and then he tells me to wait until 10.30pm. In addition, he then proceeds to tell me that the flight to El Salvador is overbooked. Unacceptable and unsanitary!

### "worst airline I have seen"
Not Verified | I was supposed to fly from San Jose, Costa Rica to San Francisco end of Mar 2020, however, Costa Rica locked down on Mar 16 which I have to cancel and asked for ticket refunded immediately as I did not know when I could leave. Can you imagine, it takes more than 6 months, I still not get the refund until now as they were trying to convince to get voucher, however, with my situation, I wasn't based in Avianca service zone, I was not able to use those voucher. The customer service is like a robot, keep answering the same "we have no further info" etc. A company with no service. It doesn't worth any single penny, The worst airline I have seen.

### "sell tickets to not-existing flights"
We booked a flight London - San Cristobal which was canceled due to the pandemic. Then we asked for a refund but hadn't received it for 5 months. We used a voucher to book another flight Quito - San Cristobal on September 3rd. The flight was AV1636. We had to buy another ticket to Quito. Two days before the flight we contacted Avianca using the chat and they confirmed that the flight AV1636 was scheduled on time. When we arrived in Quito and tried to check-in for AV1636 but we couldn't. We contact Avianca using the chat and another guy told us that the flight was canceled a long time ago and they didn't even notice us. So I am assuming they sell tickets to not-existing flights. We don't know what is going on in the management of Avianca company but we don't trust them anymore. Our friends who booked a similar flight with Latam have already received a refund.

### "They gave us flimsy excuses"
We booked tickets from Guayaquil to JFK with a 2 hr 20 min layover in Bogota. The plane that was going to take us from Guayaquil to Bogota was delayed by 20 minutes, so Avianca automatically rebooked us on the next flight from Bogota to New York which would take off nine hours after our original flight. On our flight from Guayaquil to Bogota, the plane took off before they finished the safety video. When we landed in Bogota 15 minutes after our scheduled time, we asked the service desk agent if we would be able to board our original flight to New York since we would have two hours to do so. The service desk agents were not compassionate with their responses and told us that we can board the original flight if we would not like to see our luggage. They gave us flimsy excuses and said it would take more than two hours to transfer our bags from one plane to another and that Avianca would not take responsibility due to high air traffic. We were not offered meal vouchers for the extra ten hours we would be stuck in the airport.

### "Don’t expect any help"
Early hours of the morning we arrive at the airport in Rio De Janeiro. I was then told that I could not board because I didn’t have a hard copy of my yellow fever certificate. I had pictures. I told my friend to go as we’d booked multiple flights via Bogotá. The staff just left me in the airport. They said wait 24hrs for the desk to re-open. As a young female, alone, this was very scary. A random lady in the airport kindly offered to help me because I was in tears. She called the number for me. Took me 7 hours to get my flight changed. They told me I could go via a different country. A refund would take a month. You had to go through a long lengthy process. Not one person from the airline helped me. I was handed a business card with a number and no phones worked in the airport. Went to a hostel. Called everywhere around Rio to find the embassy or a place to print off a new card. My UK doctor sent my records, these were not accepted. In the end I flew to Peru. Once in Peru, still not guarantee of getting on a flight to Colombia (even though I was told I would be allowed and after waiting a few days). Finally, they told me where I could go and get another printed (not that anyone had mentioned this for days). Got on the flight and reunited with my friend (finally). I also found out that not everyone was asked for this card, so I happened to be a spot check! It was the most exhausting 5 or so days of my life. Please be so cautious. Read all of their terms and conditions. It did not say this anywhere in big print on their website or the tickets or we wouldn’t have booked or tried earlier to sort it. It’s worth it to pay more with another airline or make sure you check EVERYTHING. Even so, if something goes wrong. Don’t expect any help from this airline.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service I have ever received. Avianca cancelled my flight from Buenos Aires in March (due to COVID), and I've been waiting for my refund for 4 months now, without any confirmation that I'll ever receive it. To repeat, they cancelled the flight - and haven't confirmed they will be providing me with a refund? I've called numerous times, only to be told that "the refund department is working on it" and "we cannot confirm if they will provide you with a refund.

### "still waiting for our refund"
Not Verified |  We bought business class RT tickets back in October Medellin to Madrid. Our flight to Madrid on Feb 17 was ok but certainly not business class standards. We needed to return from Madrid before our original date because of CoronaVirus. Because Madrid was shutting down foreign air travel, we needed to move our return trip to Mar 17 (originally Mar 23). Avianca refused to honor our tickets and made us buy same-day, one way ridiculously priced tickets in coach or give them another $3000 to use our original tickets. As time was a huge factor, we bought the last minute tickets. We got our seats but were stunned to see that Avianca put all 40-50 passengers in the first set of rows in coach including middle seats - during a pandemic when Spain had some of the highest cases and death rates in the world. I wish I had taken pictures of the sardine can they created. As it turned out, Avianca cancelled our flight for the original date, Mar 23. We also noticed that no one was flying business class but they had no problem dismissing us. It is June and we are still waiting for our refund. I will never fly them again. Ever.

### "never fly Avianca again"
First flew with Avianca to South America back in 09'. Great flight, staff, service, food and beverages. Fast forward 10 years later. I have flown with them many times to my wife's birthplace of Colombia and the drop all aspects in just a single decade is unfathomable. Food is bland and the staff are mostly indifferent. The kicker for me this time was after my flights. I was stuck for 24 hours due to civil unrest in Quito. I just wanted to get out. United, one of their partners, was not coming to get me and other ticketed passengers. I bit the bullet and bought a ticket that would get at least to Bogota Colombia so that I could then get back to the States and decided to fly to Miami since that was the cheapest flight at the last minute. I bought the ticket. Went to check in. The Avianca check in agent for the flight asked why I had two flights with them-turns out that while I was buying a ticket directly with them at the Quito airport at their counter, United had rebooked me with Avianca for later on that day since they were partners. The agent looked into it and stated I should keep this flight because they knew it was going out-the plane and staff were there whereas the later flight was still a risky one to depend on-it could get canceled. I took it to Bogota and once there United was able to get me back to Houston. Thus, there was absolutely no reason to fly to Miami so I just didn't take that flight. Shortly thereafter, I contacted Avianca about a refund for the flight I didn't take in this unusual situation. Surprisingly, within a week they got back with me and gave me about a $35 refund! The flight I didn't take was at least a $400-$500 flight. I called back. I was given the run around for months. At no point, could Avianca provide any sort of cost breakdown as to why I was getting at least less than 10% of the value of the flight back-AND I had been an Avianca miles member for a decade! I called in at least 6 times and no one could ever answer my question-I mean how did I even get that tiny refund? Frankly, they used their English language barrier to continue to give me the run around for months-until I finally gave up. Well, all that means is that I will never fly Avianca again. What a total fiasco.

### "ignoring social distancing guidelines"
Not Verified |  After 5 days of travel to even get to the airport - and max scrutiny for safety and social distancing compliance - shoes disinfected luggage sprayed - hours in line for the bus and the hotels all 6 feet apart-45 mins to board the plane standing in like 6 feet apart. Get on the plane every seat full, no social distancing measures except masks which for my daughter she’s been wearing for 5 days - how in the world is this safe or acceptable. Colombia has been on a full quarantine with people stuck in their homes with limited access to outdoors even and they have an airline completely ignoring social distancing guidelines.

### "Avianca is the worst airline"
New York to Cali via Bogota. Avianca is the worst airline and has a terrible customer service! They let me wait for 2 hours 48 minutes on the phone today March 15, 2020. When, finally they answer I asked them to change my itinerary and they told me I have to pay $1,300 for the change when the airplane is basically empty. People is afraid to fly due the Coronavirus and Avianca is just expensive rip-off company. I will not recommend it to anyone. They had changed flights to us in the past with no reason and they never refund anything but when we need to change flights they just grossly overpriced. I hope they are not continue in business and people choose another airlines.

### "no delays, friendly staff"
Medellin to Cartagena. I have flown with Avianca a few times in Colombia. Everything is rather routine. No big check-in queues, no delays, friendly staff. They offer a drink during the flight but no stacks - which is okay considering that most flights are around 1 hour. Flights within Colombia do tend to get a bit bumpy though.

### "What a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Bogota to Armenia with Avianca. What a terrible airline. It’s the second time they’ve change my itinerary regardless of my other flights. They just do whatever they want and the customer service is worthless.

### "Good value for money"
Not Verified |  Munich to Bogota. Good value for money as typically direct routes from Europe to South America tend to be kind of expensive. The flight was on-time and the cabin crew was friendly and everything was uneventful. The seat and the entertainment system were not that great but still within acceptable limits. The food served was below what I would have expected but not bad for airline food.

### "Poor customer Service"
Bogota to Munich. Poor customer Service as there was no answer on following bad experience:  headset has a low quality. It feels cheap and does not work perfectly. Onboard meals are very very low quality. The meat was dry and Ravioli did not taste well. Mushroom not cooked. Same dry meat also in the Omlette! No Menu card was provided. Flight attendent did not know what to choose from. Kitkat as part of dessert? There are not much films in German language. Seat was very dirty. Lounge in Bogotá is very low standard. Food is in low quality and not much to choose from. Space is very limited. No water in bottles.

### "No access to TV monitor"
Bogotá to Los Angeles. No access to TV monitor, reset it several times but no luck. There was no access to map. Seats control not working properly and fully extended, and the headsets were not cleaned and in a bag. Very old aircraft, I used to fly in the Boeing 787 from LAX to Bogota, but they downgrade the aircraft.

### "bad customer service"
San Salvador to Dallas Ft Worth. Really bad customer service, Will never fly with them. They charge you extra for everything, after paying $1000 for a ticket, just because is a busy time of year.

### "customer service is terrible"
Bogota to New York. The worst, they changed my ticket for 7 hours later without asking, I’ll be super late in NY always making changes because they do not know how to sell tickets. They just said my ticket has been changed, I was supposed to arrive at 1:30 am and now I’ll arrive at 3:40 am according to the lady Who just notified me that it was changed, the customer service is terrible.

### "terrible customer service"
San Francisco to San Jose via San Salvador. My girlfriend and I booked a flight from San Francisco to San Jose, Costa Rica on December 22nd. The flight was canceled for mechanical reasons (after we boarded the 5:45am flight and sat on the airplane for almost 2 hours). The next flight they could get us on was more than two days later. This was unacceptable for us so we booked on another airline and asked the gate agent for a refund. She said we have to request a refund from the call center. So we were on with customer service for over an hour and they said we had to request a refund online but their system was down so we would have to wait. We have been trying for 5 days to request the refund but the site is still not accepting requests. Meanwhile, we are in Cost Rica (via United Airlines) and I get an email saying it is time to check in for our return flight. Huh?? The email included an itinerary saying that we flew to Costa Rica on Avianca airlines on December 24th, which we certainly did not - we were never told we got rebooked on that flight, never got any email saying so, never got a check-in reminder, etc. And now nobody from customer service will speak to us. It is my opinion that they just “re-booked” us on another flight without telling us in order to avoid having to pay a refund. This is a terrible airline with unacceptably terrible customer service

### "cabin staff were friendly"
Los Angeles to Guatemala City. The cabin staff were friendly, seats were comfortable and clean. Food and drink was provided, and blankets, pillows, and headphone. The flight attendance offered more spacious seating to a larger lady since there were empty seats. They offered me a direct flight at a sooner time since it was available instead of my later flight with a lay-over in El Salvador.

### "Avianca will not take responsibility"
Managua to Toronto via San Salvador. We have only flown twice with Avianca and we are not fluent in Spanish. The costs mentioned are for two people. 1st Trip - 2nd portion delayed until next day. They did provide a hotel for the night. However we missed our $80 shuttle and the 1st day of our vacation ($$?). 2nd Trip - 1st portion delayed and type of plane changed last minute so we could not check baggage. We had to depose of personal items that could not be in carry-on. The delay caused us to be late for the 2nd portion and miss our connecting train ($120) and so we had to arrange alternative transportation last minute (flights cost $520). We also missed 24 hrs of family time the day of Christmas Eve. We interacted with perhaps 12 staff during our trip, asking for Avianca to change the final destination to where the train was intended to get us to. Two were sympathetic and the remaining ten were incapable or incompetent. They would tell us to stand in one line only to be later told that we had to go to another line until finally we had to catch our flight. Avianca will not take responsibility when they fail to fulfill the contract made when purchasing a ticket.

### "I hate this airline"
Houston to El Salvador. Our flight was at 355pm and it is now 545pm. We have been stuck in this plane for hours and nothing looks promising. This is unacceptable and it's a horrible situation to be in. I hate this airline.

### "gave me nonsense options"
La Paz to Bogota. Late again. They delayed for about two hours and didn't give any type of compensation for this (not that a bottle of water or a snack matters to me, but shouldn't a reputable airline do the minimum to show that at least they care?). I was notified by email that the airline would be departing late, so I arrived later to the airport accordingly as the departure time was around 2 AM and wanted to rest a bit more at home. When I reached the airport about 2 AM, counter was closed already and wasn't sure what was going on. I was standing in line and no body came to assist me until I walked to the counter. I was told the staff finished their work and couldn't check my bag, so they offered to send me without my luggage or the next day. Either option was not workable for me as I don't live there and had to take three other flights after this one. I was upset as they didn't put a real effort in helping me and only gave me nonsense options. I talked to another person in the counter who didn't help much in the beginning, but after some begging, she reluctantly called in and thankfully the police agreed to check my bag. I was put in high stress as I had to figure out what to do in case the police wouldn't check my bag. My next flight after AV was with Lufthansa, which was late one hour, but they apologized at least three times throughout the flight. I didn't hear any apologies from AV and they wanted to send me without my bag (do you realize how ridiculous this sounds?) I hope they step up their customer service game (ground service) The plane was actually a nice one as it is still a new one with decent entertainment system. I visit LP a few times a year and find the BOG connection convenient. I will still give them a chance as they are part of Star Alliance. But if problems persist, I will need to take another airline.

### "will never fly Avianca again"
São Paulo to Fort Lauderdale via Bogotá. I booked Avianca cause it was cheaper then flying American or LATAM Brazil. So my flight from São Paulo to Bogota was scheduled to depart at 12:45 AM, so I got on the plane, I flew business class, but when I sat down on my seat (1A), they didn’t serve a single peanut for the whole 5 hour flight to Bogotá. The seats, which were in business class barely reclined and were not comfortable. And this is the 1st airline I’ve flown on that didn’t let me use their in-flight entertainment system or the stow-away TV. So I wanted to use the tv before takeoff, but there were way too many ads that you couldn’t skip and before takeoff the flight attendant made me put the tv away. So I slept a bit, but I couldn’t sleep that much because I couldn’t get comfortable, and my phone had no battery, so I tried to get the tv, but the flight attendant came out of nowhere and told me to put it away. The 2nd flight from Bogota to Fort Lauderdale was better but the flight attendant didn’t speak much English so we couldn’t really communicate and I was sitting in my seat (1C) and they gave food - the 2 food options were an omelette and some mozzarella thing, so I asked for the mozzarella thing, but she gave me the omelette, which was disgusting. I was thirsty so I asked a flight attendant for water, but she never came back, so I called another flight attendant and she got me some water. So we arrived at FLL but when I got to baggage claim, they (Avianca) lost one of my bags! I will never fly Avianca again!

### "Frustrated and disappointed"
Not Verified |  Bogota to La Paz. Frustrated and disappointed at Avianca's cancellation. I was flying from Paris to Bolivia, connecting thru Frankfurt and Bogota. My first flights were with Lufthansa and last one with Avianca. I took with this airline because it is part of Star Alliance and wanted a streamlined process while getting some miles. I had a long day as Paris was on strike and almost missed my flights, but LH managed to take us to our destinations. When I reach BOG for my last flight, I was surprised to see the cancelled flight. This is frustrating for me as I will be spending less than a week with my family in Bolivia and taking away a day from me means significantly. I'll still give them a chance in the future as I had high views on this airline, but it is starting to change and I hope they can keep up with the brand name and airline alliance reputation. I was given with a new ticket and a hotel voucher ... but I can't give them credit for that as that's what they are supposed to do. This compensation means nothing as reaching my destination on time was more important.

### "never fly with Avianca again"
Not Verified |  Cusco to Rio de janeiro via Lima. Because whats happened in Bolivia and that my governmnet warned me from going there I had to cancel the Lima to La Pas part. The warning came just the day before my trip and I could not get in contact with them until I was in Lima. I went to the counter in Lima and ask If there was any problem to do that, they said Its no problem and I can use this part of the trip within a year. This morning when I came to the airport they could not find my booking and they could not help me in the counter at all, had to ask the tourist office to help me call them, and after 2 hours telephone queue I got to know that they canceled my ticket and the only thing they could to is to help me to write a complain about that they didn't inform me about this. It would take 7 days before I would get any answer and maybe a new ticket. I have another flight from Rio tomorrow evening so had to book a new ticket and pay 600 euro. I would never fly with Avianca again.

### "avoid at all cost"
Not Verified |  London to Lima via Bogota. Cancelled our flight 1 day before departure. Delayed our flight out to Bogota but didn't update our connection flight to Lima. Struggled to get a refund confirmed, even after getting a refund request submitted we've been told to wait indefinitely until they process it. They don't know how long this will take! Ridiculous. We've then had to buy new flights last minute to get to Lima on time to make sure our itinerary isn't disrupted. Original flight cost £808 for two people. New flights have now cost us £1,450 for two people and we don't even know when we'll get our original flight refund back! Terrible service, avoid at all cost.

### "The flight got cancelled"
Bogota to Cartagena. The flight got cancelled due to "weather conditions", while we were informed, we could see the viva colombia take off to Cartagena in the Back through the nice glass of the airport. After this cancellation by higher forces, we were put on hold and finally booked to a flight 4 hours later. The flight was packed and on top we lost the business class status and had not only to travel Economy, furthermore we got a middle seat each of us, one in the left, one in the right row of the seats. When I asked for a compensation due to the loss of the status I was told that it was not possible but at the same time we would be charged an additional fee, cause the switch to another flight was considered a change of the reservation which we would need to pay for. I feel frauded, we did not even get a better meal or anything as a compensation. So we travelled economy for business class price, without being able to choose seats, sit next to each other, or even have any of the benefits other business class passengers would get on the flight. Ground personnel seemed rather helpless and overwhelmed with the situation, even unable (or unwilling) to at least provide us a contact, where we could address our claims to in the aftermath. They only advised us, to use the contact function on their webpage, which I tried, but did not function (the link was dead) Concerning the flight itself, the seats were normal, the inflight entertainment in my seat was broken. All Avianca employees were extraordinary polite and nice but in the same level overwhelmed and unable to provide useful information or solutions.

### "customer support shockingly bad"
I was traveling in Colombia and have booked multiples of internal and international flights and a number of things happened in the space of 4 weeks with this particular airline. I booked internal flights and international flights where I’ve a ‘confirmation email’ that clearly states that payment was successful. On the day of the flight, my details did not appear and they couldn’t care less. They even say, book a different airline (one of their competitors). They are meant to be premium economy and part of Star alliance but their service isn’t up to scratch. The budget airline Viva gave me fantastic service and even helped me quickly and efficiently. So if you’re a foreigner, stay less than 60 days and flying out of the country. You can request to be refunded the airport tax at check in. Which I did, I have a transaction reference and they said it will go back on my card. It didn’t so I reached out to customer service who basically told me a spiral of lies including ‘my card company is withholding the transaction’ and tried to fob me off. I still insisted and they said they can’t refund me as that has to be done on ground level. But I requested this and it’s Avianca as a company responsibility to ensure my refund is processed. It went back and forth - still ongoing but they are saying they can’t give it me even though I did what I needed to do which was request it at check in. So this lies with aviancas staff mistakes and they won’t accept or resolve this. They’ve changed my flight times without telling me which meant I almost missed my flight. Customer service both on ground level and customer support via emails are shockingly bad. Avoid them and use other airlines like Latam and Viva Air - at least the budget airline treats you better than this fake premium economy.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Washington to El Salvador. Both of my husband's flights were delayed, when flying to El Salvador and when flying back to Washington, the flight was delayed by 9 hours going to El Salvador and 4 hours coming back to Washington! In both times the reason according to them was because of technical problems, which I don't believe. I don't recommend this airline

### Avianca customer review
More than 4 months ago we bought plane tickets to fly to Havana from Santiago. The original date was November 16 and return on the 23rd of the same month. We bought for that date because we will participate in a congress. We called to Avianca November 5th and they said to us that they change our ticket unilaterally, the new date is November 17 and returns on the 22nd on the same month. I explained to them that this date did not serve me since I lost two days of course and two days of hotel but they were not able to offer me any solution besides that they do not want to reimburse the money thay we spend for those two days me for the hotel and the course.

### "cancelled our flight"
Washington to San Salvador. Avianca cancelled our flight no email nothing, even the staff at the front of Avianca say "we just found out now". Also when calling to reschedule I got hung up three times before getting thru then they have an English line but waited 20 min and still got hung up on finally get someone on the phone and did even correct my ticket correctly, then asked for a discount because this is a huge inconvenience and the guy didn't even care. Also got shorted and day and still for the same price ? does not make any sense.

### "delayed our flight constantly"
Cusco to Lima. Definitely do not recommend flying with Avianca. They delayed our flight constantly for 6 hours, giving us different excuses. Several of us had connecting flights and needed to know if we had to find alternatives, but were told that a plane would be coming soon. The supervisor was conveniently in a meeting during most of this. When several people asked for a refund, they were told that it would not be possible. When we asked if there was any way they could help us by allowing us to fly on another flight or asking another airline for assistance, they said there was nothing they could do. We were given coupons for a free meal while we waited to a small cafe, which ran out of food quickly and ended up resorting to bread with a slice of meat. When I was finally home, I filed 2 complaints because the first time the person on the phone didn't file it correctly. They are willing to give me $22 in credit or some miles with them. That's pretty petty I'd say. I won't ever fly with them again and I would encourage others to avoid them as well.

### "Very unreliable airline"
Washington to Managua via El Salvador. Both when flying to Nicaragua and flying back home to Washington the flight was delayed by 5 hours-6 hours each time in El Salvador! The first time flying to Nicaragua no reason was given for the delay other than the flight was canceled. The second time was due to a “delay”. Very unreliable airline and my understanding talking with others is that this is very common.

### "most unreliable airline"
Río de Janeiro to Quito via Lima. Have to say, probably the most unreliable airline in the industry. Every time I book with Avianca something ridiculous happens turning a simple flight into a significant emotional event that last days. They just can’t get their stuff together and do the basics. The staff tend to be equally uninformed and tell customers anything to move them along but their info is usually incorrect. Really, I been fooled a few times because they seemed to have better timings than LATAM on some routes, but of what use is the schedule when they couldn’t keep the timings if their lives depended on it. Another important trip blown by Avianca’s incompetence - total disappointment and unreliable.

### "everything moved along efficiently"
The baby bus A319 was indeed a small plane, but everything moved along efficiently. We boarded on time, were airborne on time and arrived at the destination ahead of schedule. Decent legroom, nothing to rave nor complain about, but more importantly the boarding process was seamless and so was the disembarking process. Baggage arrived with zero issues. Worthwhile noting that tickets were expensive though - US$375 per person for a one-way ticket. Breakfast was a tiny sandwich with juice, certainly a long way from satisfying hunger pangs but still better than having nothing at all. Despite all the negative reviews here, it's one of the only options from La Paz to Lima since it was one of the only two airlines flying this route, apparently, hence just cross your fingers and hope for the best. Do not be afraid after reading all the negativity here. Not all is bad.

### "Really bad service"
Bogota to Pereira with Avianca. Seat 1c, no air con for over 45mins. We took off 1.15hrs late. No snacks, drinks weren't offer to me. Staff just spoke to their mates on the place. Really bad service.

### "have nothing to complain about"
Bogotá, Colombia to Santa Marta, Colombia. I have nothing to complain about. The flights cost less than half the cost of what comparable flights would cost in the U.S., and the plane and seating seemed pretty standard for coach service. I didn't get a choice of seat with the fare I chose, but I was happy I got a window seat both ways. I'd fly Avianca again without hesitation.

### "so-called business class"
Bogota to San Andres Isla. The only way that I can describe our "business class" or so-called "Clase ejecutiva" experience is what a joke. It is truly unbelievable that an airline like Avianca when there are so many options and competitors on the market treat customers like that. They robbed us in the most stone-faced way. Their business class is nothing more than the first 3 rows of seats being separated by a curtain from the coach class with exactly the same seat 3x3. No In-flight entertainment, no WI-FI, no reading material besides the safety card and I believe, in the longest flight this airline has within Colombia (1:40 min +taxi ), one cup of coffee or soda (not even the whole can) was offered. At my request of another drink or food even to buy, the flight attendant "politely" denied my request and simply told us nothing was available. I wonder why my wife and I along with one more passenger were the only ones on that "exclusive" side of the plane. They definitely got us and looking at the extremely low quantity of people flying on that cabin, it looks that already other people learned their lesson and sprayed the word among others not to pay that step up in price for absolutely nothing in return. Shame on you Avianca. I used to be so proud of flying in your planes back in the day but looking at how low have you become a cheap airline, I am going to make sure myself, family and friends will look elsewhere for our future flight needs.

### "nice for domestic short-haul"
Short-haul flight, good service. Only problem a short delay for take-off caused by ground traffic. Overall nice for a domestic short-haul flight. Will choose it again.

### "do not fly with this airline"
I took a flight from Buenos Aires to Miami with a lay over in Lima. I had never been mistreated this way, the on board personal are very rude. You are not getting anything for free your paying full market fare. Please take my advice and do not fly with this airline.

### "they are having problems"
Bogota to Munich. This is the worst airline service I have taken in all my life. Most of the flights are delayed for hours on end for no apparent reason, customer service offer no help, are often rude to customers, and the service at the airport is very unfriendly. I have taken about 10 Avianca flights this year, nationally and internationally, and I have had problems with 8 of them. Apparently there is shortage of planes by the airline and they are having problems worldwide, but they are solving the problems by affecting the customers. Today they decided to inform me that my flight, leaving later tonight from Bogota to Munich, would be 4 hours delayed, with no reason given. This has affected all my travel arrangements and costed me a lot of money to fix.

### "a great flight experience"
Los Angeles to Bogota. We had a great flight experience. Boarded on time. Departed on time. Comfortable seats with full lay down. Extremely friendly, good service. Very nice amenity kit. Flight was AV 89. Definitely would fly them again.

### "the crew was very kind and friendly"
Not Verified |  My flight was from Bogotá to Madrid in business class with Avianca. I was the last one to board, but the crew was very kind and friendly. My seat was slightly broken in the bottom and there was a paper in it when I boarded the airplane. Also, the crew offered me chocolate ice cream for dessert but sadly, later they said they had run out of it. In pite of that, I asked to watch the sunrise and they took me to a place just behind the control cabin to watch it in a window that seemed specially designed for that.

### "didn’t receive the ticket"
Not Verified |  Medellin to Barcelona. Only 2 seats were available at that overseas flight. We bought them online. We should received electronic ticket before 8 hours according to the reservation conditions. We didn’t receive anything. We called several times the call center and when to a sales office. First time, Call center told us to wait 18 hours. After that time we didn’t receive the electronic ticket. Sales office couldn’t tell us the status. It was not possible to buy another ticket in another flight as they still were validating. We called again call center and told us that we should wait until the day of the flight to know if the payment when through (we complained as this is out contract conditions). Finally, 24 hours later they cancelled the booking. They, even, didn’t try to process the payment as the bank didn't send any failed attempt (as they usually send when there is any error). Finally, we checked for the same tickets and they were 1200 USD more expensive. We bought a different one for 600 USD more expensive. Obviously, they wanted to make sure to sell those tickets and to sell them to the higher price.

### "noticed a decline in the quality"
San Salvador to San Francisco. I have flown Avianca many times and have noticed a decline in the quality of their services. I usually travel business class from SFO-SAL-SFO - the last time on August 11 of this year. On the SFO/SAL leg of my trip I took AV 565 (an early morning flight) in business class and, while the crew was attentive and the seat relatively comfortable, the food was atrocious. We had no choice of meal as they ran out of a second option (there were only 12 business class passengers) and wound up eating some sort of a omelette burrito stuffed with bacon which was just inedible. I have had better meals in Economy. Once we landed, my bags took for ever to be delivered at the carousel even though they had the "priority" tag (I saw plenty of other bags from the same flight without the priority tags before mine turned up). On the SAL/SFO leg of my trip (AV 560), the plane - an A320- had old recliner seats (the sort one sees in domestic first class for 1 hour trips). The entertainment selection lacked personalized screens AND the music channels were not operational - this was a long 5 and half hours flight, so the combination of a relatively old and uncomfortable seat, paucity of choice for movies and no music at all made it for a particularly boring time. I might add that the food offering was also mediocre: we were offered some nuts with a drink prior to the meal (not warmed up, either) which consisted of a choice of chicken, beef or vegetarian selection. Thie beef was tough and flavorless (no matter how much salt and pepper I poured on it) and was followed by a mediocre mousse-like dessert. Again, the experience was salvaged by the attentive and nice flight attendant which, on both legs, were the only positive aspects of the experience aboard Avianca. i would not recommend that anyone spend the 60,000 miles required for a round trip from SF0/SAL on Avianca. One barely gets the sort of service expected during a short domestic hop; old seats lacking the bells and whistles of modern business class, horrible food and indifferent luggage handling for priority tagged bags. Not worth either the $$ or the miles.

### "Both flights were delayed"
Not Verified |  Took flights with Avianca from Cali to Bogotá to Valledupar. Both flights were delayed by more than 1h,r lounge in Bogotá ran out of food quickly at around 13:30. Very basic food and beverages. In short, I only take Avianca if there's no other choice, and from Cali that's usually the case. Flights are ridiculously expensive as well.

### "kindness of Avianca crew member "
Not Verified |  I am very grateful for the kindness of an Avianca crew member on the ground in the Havana airport who helped me save an artwork that I had purchased in Cuba but that was confiscated by the customs personnel at Havana airport. This man would not let me go back to the departure gate to check my carry-on bag so that I would not have to discard the artwork even though there was lots of time before our flight was to depart. I asked the Avianca staff person at the gate for help, and she went to customs, got the artwork out of the trash, had me put it in my carry-on, and helped me check in the bag. She went out of her way to help me. Unfortunately, the piece had been broken when it was tossed out, but I am hoping I can fix it. Also, at SFO I missed the last subway train home because it took 90 minutes for our luggage to be unloaded, but that's not Avianca's fault - it's because SFO makes them park very far away from the terminal.

### "Horrible staff"
Bogota to New York. Horrible staff, I was sick with a doctors note and was ordered to lay down. Flight attendant would pester me to move and after a bit of arguing she responded with “Ok, I’ll Let you stay but I won’t give you food.” And I stayed the whole 7 hour flight without food or drinks. As well as they handled my luggage very poorly.

### "flight was quite satisfying"
Not Verified |  Munich to Bogota. All in all this flight was quite satisfying and on time. There's a wide range of entertainment available, even in German. I ordered vegan meals, what gave me the benefit to receive my meals first. Unfortunately my "breakfast" (10 AM time of origin) consisted of tofu with soy and vegetables. The staff were quite rude when I asked for something else.

### "staff is very rude"
Cusco to Miami via Bogota. The staff is very rude. They have no training in customer service it seems. The supervisor gave me wrong information and when I called customer service the agent said that he was sorry but there was nothing he could do if one of their staff gave me wrong information. They do not own up to any mistake they make. I will not be flying with them ever again.

### "miracle they’re still in business"
Lima to Bogota. Avianca ruined the first and last day of my holiday. My husband and I were flying from Lima to Cusco direct. When I tried to check in online the day before the flight, the system said, please try again later or check in at the airport. After a few more tries, we decided to check in at the airport. When we arrived there however, they told us there were no seats for us as the flight was overbooked. The service was horrible, no excuses, nothing, just you can’t fly. We were booked on a flight much later in the day with a stop in Lima, so we arrived 10 hours later than planned in Cusco. All we got was a 60USD voucher to use in a next Avianca flight! Coming back we flew direct from Lima to Bogota in the afternoon. I checked in online and thought that for sure, everything would go smoothly this time. How wrong I was. The night before our flight we went out with friends for cocktails, when we arrived back in the hotel I had an e-mail from avianca, send just before 1am to tell me there were changes to my booking. Apparently we now had to fly at 11am, 6 hours earlier than we were supposed to. We tried contacting call centers, but nobody answered. Just a computer who told us that the afternoon flight was still confirmed. When I checked our booking however, we were checked in for the early flight! Nobody asked us if this was convenient, if we could even make it. As my husband needed to really be back for work the following day, we took the early flight as we couldn’t risk not flying at all that day. We had however very little sleep and no chance to say goodbye to my brother, who lives in Lima and who I hadn’t seen in over 6 months. At the airport again no excuses or explanation whatsoever. The flight left with almost 2 hours delay. I will not fly with aviance again, I will prefer to pay more, or even prefer a layover, at least I will not have to be stressed in advance and be able to get on the flight I pay for! I have heard the company is doing really bad and no wonder, it’s a miracle they’re still in business to this day.

### "one bad excuse after another"
Not Verified |  San Andres to Cartagena. Avianca cancelled our flights so we applied for a refund against our ticket numbers. After a week or two I get an email telling me that my application had accidentally been closed, and was provided with 2 random ticket numbers to start a new refund application with. Stupid of me not to ask whether these ticket numbers were already assigned to someone else As it turns out the money was eventually paid, except not to me. They were paid to someone who's card details I never provided and have never seen before. But somehow with my name against it. Since then, Avianca have ignored every single one of my emails completely and when I call, I get one bad excuse after another and it's made clear that they have no intention of helping me get my money back. I'm seeking legal advice.

### "staff was friendly"
Cartagena to Bogota. Most people only review when they have a bad experience with an airline. I have had several pleasurable flights with this airline within last month, including long haul from Bogota to Barcelona. This particular flight was on time, the staff was friendly and spoke good English. Boarding and disembarking went smoothly and without issues. Passengers were offered free tea and coffee during the flight.

### "had a horrible experience"
Santiago to San Francisco via Bogota. I booked my flights home through Avianca specifically because I needed to reach home to spend the last part of the July 4 holiday celebration with my family in California. I could have taken shorter routes, but this got me there at 8 pm today, July 4. During the night prior Avianca sent a note that my flights had been changed and now I come home the morning of July 5. I went to the airport and asked for help. The woman behind the counter left me standing. I am in the business class line and have business class tickets. She did not listen and she did not help me. I finally went to the gate and tried there, but the same woman moved there. She said at the counter that there were no other flights. At the gate she instead said that she cannot make changes from Santiago. All changes had to happen when I reached Bogota. Then in Bogota the agent said there is nothing he can do. I asked to even go to a different airport or whatever would work. I was in Bogota all day. I then asked for lounge access because the Internet wasn’t working. Instead he handed me a coupon for a Burger King hamburger meal and sent me on. I missed my holiday and family, and I had a horrible experience. I was exhausted and on the floor at the airport trying to charge my phone so I could contact my family. Even if I could not be helped, I could have been treated kindly. I was crying when I left the agent. I will advise others at work and home to avoid Avianca in the future based on how I was treated. The final straw is that I could not even file a complaint because their complaint system would never accept the complaint and kept cycling or advising that there were invalid characters. I tested sending only 1 character and it still would not submit so they are mechanically keeping people from providing negative feedback.

### "never fly with Avianca again"
Los Angeles to Bogota. The night before, I got an email requesting to check in with their “web check-in”, so I did. After the web check-in, Avianca sent an email with my boarding pass stating “If you only have carry-on luggage, please go directly to the boarding gate.” I only had carry on luggage, so I went directly to Terminal 3 as my boarding pass stated. After passing extensive security at Terminal 3, I looked for Avianca booths or staff but I couldn’t find any. After asking around, airport staff directed me on a shuttle bus to Terminal 2. Once I got to Terminal 2, airport staff redirected me to Terminal B. Once I got to Terminal B, airport staff said my boarding gate had not been assigned yet because it wasn’t on the monitor yet, but it would be departing from one of the gates in the same room we were in and my flight should be on one of the monitors in that section in a couple hours as it got closer to the departure time. I was in the departure area where I was told it would depart from 38 minutes before it was scheduled to depart and 51 minutes before it did depart but there weren’t any planes departing to BOG and my flight wasn’t anywhere on the monitor it was supposed to be. Airport staff didn’t see it on the monitor either. I went to two other airport staff and one of them looked up my flight with an app on his phone. Terminal 3 was listed as the departure gate so he told me I needed to go there. I took the shuttle bus back to Terminal 3, but there weren’t any Avianca booths or staff so I went over to an Alaska Airlines booth. The lady tried to help me but wasn’t able to see any Avianca departing gate info from her computer. She told me to go to the Avianca front desk outside of Terminal 3 security checkpoint. By the time I got to the Avianca front desk it was too late to get through security fast enough to make my flight. The Avianca supervisor told me there was a flight to BOG 26 hours later but that she couldn’t wave the rescheduling fee but that customer service may be able to. There shouldn’t have been a charge since I did everything I was instructed to do by Avianca, but she told me I should have checked in at the Avianca front desk before going through the security checkpoint at Terminal 3. I showed her my email from Avianca with my boarding pass instructing me to “go directly to the boarding gate” but she had no response. The supervisor then connected me to customer service to discuss possibly waiving the rescheduling fee. After talking with customer service and being on hold several times, totaling about 2 hours, they provided no alternative besides paying around $1,300 for the next day flight change. I decided not to pay an extra $1,300 to an airline for their mistakes and bought a $400 ticket back home to Seattle with a different airline. I Should have never been provided the web check-in option and told to bypass the Avianca front desk if Avianca provides no reliable way to find the correct departure gate. The flight AV89 should have been displayed on the monitors in Terminal B with all of the other flights. Avianca’s incompetence cost me about $1,600 total and tons of wasted time. I tried to resolve this through Avianca’s dispute resolution process, but they made me jump through endless hoops, accidentally closing my case many times. This lasted about 6 months and never solved anything. I will never fly with Avianca again if I can help it.

### "Avoid Avianca like the plague"
Abysmal and totally incompetent. From the conduct and service of the staff, down to the organisation and contingency planning of the airlines management. It really does beggar belief that this airline is operational. My flight was cancelled, they kept us all waiting in complete oblivion and when they did make an announcement, it was in Spanish. The flight is going to LHR, don’t you think a translation to English would be fair? Avoid Avianca like the plague. I despise this airline so much I’ll even go so far as to avoid El Dorado airport all together.

### "Thank you so much"
Not Verified |  Belize City to Panama City via San Salvador. Unfortunately, I don't have the email of Mr Alpuche and his staff. I had an issue with my passport and thanks to the Avianca Belize team professionalism, patience and willigness to help, I was able to travel to Panama and attend a very important yearly event held by my employer. It could have been easier to say "it's not possible" but fortunately, you went the extra mile, contacted all the key personnel and made it happen. Thank you so much to the Avianca team.

### "bump you and change your seat"
Bogota to Medellin. Trash airline. Avoid flying with this airline. If you pay for a seat located near row 11, they may bump you and change your seat to row 37, the 2nd row from the bathroom. And for proof I will include pics.

### "Avoid this airline!"
Lima to San Salvador. Avoid this airline! Our flight was delayed for four hours, then delayed again for two hours. We missed our tour in Quito. Avianca changed our flight for the next day, but then this flight was cancelled. They gave us a flight the following day. We lost two days of our vacation and spent 120USD on taxes. Avianca gave us a credit of 57USD. Avianca is a joke and should be avoided

### "Never had a good experience"
Bogota to Bucaramanga. I have flown all over the world in more than 40 countries. I have never seen such a nasty service. Mean, nasty people, who want to annoy you. Absolutely no kindness ever not since 1966 when I took them at 6 yo. I fly with them only because I do not pay for my ticket, my customers do. Never ever had a good experience with them. Just fact.

### "avoid this airline"
Los Angeles to Guayaquil. Only use this airline when you absolutely have no other choices! Booking ticket on their website was easy. However, the system changed my flights a couple times before my actual departure, which was confusing. Check-in counter opened late. Ground staff were extremely unfriendly and yelled at me for simply requesting aisle seat. For many other airlines, a passenger can request for preferred seat at check-in, but for Avianca a passenger needs to contact call center 24 hours before departure or check in online to self select the seat. That's what the ground staff told me in stern voice. Since most staff were spending time yelling at passengers, that's why the service was very slow. Such a low service standard in my opinion. Cabin crew provided similar level of service - poor. I was sitting at emergency exit row, but the cabin crew failed to inform me of safety procedure. Their mindset around safety were questionable. Also, a cabin crew didn't offer me food until I asked to be served. What kind of service is this?!?! Boarding was slow and delayed resulting in tiny delay in all flights. Poor to zero in-flight entertainment. Dirty seat and toilet. Old aircraft. Awful food. Again, avoid this airline!

### "catering is close to non existent"
Los Angeles to Bogota. 4.5 hour delay. Plans changed and trip cancelled: Had a Lima to Cuzco on another airline on same day of arrival and lost my ticket. Had to buy another ticket. Still waiting 3 weeks later to see if Avianca will compensate me with anything. On board catering is close to non existant. Late dinner, small portions. Worst of all no breakfast or snack with a good coffee before landing. That was a 7 hour flight! Inadmissible. Can't make up my mind yet if I should give them another chance. It will depend if they compensate for the extra money I had to spend to fly to the sacred valley.

### "pleased with the flight"
Washington to San Salvador. I was very pleased with the flight. Since we arrived the check in was quick and pleasent. The staff at check in were very friendly and helpful. The flight attendants were all very professional and attentive. It was the best experience .

### "The worst airline"
Medellin to New York. The worst airline. The staff very disorganized and unkind. The old planes and the entertainment equipment (tvs) damaged. The airline lies to its customers and fail their problems. Do yourself a fly with another airline. Lo peor cómo aerolínea. El personal muy desorganizado y poco gentil. Los aviones viejos y los equipos de entretenimiento ( tvs) dañados. La aerolínea miente a sus clientes y fallan a sus problemas. Hágase un favor viaje con otra línea.

### "my worst mid-haul flight"
Bogota to Rio de Janeiro. This is my worst mid-haul flight, the seat were terrible for Business Class! Meal was good, Flight Attendants were helpful.

### "Cabin crew were professional"
Mexico City to Bogota. The plane is small but it's okay for 4 hrs flight. Cabin crew were professional. The only problem was Check-In Process and Boarding at MEX. There's no benefits as Star Alliance Gold/ Business Class Passenger. People pass the queue as they want and the staff is just stay like a statue, I didn't know it's the Airport's fault or Avianca's flight.

### "worst customer service"
New York Jfk to Lima via Bogota / Medellin. Worst experience and worst customer service. I bought my tickets three months in advance. Finally the day of my flight arrives and just got an email (two hours before my flight) saying sorry for the inconvenience your itinerary has changed. They added another stop to my flight plus extra time. I was supposed to arrive to Lima at 9:30 am. Now it is scheduled to arrive at 5:49 pm. I called customer service. Please update your phone numbers. They have several that do not work after finally finding one that actually worked, I was put on hold for 20 mins until they hang up on me. This is ridiculous. I am told at the counter they are not responsible about what happens in Bogota and there is nothing they can do. Does this company expects their customers to be ok with whatever change they make last minute? With no excuse? Unacceptable! Will never use this airline anymore.

### "Service was excellent"
Medellin to Miami. Had my doubts about Avianca given the poor reviews posted on this site. Compared to European business class, they have a proper 2+2 set up with recline-able seats and headrests. Boarding was efficient for business class and Star Alliance Gold Members and families. Service was excellent with better than average three course meals with pre-take off 'champagne'. FAs were attentive and both legs were early/on time. IFE screens could do with an upgrade as their definition was blurred Special business class ticket meant that price wasn't that much more than standard economy. One minor niggle is it seems impossible to get anything resembling an invoice from their internet ales.

### "disgrace of a company"
Not Verified |  Boston to Santiago via Bogota. Worst airline customer service I’ve ever experienced. 14 hour delay caused us to miss a second flight, and the airline did nothing but set us up in a cheap, run down hotel in the bad part of Bogota. Absolute disgrace of a company, I’d rather drive across the continents than give them my money again.

### "disappointed with the service"
El Salvador to Washington. Totally disappointed. The Avianca lady before entering the gate for departure was disgustingly rude! She did not greet me and just shouted “your boarding ticket!” What kind of friendliness is that? Also, the day I arrived I did not know where to go so I asked for help. Both the ladies standing checking the boarding tickets refused to acknowledge me saying “excuse me” (trying to get their attention) and kept on talking instead. When they finally decided to answer me they gave me the wrong instructions (yes I got even more lost instead) it was just a way for them to get rid of me. My whole family has used Avianca but at this point now I am disappointed with the service, and will double think before flying with Avianca again.

### "attendants seemed friendly"
Lima to Cusco. I was happy to see that the tour agency that booked all my tickets booked me on Avianca, as they were a star alliance member. This meant I could use my Royal Orchid Plus Gold privileges. Our whole itinerary was from Buenos Aires all the way to New York City, making stops along the way. One thing that made me wonder straight from check in was the matter of people trying to cut queues by going to the Business class line. I went up showing my gold bag tag (I had lost my wallet hence my gold card) and the guy still asked for my name. This happened at two of the three airports I had to check in at. Star Alliance lounge in Buenos Aires is crowded not because of lack of capacity, but because too many priority pass users were getting in. When I went there they had stopped admitting priority pass but thankfully my star gold status was enough to admit me plus my mum. Due to the amount of people, I could not connect to the lounge wifi. That is quite a bummer for any lounge. Boarding was organised from A to F, with star gold getting group B. I actually liked this more than boarding with business class passengers as you can board in a more orderly fashion. I settled in seat 7K, but as two rows behind us were empty, i opted to sit by myself and give my mum an empty seat next to her for more comfort. The seat is similar to Thai airways in two aspects; it had massive legroom and a footrest. Something much appreciated on a long flight. After takeoff, service didn’t commence until halfway through the flight, and the flight attendants explained this was due to the turbulent weather while flying over the Andes. At least I ate in the lounge. A paper box served on a flimsy tray with a yoghurt, and inside the box was a potato cake which seemed to be too salty. Food on Avianca seemed to be of okay quality, not comparable to Thai airways or ANA, all of which are in the same alliance. The paper box makes the food look cheap but for environmental quality it seemed okay. We had to go to re check our bags in Lima for our flight to Cusco, and that flight was uneventful. For our flight from Cusco to New York via Bogotá, I asked for an upgrade at check in. This was met with a very quick yes. Unfortunately there was no lounge either in Lima or Cusco. Lima is a hub airport so why is there no lounge!? The boarding pass still showed I was in economy, but at the gate they said “you were already upgraded at checkin, here are your new seat numbers.” This was an older business class and I found that the seat was merely just wider and had better service. The food was still so-so but I finished as I was hungry. Apparently for our overnight in Bogotá, we found out our luggage didn’t make it to Bogotá, due to weight constraints. They arrived four hours later after being rerouted. Re-checking the bags in Bogotá, I was put first on the standby upgrade list. I wasn’t upgraded as all business class passengers checked in. The Avianca lounge left a lot to be desired. The Star Alliance Lounge finder with my filters put on indicated I could use the diamond lounge, but I was denied access and directed to the gold lounge. I was wondering why the New York flight is frequently delayed upwards of an hour, and I found out that they do strip searches at the gate. But this was to select passengers and they delay the entire flight. This was more or less the same story, and flight attendants seemed friendly. Given the choice of alliance, I wouldn’t mind flying Avianca again that much.

### "no clue where my bag is"
Bogota to Curaçao. First of all the flight had a delay of around 30 minutes when we already boarded at the plane, so far Ok, but arriving in CUR airport the luggage of around 10 people didn’t arrive and the customer experience from their ground service staff - staff took more than 1 hour to attend us, but still we understand it. He told us that our luggage will fly on the next flight to Curaçao (arriving at 16:30 local time) and it would be delivered at our hotel at 17:00. Ok, we left the airport and end up receiving 01 of 02 bags at 22:00 at our hotel. Now it’s already 08:00 AM on the next day and no clue where my bag is. Besides that i’ve been trying to call then on the 0-800, but is the worst experience that i’ve ever had with any airlines. Terrible service from their staff, one time it took more than 30 minutes on the line and the other time they told us that their system was off. - so what else you can expect from an airlines who threat their customer without any respect?

### "Do not use this airline"
San Francisco to Ibague via San Salvador / Bogota. It seems every time I fly this airline I have an issue. today I've been stuck at a airport for 7 hours for the last 52 minute flight. Yet again delayed. The airline has nothing but inconvenience after inconvenience. Do not use this airline.

### "airline so consistently unpleasant"
Medellin to New York via Bogota. I write this on the return leg of my (almost) monthly JFK - MDE - BOG commute. I have avoided AV for the longest time but now that their nonstop from New York to Medellin is a daily frequency, it's the easiest connection. The convenience just about outweighs the indignities of the AV experience, though one wonders why this airline is so consistently unpleasant. The unreliability of their operations is of course well known, not just because of the temperamental Colombian climate (which finally might be addressed with better navigation equipment) but also because of notorious ramp delays. A combination of both delayed my MDE to BOG flight, endangering my connection to JFK. At the last minute, a stony faced attendant in the lounge moved me to an earlier flight. Both international flights ran on time, which is either an improvement or an exception. Their A330s now have pretty comfortable lie flat seats. The in flight service is minimal. While the meal quality has improved from inedible to edible in an emergency, the wines remain bottom shelf supermarket. And their practice of blaring advertising into the cabin from boarding till take off is one of the most head ache making, customer unfriendly practices I have encountered in 40 years of flying. Another bizarre practice is their habit not to announce in the lounge when flights board (particularly inconvenient because their boarding times are always moving targets). Ostensibly, that's to avoid noise pollution. Instead, they announce every five minutes that they are not making announcements. Same pollution, just without informational value added. That's Avianca logic for you.

### "service was great"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Lima. The service from start to finish was great. The seats were large , the leg room great. A soft blanket and pillow were placed on every seat. The food was good and service was great. It exceeded my expectations and the flight was as good or better that many of the US planes I’ve flown

### "Reliably terrible"
Cali to Bogota with Avianca. Reliably terrible. Not the first time I’ve written a scathing review. If there’s a way they can mess something up, they will. Long lines, non-functioning app, check-in machines don’t work, make errors in the names of the boarding passes and can’t resolve them. As I write this, we might miss our flight because of one of their all-too-predictable mess ups. Seriously, do everything in your power not to fly with this airline.

### "lacks customer service"
Madrid to Bogotá. The on board service fast ok, just ok. But the ground staff lacks customer service. Every time one of the customers approached to ask a question to the counter prior boarding they were yelled by one of the ground stuff. You do not treat your customers like that. Also lacking organization and communication, there was a delay and every one of the staff were giving different information which made customers confused and anxious. Even if they had excellent products, which they don't, this kind of customer service damages the image of an entire company. Very disappointed.

### "Horrible service"
Cusco to Lima. Worst airline! They cancelled our flight and let us know 1 hour after the programmed departure time, letting us no option to take another flight that day. They tried to convinced me to take a flight at 8:30 am the next day, even when I told showed them I have a flight to Mexico at 11 am. They said I had enough time which is ridiculous talking about an international flight. They paid a 3 stars hotel when I had a 5 stars hotel paid in Lima, a reservation that obviously I didn’t use. The staff was even sarcastic when saying that’s all they can do for me. The flight they gave me the next day (5:30 am) was 1 and a half hours delayed. Finally, we arrived in Lima and they let us know our luggage was in the next flight, so I have no time to take my international flight with my bags. Horrible service, organization and company.

### "flight was overbooked"
Not Verified |  San Salvador to Los Angeles. A trip was booked with cash + miles, and Avianca provided a receipt/confirmation. At pre check-in, Avianca informed that the seat had been sold to someone else and the flight was overbooked. Even though seats were available on earlier and later flights, Avianca continued to question the validity of the receipt/confirmation it had issued and consulted and investigated internally, and did not even suggest an earlier or later flight as an option. After an hour on the phone and then another hour and half in Avianca offices, Avianca accepted the idea of booking on an earlier flight. BUT, it has not yet completed the change explaining that Avianca will complete the change in the next hour. Hours of frustration and concern over a flight that was confirmed more than six weeks ago, and still waiting to see if it has been resolved after several hours pleading with Avianca to honor its commitment.

### "have the worst customer service"
I will never fly Avianca again. They have the worst customer service. I flew out October 30 and returned November 6th. I checked a extra bag and was told it may not arrive till the day I leave. I was okay with that and paid an outrageous fee. The day I flew home I was told the bag was delayed and would be there later that day. I had my family go back to pick it up. I was advised it never made it there. I have been calling every day since with no update. I was told today that it will not be there until November 12th, over two weeks from my original trip. The customer service supervisor refused to let me speak to her manager and refused to give me a name. I would recommend to pay more and use a better airline. I will never fly again or recommend anyone I know to use this unprofessional company.

### "second time big delay"
Pereira to Bogota. Second flight in Colombia, second time big delay (8 hours first one, now 3 hours) without any sorry or customer service. Received two vouchers for burgers and they promised a 30 euros voucher for Star Alliance. Did not receive any email or notice! Take cheaper airlines and try to avoid if possible. Other airlines all were on time.

### "Never again with Avianca"
$117 usd to cross one border with a surfboard bag 16kg. Absolutely ridiculous. Booked my flights back home to Australia from Lima with Qantas but the first leg to Chile was with avianca. $117 for a 3 hr flight but with Qantas 14 hrs to Sydney than another hr to Brisbane and it’s free? Figure that out. You can buy a half decent surfboard for this. Never again with Avianca.

### "don't care about customers"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to Cusco via Lima. Horrible baggage service and terrible follow-up customer service. We booked through United Airlines and flew on United from San Francisco to Los Angeles, then changed airlines to Avian to fly to Lima, then change planes again to fly to Cusco. Our luggage didn't arrive with our flight so we asked why. Avianca baggage service told us United didn't transfer the bags to them on time to make the flight. They told us they'd have the bags brought to our hotel in Cusco later that same day. I called United Airlines baggage service to see why they delayed our bags and they told me that they didn't delay them, they transferred the bags to Avianca within 10 minutes of our flight landing in L.A. and 90 minutes before our Avianca flight departed. Avianca didn't deliver our bags by early evening, so I called baggage service again, after a lengthy wait on hold I was told that our bags hadn't arrived from Los Angeles yet but they would have them delivered to us early the next morning. Next morning, still no luggage so I called again, another lengthy wait on hold, then told that our bags left Lima but they couldn't gat any confirmation that they had arrived in Cusco. Baggage service in Cusco had no idea. We got very stressed out because we were leaving the next day to hike the Inca Trail with no change of clothes or hiking gear, not knowing if our luggage would ever arrive or if we needed to go buy all new clothes and gear. Several phone calls later and more "we don't knows" from Avianca and our bags finally arrived late afternoon of the 2nd day. I had told baggage service I wanted to file a formal complaint. They told be their Customer Service would contact me by Oct. 1st. It's now Oct. 29th and still no one has contacted me. I've called them but they're either closed for the day or no one speaks English and someone will call me soon. Still waiting for that call. Obviously they don't care about their customers.

### "super rude with no real answers"
Los Angeles to Bogota. This is my first time flying with this airline. I have not boarded the plane yet. They have canceled the flight supposedly because lightning struck it. Now we have to wait till tomorrow morning. They do not have an answer as to where we’re supposed to sleep. They haven’t offered a hotel like airlines usually do in this situation. They’re going to speak to each individual passenger. When you ask for answers they are super rude with no real answers as to where we’re going to sleep.

### "not overwhelming experience"
Lima to Sao Paulo. Friendly check in. Unfortunately there is no lounge (bear in mind Lima is a huge city, and there are some lounges but not for Avianca). They offer you a god and beverage coupon in a small fast food place, where food is really not good - disappointing. Boarding was not so pleasant, staff were rude (Peruvian people are normally so friendly I don't know what happened here). Old aircraft, my seat had old bottles from previous passenger. Toilet seat broken, you could not really use it. Food not good. Staff were friendly on board. Flight was on time. Seats are ok, not fully flat but ok for 5 hours flight. Overall not overwhelming experience but ok.

### "changed without notification"
Tegucigalpa to San Jose via San Salvador. Original itinerary was changed without any notification. First departing flight out of TGU was delayed two hours. One bag did not arrive to original departure point (TGU). After calling the Tegucigalpa desk repeatedly I was informed the staff could not access the baggage system. I was never notified about my bag being found and returned to TGU, and upon presenting myself at the Tegucigalpa desk I was told they could not see me because it was 11:10 and they were going to leave for lunch. I was asked to come back at 3. At 3:10pm I returned and they still had no information about my luggage. Upon asking for a complaint form I was told by the Tegucigalpa desk they did not have any, and I was given a blank sheet of paper to issue a complaint in, and was told they would "enter it into the system". The online Avianca complaint system does not work, and neither does the online chat. It is a farce.

### "lost my connection flight"
Panama to Boston via San Salvador. It was a terrible mistake use this airline. Flights are delayed and I lost my connection flight to Panama. They put me in another flight the next day (not even direct, with a layover in San José), and this flight was delayed too.

### "a disappointing experience"
Cartagena to Medellin. This was a disappointing experience. Check in was fine and the their is a lounge for business class passengers in the Cartagena airport. However, my seat's electronic functions for changing positions did not work. None of them work so I was unable to adjust the seat. Also, the flight attendant did not ask me if I wanted any drinks or snack during the flight. He seemed to forgot where he stopped his service. I did not ask for anything but nothing was offered either.

### "the plane was changed"
Cali to Madrid. We originally booked this flight because of the B787 plane. With my broken back and 6' stature of myself (and my husband) I needed the extra space. However, several months after booking, the plane was changed to some airline company we've never heard of, and our seats were separated (we were able to change the seats to be together). Although we weren't familiar with the plane, we presumed that the Avianca would give us a plane that was comparable to the Dreamliner, especially with the length of the flight. However, once onboard it quickly became apparent, that our 10 hour flight was not going to be what we booked or expected. Toilets didn't flush. My legs were actually up against the seat in front of me, and when the seat was reclined I was actually pinned in, couldn't move, and therefore the seat couldn't go all the way back. My husband ended up moving to the row across from me, just so that I could stretchout. They ran out of food - no egg meals, no milk for the cereal. No air vents for either fresh air. It was so warm and stagnant you could hardly breath, and they claimed they couldn't lower the temp. This plane had to be the worst and most uncomfortable experience of my flying career and when we paid for the Dreamliner, we are extremely disappointed. What was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime started out a complete nightmare. We have been attempting to file this complaint, however, first they could not find our locator number, so we had to find our tickets. So now we have our tickets and they can't take a complaint in English. We were finally able to file the complaint, we were granted a $200 voucher, but as of today, we've yet to see or hear anything more from Avianca. We have given them business in the past and a very large payment for these tickets but I'm afraid, if they don't care enough to follow thru with my disappointment we don't care to give them any more of our business.

### "Overall, was a good flight"
Los Angeles to Bogotá in Avianca on B787 in Economy. Check in was clear and efficient, but had to transfer from Terminal 3 to TBIT for Departure. Boarding went smooth, calling groups by letter. Wasn't much overhead bin space as we boarded last. Departed 5 minutes early. In-Flight Entertainment was extensive with about 15 movies and TV shows, but could be a bit glitchy during takeoff and landing. Although online they said there was WiFi, there wasn't an option connecting on board, but wasn't needed because of the great IFE. Recline was extremely good, about a good 6 inches (15 cm). Food was okay, I chose Pasta over Beef. Overall, was a good flight. A precaution is that if you would like water at other times out of the drink service and landing, you have to ask the flight attendants for it, and they do not speak too much english, so basic Spanish will most likely be needed. Arrived 30 minutes early in Bogotá. Would overall recommend Avianca.

### "ruined our trip"
We had a terrible experience with Avianca. We booked our flights in May to travel in August from Cusco to Puerto Maldonado in Peru. We tried to check in the night before travelling but the website was advising us to go to the check in desk to complete it. When we arrived there they said that our seats had been assigned to someone else for two reasons: first of all apparently we bought our tickets in overbooking and secondly our seats were assigned to someone else as the day before a flight was cancelled. When we asked how we could know that we bought our tickets in overbooking, as it wasn't mentioned anywhere, they confirmed that there was no way to know but we should have guessed it as the price was lower than normal?? They kept us waiting for two hours in case someone decided to postpone their flight and of course it didn't happen. Avianca offered to book the next available flight which was the day after but we had to be in Puerto Maldonato the same day, no other options, so we had to take a taxi (9 hours) to reach our destination on time. We asked for a refund and Avianca advised us to go to their headquarter in Cusco. We took a taxi and once arrived in the main office they told us that it wasn't possible for us to ask for a refund there but that we should have forwarded the request through the website. I would advise not to travel with this company, it totally ruined our trip and costed us $650 extra to reach our destination.

### "Try to avoid"
Puerto Maldonado to Lima. The flight with Avianca was the first section of our return flight back to Europe and we were booked in Business Class - it was one booking, one ticket. First Avianca was not able to check our luggage through to the final destination - because we "fly with another airline then". Well, one ticket, one booking. I have never heard a story like this from another airline. We had to pick up our luggage in Lima and check-in with the next airline again. Took us one hour. And it was not for customs (there was no customs check in Lima) - as they said it is "their policy". Ridiculous. Secondly we got no meals offered - on a 3 hours flight in Business Class! And when I asked whether we could have lunch I received the same answer - it is not "their policy" to serve food. c - you are not getting what you pay for.

### "had my ticket downgraded"
Not Verified |  Sao Paulo to Calgary and had my ticket downgraded without any notice. The day before my flight I tried to check in and was informed that my business class ticket had been changed to an economy ticket as Avianca had switched their aircraft. Even after calling Avianca more than 8 times to see if they could switch me to another flight or give me the ticket difference back the only solution given by them was a small compensation that could only be used on Avianca products. I paid more for a service that they are no longer offering but are still accepting payment for to only be told that the money that I could get back had to be spent with them.

### "very disappointed in Avianca"
Bogota to Aruba. We booked our flights weeks in advance and noticed during the check in period of our return flight that we were not able to do online check in. The only message we got was to find a staff member of Avianca. At the airport after queuing for long time we were notified that the flight is overbooked. Avianca overbooks all the time, why does the employee act as if she is doing this for the first time? Avianca knew 1 day ahead that flight is overbooked, why not inform us and avoid us getting up at 4:30 am and get angry at the airport? Avianca rebooks us onto an alternative which is also sold out, costing another 15 minutes to find another option -  after making a picture with the mobile phone of their computer screen that person went away to manually print our new ticket. At the counter there are 2 employees standing next to the person handling our case and she is laughing and chitchatting with them about things which are not relevant to us. Avianca allows employees at check in counters to spend so much time per customer, it is not strange that flights get even more delayed and passengers even more annoyed! We did receive the the breakfast voucher since were rebooked to a flight 10 hrs later and flight compensation EMDS. I am very disappointed in Avianca as a national airline carrier.

### "had a semi-functional seat"
Madrid to Bogota. Paid in excess of US$ 500 to have my flight changed from a code-share with Wamos Air (knowing their reputation) to an Avianca operated one with the expectation that a Star Alliance Member advertising themselves as provider of premium quality flights to Latin and South America would actually provide a decent service on a 10hr+ transatlantic flight. Check in at Madrid: absolute cluster and late Departure: late (I had a connection to make in Bogota for final flight to Medellin) On the plane I had a semi-functional seat with a broken fold down tray table which resulted with my drinks in my lap. Made staff aware of it and was given a reply of "sorry we are fully booked there is nothing we can do about that. Asked to speak to the Crew Lead who was trying to be as helpful as possible which didn't however change the fact that for every drink and meal on a 10hr flight I had to stand in the galley as my tray table was clearly unserviceable. Add to that the a budget airline quality (or lack thereof) seats and in flight service insufficient for a 10hr flight with the majority of the crew being inattentive. Avianca left half of my luggage in Bogota which I then had to wait to arrive in Medellin on the next flight. I booked Avianca as a means to not having to transit through a US airport en route to Colombia which given the lack of international transit zones can be tedious at the best of times - given the choice I would rather deal with a rubber gloved TSA employee any day than ever fly Avianca again. Avianca is a sub-standard airline, providing a low quality of service, serving poor food, a limited selection of beverages for a 10hr transatlantic flight and incapable of ensuring that my luggage wastransferred correctly.

### "good service from Avianca"
Cartagena to Bogota. Most of the time people will only ever leave a review when they have a bad experience  I had good service from Avianca, quick response from their customer service with Regards to a potential problem, which also didn’t incur a fee which is unusual as in my experience airlines will charge you for any little thing they possibly can. Would look to use again certainly.

### "uses remote stations"
Terrible experience. More often Avianca uses remote stations in Bogota, although the airport is fairly new. This time, when boarding for LPB, they took us in buses to the plane and we waited hours standing inside the bus in front of the plane before they would let us board it. Passengers were asking them to take us back to the terminal, to have something to drink, go to the toilets, etc, but they didn't listen.

### "another great trip"
Bogotá to London. Yet another great trip with Avianca. I flew on their economy class and I had an amazing experience. We arrived into check in and we took around 5 minutes, which is amazing given that it was the time were all Avianca international flight departe. When boarding we were met by their crew and then boarded their Boeing 787. Upon arrival to our cruising altitude, meal service started with a pizza of a known Italian restaurant in Bogotá, an amazing pizza. Legroom and recline were above average for long haul flights. I had an amazing sleep in the confy seat which was quite soft . Around two hours out from London, breakfast was served. We could have a selection of cereals with a parfait yogurt, and a full colombian breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, toasts and a colombian treat called arepa.) I went for the Colombian breakfast which was amazing as well. Our bags were delivered quickly. Overall an amazing trip.

### "experienced the worst customer service"
Upon purchasing my ticket the airline spelt my name wrong (they had my passport). When I tried to select my seat they refused to let me and said I had to go to the airport. When I tried to speak with a supervisor, I was told “they only spoke Spanish”! I needed an aisle seat and they were giving me the hardest time. On my next flight I tried to change the time and they charged me $1082. I experienced the worst customer service and I will never fly with Avianca again!

### "refund request rejected"
Scheduled to fly out May 24 10.20pm. Duration of trip was 3 nights/4 days. After many confusing hours, flight cancelled. Staff couldn’t tell me if I could get a refund for my ticket. If I took the replacement flight (next day afternoon) whether I could get a refund for my ticket Despite our short vacation being cut even shorter we decided to take replacement flight. Given a nights stay (it was 2am at this point) at nearby hotel. Made the most of vacation but wanted resolution with the airline. Summary of how that went: Emailed on May 25, 10 June refund request created, 25 June refund request rejected, 27 June reason for rejection was the fact that I’d taken alternate flight. Forwarded my complaint to another department. July 7 new department said no compensation will be given. Waste of time and money and zero customer service.

### "avoid it if possible"
Pereira to Bucaramanga via Bogota. We were advised 24 hrs before departure that the original flight from Pereira to Bogota was cancelled for no reason. We were re-scheduled to leave four hours before. The first leg of the trip was late for no reason. The second leg of the trip was three hours late. This simple trip took 7 hours more than it should have taken. We never received explanation, a word of excuse, an extra service nor anything that would explain such changes in schedule or delays. Fly with Avianca if you must, otherwise avoid it if possible.

### "the worst experience ever"
They cancelled my TACA/Avianca flight from Havana to San Francisco via San Salvador, i told them i had a connecting flight from San Francisco to the Philippines. They never compensated and told me my flight to the Philippines is not their responsibility even if i missed it because it is with a different airline, although obviously I missed it because of their flight cancellation. This has got to be the worst experience ever. Terrible customer service.

### "does not respect their clients"
Los Angeles to Cali via Bogota booked for July 2018. I received and email that my flight was changed all of a sudden. The only solution they gave me was to apply for reimbursement, but I would still be charged the penalties. Avianca does not respect their clients and makes you adjust to their needs. Horrible airline. Never again will I buy from them.

### "good price only for locals"
Not Verified |  Lima to Trujillo. This airline offer good price only for locals and overcharge to international customers. Then the flight was late and I arrived later because delayed. The airplane was there yet but they didn't let me check in my luggage because they affirm that the flight was closed. How they can close a flight which airplane is behind and has not arrived yet. I requested to talk with the supervisor and ignored me saying that the supervisor was busy helping another person. I was with my 1 year old baby and my grandma of 83 years old, my daughter and husband and I was mistreated by their personnel. Ignoring my situation and condition in that moment. I came to Peru after 5 years and my day was so far pretty bad due to these people.

### "Luggage lost and not compensated"
Not Verified |  Luggage lost and not compensated. I took a flight with them last October and at the check out they forced me to register my tent separately from my luggage. I said it would get lost because it is small but they didnt care. When I arrived at my destination, not only were both luggage and tent delayed 1 day because our flight was late, but the tent was never delivered to me. I have sent 3 messages on their client platforms, called many times and even went to their offices. Every time they acknowledge the tent is missing and file some paperwork and say I will hear from them soon. It is June and I still haven't been contacted back despite my many attempts. Clearly the tent is lost, but the company refuses to offer compensation. I trusted them  with an object worth 500 euros and they lost it and haven't even tried to find it. They probably hope that by ignoring me I will stop asking for decent service, but at least I can inform other passengers about how customer service is handled by Avianca.

### "I didn't have my suitcases"
A really bad experience, full of miscommunication and poor customer service. It started when I landed in Rio de Janeiro and I didn't have my suitcases. The ladies at the Avianca counter told me I'd have my basic expenses reimbursed. They told me my luggage would be delivered on the following day. I explained to them that I wasn't in a hotel or in an apartment with a doorman/ receptionist. They said it'd be considered when they analyzed my situation. I had 2 choices either to picked up my luggage at the airport or wait all day for the delivery since they don't have a certain time to do that. I called Avianca on the next day to make sure my baggage would be there and the associate on the phone told me a flight from Colombia (where my suitcases were suppose to come from) had landed that morning. I headed to the airport and then the flight was delayed, no flight had landed. Later on, I sent somebody to pick up my suitcases at the airport while I was having my birthday party. After all that inconvenience, I had to struggle with Avianca for 2 months to have my transportation expenses reimbursed. The whole process was very disappointing.

### "poorly run airline"
My wife and I used Avianca on 5 flights within Colombia and an international flight to the USA and a r/t flight to Peru from Colombia. All five flights in Colombia were delayed by as much as 2 hours causing us to miss connections twice. All five! The Peru flight was canceled and via a much longer route we arrived a day later. The USA Miami flight was late departing and arriving and we were 15 minutes from missing a United Flight connection. I have been flying Internationally for 28 years. I have used many 3rd world airlines. Never have I experienced such an unreliable and poorly run airline.

### "everything was outstanding"
London to Bogota. Excellent flight and everything was outstanding. From the booking, to check in at Heathrow Airport, Boarding and service during the flight. The meal from London to Bogota was very good, excellent cuisine, in fact much better than the one from Bogota to London.

### "Bad experience, delays, cancellations"
New York to Bogota. Bad experience, delays, cancellations, I cannot understand how can they be part of Star Alliance. We had two huge delays on our flights to/from NYC. The first flight on May 19th had a 7h delay. The explanation a flash lightning hit the aircraft. After checking Flight Radar I noticed that our aircraft was coming from London and only arrived in Bogotá at 3am (our flight was 22.49 night before). Nobody seemed to be worried or concerned with passengers. The second flight on May 20th had a 3 hour delay, again no explanations. With this delay we missed our connection to São Paulo (GRU). Again the airline was disappointing, they did not put the passengers on the next flight, they waited so there were no seats available on the next flight, only for the following day, making us stay 24hrs in Bogotá. Seat was good, entertainment good and beverages poor.

### "least they could do was upgrade me"
This airline just lost a customer. After giving no notification my flight was going to be delayed, I waited for 3 hours at the gate until they told me that I was not going to make my connecting flight due to this delay. They directed me all the way back to the entrance of the airport and gave me a new ticket for a different flight at a later time. That’s two times going through security and walking around the airport to get to the gates. After spending the entire day at the airport and losing a day from my vacation, the least they could do was upgrade me to first class, which I asked both the assistant at the counter and the manager on the phone. I guess they don’t respect or value their customers.

### "promise wheelchair assistance"
❌ Not Verified |  Cusco to Houston via Bogota. Avianca's policy for passengers needing wheelchair assistance on tickets requiring a interline Star Alliance connection in Bogota. In our experience, you're out of luck. This policy was confirmed by multiple Avianca employees at the Avianca Lounge at El Dorado airport at approx 930pm on May 19 2018, including the manager (who was happy to provide his name to me). Specifically, Aviancas policy is that the connecting airline is responsible for getting you from the arrival gate to the connecting gate. To be clear, most connecting airlines have no presence in the international arrivals terminal and many dont have a presence in the airside terminal more than a few hours befor a flight. And it can be 750m or more of a walk (or crawl). Aviancas policy is complicated by the fact that Avianca ground staff at other airports (in our case Cusco) are unaware of this policy and will promise wheelchair assistance upon arrival. We were on a routing of CUZ-BOG-IAH medical return flight for a post emergency surgery patient. Avianca flight Full Y fare AV144 on 19May 2018. Connecting to Business Class UA 1006.

### "terrible experience"
Miami to Cusco via Bogota. Canceled our flight upon arrival to Miami airport within the hour of arrival. There was no cancelation notice via email or phone. The customer service was the worst. My fiancé was on the phone for over 2.5 hours with no offers from Avianca to help or rectify the problem. Therefore, we missed our first day in Cusco which entailed paid for excursions and a booked hotel. Their comments were simply, “I’m sorry it happens”. Literally infuriating. There is a reason why they are cheap and the customer service is terrible. Once we actually caught our flights they were delayed on boarding and leaving the airport by  an hour. Overall, terrible experience.

### "Staggered and horrified"
Santiago to New York via Bogota. Staggered and horrified by Avianca's non-existent service and cavalier attitude to public relations. Delayed by a total of 36 hours on a 10 hour route, with the original delay compounded by open deceit on advising both myself and my travel agent, verbally and in writing, that I had been re-booked in business class (necessary for medical reasons). On arriving at the hub in Bogota: no, we have downgraded you to economy and if you don't like it, you can wait another 17 hours. The service for passengers with a disability consists of advising you to wait till all other passengers have boarded, so you "won't be in their way", and changing your necessary aisle seat to window at their own convenience. Do all you can to avoid this airline: their own web and FB pages are a litany of unresolved complaints and refunds owed. The absolute worst experience I have ever had in 25 years of flying to and around Latin America. Atonita y enteramente molesta ante la patetica (no)respuesta de Avianca a una demora de 36 HORAS sobre un viaje de tan solo diez, con engano, mentiras y cambios ocultos de clase de servicio (de business a economy!!) de por medio. Que desgracia, que pesimas RRPP, que mala empresa. Nunca mas viajare en Avianca y fomentare que ningun/a colega lo hace tampoco

### "perfunctory and sparse"
Bogotá to Los Angeles. All good at check-in except my pre-assigned seat had been taken for a child whose parents were in the middle section. Additional two rows of Business seats in the front of the main cabin proved to be inferior. Lounge was OK, no better in Business than the Star Alliance Premium Lounge. Inflight service from flight attendants was perfunctory and sparse. On a flight lasting over eight hours I saw them on six occasions only. Meals were truly awful. I chose a chicken roll with vegetables for lunch, it was bland and the vegetables were just scattered on the plate. Essentially a poor economy meal served on china. It came with a miserable selection of cheeses in small portions with one meager piece of guava paste. Dessert was something called "Tiramisu", nothing like any tiramisu I have ever eaten before. Prior to landing we were served a chicken sandwich which had fused to the dish, if I received something like this at McDonald's, I would refuse it. Once we landed in LAX we engaged in a wheelchair charade that would have been comical if it not been so frustrating. There were 17 wheelchairs at the deplaning area and only four persons to push them. It was a Laurel and Hardy scenario as we see-sawed our way slowly to the Custom's area. Yes, they were not busy on a Saturday evening but it took us an hour to reach them! By the time we were through, the baggage belt had been emptied and all the ambulatory passengers were long gone. Truly a study in inefficiency and a miserable end to what had been up till then a great business trip. My suggestion, change the wheelchair assistance company and get catering from a real food service company.

### "providing minimal service"
London to Cuzco via Bogota. Boeing 787-8 has small seats that feel like they are made from concrete. Also the seat reclines a fair distance so if the person in-front does recline you will not even have enough room to fold down the table to eat etc. The food selection on the London-Bogota leg had no choice as they had 'run out'. Most staff content with providing minimal service in Y class. The A319 leg of the trip had a much better seat than the 787 which is ironic as the 787 flight was over 11 hours. The IFE system on the A319 did not work and was shut down for the entire flight. Will be in no hurry to fly with this carrier again.

### "on time and had decent service"
Washington to San Jose via San Salvador. Avianca is what I would call an average airline. Nothing special, but gets the job done. Upon boarding you are met with a kind Spanish greeting and a very bland cabin. There were no personal TV's on board our A320, and the seats themselves were not very comfortable. During the flight from IAD-SJO we were served an overly cheesy mac & cheese and some drinks. Overall, Avianca had nothing special about it, but was still on time and had decent service.

### "a fantastic experience"
Bogotá to Cartagena. I was very positively impressed when I flew Avianca for Easter week. After reflecting back on this fantastic trip I noticed how badly used we were to traditional American and European carriers for the following reasons. First of all we were greeted at the airport by some extremely friendly staff members; who personally guided us to the check in zone. After a short queue at the check in zone, I was guided to the exclusive dock inside the terminal where only Avianca flights operate. This made the terminal a lot less crowded than the other dock where Latam, VivaColombia, Wingo and all the other carriers operate. The boarding process was fast and efficient and the flight departed 10 minutes before schedule and the cabin crew members were extremely polite; to the point that upon boarding the airplane I was personally greeted with my name (“good morning and welcome aboard Mr Castro” said the flight attendant). The plane was very clean and although it was one of the old members of Avianca’s fleet (built in 2011), it was as comfortable as all the other members of Avianca's fleet. To my surprise despite the flight being around 50 minutes long it had generous legroom a (I was not on a bulkhead or Exit rows), a huge seat, a personal IFE on every seat and we were given fresh fruit and a croissant on this short early morning flight. The fact that we had an inflight meal on a 50 minute flight is amazing to me as all American carriers I flew (except Delta and JetBlue) don’t even give inflight free meals on international flights that are 3 hours long. Upon arrival at Cartagena everything was as efficient as at El Dorado. My bags were some of the last ones off the plane and it only took me 10 minutes from the moment I walked off the airplane to the moment I walked off the airport doors. Overall it was a fantastic experience, I can’t wait for my next leg of the trip (back to Bogota and then to London Heathrow) to come and if you are flying to Colombia or anywhere in South America it definitely is the airline that you have to fly.

### "failed to deliver my bags"
Flew Avianca from Madrid to Bogotá. At the check in I checked an additional bag without any problem to my existing bag, as I have only been on transit. I received a new boarding pass but Avianca failed to add the priority status which I had. At the gate however I checked and was able to do the priority boarding. The flight itself was ok, no major things that made me love or hate the airline during the flight. After arriving at the destination however Avianca failed to deliver my bags and after I received them approx 24 hours later Avianca refused to give me any kind of compensation for the items I had to get to cover for one day. So overall I would not suggest to take Avianca again.

### "none of my fears came true"
Bogota to Medellin. I was really anxious about all the flights with Avianca after reading  horrific reviews. I was sure I would lose one of my suitcases, my connecting flights or something else. Luckily none of my fears came true. All flights apart from one were on time (20 min delay on one). No luggage was lost or broken. On some flights we were changed to an earlier one because we arrived early at the airport. This would save our connecting flights in case of a delay. Long haul flights London to Bogota on a Boeing 787 with OK service/food. Legroom for a 1,93m/6ft4in like me is an issue so that's why I booked seat with extra legroom. What needs to be improved urgently is the customer service, over chat or phone. The agents have an issue with English and as a result it takes long to communicate. Furthermore seat booking MUST be made available online, not only over the phone. It takes literally AGES to confirm everything on the phone and in my case ONE of the seats was mistakenly not booked and I found out 2 days before departure and it was too late to book again according to an agent. Therefore 7/10 and would fly again.

### "used a third party company"
This was by far the worse experience my family had have traveling with Avianca. We are consistent frequent business class flyers on Avianca. (4-5x per year). We were traveling with our son, a minor, for this flight also. Our usual route of travel is from New York (JFK) to Santa Marta Colombia (SMR). With a stop in Bogota. Avianca used a third party company for our flight from NYC to Bogota and it was awful (“Wamos”, was the name of the partner airline). The airplane was very old, dirty, and no entertainment system. Also the flight attendant gave us a menu with 3 choices of food, when it was time to order our food, we were told the only choice was breakfast burritos. We were amoung the first people served. Having a menu was useless. The seats were not comfortable at all. We were not able to rest. Those combinations made for a very uncomfortable, long and boring flight. Coming back home was even worse. Again Avianca used the same company to bring us back. Needless to say, it was an old airplane, poor seats, no entertainment system, and low quality food once again. The food was worse this time. We could not eat it. So we traveled uncomfortable, bored, and hungry. I understand Avianca is having some issues with their pilots and are using different ways to transport their clients. There has to be a better solution. We the customer should not have to suffer thru low quality service for the same price. Avianca should respect their clients and partner with a better company to provide the same quality service. You should not charge for a premium service when you are not delivering (what we pay for) premium service. We traveled business class for a reason. We wanted to be comfortable and rested. We will state once again, we had a horrible experience! I will not recommend travel using Avianca until they fix the problems with their pilots. Also if this service continues, we will not travel on Avianca. Avianca will lose, very, loyal business class travelers.

### "definitely over my expectations"
Bogotá to Barranquilla. This was actually my first time flying in business class. We usually never consider business but for some reason the one way ticket was cheaper in business than economy ($80 ish). I didn’t have any high expectations since it was a domestic flight, but it was all in all a really smooth experience. The Avianca Diamond Lounge at Eldorado Airport was decent, some small snacks and drinks as well as fast WiFi. On the flight I was served a beer and a glass of whiskey, no meal service though. Really comfortable and big seats as well as a pretty decent entertainment system. All in all nothing to complain about, pretty simple but definitely over my expectations.

### "crew service: awful"
Bogota to Santa Marta. Worst airline, 3 hours waiting to connect a flight without any reason. VIP lounge out of standards, crew service: awful, food as compensation: subway sandwich for business class. You wont like to live this experience! I prefer Latam Airlines rather than travel trough Colombia.

### "Both of my flights delayed"
Medellin to Cartagena. Avianca has to respect for the time of their passengers. Both of my flights today were delayed. This is the 5th time I’ve flown Avianca and they have been late 4/5 times. When I asked the staff why the flight was delayed she said I don’t understand what the problem is because it’s only 45 minutes late. Those are my 45 minutes, and I guess I’m fed up of the lack of respect of Avianca.

### "a flight they cancelled on me"
New York to Cartagena. We booked two business class tickets for a direct fight to Cartagena that was supposed to land at noon, so we can make our boat connection to Rosario Islands. A week before our trip, we got a notice from Avianca that due to the strike, they had to reroute us through Medellin. The new flight with the layover would bring us to Cartagena at 4:30 PM which meant we would miss our boat connection. I went to the NYC office to cancel those flights and had to book a new flight with Jet Blue last minute. The agent who filled out all the cancellation forms told us it will take 6-8 weeks of the refund. At 6 weeks I called the headquarters to see what is the status of the refund. They told me to have patience and it will be more around 8 weeks. They also said they would escalate the case. At 8 weeks I called again and this time they said it will be more like 3 months to get the refund, but they reassured me they would escalate the case again. The following week I went back to the agent in NYC to see what she can do. She discovered that the claim was still pending and had been “Neglected” (her words). She told me it would serve me better to start a new claim to get new attention to the case, and she reassured me that this would not mean that I would lose my turn and have to wait another 3 months from then. At 2 months and 3 weeks I called the headquarters again, and with such chutzpah they told me my new claim was filed only a week ago and I need to wait for 90 days from the new claim to get my refund, which would mean basically 6 months from the date of the cancelled flight. As I really refused to take no for an answer, they put me through to the manager. She told me the reason the NYC agent issued me a new claim number was because there was a mistake in the way the original claim was filed and it had been rejected, not neglected. Meanwhile, nobody had bothered to call me when such rejection was done to tell me there was problem with the claim and see how we can fix it. She was also adamant that she cannot do anything else at this moment and that I will have to wait 90 more days from the filing of the new claim to see my refund. She again said she will escalate the matter, which by now we all know means nothing. She refused to give any assistance at all. Many phone calls to the headquarters and a few trips to the NYC local office, I’m still not even sure when or how I will ever get back the money from my two round trip business class seats on Avianca. They were happy to take thousands of dollars from me, changed our tickets on us without consulting us first, and now are creating all kinds of roadblocks and delay tactics in refunding the money. Even though they made a mistake in filing of the refund claim, they never bothered admitting to their mistake, nor are they taking any responsibility for a mistake that was done by their agent. Basically, they’re hoping I would just shut up and disappear so they can keep thousands of dollars for a flight they cancelled on me.

### "Terrible customer service"
Purchased a direct flight from Bogota to Guatemala City for a business trip. Three days before the flight, received an email stating that the route had been cancelled. They offered to put me on a flight with long stopovers in San Jose and San Salvador. However, this flight sells at around $290-310. The direct flight I purchased was $510+. There were no other flights available given the lack of notice, so I had no choice but to take the overpriced flight. Felt like a bait and switch. Went two the Avianca office three times and was told I would receive a voucher for the inconvenience. This was confirmed calling the call center. I submitted requests online November 8 and did not receive any response. After 5 calls in December, still no response. After two very angry calls in late-December, finally an email. After two more angry calls in January, another email from an agent. After exchange emails for two weeks, I was told that because I completed the flight, there would be no voucher or compensation. Terrible customer service and airline.

### "service from the FAs was pretty good"
I flew with Avianca from Santiago de Chile to London via Bogota as last minute replacement to my previous flight reservation which was with Latam. I booked this flight as I got a very good deal for the business class seat. I have flown with Avianca before and I wasn’t really impressed with the plane which was old and the seat was outdated version. This time, I flew with B787 on both legs which is big improvement from the old A330. The seat configuration is similar to Cathay, AA and Qatar Airways which give all passengers direct access to aisle. This is much nicer than Latam B787 so I’m happy with the replacement flight. The check-in process was easy. I used their apps for check-in on both legs and I received the electronic boarding pass right away. The drop off point staff were also efficient. The IFE is improved version to the previous one, although the choice of movies is not on par with best airlines in the world. It didn’t bother me as I preferred to take a nap or sleep during the flight. The food was ok, nothing special. The service from the FAs was pretty good on both legs. They were all courteous and their communication skills are very good. Overall, I’m happy with the flights and I would fly with them again if the price is right.

### "completely disorganised"
Santa Marta to Medellin via Bogota. Booked a direct flight Santa Marta to Medellin. The airline canceled our flight and change our itinerary without notice and at last minute. We were made to get a flight that stopped in Bogota instead. We were not told that our new flight would leave an hour earlier to the one we had booked, so we almost missed the plane. Then the plane wouldn’t work and after sitting for 45 minutes waiting to take off we were told to all get off again and there would be an hour wait till we could depart. We are currently sitting at the gate waiting and it has been two hours. Our flight has now been pushed to 4pm, another two hours, which is when our connecting flight from Bogota to Medellin was meant to be. We are now going to miss our connecting flight. Never fly this airline, completely disorganised and horrible customer service.

### "the flight was a delight"
This really turned into a good flight. After purchasing the flights on the 787 Avianca changed the Los Angeles - Bogota to A321 stopping at SAL which was a real bummer and I do not recommend their A321 old planes with seats that feel like you are sitting on a pallet. Anyhow, the ride back on the B787 was great! Business was 1-2-1 which is fantastic and better than US 2-2-2 set up. Cabin crew were a little rough and could use some soft skills training but they are not the worst by far. Food and drink was good, beer a bit warm. Overall the flight was a delight and the AV system and headphones are on par with other long haul carriers. I will say that Avianca does and did make changes to the itinerary several, and I mean several times, you can call them and they were nice and easy to deal with on the phone. BOG was a great place to visit and if you go, I recommend Avianca.

### "horrible service and timing"
Miami to Bogota. Horrible service and timing. I understand that over the holidays travel is congested. However, not only did Avianca changed my itinerary without notice and last minute on a round trip ticket that had been purchased 3 months in advance, but also, the airplanes I flew on looked very old and beat up. On my return flight to Miami from Bogota, originally scheduled for 2pm on January 2nd, 2018, I had to wait in line at the Bogota airport for 1 and a half hour. They did not have enough staff on the counters (about 2/3 positions empty); when I finally got to the counter at 11:00 am, I was told that I would not fly on the pm flight because it had been oversold, just like that. Unbelievable for a ticket secure over 3 months prior. I ended up leaving Bogota at 10:45 pm that night after multiple delays in a very old plane with its seats literally falling apart. What a horrible experience. Do not use this airline. I should also mention that my initial flight from Miami into Bogota was late by 5.5 hours. Apparently, this is common place with this airline.

### "Cancelled without notification"
San Jose to San Salvador. Cancelled flight without notification. Rebooked us in the next available flight which was one week later. Refused to give refund or compensation for hotel or meals. You’re better off setting your money on fire than buying a ticket with this airline.

### "changed return flight without notice"
Horrible experience on my return flight from Cali to Houston. The airline changed my return flight without notice, just received an email saying a change had occurred on my reservation. I called and they explained there was a problem on my connection so they changed it automatically. When we arrive at the airport to check in they rearranged my seating  I previously had sending a minor unaccompanied. When I asked for assistance they  replied if you don't want to travel, don't. I understand situations come up and things change, but I expect more.

### "Very efficient and pleasant staff"
A return trip from San Jose to Guatemala City, the first time I have flown with Avianca. Very efficient and pleasant staff, on check in, boarding and in the air on both flights. Comfortable seats and good legroom. The snack was not much to write home about, but it and the drinks were served in good time. It encourages me to think of using Avianca on longhaul.

### "these are really old planes"
Washington to Lima via San Salvador. We got business class tickets for an international Avianca so my sick father would be able to lay down and be more comfortable. We paid over double per ticket for these seats and even called to make sure they were business class seats and my father would be able to lay down. Well, that was a complete lie. My parents got on their flight and the seats were only slightly larger than economy seats and certainly were not laying down. All the advertisements and information for Avianca's business class were showcasing beautiful laydown seats. What gives? Even the flight attendant was saying that these are really old planes and Avianca does not care about upgrading. My parents had four business class flights and only 1 was the real business class. We complained to Avianca and they said they can change planes up to the minute they fly so even if we buy a ticket with plane X with laydown business class seats they will change to plane Y with horrible business class seats but we still have to pay. There were coffee stains on my food tray, the blankets and pillows were not in sealed bags nor folded with an unpleasant odor. I am disgusted at the lack of care from this company and will never fly with them.

### "will never fly with them again"
Cusco to Buenos Aires via Lima. Extremely poor service I received from Avianca. Yesterday morning my flight was canceled. The woman I was dealing with at the Avianca counter was not clear with instruction and I missed all my connecting flights because of it. After waiting at the airport for 3 hours dealing with this woman, I was told that my flights would have to either be canceled or rebooked to the following morning. I rebooked them but then had to purchase all new tickets for my other connecting flights, costing me a lot of money, all because of one canceled flight. I was given a phone number I was told I could call in case I needed to get a reimbursement and cancel my flights the next day. After spending all day trying to sort of how I was going to get to my final destination, I spent over an hour on the phone (using the number I was given) with 4 different Avianca representatives, trying to get a reimbursement, only to be told at the end that I needed to apply for a refund online. My whole experience with Avianca has been unprofessional, frustrating and wasting my time and money. I do not recommend using them to fly and I will never fly with them again.

### "staff courteous and professional"
Lima to Buenos Aires. This was the latest of several flights I have taken with Avianca over the past few years, and again I was very satisfied. The staff were all courteous and professional and really seemed to go the extra mile. The seats felt more comfortable than average for economy class. The in flight meal was slightly below average quality and there was no individual seat back in flight entertainment but, since it was a relatively short flight it wasn't a major problem.

### "dedicated business check in a joke"
Miami to Bogota. First of, the dedicated business check in is a joke! It took me longer to check in (25 minutes) than my friend who was traveling coach and who had arrived after me. Then the lounge at MIA is a disgrace: dirty, no food selection whatsoever - what took the cake was boarding. No priority boarding for business class pax, everybody boards at the same time! Finally, not even go as I boarded the airline, just two flight attendants giggling. I’m platinum on Flying blue and gold in the executive club, they don’t treat their business customers as such. Pity!

### "uninterested and unfriendly"
London to Bogota on Boeing 787, so the hard product is fine and the seat pitch in Economy is quite good. But service-wise, this flight was really bad. The crew seemed completely uninterested and unfriendly. It took quite a while after taking off before dinner was served - and there was one single rounds of drinks, which came together with the meals. I have flown many long distance flights in Economy with many airlines and I don't recall ever having been served drinks only a single time at that stage of a flight. I had eaten before so I didn't try dinner. For breakfast, I chose the eggs dish and the consistency of the eggs was extremely weird. I am usually not picky but I couldn't finish it. In Bogota, it also took quite a while until the luggage arrived, but I am not sure whether this is Avianca's or the airport's fault. Overall, I am very underwhelmed. I have flown a couple of short-distance flights with Avianca in Latin America and oddly, during all of them I had better experiences, with better food and better crews. Could all be just coincidence of course, still worth mentioning.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience with Avianca. Got screwed by them multiple of times on the same ticket. First they changed my ticket to arrive 36 hrs after my original stated time and changed my flight from a 5hr direct to an 14hr stop layover. Asked to change it and they could not accommodate. So I had to book another direct flight last min. on Jetblue at my own expense! To make matters worst on the return flight with them they changed it from from a 5.5 hr direct flight to an 8hr flight because they added a stop. They wait until 4 days before to advise of this so you cant cancel and get a refund since all other flights are either too expensive or booked! I asked for compensation via voucher or at least an upgrade and they just smiled with a no we cant.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Flying with Avianca was absolutely one of the worst experiences of my life, not to mention the worst airline I've ever encountered. To name only some of the chaos Avianca caused me: they rescheduled my flight three days before I was to leave without telling me so that I would have missed my connection by 3 hours. Had to spend 2.5 hours on the phone with them to fix it, which resulted in missing a day of my trip and having to make 2 extra connections (they did not reimburse anything or offer any consolation). I called ahead to get the vegetarian option for a 12 hour flight and they wouldn't do it because I was 22 hours within my flight (must call at least 24 hours, they said. The only rules of etiquette they follow are their own. I checked only one bag, even though I'm allowed 2 bags, and it was 10 pounds over their limit, so they made me carry my shoes on my flight (the fact that I was under the limit of 2 bags didn't convince them). About 30 min after everyone ate, the entire plane rushed to the bathroom and there was a line in the aisle for half the flight. They lost all of our seat selections because they tried to put me on another flight literally 1 hour before my flight was leaving, again without asking or telling me, so I was shoved in the back of the plane for each leg of the flights they put me on. I tried to call several times to have this resolved or to get some kind of reimbursement, to which they told me to "submit a complaint on the website" or they would transfer me to another department, which would transfer me again - an endless, unresolvable loop. The flight attendants are as rude as the customer service reps, I didn't put my controller away during landing and one attendant scolded me like an insubordinate child. Pay the extra $300 for a better airline!

### "served its purpose at a reasonable fare"
I had a total of 4 flights with Avianca over a 10 day period travelling from Peru to Colombia and within Colombia. The flights were generally fine and while nothing to rave about, served its purpose at a reasonable fare. However the final flight from Bogota to Lima was a disappointing experience. Poor service from the Avianca ground staff at El Dorado who did not let us check in early even though it was mentioned to us previously that it was possible in Bogota. No explaination was given as to why this was the case. The check in process was also the slowest I have witnessed and this includes the process on many Budget carriers in Asia. The staff also continue to speak to us in Spanish even though it was clear that our Spanish was sub standard and to top it off, she could actually speak English fluently. The boarding process was a mess with passengers being allowed onto the aerobridge but without being able to enter the plane for a few minutes. A disappointing final experience on Avianca.

### "so disappointing"
Do not waste your money. Our honeymoon flight was cancelled and they won't do anything for us. We have spent $250 on a hotel and will have to book another in Miami and they won't give vouchers or do anything for us except have us wait in an extremely long line to be rebooked tomorrow. I will never support this airline again - so disappointing!

### "spontaneously change flights"
Boston to Cali via Bogota. Avianca is a terrible airline. Long, long lines to check-in, no or extremely clunky online check-in, extremely long waits for the call center when things inevitably hit the fan. To top it all off, they spontaneously change flights by a full 24 hours with little to no warning. That's what they did to me (changed a Saturday flight to a Friday flight on a Thursday) which forced me to spend another $350 on a separate flight with a real airline because Avianca was too incompetent to be able to get me on another flight. Avianca is a joke, save yourself the time, money and frustration by flying another airline even if it costs a little more upfront.

### "delay again flight from Bogota"
Santiago to Cartagena via Bogota. Delay flight that depart from Santiago from 7.53 to 10.50, and delay again flight from Bogota. My holiday in Cartagena was destroyed when Avianca sent e-mail to tell me flight from Bogota to Cartagena was canceled and offered new flight to me. I tried reply e mail many times but they were not responding to me.

### "Overall horrible experience"
Mexico City to Bogota. My flight was supposed to depart Oct 5th at 1:28am and it has been delayed to 8:40pm because of a sick crew member but passengers were only notified after midnight on Oct 5th. Many people had connecting flights to other parts of Colombia and some to Madrid. The airline did not offer any type of compensation. I called the customer support lines and no one would help. Overall horrible experience.

### "far from customer friendly"
Cusco to Lima. Our flight was cancelled with no reason (we think they did it on purpose to get the other flight more fully occupied). When in line they told is we would get transferred to an earlier flight which was delayed. However, they lied to us and we got transferred to a flight 4hours later. We never heard any apologies and service was far from customer friendly. Would definitely recommend another airline if possible! !

### "service was lacking big time"
Barcelona to Bogota. Avianca is starting to look more and more like a low cost airline than a regular airline. We flew business class return ticket from Bogota to Barcelona and in both cases our business class boarding was done from the same door of the plane and we have to wait in line for over 45 minutes whick takes away from the business class flying experience. Also on our flight from Bogota the plane seemed to lack proper cleaning and service was lacking big time. Both my wife and I were very excited to fly the Boeing 787 but Avianca is really falling behind on the business class category due to its below par service and inadequate boarding process that could be easily be corrected should they choose to do so. In terms of flight entertainment goes there are not complaints, and food was good as far as airplane food can be expected to be. Moreover, the attitude of the flight attendants was unfriendly and unattentive. We will be looking at other airline options for future travel to international destinations.

### "food was very dissatisfying"
Cuzco to Lima in Business Class. We purchased a business class ticket hoping more enjoyable experience, especially expecting that after the aircraft landed, we could deplane without waiting much longer as economy pax did. Upon landing in Lima Airport, we needed to rush to catch our connecting flight to Santiago. As we were seated at at row number 1 (the very front row), we were expecting to be able to deplane as soon as the door opened. The reality was completely the other way around. The aircraft parked at the international gate section, so they decided not to open the front door (with aviobridge) but the the rear-end door instead. This was very ridiculous because we became the last pax to exit the aircraft and needed to wait so much unnecessary amount of time! (please be reminded that we were seated at Business Class Row 1 which naturally should be the first pax to deplane!!). Other comments regarding inflight meal: They only serve beverage (in a plastic cup) and 1 granola bar which was very dissatisfying for a business class meal

### "luggage nowhere to be found"
Rioacha to Medellin via Bogotá. I suggest anyone flying domestically within Colombia to not fly with Avianca. We had a flight from Rioacha to Medellin with a connecting flight in Bogota, the flight from Rioacha was great, very on time and friendly security and staff, now when we arrived in Bogota everything changed drastically. Our flight was suppose to take off at 8:30pm it got delayed an hour and a half that's fine no big deal, around 10pm making the line to board the flight which was so disorganized and was wrapping around the whole corner, there was about 4 lines and no one knew which was for which there was people boarding for Barranquilla and Medellin finally we walk up to the attendant and to our surprise our flights were switched (never said anything over the intercom never called out our names over the intercom ) so not only did we wait almost two hours they made us run across the whole airport. On the plane fine, we arrive to Medellin while waiting for our luggage to our surprise it's nowhere to be found so now we have to speak with someone to find out where our luggage is at, and they have no way to tell us where it's at? So we decide to wait for the next flight thinking maybe our luggage was on that flight and nothing.

### "least compassionate and worst company"
Avianca is the least compassionate and worst company I have come in contact with. My wife's father died. We called to get her plane ticket changed thinking it would be no big deal. Avianca refused to change it after being on the phone for over an hour. The people she and I spoke to were rude even when they knew her father had just died the day before. They said it was "not their problem. After a long and exhausting day of funeral arrangements, we were hung up on by the Avianca agent. We did not have the energy to call back that night since it was almost midnight. The next day my sister-in-law (her sister) called back to help. She was on the phone with Avianca for 2 plus hours. They again said not their problem. They didn't care that these two had just lost their father. Their callous attitude said it all. Finally we got somewhere after 2 hours and were told to send the death certificate. We sent the death certificate and got the flight changed, or so we thought. We got notice from Avianca that a death certificate wasn't enough since he died on a Wednesday and she wanted to fly back the following Wednesday. Now Avianca wants the notice from the funeral home for what day the funeral was and a notice for when he was going to be cremated. Finally after days of fighting with Avianca and endless painful paperwork sent, she was able to change her ticket. Of course she had to pay over $100. Not only did she have to pay that fee, her original flight was out of Cali, but she had to travel to Bogotá. Avianca refused to change her flight city, so after the most exhausting week of her life she now has to fly from Bogotá to Cali back to Bogotá to El Salvado to finally make it back to the US. Avianca refused to let her just go Bogotá to El Salvador. Why would they? They have proven how awful they truly are. We will never use them again. You ca not treat people like this. In a time of extreme circumstances, compassion is a must and Avianca has zero! After weeks of going back and fourth they basically said it's not their fault and they don't care. Way to show human decency and compassion.

### "staff did not care about us"
I bought a ticket from Trujillo to Cusco with a short connection at Lima sold by Avianca through Opodo. In spite of the first leg of the flight being on time and rushing on the connection to the second flight boarding gate, the boarding staff did not let me in the flight while the flight was flight was still boarding according to the signs. They switch to a flight boarding four hours later without trying to honor the connection commitment taken by Avianca. The boarding gate staff did not care about us and was highly impolite.

### "food was good for a short flight"
Good service from staff and great price. We flew from Guatemala to San Jose via San Salvador with Avianca. Seating was well organized, food was good for a short flight with liquor. We loved Avianca will keep flying with them. The price of tickets is very affordable. The atr72 is a very nice little plane.

### "Staff were not helpful"
Flight from to Medellin to Bogota was delayed for over 2 hours for no reason. This seems to always be the case with Avianca. Staff were not helpful when attempting to reschedule to an earlier flight (I had no checked luggage). Horrible service from them as usual.

### "No assistance or information"
Bogota to Medellin. Flight to Medellin was delayed, so i couldn't catch my return flight. No assistance or information was given, unfriendly and uninterested staff, they told me to fly to Medellin and to wait what happened there. No rebooking was offered. When I arrived I got Information from TripIt that the return flight was also delayed, first 40min announced, then later 2h 45min. Other passenger also angry about information policy. Then an aircraft change was made and we arrived with 30min delay at BOG. No english Announcements at the gate. My first and last booking on Avianca.

### "experiencia de vuelo fue muy buena"
Bogota to Medellin. La experiencia de vuelo fue muy buena, las personas de la sala VIP muy atentas y el servico en el lugar fue adecuado. El vuelo salió muy bien y pude llegar a mi destino sin inconvenientes. Gracias a las personas que participaron en mi proceso de viaje. ENGLISH: The flight experience was very good, the people in the VIP room attentive and the service onboard was adequate. The flight went very well and I was able to reach my destination without inconveniences. Thanks to the people who participated in my travel process.

### "recommend Avianca Economy class"
San Francisco to Montevideo via San Salvador and Bogota. The inaugural BOG – MVD direct flight was the day before my trip. Alas, my flight had to divert to ASU and wait on board for 3 hours due to inclement weather in MVD, and as a result, we weren’t served breakfast before arrival (no big deal). All flights departed on time. Do your check-in on-line in advance to select your seats, or your wait at the check-in counter could be unnecessarily long. All flight attendants were courteous, smiley, and efficient. Their English skills could improve but are sufficient. The A320’s have overhead shared screens for movies, the A319’s have individual back-seat screens with a decent selection of audio, movies, and TV shows. Seat comfort is decent. Food was mostly okay (one beef-and-rice meal was inedible even though I was hungry). On some flights you get pillows and/or blankets and/or nothing, so bring your own essentials. On the return trip, I had a tight, 30-minute stop at San Salvador, where there is a security check for flights to the USA. By the time I made it to my flight to SFO they had already boarded half of the passengers. Thankfully I had not checked any luggage, as I imagine that it wouldn’t have made that connection. I risked the tight itinerary because the ticket price was very good, but in the future I will select the stop-over in LIM instead of BOG. I have flown other airlines from the U.S. to South America, and considering prices, schedules, comfort, and service, I recommend Avianca for Economy class. On a previous flight, I learned that their Business class is really not worth the price, by a long shot (on Business class, American Airlines is far better).

### "had to wait 9 hours at the airport"
I am flying Avianca from Cartagena to Quito with a connection in Bogota. The first leg of the flight was delayed by three hours, allegedly because of one crew member being "unwell". The second leg of the flight from Bogota to Quito cancelled (same day) due to an alleged mechanical problem, and had to wait 9 hours at the airport for a red eye flight. All they offered was a Burger King meal. What a joke.

### "worst customer service"
Lima to Los Angeles via Bogota. I have never had such a poor experience as I had on Avianca today. Waiting in the Lima airport for over 2 hours just to wait to check in showed the airlines inability to function in an organized function. After speaking to 2 different Avianca agents, we were told that we needed to continue to wait in line, despite our flight being "closed. I went to the agent a third time to ask, as our flight was taking off in 30 minutes, and she told me our flight was closed and they would move us to the next plane, which would cause us to miss our connection. After fighting with a very nice agent, she was able to get our flight to "reopen" and get us on the flight. After running through the airport we got to our gate and barely made our flight. After arriving in Columbia, Avianca called my name for extra security measures. They searched me extensively and never once able to explain to me in English what they were doing or why. Once I finally got on the plane, the agent had change our seats on the next flight from an aisle and window in the front, to the far back of the plane in the middle. They have some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

### "this time I am disappointed"
São Paulo to Lima. Even though I have traveled many times in Avianca this time I am disappointed. My flight start at São Paulo with and A330 to Lima, at the time that I arrive to the the airplane my seat were damaged, they recline without push the button to recline. I tell the cabin crew that my seat has this damaged, and the cabin crew were a little angry so tell to other and she said me that the only option were at the last seat of the airplane. So I accept the change of seat. But at that seat the IFE didn't works.

### "quality continues to decline"
Orlando to Sao Paulo Bogota. Avianca's quality continues to decline, from chicken and pasta and they have gone to pasta and hamburger with blue cheese. No options! The special meals are very low quality and no taste. When you compare to other airlines, you feel the big difference. Not to mention the cheap wines and lack of champagne. They offer cheap Chilean sparking wine as champagne.

### "I was prevented from boarding"
Bogota to Santa Cruz via Lima. I checked in at Bogota El Dorado airport 3 hours before my flight to Santa Cruz Bolivia, via Lima on 8th April, Avianca officials prevented me boarding the flight as they said I was not in possession of a yellow fever certificate which was mandatory for Bolivia. I was not asked for proof of vaccination at check in. When I was prevented from boarding the aircraft I was also told that my bag had not been loaded so Avianca staff had obviously been aware of the situation for some time, but no one had contacted me while I had been in the lounge for three hours to advise me of the situation, if they had I could have obtained the vaccination at El Dorado airport during this time. Avianca made me pay to rebook my flight and I had to pay for a hotel before resuming my travel to Santa Cruz Bolivia the next day where on arrival I was told that a yellow fever vaccination was not required! I tried to speak to the duty manager for Avianca on the evening of the 8th April to ask that Avianca contribute to the rebooking and hotel but he sent a message through ground staff that he was too busy to bother with my problem.

### "no-frills, on-time experience"
San Francisco to Montevideo via San Salvador and Lima return March 22. All flights were on time. Desk and gate agents were cordial and professional. Video entertainment on shared overhead screens was identical on multiple flights (other airlines vary programming on South-bound vs. North-bound flights). Most on-board meals were good but a couple were sub-standard (ie. barely warm). Announcements in English were often unintelligible, but they were fine in Spanish. The left-side rear bathroom door on the aircraft used for flight 904 from MVD to LIM on March 22 had an open gap with the doorframe, so after you sat down, you realized you were exposed to the galley. Cabin Crew were excellent across all 6 flights, unlike other airlines where they tend to disappear soon after take-off (Aerolineas Argentinas comes to mind). There are no seat-back pockets, so your knees enjoy a bit of extra leg room but you don’t have a place to store small items such as your bottle of water. Not all flights offer blankets, but all flights get very cold (so, dress accordingly). Overall, the price was right, the food, entertainment, and seat-comfort were acceptable, and the cabin crew were great. I recommend this airline to anyone who seeks a no-frills, on-time travel experience.

### "these were all excellent flights"
London to Bogota, Medellin to Cartagena, Santa Marta to London via Bogota over a period of three weeks. Similar to my previous experiences with Avianca, these were all excellent flights with a decent level of service. Avianca now use the Boeing 787 on the London-Bogota route, which is probably my favourite plane to fly long haul (not that the previous A330 was bad). The tinted windows, higher pressurisation, gentle lighting and more spacious cabin of the 787s make a big difference when you are on a 10+ hour flight. Avianca cabin crew were more friendly on this occasion than previously, and the IFE offering on the Boeing 787 was also very good. Only complaint about the long-haul legs is the food: on the way out the offerings weren't too bad, but the BOG-LHR return flight featured some of the worst airline food I've had in recent years. Domestic flights were very pleasant and all ran on time. Medellin airport is unfortunately quite far out of the city, but check-in was a breeze and the trip to Cartagena takes less than an hour. Decent inflight service, with free drinks, for such a short flight. Baggage reclaim in Cartagena was rapid. On my return flight from Santa Marta to Bogota (connecting to LHR), I arrived very early at Santa Marta airport (3 hours before my flight). The friendly check-in agent offered me a seat on an earlier flight to Bogota which saved me 2 hours of sitting in Santa Marta airport, where there is absolutely nothing to do. This also saved me having to worry about rushing a connection between terminals in Bogota, and gave me plenty of time to charge my electronics and find food at BOG before my international flight. I'd continue to use Avianca for connections to Latin America: the direct LHR-BOG flight on its own is a major plus, compared to having to transfer in a US airport (with the associated hassle of US immigration and re-checking bags, etc).

### "lack of customer service"
Los Angeles to San Salvador. I could not check in 24 hours in advance because there was a glitch on the website and nobody would answer the 800 number. I tried to check in in Seattle but the man could not check me in either. He told me to check in at the desk when I arrived in Los Angeles. The Seattle to LA flight with Alaska Airlines was delayed so I had 40 minutes to get to my connecting flight on Avianca. When I arrived at the ticket counter there was nobody around so I called the 800 number. There were staff available in the office next to the ticket counter but nobody would come out to check me in and nobody would answer the 800 number. Finally, when I found their office I asked for assistance to get me on another flight but instead of helping me they sent me back to Alaska because they said it was not their fault that I was late. There were many other options for today but they didn't try much so I had to take a flight the next day. The problem I had was that Alaska Airlines was late but nobody was there to check me in and I had plenty of time to get to my connecting flight. I talked to several people in their office and nobody would help me and kept trying to have Alaska fix the problem. I felt like a ping pong ball and they are in different terminals. They would not cover my hotel room even though I could have made my flight, I begged actually. Nobody answers the 800 number which is poor customer service and they would not make an acception for an obvious lack of customer service.

### "I am not looking forward to it"
Customer service or the lack of it when booking a flight. You cannot deal with these people, they just do not bother to contact you. Their chat is automated, their call centre is scripted. I have not flown with them as yet and I assure you I am not looking forward to it. They cannot be bothered to help me with a trivial dispute which was caused by an error on their webpage. Just remember once they have your money they dont give a damn anymore. I have yet to fly with them. My flight is in February. That's if I dont cancel in frustration.

### "helping us through every step"
Lima to San Francisco via El Savador. A company's character is defined by how it runs its business when its customers need it the most. My review is based on one such experience where I got injured while on vacation in Machu Pichhu. Except for Avianca, all other companies I had to deal with due to the injury were a flat disappointment. The patience with which customer service talks to you, even in repeat calls, different questions, long conversations, etc. In about 15 calls only one I had to wait in queue for 2 minutes, a welcome change after dealing with customer service centers in USA where 20 minutes of wait times are a norm. The consideration they gave to me and my wife after knowing that I am injured and need to go back to hometown to get treatment due to my medical history is commendable. They booked us on next morning flights, with somebody helping us through every step at the airport. They gave us VIP lounge free for our long layover in El Savador. It was surreal to see how much they cared. I would love to fly Avianca in future with the confidence that if things go sideways, there is somebody who cares.

### "extremely good value"
London to Medellin via Bogota. Given the pricing of Avianca business class flight compared with the competition they are extremely good value. The new Boeing 787s have an excellent business class cabin (not that the A330 was bad). If there are drawbacks it's the food which isn't up to standard. The lounges both in Bogota and the United lounge in Heathrow are nothing special. Note the United lounge starts to close just as passengers are arriving for the Avianca flight. Service isn't world class, but cabin crew are generally pretty good. In terms of punctuality Avianca suffers domestically because of the often challenging weather. At the present time there are considerably more delays in country because of work going on at Bogota airport and elsewhere. Avianca is a stunning deal and the direct flights to and from London are excellent.

### "without any air conditioning"
Bogota to Pereira, and the Avianca flight was 90 minutes late for no reason. We had to wait inside the flight for about one hour without any air conditioning, service, or minimum explanation. No clear reason as to why the delay. Only when people started to really get mad, the plane finally left.

### "very small selection of food"
I have been flying Avianca for last 18 months, and the service has been deteriorating dramatically. On my last trip, took 3 legs of Avianca. On all legs priority boarding was not supported (I am LH Senator). I requested to have emergency row seating at check-in, and was told yes. I was not seated in emergency row on any flights. The lounge in Lima is a disaster. On LIM-BOG leg they are using B787, but the crew seemed to be working for the first time - they ran the trolley into passengers legs and my chicken was spilled on top of my shirt. When I asked the attendant to bring me a wet wipe from Business she replied I could use the paper towel. Only one drink run, together with food. Very small selection of food, no alcoholic beverages served. Two flights were late, one for 1 hour, resulting missed connection in BOG. Eventually Avianca lost my luggage, and delivered it only 24 hours later, though there are flights every hour between BOG to MED.

### "staff were not organized"
My flight from Chicago to Quito via San Salvador was a disaster. First part of my flight to San Salvador arrived as scheduled but from San Salvador to Quito things got sour. They canceled my flight and I had no choice but to take a flight to Lima, spend the night there and next day fly to Quito. Once we arrived in Lima, Avianca staff were not organized. It took a couple hours before we were transported to our hotel. I arrived in Quito 5 hours later than originally scheduled. My trip was only for two days so this really made things challenging. My trip returning to the US didn't get any better. I got to the airport about two and a half hours before check in. When I got there the flight to Chicago had been canceled again. I talked to Avianca at the check in counter. They gave me no reasonable excuse of the cancelation. They said they had been having problems with their planes. I noticed that several flights within Ecuador had also been canceled. This nightmare had just started. They instructed me to wait for a couple hours before checking in with American Airlines. They were able to re-route me via Miami. At that point I was just happy to be able to leave even though I would arrive 4 hours later in Chicago. When I approached the American Airlines counter, they told me that I was not in their system. Avianca had not confirmed a spot for me and another 12 people even after reassuring us that a booking had been made through American Airlines. For the next two and a half hours all we did was talk with Avianca staff. They instructed us to go from one place to another. From offices to domestic counter, back to the international departures area. They did not take it upon themselves to help us. They never offered to resolve this for us. There was a young couple with a baby, I remember. They had no sense of priority or customer service. Seems they could care less for their customers. We were all tired, hungry and very, very frustrated. It seemed no one cared or understood our frustration. After insisting with several Avianca employees time after time, American finally got me on their flight to Miami. It was a sense of relief stepping onto the plane and knowing that I would be finally going home. I promised never again to fly on Avianca.

### "get what you pay for"
I flew with Avianca London to Havana return via Bogota this November. Not a nice experience. I never call assistance on a flight but on the first journey, I wanted to ask for a pen to fill in the form they gave us so I rang the bell - but no attendant came, they just ignored the bell. My suitcase arrived with one wheel missing in Havana and I was told to fill a form in at the desk. When I got there, there was no one from Avianca and I was told to wait for the lady to come, which is the least you want to do when you have been travelling for over 20hrs. After 20mins, she was still not there, I asked another airport person and she called her, then said she was on her way. But after another 10mins, the Avianca lady still wasn't there and no one could tell me where she had gone or when she would turn up at her desk. By then I gave up. On my way back yesterday, I told the Avianca manager at the check-in desk and she filled the form in for me. I did not appreciate that the manager assured me the Avianca desk was always attended and was basically insinuating that I was lying, unbelievable. Other than that, all 4 flights that I took were packed, not a single seat free and the journeys were uncomfortable. On the last Bogota to London leg, they had overbooked and some people could not get on the plane, someone told me 11 of them (they asked for volunteers to stay overnight in Bogota but did not seem to attract any takers!). That plane (Boeing 787) was very uncomfortable, seats were tiny and the heat was so unbearable I could not sleep. The only positive thing about this airline is the cheap cost compared to others companies. At the end of the day, the saying is true, you get what you pay for.

### "these people are idiots"
The return leg of this round trip (San Jose to Chicago) was to occur Saturday, November 26 at 5:40am. We arrived at San Jose at 3:40am. A representative of Avianca stopped us as we approached the check-in windows and informed us our flight was cancelled. She would not let us approach the ticket windows, saying no one there could help us reschedule. Instead she said we must call the customer service number. After a long time on hold I reached someone at this number who informed me that no one could help us reschedule until 5:30am when the office opened. I returned to the agent with this information but she refused to let us get help from a ticket agent. We returned to our hotel room and call the number at 5:29am. We were on hold for 45 minutes. When someone answered we were told that the customer center could not help us reschedule our flight, we must do this at the airport; the airport we had been turned away from at 4am. We returned to the airport and waited in a long line where only one agent working. We were then told that we could be on the flight on Tuesday morning - 3 days later. The airline refused to take any responsibility for our accommodations and would not find us passage on another airline because, according to them, the cancellation was weather related. I live in Costa Rica and this flight was for my daughter’s return to Chicago. We had “weathered” the non-hurricane in San Isidro de General and had driven from there to SJO on Friday under sunny skies. It was sunny skies in San Jose Friday when we arrived and clear skies Saturday morning when we went to the airport. On Saturday morning when our flight was cancelled other Avianca flights were traveling from SJO to San Salvador airport. In other words there was absolutely no weather issue in Costa Rica or San Salvador or in between. It was the smirks on the agent's faces when they told us there was nothing they would do to help us that was especially galling. The idiotic run around from the airport to the phone center to the airport wasted the time when we could used to make alternate arrangements. While we waited to learn what Avianca was going to do for us alternate ticket prices skyrocketed. Why couldn't they have just told us our flight would be Tuesday morning and they would do nothing to help us at 4am when we were face to face at the airport? This critical information at 4am would have allowed us to make affordable arrangements ourselves. These people are idiots. Don’t let them ruin your trip. Any time or money savings you think you might save flying with them comes at a very high risk and for us cost.

### "Deplorable attitude"
Deplorable attitude of Avianca. The San Salvador - San Jose flight is canceled due to bad weather, obviously not the fault of the airline. But it is unacceptable that they call a small group of passengers and take them to a hotel, and the others leave us like dogs at the airport. See how they survive. Shameful. Deplorable la actitud de Avianca. El vuelo San Salvador - San Jose se cancela por mal tiempo, obviamente no es culpa de la aerolínea. Pero es inaceptable que llamen a un grupo reducido de pasajeros y los lleven a un hotel, y a los demás nos dejan botados como perros en el aeropuerto. A ver cómo sobreviven. Vergonzoso.

### "last time I will fly with Avianca"
Lima to Washingto IAD via San Salvador with Avianca. I suffered from severe altitude sickness in Cusco and had to leave early to go back to Lima because of it. We first called Avianca to change the first leg of our flight to Lima and they wanted $1600. They had the same flight listed on their website for $67. We then just booked another available flight and went to Lima. The next day we called Avianca to let them know we would not need the first leg of our flight (the second part of our flight was the next day and traveled from Lima, San Salvador then IAD). They told us it would be $100 per person to still use the second part of the flight we had already paid for. I then asked to speak to a supervisor who told me it would be $200 per person. I was very frustrated by this point and said we would call back. After calling back 10 minutes later the new lady said it would be $175 per person. They are now escalating it. It should not be this hard to deal with an airline. I fly quite a bit and this is the worst experience I have ever had, this is the first and last time I will ever fly with Avianca.

### "losing all connections"
We bought business class flights from Santiago to Medellin return, the flights departing Santiago on Oct 30, and leaving from Medellin Int'l Airport on Nov 4. But flight AV8435 was delayed on 20 mins, so the staff at checkin told us they couldn't check us in, because we would have time to board our connection, despite the fact we had almost 90 mins to make it. We were offered to be served by the checkin supervisor. We told her we needed to arrive to Santiago the next morning but they didn't allow it. Almost 2 hours passed where she was "looking into options", We started looking into alternatives in our cellphones, and showing them to her - but all she said was "Let me see" "I can't connect with LAN" "we are doing the best we can". Long story short, all the different flights we were showing her were closing and we ended up losing all connections that could get us into Santiago by Nov 5th morning (today). They kept searching, so we - in 5 minutes - logged into our cell, got into Latam's site, and bought a one-way ticket Medellin to Santiago. We later went to the Avianca Office at the airport, and spoke to the man who identified himself as the one in charge, we told him was had happened and he stood looking at us. Didn't open his mouth to say anything, just took his phone, turned his back and made a phone call.

### "the service was poor"
London to Bogota with Avianca. I was looking forward to the flight as my wife and I were accompanying her mother back to Colombia after a three month trip to Europe. We flew back in business class and settled down in anticipation of a pleasant flight. Unfortunately the service provided by some of the flight attendants was poor. The attendant that was looking after my section of the cabin didn't speak English and became quite rude when I asked for tea as she didn't know how to prepare it. I explained in a calm fashion but she had to ask for help from another attendant as she couldn't understand me. The food and presentation was very poor considering the price one has to pay for a business class ticket. The beef was uneatable as it was very under cooked. The same was repeated with the breakfast very badly prepared food which I couldn't eat. When I asked for a yoghurt she refused saying this was part of the other choice. I was also not offered an aperitif or other drinks after dinner or at any other time during the flight. I also had a problem with my film selection which wouldn't download and when I asked for assistance she just shrugged her shoulders as she did not understand me and moved on.

### "really do not want to serve you"
Los Angeles to San Salvador. Not awful, but as many others have pointed out, the strange indifference of the flight crews is notable. This want not my first Avianca flight and I've seen this issue with the flight attendants before. They get you seated, offer you water while others board (in Buz Class), and then you don't see them for hours. They close the curtains to their area and gather and chat, leaving passengers on their own. It's happened on every Avianca flight I've taken. The flight attendants really do not want to serve you, it's evident in their attitude and how the flight unfolds. I just flew business class from LAX to San Salvador and the FA didn't materialize until one hour before landing to hastily hand out a meal and that with a bit of a snarl. Otherwise, Avianca's ok. The plane was clean, the seats functional and wide, though the boarding process was chaotic, but then again, that was due to obvious indifference on the part of the Avianca gate agents. You meet the same attitude from the Avainca agents who staff the lounge in San Salvador. At least they're consistent.

### "like a third world airline"
San Salvador to San Jose. Avianca still using A320 with the TACA livery and in terrible condition inside. Business class seats were deteriorated to the point that leather was cracked, no personal entertainment system, and most of all unable to eat the food. The menu was pizza. When I got my plate I thought it was pasta with mushrooms, that is how soggy the pizza was. Maybe think of a friendly menu. Especially since the airport in SAL has practically no decent option to buy food. More surprised to learned that this aircraft was coming from Toronto. I feel bad for the passengers that paid business class for a 5 hour flight and got what I got for one hour. Service was good and friendly but the rest really felt like a third world airline. Lounge in SAL is nice but too small, many people standing. One would think they would plan accordingly in one of their hubs.

### "all in all, very positive and organized"
Buenos Aires to New York via Lima and El Salvador with Avianca. Every flight left spot on time. The Avianca crew is well organized and every flight had 2 attendants welcoming passengers, pointing to their seats. Smiles. A good start. The food was mediocre and small portions but they existed and alcohol and non alcohol were served at least 3 times on each leg of the journey. The average flying time was 4 hours plus each journey. Seats were fine and flight attendants went our of their way to tell passengers if there were empty rows of 3 seats which was true on 2 flights. The attendants were mainly from the original TACA team and sometimes incredibly helpful. When it came to a transfer and time, an attendant personally took my 4 items and stored them in the crew locker so I could get them quickly. I pressed the call buttons a total of three times and waited a total of one minute each time. The attendants on the El Salvador to New York run were quite busy assisting passengers to fill out immigration cards, etc. The seats were fine on the A330 but lacking support on the A320. There was seatback entertainment on all but the smaller jets. If you can take a rather exhausting 3 flight trip from Buenos Aires to New York, then Avianca is fine. I think the experience is rather first class in terms of service and personal care. The only complaint was that the captain announced almost nothing except to fasten seat belts when over turbulence, which was minor. The team was spot on time handing out immigration or customs cards at the beginning of each flight. So, barring the mediocre food (except out of Lima) I would, and do, recommend Avianca on this route. They are not cheap, but service is fine. I have flown with them perhaps 90 times and had two flights leave late and never lost or missed any luggage. It is always reassuring to hear from the captain, but it seems that is becoming a things of the past on some airlines. All in all, a very positive and organized group on each flight, comfortable seats, recommended.

### "told me to write a complaint"
Bogotá to Bucaramanga. I was flying together with my wife and my son (which was 16 months old, this means that under Avianca and IATA regulations my child is supposed to seat on my wife's legs with a baby seat belt). However, due to the fact that I've paid for three seats for more confort the incompetent stewardess and crew sustained in a very rude manner that my kid was supposed to seat on its own seat. I tried to make them aware of their own safety regulations, but they ignored me an told me rudely to write a complaint. It is unbelievable how ignorant the crew were about their own regulations.

### "had a really good experience"
Miami to Bogota. I had a really good experience flying MIA-BOG return with Avianca. The economy seats were comfortable and the onboard entertainment system is very good quality with large, high resolution screens. Both flights arrived early and staff were helpful. The food was not amazing but decent enough and wine was served on the evening flight. They also had USB charging available in economy seats. Overall, Avianca were better than most European airlines I have flown with, including BA. Their aircrafts are clean and modern too.

### "good price and quality"
Havana to London via Bogota with Avianca. Great choice of seats despite the cheap flight for such a long way. Comfortable seats and good onboard entertainment. No delays or issues with luggage. Cabin crew could be more attentive and professional. Food supplied on both flights was ok. Good price and quality.

### "would recommend this airline"
Liberia to Panama City via San Jose. I flew with Avianca and can say that I would recommend this airline. Sandwiches were even provided on brief flights which I definitely appreciated. No problems with the seats, cabin crew, or wifi. Oddly I had to fly in a bush plane from Liberia to San Jose before connecting to Panama City.

### "business class experience good, not great"
Flew JFK-BOG in business then BOG-GRU in economy. Chose Avianca because of attractive fares and Dreamliner aircraft on both legs. The business class experience JFK-BOG was good, not great. Cabin is organised in 1-2-1 herringbone style which is generally great. I found there was no legroom when the seat was in lie flat mode. My feet kept bumping into the enclosure no matter what position I was in, and I'm 5'11". Food was unremarkable, service was indifferent and sporadic - crew disappears for hours at a time. IFE was good but the system was quirky. Very modern but didn't work perfectly. The economy class leg BOG-GRU was a bit better perhaps for economy but service was again unremarkable. Avianca could be great if they paid more attention to detail and the cabin attendants smiled a bit more - this was odd as given the warmth of the Colombian people in general I assumed the national airline would reflect that.

### "substantial snack was served"
AV481 from San Salvador to Tegucigalpa, on ATR72-600. First time flying Avianca, and on a propeller jet. The flight was almost full, but it was a small plane anyway. No in-flight entertainment, not that any was needed for a short 45 minute flight. Surprisingly a substantial snack was served - a ham roll (or some meat, I cant recall) with a pack of local snack mix and a drink. For such a short flight, it was literally take-off, eat, land. Service was okay. The seat however was not very comfortable, despite the short flight - I felt my back aching after the flight.

### "never fly Avianca again"
Cusco to Lima. I will never fly with Avianca ever again. First thing that went wrong is they pushed back our flight an hour without telling us. The plane shows up even later then was planned. They then unload the plane in like 15 minutes and loaded us in 20 minutes. As soon as we land in Lima we waited on the plane without a gate or anything for about 30 minutes before they even pull up busses or stairs for us to walk down. Once we take the bus to the baggage claim they tell us that only four bags made it. They lost my bag along with all 20 other people I was flying with as well. The lady that helped me had no idea what she was doing. She told me that United would be dropping my bag off to my house in the United States which they won't do and I will have to drive two hours to the airport to get my bag which avianca lost. Currently on day 4 without my bag. They never even apologized or offered anything for this inconvenience.

### "good service provided"
New York to Santiago via Bogota with Avianca. Check in fast, nice staff on the ground. Boarding a bit chaos. On board nice cabin, FA not very friendly, but good service provided. IFE very good. Flight to Bogota on time. Food not very good for business class. Connection in Bogota very fast and easy, recommend for connections in the región. Businees lounge great. Had time for lunch and connect for a bit. Next flight to SCL again on time, and boading chaos again by buses. FA better this time, food for business class not good at all. Comfortable 319 business cabin. Arrival on time.

### "flight itself was pleasant"
Travelled from Panama City to Bogota recently with Avianca. I had to wait 45 minutes for check in and there were only 5 people ahead of me. The counters were understaffed and the staff had a hard time dealing with customers who had excess luggage. The flight itself was pleasant. A free warm snack and drinks were served. Despite being only a 1.5 hour flight each seat had an individual IFE. Announcements were done in Spanish only.

### "lose a whole day vacation"
Due to internal problems of Avianca there was cancellation of our initial flight from Cali to Bogotá and then losing our connecting Avianca flight from Bogota to Havana. We had to travel by another airline and lose a whole day vacation with the impact that generates, without getting compensation from the airline Avianca .

### "flight attendant was ever present"
Since I am an Elite member, I was given a free upgrade. The flight was operated by TACA Peru. The quality of service for this relatively short (2:30 h) flight from Cali to Lima was very high: I was greeted by my name by the flight attendant, sparkling wine was offered before the on-time departure and the inflight meal/wine were above the average. The flight attendant was ever present in the cabin. The seat was quite comfortable and in-flight entertainment was good. Return via Bogota on a new B-787 (Avianca operated), spacious and quiet, in economy class, noticing that even in economy the quality of service has approved: a hot meal and wine are served, and in-flight entertainment is good as well. Avianca is still my favorite airline.

### "employees lack of interest"
New York to Curitiba via Sao Paulo with Avianca. Good food on the plane. The check in employees both in New York and São Paulo helped me twice by making exceptions (letting me go through priority TSA so I wouldn't miss my flight and allowing my international limit on domestic flight.) Cheap tickets. Cons: No communication with passengers beyond check in. Flights are often delayed. (2 out of 3 were at least an hour late). We were not made aware until the departure time. And we had to ask! Lack of following group boarding, it's kind of a free for all. Seats were too tight and uncomfortable on flight from NY to Colombia. Almost felt more like a domestic plane than international. But most disappointing was employees lack of interest or communication.

### "attendants were courteous"
The A320's between San Francisco and SAL only have overhead shared movie screens, even in Business Class. Same with their A319's between Lima and Montevideo . However, their A330 on SAL-LIM have back-seat, individual screens. Meals were decent, but make sure to have a meal before the SFO-SAL flight, as breakfast is not served until the end of the 6-hour flight. Cabin attendants were courteous. Smiley and engaging. Boarding gates can be very chaotic at SAL, though. International transfers at LIM require going through an X-ray security screening. I had a 55-minute connection there, which was shortened by a late arrival. I made my connection, and my checked luggage also made the airplane transfer. I purchased an upgrade to Business Class for the SAL-SFO leg on the return trip. The in-flight experience was not really worth the US$200 (e.g., the seat legs are still designed for a 3-seat row, instead of the 2 seats actually there; so your feet, and your seatmate, have to deal with the divider). Still, access to the VIP room in SAL is worth it, especially if you are lucky enough to get one of the 8 reclining chairs in their quiet "rest room". Although their departure and arrival times can be very inconvenient, their price and service make them a great option for this flight. By the way: in their on-board announcements, they point out that they are "TACA Peru on behalf of Avianca".

### "worst airline I've flown"
Puerto Maldonado to London Heathrow via Bogota with Avianca. Worst airline I've ever flown. Arrived at Puerto Maldonado to be charged for seemingly excess luggage and then had to inform staff that I was on an international flight so was allowed extra baggage. Our flight stopped at Cusco even though we were meant to be flying through to Lima. The plane was filthy, my friend had to ask for a wipe to clean her tray. The cabin crew staff were so unhelpful, spoke very little English and couldn't crack a smile if they tried. I moved seats to try to sleep as it was an overnight flight but they had blocked off rows for cabin crew. Surprised me as I thought they're meant to be working and don't they have specific seats for crew allocated for take off and landing? There was no water offered throughout the flight apart from with the bland 2 meals given. On a long haul flight that's over 10 hours, passengers should be expected to be kept hydrated. As we disembarked, the staff were more interested in talking to each other and didn't even acknowledge the passengers walking off. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "the flights were on time"
Flew Avianca from Madrid to Bogota, return Cartagena to Madrid via Bogota. On a connecting flight from and to Geneva. Quick boarding, the flights on time. Nice crew on the way to Bogota, not so good on return. Seat comfortable, I could sleep. Meals were not really bad, but nothing special and very little to eat. Best meal was breakfast. In fact it was like an economy class meal on European or Asian arlines, but served on China. But the price was lower than Iberia or Lufthansa. Don't bother to book business on national flights, you only get a drink in a real glass!

### "refused to take responsibility"
Santa Marta to Bogota flight with Avianca was delayed and eventually cancelled and I subsequently missed my connecting flight back home. It was chaos, no one knew what was going on, there were no updates and they refused to take responsibility for me missing my flight. They even had a flight going direct to London that night which I could have taken but they lied and said it was full. I had friends on that flight who said it wasnt.

### "not use for international flight"
Had 5 flights with Avianca in the past 2 weeks (4 domestic within Colombia and 1 international from Bogota to New York). All flights left on time and all had (albeit rather limited) in seat entertainment. Cabin crew were generally friendly. However, a couple of things on the international sector were unacceptable. Firstly, some of the crew had no English. What would happen if there were an emergency? I would not want a crew member who could not instruct me what to do. I have never been on an international flight with any airline with crew members who cannot understand a word of English. Also, the food was appalling - badly presented and bland. I was given spaghetti with no sauce and 2 slices of overcooked zucchini plus two green cherry tomatoes. On the side was a stale roll and some crackers. It was all presented in a polystyrene container. And that was it For a six hour flight. It is just not in line with what other carriers are offering on similar lengthed international flights. I would use Avianca again for domestic flights but not for an international flight.

### "service was fast and efficient"
Bogota to Miami vkia Medellin with Avianca. The service at Bogota was fast and efficient, the plane arrived on time to Medellin. I was traveling with my mother, she had recently a knee surgery. We ask for a wheelchair in Bogota and also at Medellin, and this service was provided without any delays. The flight to Miami was good. Lunch was given during the flight, the entertainment system was great, with good selection of movies and TV series.

### "oblivious to passenger needs"
Cartagena to London Heathrow via Bogota with Avianca. Despite being booked and confirmed some months ago, my sister and brother-in-law (with whom I was travelling as a "Group") were given standby status at the very last moment. I was given a boarding pass. We were unable to use the privilege lounge I was entitled to use as we were anxious to be in the front line regarding their standby status, and there was a distinct lack of English speakers among the ground staff. The plane was delayed, finally boarding passes were issued, we boarded the aircraft and waited and waited. We had been able to eat small bite at around midday before boarding our first Avianca flight (AV9551) from Cartagena to Bogota but nothing to eat or drink since, and we were hungry and thirsty by the time we boarded. We were not offered a drink, not even water, and there were no announcements from the flight deck. When finally dinner was served (after midnight) it was totally inedible and my dessert was missing. We were offered a drink at that time, but I had to repeat my request for both wine and water. The cabin staff seemed utterly oblivious to passenger needs. All the cabin lights went out leaving cabins in total, velvety black darkness. I was not able to call for more water although I pressed the call button regularly. When I wanted to go to the WC I could see nothing at all in the utter darkness, and so tripped over a pair of legs which had been pushed out into the gangway. I went flying and my bag landed somewhere ahead of me. As I have two replacement knees, I am unable to actually kneel at the best of times, and of course I landed on both of them. I screeched because the pain was intense. People got up to help me, but no cabin staff came to investigate and neither did a single light go on. I retrieved my handbag and staggered off to the WC. I felt my way back to my seat with everything still in total darkness. When breakfast was served it again was really horrible and we were very hungry by that time. I ate two salty biscits and tried a yellowish roll of what seemed to be made of plastic and gave up. When I asked for milk with my coffee, for I was not offered any, a small packet of powder was chucked on my tray. I said I didnt care for creamer and wanted milk, but the stewardess shrugged and said they didn't have any. I insisted and she eventually returned with a small carton of milk. Thankfully I managed to get a small glass of water, too. When we finally landed at London not a single member of the cabin staff was at the exit to give us the usual spiel of thanking us for using Avianca and wishing us a pleasant onward journey etc.

### "to Bogota the food was awful"
Quito to London via Bogota. The outward Avianca flight was grand but the return was not. When we arrived at Quito airport the girl wanted to change our flights, we were not interested in another up and down (via Madrid). We asked for window seat but were told that it was not available on the first leg but it was for the long haul part - that was 9 hours before we were expected to take off at Bogota. Unfortunately we hadn't looked at our boarding passes but then when we discovered that not only had we not a window seat, but we were also sitting in different rows. As it happened there was another drama going on (the flight was overbooked) but the air hostess was excellent. I feel the check in girl at Quito didn't know what she was doing - she should be trained better for the job and improve her English or else just deal S American flights. The food on the long haul was good but going to the Galapagos and to Bogota the food was awful, just something greasy with inedible plastic pink stuff inside! No vegetarian option!

### "stranded with no explanation "
Due to fly tonight from Bogota to London. Avianca overbooked the flight, yet gave passengers no notice (they have email and mobile numbers) - even at self check in, Avianca staff said nothing so queued for 2 hours to be given a boarding card with no seat number. When questioned staff lied and said seats allocated at gate because of 'weather conditions' - staff spoke poor English and gave no information. The flight left without 20 people stranded with no explanation - after a further two hours given a litre carton of juice between 8 passengers. Finally, Avianca staff just walked off and left us. We got them to take us to an airport hotel - it is now 2am- we have no luggage as they dont know where it is -  we are appalled at the poor level of customer service and lack of concern compassion - lets see what chaos tomorrow brings.

### "will find another carrier"
Because of bad weather in Bogota was the Avianca flight delayed and we were not informed before boarding - after boarding we was sitting in the plane for almost an hour and almost no information about what was going to happen. Then asked to leave the aircraft also without any information. After 1:30 we was asked to board again, but just before we where going to enter the aircraft we were asked to go back to the terminal again because now there was no crew. Again we wait and no further information. After a while told that a crew was on there wayand we just should wait. An hour later the flight was canceled and we were not compensated in any way - even that it was Avianca that was the reason that was not flying. This was so bad handled and it will mean that I will never again use Avianca in South America, I will find another carrier. Another thing, Avianca is member of Star Alliance, an international group and the staff speaks no English or so bad that they are not able to communicate with people that do not speak Spanish. After more than an hour more it was possible to be rescheduled to another flight the day after and my connection to Sao Paulo the only one, so now I am 24 hours delayed.

### "IFE screen was broken"
First leg with Avianca from Roatán - El Salvador on a new ATR 72-600 was very comfortable, a small sandwich and refreshments were served on this short 1-hour flight. Boarding process in SAL was absolutely chaotic. The second flight El Salvador - New York JFK was on an older A320 which was completely packed with a lot of babies that were crying non-stop. The A/C was set to very high temperature to the point where I started feeling like I was about to pass out from the heat. I complained to several crew members about this, and they did not seem to care much. My IFE screen was broken. On the positive side: this second flight landed in JFK 45 minutes ahead of schedule, and the refreshments were served continuously which helped somewhat with the heat situation as I kept getting cupfuls of ice to cool myself down.

### "cabin staff not present"
Very impolite staff at Cali Airport. Old plane without basic entertainment. Food poor and cabin staff not present. 40 mins before landing, they told passengers to fold the blanket and put it behind their back - never seen that before, arguing that it is a security mandatory rule - I had to laugh.

### generous legroom in economy"
Having declined to make a bid for an upgrade to travel business class on my return journey BOG-MEX because of the non satisfactory service in business on the way to Bogota, I rather enjoyed travelling in economy with Avianca back to Mexico. Strange as this may sound, I found the service better in economy that in business and the flight attendants were friendlier and paid more attention to passengers. Avianca's economy also has more generous legroom in economy than many airlines I have flow. Entertainment system is excelent. Only problem was very, very small food portion.

### "meals served are good"
I have used Avianca in several trips, both for national trips or for transatlantic flights. In my opinion, the service in international flights is way better than the national ones. The staff onboard are usually friendly and polite. Moreover, although I don't like airline meals, I think that the meals served by Avianca are good. I would recommend to improve the space between seats for international flights and the puntuality for the national flights.

### "the worst travel experience"
After a long flight we were informed that due to fog the plane was unable to land in Bogota, so we were diverted to Cali where we remained on the plane for an hour without being informed of what was going to happen. Staff were unable to speak English competently and they failed to communicate with the non Spanish speaking passengers,which I found strange for an international airline? After an hour there was an announcement in Spanish that we had to disembark the plane and wait for further information. In the waiting area the staff told us nothing! We ended up waiting for 3.5 hours. My husband managed to speak to one staff member who assured him that they would inform him when the flight to Bogota was boarding and guaranteed that we would be able to get a connection flight to Costa Rica. Needless to say the staff member did not meet their obligation, we found out that there was a flight through another passenger. When we arrived in Bogota, staff told us that we were unable to get the connecting flight that was promised to us; instead we were informed that we would have to fly to San Salvador and then get a further flight to San Jose. Security in Bogota was a nightmare, they confiscated my mosquito repellent (without explanation) that was 90ml. This was particularly worrying as Columbia has had a number of Zika cases reported. When we boarded our next flight from San Salvador to San Jose, we were assured that our luggage would be waiting in San Jose. Needless to say that the airline lost my luggage and were not apologetic at all. All in all there was 7 hour delay, and the staff were terrible. This was the worst travel experience I ever had. If you are considering flying with Avianca, please think again

### "onboard service satisfactory"
Flew Avianca from LIM to Cusco. Check-in area very busy at LIM airport however not too much trouble. Check-in process with ground team was efficient and assisted with changes to early flight. Boarding via coaches in priority groups. Onboard service satisfactory to short route. Seats in overwing exits row, comfortable with good legroom. Baggage claim in CUZ with no issues.

### "information was non existent"
After four Avianca flights in two weeks flying from Cartagena to Bogota we hope we never have to fly with them again. Each flight was at least two hours late. Explanation or information was non existent. Service on board was indifferent with not even a cracker offered. I have never encountered an airline like this.

### "seat space was very good"
My bid to travel business class with Avianca from Mexico City to Bogota was accepted but service was so incredibly indifferent and below what I expected that I will not make a bid for the return journey. I was in row 2 and my choice of lunch from three options has already finished. Most in the cabin were upgraded at the gate (it was very obvious). In the ends the person next door gave me his choice as I could not eat anything else. It was incredibly awful, a rubbery chicken with no taste. Seat space was very good (the old business). Selection of wine was well below standard with very cheap Chilean wines. Flight attendants were friendly but never smiled and they did not offer to store jackets and coats. Check in was friendly and fast and boarding was orderly. A good service let down by the incredibly bad food.

### "never fly them again"
Los Angeles to San Pedro Sula via San Salvador with Avianca. This airline would rather fly with empty seats than make a satisfied and potentially repeat customer. My connecting flight came in quite a bit earlier than expected, leaving me with 5 hours to kill at a tiny airport. I thought I might be in luck when I learned that there was an earlier flight, but when I asked them if I could standby on the earlier flight they told me that it would cost me $200. Even at the very end of boarding, when it became apparent hat there were quite a number of empty seats, they remained adamant that I would either have to pay or to wait five hours. It's this kind of interaction that makes me lose faith in humanity. I'll never fly with them again.

### "not fly with them again"
Avianca offered a good deal on flying to Colombia, where several friends of mine live, so I decided to take the deal. The process of buying the tickets was somewhat difficult as their website was having problems and when I called there was a good deal of confusion and they had to call me back to let me know they would call me back again. Several times, but in the end I got the deal so no complaints. I am tall (just over 2m) and the seats are small, the head rests are against my shoulder blades and very uncomfortable. There was good in flight service for what it was and the entertainment was not bad, but whenever their was an announcement my movie would switch to spanish (I prefer English) and there was no way to fix it without restarting he movie and slowly forwarding to where I was. This happened three times and I decided to just listen to music on my phone. My connecting flight from Bogota to Armeria was odd because the airport and Avianca did not know where the plane was. There was about 40 of us being led around the airport until they found it on the otherwise of the airport, at this point I will note that besides my LAX flight each plane left and arrived and hour late, I am not sure Avianca is to blame for the confusion in Bogota though. My trip got cut short and I had to change my return flight, after explaining my situation Avianca offered to nullify the fee for changing flights which was awesome. Except that they did not and charged me the fee anyway. My return flight was three flights total, all of which I checked into window seats for, there was a problem and my itinerary was changed to four seperate flights none of which I was given window seats for anymore and was instead in middle seats each time, the Avianca staff member that changed my flights guaranteed me that they were still Windows seats. All in all I was not impressed with this airline and would not fly with them again.

### "pay for a good service"
Palonegro to Medellin via Bogota. Avianca is a leading airline in the region and flying is a top-notch experience. Ground personnel courteous and helpful, organised boarding process, clean, modern and tidy airplanes with AVOD catering to all tastes with programming offered in English, Spanish and Potuguese. Departures and arrivals quite punctual as was luggage delivery. Avianca is costly to be honest, but some good deals can be found and it's better to pay for a good service.

### "adequate leg room"
All flights from Madrid to Lima via Bogota were on new aircrafts and all flights were on time. Seats were very comfortable with adequate leg room. Service was great with 2 servings of food and full service of drinks (juices, beers, alcoholic). You had to ask for salt and pepper? During the flight there were snacks, crackers and drinks available in the galleys. Staff were great, professional and some fluent in English. IFE was good but from the 58 movies most of them were outdated. On IFE there was an option were you could see the offered Menu, also you could see the connected gates on arrival (1 hour before arrival). Great flight experience.

### "staff were very polite "
Los Angeles to Lima via Bogota with Avianca. The staff were very polite and helpful. They greeted and asked us if we were okay. The A330 was a great aircraft that supplied the traveler with entertainment and comfort. The meals were better than I expected, and the snacks hit the spot. My only complain would be that the aircraft didn't provide wifi service, other than that it was a great trip.

### "I missed my plane"
I had a flight from Montevideo to Cuzco and although I arrived several hours early to my flight, I missed my plane thanks to front-desk clerks. They had me wait for a ridiculous amount of time to "double check on info" and by the time they were done checking (not sure what exactly they needed to check) they decided I couldn't board their plane. I still had an hour to board but for some odd reason they didn't let me through. Rescheduling my flight was an even bigger nightmare. I had to pay a $120 penalty fee and an extra $350 fee for a new flight. Getting my money back was impossible and anytime I mentioned that I missed my flight due to Avianca employees I was told that there was nothing they could do about my situation. I never got a proper apology from the airline.

### "crew were friendly"
I flew this new Avianca Boeing 787 from to Buenos-Aires to Bogota. The flight was amazing. The food should have been warmer was the only downside. Coffee was great as expected. The seats were comfortable and the IFE interface was friendly. The crew were friendly even the ground staff.

### "experience is terrible"
It's no coincidence. I travel 100,000 miles through Star Alliance by Air Canada and United but every time I use Avianca during a connection in South America, the experience is terrible. On this particular flight, despite my status and booking at the first class counter they assigned me a middle seat. When I realized, already onboard, the flight attendant ask for my boarding pass to talk to the supervisor or people on ground to see what they can do. 15 minutes later when they where closing the door I asked her about the status. Surprise surprise, she had not talked to anyone, just walked away with my boarding pass. It is always the same experience. They look and act like friendly but the outcome of the service is in a word terrible.

### "cancelled without notification"
I had the most appalling experience with Avianca. I booked an airfare that simply got cancelled without notification. I arrived at the airport on the day of the flight to find out that my ticket was cancelled - 2 hours before departure! The Avianca customer service could not care less about the cancellation (it seems this is the way they regularly operate). They simply advised me to buy another plane ticket - with a price premium for buying it 2 hours before the flight - of course! This seems surreal to me: in 2015, not even a notification of cancellation? I am still fighting to get my money back on the price difference.

### "much better than UA or AA"
Washington Dulles to Bogota return on Avianca A319. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom for me (1.8 meters tall) and wide choice of videos and music. A small meal and snack were served during the 5 hour flights. Going to Bogota, my seat (11D) did not recline because exit row was behind, but purser came by and offered to move me to an aisle seat further back. Much better seats, IFE, food and service than UA or AA.

### "New, clean A321"
Cartagena to Bogota with Avianca. Online-check-in easy. Security checks in Colombia at domestic flights surprisingly laissez-faire. Completely chaos at boarding, earlier flight delayed so our boarding also delayed, several switches from gate 1 to 3, after to 1 again, finally to gate 2. Looked like a giant game for children - however, not that funny. Delayed departure approx 30 mins. New, clean A321 with new cabin light system, full entertainment system (screens in backrests) even in economy. Just water for free. Arrival delayed 30 mins. Like usual endless taxi in BOG.

### "seat space surprisingly wide"
Reasonable pricing. Online check-in worked easily and properly. Security and gates for domestic flights at T1 at BOG-El Dorado surprisingly quick and smooth. However - at domestic terminal just one small kiosk and café. Boarding with bus was quick and had sufficient space - not squeezed in like with most European airlines. Hand luggage up to 22 lbs free of charge - however, nobody controlled it. Plane looked clean and well maintained. Don't expect the attendants to speak English - however, they were friendly and professional. Drinks and snacks have to be paid. Seat space surprisingly wide. However, the backrest is very uncomfortable - if you are taller than 1.80ms, your shoulders are pressed forwards by the "headrest" - for a one hour-flight its not a big problem at all, however, for middle-range-flights its a no-go.

### "lacklustre cabin crew"
I have recently undertaken 6 flights with Avianca, on a trekking tour of Peru. I was very impressed with the new Dreamliner aircraft which offer good legroom, even in economy class. What I was much less impressed with was the lacklustre cabin crew. Most of the time they just seem uninterested or bored with their jobs. Very little interaction and few smiles. On two occasions, on these 6 flights, I asked for something - once a glass of water, and then for some duty free. On both occasions it seemed like I was causing a significant inconvenience to the crew. In the future, I would chose another airline, where possible. Avianca really need to address this issue - is working for Avianca and dealing with passengers really such a chore?

### "downside an older airplane"
Doe to a system glitch, the seat I selected online was no longer available for my Avianca flight and I am tall, so I resigned myself to a normal seat. I was pleasantly surprised by a free upgrade before boarding, as compensation for not being able to honor my seat choice. The downside was that is was an older airplane with no personal entertainment on a 5 hour flight.

### "happily fly Avianca again"
I had nine flights with Avianca this summer to, from and around Latin America (LHR-BOG-UIO, GYE-GPS, SCY-GYE-LIM, CUZ-PEM, PEM-CUZ, LPB-BOG-LHR). The first eight of these were uneventful, service was good - modern, clean aircraft (A330, A320 and A319) with excellent seat pitch for economy and decent inflight food and drink service. Personal IFE screens on most flights, even short (less than 2 hour) legs on A320/A319 aircraft, which is pretty much unheard of for major European carriers. All of these flights arrived either early or within 10 minutes of scheduled arrival time which was impressive. The real measure of an airline though is when things go wrong. AV120 from BOG-LHR on 28th Sept was severely delayed due to a faulty plane (impact on one of the engines). Avianca ground staff were excellent given the circumstances. No long waiting around without information at the airport; just 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time of 2304 an announcement was made to say the plane would not be leaving that night, and was rescheduled for 1330 the next afternoon. Although inevitably this led to a scrum of people angrily shouting at the staff (I really don't understand why so many people think they are more important than everyone else), the staff were helpful and patient, and within an hour I was sat in a 5 star airport hotel with food. The next morning Avianca paid for breakfast, lunch, gave me a $375 voucher redeemable on a future flight and the rescheduled flight left just after 1330 as planned. Only real criticisms I would make of Avianca through my whole experiences would be that announcements in English as well as Spanish would have been helpful (although the staff all explained in English when asked. My IFE screen broke halfway through the flight home and couldn't be fixed. The cabin staff on the two long-haul legs disappeared for a few hours in the middle of the flight and economy check-in queues were very long at Guayaquil and La Paz. Relatively minor points though, and I'd more than happily fly Avianca again.

### "passenger treatment is awful"
Lima to Los Angeles via El Salvador. Avianca uses El Salvador as a hub to get from South America to different US cities. I got security clearance in Lima. However, in El Salvador we had to do the clearance again. No X-Ray, security personnel would check manually each bag in the accompanying luggage. It was a nightmare! One standing line for everyone, even with different connecting flights. I was the last to get into the connecting flight. Their business strategy might work, but passenger treatment is awful. Ground personnel in Lima did a lousy job altogether.

### "meals and service below average"
Guayaquil to Miami via Bogota with Avianca, which has a good fleet of newer aircraft. At check-in in Guayaquil, the gate microphone was not working. Up to 20 minutes before scheduled, the two agents at the gate never said a word to the waiting passengers a few feet away. Only when I took my boarding pass and went up to them, they scanned it and let me proceed to board. The other passengers, sensing the same, did likewise. Inflight meals and service below average. A very tough piece of beef and likewise for the chicken my wife had, not up to par with business class cabin standards. Only one of my two pieces of luggage (both tagged "priority") made it to Miami. Miami Airport is a nightmare process for US immigration, customs, luggage retrieval, and connections to other flights. It took me about 30 minutes to locate the first piece of luggage since everything was off the conveyor belt by the time we got to baggage claim, and located in small groups on the floor all around the baggage area. Walked around for another 30 minutes to confirm that the other piece was missing. The Avianca agent filled out a form that I signed and said it would be on the next flight in, and then forwarded to my final destination in NYC the next day by DHL - it was delivered by Fedex 4 days later. I am not going to say I will stop using Avianca, but I will defer to another airline if I have a choice for my intended itinerary.

Excellent airline. New and in very good condition, clean planes with a very nice atmosphere. Flight entertainment of the highest quality. Fast check-in and baggage receipt.

### Avianca customer review
A few flights with AV this month between MIA and Colombia and as well domestic flights in Colombia. Very new and comfortable aircrafts, all are equipped with IFE with a good selection of films and informations about AV and the star alliance. All flights were on time, the international flights arrived before STA, good job! The service was good, on domestic flights only drinks but a hot meal was served from and to MIA. Lounges (Star Alliance Gold/ Business Class) were basic. Bad selection from food (only one sandwich or fruits), selection of drinks was ok but nothing more. But the lounges were clean and refreshed with a nice design. Security fast track only in BOG. All in all a good airline, very professional crew and FA. Highly recommended.

### Avianca customer review
Guayaquil to Bogota to NYC. The flight from Bogotá to New York City was one of the worst business class flights ever. The flight was delayed for over two hours in Bogotá and no one told us why or even that it was delayed. We just sat there. A plane was finally brought to the gate. The business class seats were cramped. We were not offered any refreshments until over an hour and a half into the flight. The stewardesses were very polite but not around a lot. I would never fly Avianca business class again.

A good journey. Sao Paolo to Perú cabin staff are excellent. Seat is full flat 180 degrees. Food choice very good. Avianca frequent flyer program is one of best. They give many many option for redeem miles. Like air flight, Hotel, purchase from different country.

### Avianca customer review
I have flown Avianca  to and from Guayaquil and always been happy with the service. The staff are friendly and helpful and for the most part my Spanishor lack thereof, has not been a problem. The planes are clean and as comfortable as they ever get in the main cabin, food has been good and I enjoy having something now and then that is more typical of South American food. The one thing that I am not happy about is that I see they have changed their schedule so that my next trip will have to have two stops instead of just the one that I have typically had in San Salvador. It looks like they are now partnering with United and I will have to fly from Chicago to Dallas or Houston and then on to San Salvador and finally to Guayaquil. I am disappointed and would like to see it go back to a one-stop flight.

Flight AV 8532 from Bogota to Baranquilla. With my Star Alliance Gold status, I was able to use the business check-in counter, which took less than 1 minute, efficient and pleasant process. They didn't bother to weigh my carry-on like some airlines. I was allowed 1 suitcase (10 kg) plus a small backpack or laptop case. There was no automatic check-in kiosks. Star Alliance Gold passengers can access the lounge for free-a nice feature. The flight departs on time. The A321 is in excellent shape, clean and well-kept, including IFE with dozens of programs at every seat even on short domestic flights. Nice leather seats. Seat pitch is reasonable. Flight attendants look sharp and professional. On this short domestic flight, refreshment is coffee or juices. I paid about $80 for a one-way one hour flight with a 7-day advance purchase.

It was a new aircraft and very good interior. Cabin staff are gentle and polite. But the food option was not much. All over Avianca is a good airline, and I enjoyed my journey by Avianca.

### Avianca customer review
They changed our flight times days before we were supposed to depart, and would not accommodate us switching our flight because the new times did not work with our travel arrangements. The check in counters were not open when we arrived at the airport, and when they did open the self-checkout "helper" had no idea how to help us and sent us to a counter. My traveling companion was told that she had a standby seat, even though we booked months in advance. It took the staff 30 minutes to figure out how to get her a seat, and instead of reassuring us they were flirting and chatting the whole time. Even though we booked our flight together, we were not seated together and when I asked to switch seats the staff very rudely told me no, that the flight was full, too bad. We had heard of an exit refund for passengers flying out of Colombia, but when we asked several staff members they pretended they didn't understand even though they had been speaking English to us seconds earlier. Avianca is unprofessional, staff are rude and they have some serious organizational issues.

### Avianca customer review
My flight was Bogota - Santa Marta and besides a delayed that was handled by friendly and useful staff I did not experience any issues. The aircraft was brand new with plenty of room for carry-on and legs. I strongly recommend this company.

Flew Biz Class on flight AV #962 on an Airbus 330. Flat bed seat was comfortable and the plane was very clean. Food was good but served too fast after takeoff. Would have been nice to have a cocktail service before the meal. Flight attendants were very nice and passed by often. Flight left on time and arrived on time.

Family from Cincinnati went to San Jose Costa Rica via O'Hare. Could not have been more pleased with this airline. Every staff person from front desk to flight attendants were kind and sincere. Offered free alcohol on flight from Chicago to San Jose Costa Rica. Given free dinner on flight also. Allowed two checked bags each person - FREE. New airplanes - Airbus 319 both ways. This airline charges less for children's tickets never seen that before. Would rather fly this airline than any US airline any day of the year.

Recently flew from San Francisco to El Salvador - then on to Panama and back to San Francisco. Was a bit concerned because some of the reviews were a bit iffy. However cant' say enough about this airline. Beats many of the US based airlines we fly regularly. The planes were on time the staff was friendly and attentive the food was actually above average for airline good. Planes were comfortable and clean. And the flight was much less expensive than others we checked. We will definitely fly Avianca again.

### Avianca customer review
Feb 14 JFK-SAP-RTB and Feb 21 RTB-SAL-JFK. All flights on time JFK-SAP and SAL-JFK on A320 with decent leg room and food/beverage service the former flight had LCD screens in seat backs with decent selection while the latter flight had old-fashioned drop-down screens and no choice of entertainment. FA's attentive fair choice of food and beverages. SAP-RTB and RTB-SAL serviced by new ATR72's which are very quite and comfortable in comparison to the ancient ATR42's that used to service these routes. I have to commend the pilots on our SAL-JFK leg who performed instrument landing in very poor visibility and very low cloud ceiling in JFK area on Feb 21st.

### Avianca customer review
Flights AV121 from LHR-BOG and AV120 from BOG-LHR. We booked these overnight flights to make the most of our limited time in Colombia. However our outbound flight was delayed due to a technical fault and we were kept waiting at the gate until about 11.30pm when they finally decided that we wouldn't be leaving that night. The arrangements weren't very well communicated and we ended up standing outside the airport in the freezing cold waiting for buses to take us to the provided overnight hotel. We were also unable to retrieve our hold luggage (perhaps because the airport had mostly shut down by then) so had to manage with just what we had in our carry on luggage. We were initially told that the flight would leave at 12pm the next day but eventually it left at about 5pm - a delay of almost 19 hours. We were put on a replacement plane which was very new and reasonably comfortable (although our pre-booked seats were not honoured so we ended up on the back row of the cabin near the toilets). The main meal was pretty tasty actually and the cabin crew were reasonable polite. However once the meal service was over there was no sign of any cabin crew until breakfast the next day. On long haul flights with other airlines the cabin crew come through every so often with glasses of water or fruit juice to help keep hydrated so it was disappointing not to have that simple touch on this flight. The breakfast did include cereal with yoghurt though which I did like! Our return flight left on time thankfully and was back on the usual Star Alliance branded plane which didn't feel quite as new and shiny as the one we'd flown out on. Shortly after takeoff we entered some turbulence which lasted about 30 minutes - it would have been nice if the pilot had communicated this with us before take off like other airlines often do. There was in fact very little communication from the pilot (in Spanish or English). The inflight entertainment was reasonable but with only a limited selection of films. We landed back at LHR about an hour early but then had to wait because there was a technical problem getting our bags off the plane. All in all I was hopeful that this overnight service would be a useful way to get to Colombia but next time I think we'll fly indirect on a different airline.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-MAD-BOG A330. Avianca Business lounge is excellent with variety of food choices. Prompt departure lie flat seating in fishbone setup. Great inflight video entertainment. Cabin staff very attentive. Wine selection could be better as well as the menu choices. Service felt a bit rushed. Arrival in Madrids beautiful terminal 4. Great flight all around! Return leg used Iberias wonderful lounge. Boarded through a separate jetway. Flight on time. Lie flat seats. Again cordial staff but food and wine options could be better as well as the "rushed" service.

### Avianca customer review
Used Avianca for two trips (and a total of 6 flights) last month: Washington DC - San Salvador - Guatemala City (return) and Guatemala City - Flores return. Every flight left on time and arrived early. Food was served in economy class even on the internal flight that last 45 minutes and it was quite decent. Planes were brand new. Great inflight entertainment for economy class. The cabin crews were all very friendly and charming. Used the business lounges (with my Miles and More gold card) and they were fine. Other family members also flew with Avianca (from LAX to GUA) and were similarly pleased. Reading the other reviews here was a bit anxious so it was a nice surprise.

### Avianca customer review
LHR-BOG-UIO in business class. I decided to fly with Avianca because of the price for the business class. I know their reputation so I didn't set my expectation too high. The flight overall was ok. There was a mechanical problem just minutes after the plane took off from LHR. The plane had to go back to check the landing gear. The plane looked tired and they didn't manage to clean up the cabin properly. The business class seat is really poor compared to the other airlines but I could still get good sleep. The FA were definitely not up to the international standard. The meal and IFE were poor overall with limited options. Would I recommend this airline? Probably not but if you can get good price and set your expectation low enough they are probably not a bad option.

### Avianca customer review
The most horrible experience onboard the new 787 Dreamliner yesterday I flew from Bogota - New York in Business Class and I was very disappointed with this new aircraft! I can't believe how uncomfortable the Business class seat was! So hard it has no comfort no soft leather etc. It was so hard that I couldn't sleep at anytime during the flight. Excellent things were: the service the crew the food the entertainment system and the upper compartments.

### Avianca customer review
Today I flew with my two small kids from New York to Lima with a stopover in Bogota. Due to weather in the U.S. the flight was delayed but got in early enough for us to catch our connecting flight. But Avianca decided to use our delay as an excuse to already give our seats to other passengers as the flights was oversold. We were told that we had seats on the next flights 3 hours later but that was a lie. When boarding started I was waiting to handed my boarding passes but instead I was told that this flight was also full and I should wait for the next flight or could take a flight the next day. The staff were not only rude but did not seem to care much about the fact that I had 2 very small children with me. We afterwards found out from other passengers that this seemed to be a very common practice at Avianca. It seems their business strategy is clearly not based on customer service but rather on short term profit maximization. I do not recommend anyone especially parents with small children to use Avianca for connecting flights.

### Avianca customer review
Myself and my 2 daughters have recently returned from South America after a month and a half flying multiple times with Avianca. Our travel agent booked our flights. We found the quality of service A+++. The planes were very modern very roomy which is a point of difference these days the crew were a credit to the company. I would highly recommend flying with them and will not hesitate to book with them in the future.

### Avianca customer review
Will never fly again. Flight delayed 2 hours from Flores - no explanation. We left Guatamala on route to JFK with a short stop over in El Salvador - it was an old plane. The plane we got on in El Salvador was even older. Arrived at JFK and waited for our luggage along with about 30 other people. Luggage never got loaded on in El Salvador. Luggage arrived 27 hours later! I understand that things happen but the Avianca people were rude and not the least bit apologetic!

### Avianca customer review
I will never fly Avianca to Central America again! I was flying with my one year old daughter from JFK to Guatemala and had a stop with a layover of 4 hours. As soon as I got off the plane I had to wait for them to give me my stroller for about 20 minutes. When I finally got my stroller the flight attendant informed me my flight was delayed by 3 more hours (bringing the total layover time to 7 hours! with a baby and with absolutely no explanation or reason for the delay). Once the time came for preparing to board there was not one employee from Avianca at the gate. No one to ask for info no one to ask what was going on. The time came for when we were actually supposed to be taking off and still no one and still no explanation as to why. Eventually an hour later we boarded. On the way back home I got to the check in and had to wait until the counter staff showed up 2 hours before the flight (again no explanation or apology). When I got to my stop in El Salvador they almost lost my stroller because they thought it was supposed to stay in El Salvador even though it clearly said on the tag to give it to me there and that I had to go to Newark. At El Salvador Avianca airport it was extremely chaotic (also no scanners for carry on so I almost lost my flight because it took so long with each person).

### Avianca customer review
3 domestic flights within Colombia in the last month. Flight AV 9754 BOG-CTG was initially delayed 30 minutes but after boarding we had to wait another 2 hours before take off. It so happens that there was no purser! That only transpired later though as passengers were not informed at all of what was going on. Total contempt for passengers. Avianca does not have enough crew back up according to locals. Past 3 am arrival at destination. Other flights on time but crew disinterested. Good hard product but it seems wasted on this airline.

### Avianca customer review
Very complete and satisfying trip by Avianca using a modern fleet of ATR-72. The cabins and seats are very comfortable and spacious. Since the trip was short they didn't provided any food or drinks. The flight was between Bogota and Villavicencio.

### Avianca customer review
I use AV quite a lot for both International flights within Latin America as well as domestic flights. This comment refers to my last flight from Bogota to Barranquilla in Business Class. AV now uses El Dorado Terminal for many domestic flights (for the routes with highest traffic) which is convenient especially if you have to connect to international flights. The lounge has also improved but it is mostly very crowded. Long queues at the entrance. Outbound A318 inbound A320. Business Class seats spacious very nice compared to the European "middle seat free" concept. AVOD available also on domestic flights (even so in Y). These are the positive aspects. Now to the negative points: As mentioned before Lounge in BOG is always crowded lounge in BAY even worse in the evening it makes no sense to enter you don't find any space. F&B offering ok but always picked within 2 minutes. AV says they provide you with Food in the Lounge so they dont provide any food onboard not even in C Class. Not even a pack of peanuts! So when you don't find space in the Lounge you have to go and buy something because onboard you wont get anything! This is very poor for an airline that wants to present itself as the industry leader in Latin America! The crew is mostly nice and gentle and because of the nice seat I rate them 5/10 for the experience in domestic C Class. If it was European concept with middle seat free I would not even rate them 1/10 because apart from the mentioned negative points the ticket prices are very high for C Class.

LIM-BOG on 13 October. A320 with upgraded interior. Flight attendants smiling and very friendly through the entire flight. On-time departure and arrival (always a remote parking for this flight for some reason at BOG - airport is crazy busy at night). Excellent food served and AVOD had alot of shows and movies. Baggage out quickly. Always enjoy flying Avianca in South America.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-MAD-BOG J class. Both flights left on time. Dated and worn A330s (bad luck I guess as they have new ones) not lie-flat but seats comfortable enough to assure an average rest. While the outbound leg (AV10 Nov 3) featured a disinterested and rude crew and provided a below standard business class food and beverage offer the return early morning flight proved a great difference beginning with the greatly appointed Velazquez IB lounge in MAD with an expansive F&B and amenities offer which is a huge contrast with the substandard and rude AV lounge in BOG. Return AV 27 (Nov 8) offered a good early morning breakfast (almost a brunch) and then a fairly good lunch with a reasonable wine and spirits offer all of them served by a rather friendly crew. Arrival in BOG at 1pm avoids the rush and chaos of the tiny and third-world shaped EDR international terminal. I would fly them again when upgraded. Otherwise IB is a better option especially when flying coach.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-SMR brand new and beautifully appointed A320 with mood lightning. Nice crew and standard AV beverage service which is really substandard as only coffee water and box juices were available. On time departure and arrival pleasant flight and quick baggage retrieval. SMR airport is a shame as it remains exactly the same as 30 years ago. A real shame on the Colombian Civil Aviation authority but not AVIANCA's fault. Despite a good flight experience they charged about USD 250 one way and this was an early booking.

### Avianca customer review
I flew several various Avianca flights with friends through Peru and Ecuador in the past two and a half weeks and I am greatly dissatisfied with the airline in general particularly through Peru (Lima/Cuzco). The flights never left on-time and on-average left an hour and a half after the scheduled departure time. Due to connecting flights there was about a 15 minute grace period getting off one flight and going through customs immigration and then through security again to get to the next gate (flight crew did not provide instruction whether there was a way to skip all of these steps ahead of time). In addition on an early morning 3-hour flight a friend observed the entire flight crew napping in the back of the plane. I find this appalling. I would not recommend Avianca to future fliers and I am going to avoid Avianca in the future despite pricing.

One of our party had baggage delay and Avianca was of great assistance. Great experience would fly again.

Medillin - Madrid business. First don't go airside too quickly as there's nothing to do Medillin is mainly a domestic airport so no lounge airside. Nice cabin friendly staff. AVOD starts immediately and goes right to landing. Food excellent could hardly finish it all. Drinks flowing good champagne. All announcements (there are many they like to talk) in English too. Slept 6/7 hours easily. Arrived in lovely terminal 4 and easily made a BA flight 2 hours later. Bag first off. Very good experience all given beautiful flowers to celebrate flower festival in Madrid.

Avianca Well done on a professional service you have done yourselves proud I will be flying again with Avainca both me and my family.

Flight AVA121 on the route LHR-BOG. Boarding was fast and the ground staff were really attentive. The selection of onboard drinks is extensive. The service from the flight attendants was excellent. They are attentive and seem happy always with a smile. The options on the menu for dinner were great from the starters through to the dessert. The seat is very comfortable (Business on A330-200) almost lie-flat. I slept 7 hours non-stop. The amenity kit was very complete and the duvet is very comfy. Breakfast was also very tasty. Flight arrived 30 mins early. The only not excellent detail I found was the selection of onboard entertainment. Recommended.

Madrid-bBogota-Medillin business class. Very impressed in general. Cabin new and spacious. All crew spoke fairly good English. TV system good lots of tv shows games enough movies. Worked right from start of flight to landing crew friendly and hard working good breakfast followed by lunch 2 hours later which I didn't expect didn't get my choice but good food anyway. Tapas and drinks before landing lovely Crew really lovely chatted to some crew in galley very nice. Good manner and a little Spanish goes a long way. Transfer in Bogota painless. TV video explains what will happen you stay in same terminal for Medellin flights. All very fast and easy to get around. Flight to Medellin 25 minutes still managed to get a nice rum and coke! Highly recommended in this class. They are starting to fly to London and LA as well I might switch from CX to them!

AV 007 July 2 2014 Miami-Bogota. AV 9207 July 6 2014 Bogota-Cali. AV 8420 July 10 2014 Cali-Bogota. Really disappointed about the development of Avianca - starting with their new ugly livery. The crew from Miami to Bogota were completely uninterested in attending to passengers after the meal was served. During the meal I asked for a wine and water. One attendant said: normally only one beverage is served per passenger! The cup of wine is tiny (half of a normal cup)! The food was a joke have never seen smaller portions on routes over 3 hours. 3 mini- strips of meat tasteless. No salt or pepper available on board. The airline is the only one I know with a Duty Free seller on board. I wanted to buy a whiskey but it was not available. This person was not friendly or enthusiastic at all. After arrival in Bogotá the crew did not say goodbye they were just packing their stuff. Who invented this terrible new seat? For small people maybe nice for tall people like me a disaster - the headrest hurts my neck. Seat pitch was better some years ago. The service on the domestic routes did not convince me either. They only serve bad coffee or artificial juices. The planes are new but not very well cleaned. Positive: All my flights were on time. The new airport terminal in Bogotá is a massive improvement.

### Avianca customer review
Flew MDE-JFK on flight AV 42 21st June 2014. It is not worth flying Business Class. The seat is extremely uncomfortable especially if performing a night long-flight where your utmost interest is trying to sleep. There is no VIP lounge in the International aeroport of Medellin. The crew cannot be nicer but their disregard for the basic concepts of business class service is regrettable and even more the lack of consideration when you make a complaint due to the disservice is shocking. The lack of international standards in service makes you wonder why didn't you fly coach!

Business class BOG-JFK. Modern new airy business lounge at El Dorado before the flight was nice but food offerings were somewhat limited. Flight was fine. Seats were not up to BIZ class. Limited recline and tiny fold- down footrests. OK personal IFA. Nice amenity kit. Flight was on time. Bags came off first in JFK.

I flew on May 31st and return on Jun 23rd. MDE-BOG-MAD-BOG-MED. I am a frequent and loyal traveler with this airline. Best option in domestic flights but average or below average on International flights. Agree with some reviews: Stewardesses disappeared once the first meal was served they look like they don't enjoy the job one of them asked me in a rude way to put down the entertainment screen (while counterparts in domestic flights do this for you). On domestic flights staff is very kind but international flights I have to say they need to learn from many airlines and colleagues in domestic flights. Seats are excellent even in economy. Entertainment system with variety but with technical problems. Food was ok.

### Avianca customer review
We took a flight from Washington DC to Lima Peru. The flight had a delay at Bogota (only stop) due to airport traffic. They told us that Avianca had everything under control and that the flight already knew about us and they would wait. We had about 40 minutes to get from one gate to the other so we were very calm. Avianca park the plane on the last spot of the airport so the commute (by bus) was very long and once we got there they told us the plane had gone. We had to go through a very long and slow line to get to the counter. We were put on a 5.30am flight so only slept 3 hours and one bag was lost and. Very bad experience.

### Avianca customer review
SMR-BOG Late evening flight from Santa Marta. This airport is apparently being upgraded in the near future - and not before time. There are no information screens anywhere in the airport and all announcements are garbled so that even Spanish speakers find it hard to understand. On the plus side there is free wifi so we were able to track Avianca's inbound flight - which was almost an hour late landing. The airport is just too small to cope with boarding two planes simultaneously - it was a nightmare! The crew did a good job of turning the aircraft quickly and we were boarded fairly quickly. Ignored by staff at the boarding door who were more interested in their own conversation - other crew much more proactive. Very new A320 new leather seats with excellent legroom and large TV with a range of AVOD TV programmes you can start watching straight away. Once airbourne quick coffee/juice run and then it was almost time for landing. Once on the ground parked at horrible old terminal. Bags took almost an hour to come off. Having meant to have landed at 2330 I left the airport at 0100. Not great.

### Avianca customer review
Avianca is fast becoming one of my favourite airlines (I fly on average once per week for business often internationally). Recently flew Santiago-Bogota-San Jose return and found Avianca excellent in all respects. All flights and connections on- time excellent professional service only spoilt by an obnoxious fellow passenger which meant I may have been avoided by the flight attendants from time to time on one flight. Food and wine excellent and a very good lounge in Bogota. Avianca uses the COPA lounge in San Jose which is fine with good personal service provided.

### Avianca customer review
Madrid-Bogota-Cartagena. The transatlantic sector was not full but I wonder why all people were seated together if more than 30% of the seats were free. The last 6 rows were almost empty. I changed my seat and had the middle row of 4 for me alone. A330 not in good condition some IFE monitors broken and others not running well. The plane was not so clean. Food service was okay. Stewardesses some friendly others not interested. English skills mediocre. Announcements hard to understand. After first meal service staff disappeared. Before landing in Bogota snack service - small portions but okay. I wonder why they have one staff member on board only selling duty free products and don't assisting the other members of the crew. Bogota- Cartagena. 1 hour flight time only artificial juices some coke and poor coffee served no snack. Staff smiling and with lots of make up. Friendlier than the other crews on long haul flights! So I would give them 2.5 stars on transatlantic and 3 on Colombian route.

### Avianca customer review
My first flight with Avianca was mediocre: from Toronto to San Salvador to Guayaquil. On the first flight there was no routine safety review and the service was slow but fine. However on the return flight the customer service was appalling. We boarded the plane and then after waiting over an hour with no communication we were told the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues and we needed to get off. The Avianca staff then proceeded to have us wait at the baggage carousel for close to 5 hours with next to no communication no systems in place to deal with the various flight arrangements and accommodations and no food or water. People had been at the airport since 2am and we didn't get a shuttle to a hotel until 9.5 hours later with next to no proactive communication on their part. The staff tended to walk around together and claimed they couldn't do anything without their supervisor's permission who was absent from the scene. At the core of the issue was their lack of professional and organized communication strategy.

Flew Business Class round trip from LAX to SJO with layover in SAL. Flight to SAL and SJO were great. Service was good food was good seats were very comfortable. Coming back from SJO to SAL. Was delayed on the tarmac for a great while because there weren't enough buses to pick up the passengers. We had to wait until one was available. They packed the bus so full that there wasn't enough seating for people who really needed it. We almost missed our flight from SAL to LAX. The flight from SAL to LAX was terrible. After lunch service no one offered any subsequent drink service or snacks. The attendant was absent for most of the flight. Not the type of service you would expect. Coach received better service than we did in business class.

Madrid-Bogota-Neiva. Being a handicapped person I mentioned this with the booking for assistance. The attendants were always on time with a wheelchair. Had a seat against the wall where the toilets are on an Airbus A330 lots of legspace and no need to walk too much. Very nice crew and flight attendants. Overall very pleasant flight and as a regular to Colombia visiting my parents in law I always when possible book Avianca.

Recently flew from LAX to San Salvador and then on to Lima Peru. I thought the flight down was much better than the flight coming back. Got a special rate which was nice. Staff were excellent on my first flight and very helpful. Food was good as I am a vegetarian so requested special meal which was pasta salad and a roll. Seats were very comfortable. Plane was on time and I had a short layover in San Salvador. The flight coming back was different. Food was a ravioli dish but it was too hot to eat and covered with too much cheese. I didn't eat it. Movie was a film which I had already seen. Had a 5 hour stopover in San Salvador and tried to get on an earlier flight. Was told that a change to the earlier flight would cost me a change fee and I did not want to do that so waited the 5 hours in San Salvador for the later flight. I would consider a flight again with this airline as overall I was very satisfied.

### Avianca customer review
Very satisfied with Avianca/Taca services Cali-San Salvador-Washington (IAD). Upgraded to Business Class as Avianca Elite Program member. New planes amazing on time landing at IAD despite of an ongoing snowstorm in Washington Metro Area. Attentive flight attendants. Convenient routing from Northern South America to North American destinations via Avianca's Central American hubs.

### Avianca customer review
I flew 3 times during the last 3 weeks with Avianca. First from Sao Paulo to Salvador de Bahia. Check in at GRU was friendly and efficient. Getting to the departure gate was complicated the gate was changed twice and the final gate had another city and flight listed. All this may be the problem with GRU airport. The next was from Rio to Bogota. An International flight where a light breakfast was served about an hour after take off and then nothing not even water. You had to ask for water to the sullen stewardess at the back of the plane. It was a 6 hour flight. The flight today was from Bogota to Cartegena. Avianca has a dedicated terminal which was very busy but efficient. All 3 flights left between 20-30 minutes later than scheduled. The staff decidedly looked away when you were boarding probably anxious that you may ask a question. Other passengers were on my allocated seat on two flights and I had to engage with them whilst staff looked away. Perhaps it's the local way. The plus was new Airbus jets 320 and 319.

### Avianca customer review
IAD-BOG-IAD. A319 in economy both flights on time with meal and snack on each flight. Food was nothing special but at least was available. All seats had large screens and wide selection of IFE. Much better flight and service than US-based carriers to South America.

### Avianca customer review
I recently took a trip to Colombia Jan 22nd 2014 Flight number 9754. This was the best airline for courtesy service comfort and looking after your needs. I would definitely fly this airline again. Adds to the experience when your comfortable on an aircraft.

### Avianca customer review
JFK-SAP-RTB-SAL-JFK on A320's and ATR-42's. The Airbus on JFK-SAP and SAL-JFK legs were extremely new built in 2012 according to the boarding door plaque very quiet with mood lighting individual IFE. The legroom is about 31 or 32" so if you are a long-legged individual consider getting an exit row seat or fly business class. Very comfortable flight both ways. Complimentary food and soft beverages were served by very nice smiling stewardesses. ATR-42's were pretty old but they have better leg room and despite moderate turbulence over the Honduran mountainside refreshments were served. This was my third time traveling this route and I will continue to choose Avianca as long as they offer competitive fares.

### Avianca customer review
Madrid-Bogota-Cali and return: Skytrax rates Avianca with 3 stars I think this is realistic. Long haul flights: Food average nothing special average portions. They only offer drinks during the meal service. If you want something to drink you have to go to the galley. Flight attendant button is only to be used in "emergencies" I was told! I could not go to the galley because of the sleeping passenger next to me I was really thirsty and a half full glass of water was brought to me in a rude way. Inflight entertainment often breaks down movie selection ok. Seat pitch really limited. Airbus relatively new but not really clean. The toilets were not cleaned during the flight. Flight attendants disappear for the most time of the 10 hour flight. For the relatively high ticket prices bad value for money compared e.g. to the star alliance partner LH. Domestic flights both on time but mediocre service. Very limited drink service on board (bad coffee - a shame of a Colombian airline) no snack served. Staff smiling but in my opinion it is a false friendliness. English announcements hard to understand English skills also in Bogota airport depending on the employee limited. International concourse in Bogota improved a lot but you always have to be bussed to the domestic Puente Aereo Terminal which costs time and is no well organized. Next time I will use a different carrier at least for the transatlantic sectors.

### Avianca customer review
EWR-SAL-GYE-LIM-BOG-SAL-EWR in the promo fare of Avianca flew 6 times in one week. Although the ticket was very cheap and I did book lowest economy fare as a Gold Member of Star Alliance I was upgraded twice to Business Class. All planes on that trip were brand new EWR-SAL an Airbus A320. Seats in Economy were comfortable in Business there were relaxing recliners with a footrest. The individual inflight entertainment has a huge selection of great Movies and TV shows in Spanish English and Portuguese. Food in both cabins is good and fresh. Service is excellent. Friendly and helpful crews. The Airports I did visit are world class and lounges for Business and Gold members offer free drinks and food. The brand new Bogota Avianca lounge is impressive.

### Avianca customer review
We (myself my wife and 2 grandchildren) traveled from Bucaramanga to Amsterdam the larger part of the flight from Bogota to Barcelona was made in an excellent A330. The flight from Bucaramanga was made with an A320 the food and beverage are pretty good. the only regret I have is that they serve beverages only during meals. My wife and I travel yearly at least once to Colombia and the last few years we always use Avianca as carrier.

### Avianca customer review
Flight from Panama to Bogota in a brand new Airbus A320. I was really surprised by the comfort in economy class. Own AVOD. Very nice staff and excellent food and beverages.

### Avianca customer review
Arrival at San Salvador on December 3/2012 from Toronto was less than standard. We were deplaned in the middle of the runway and cramped on a substandard bus which did not moved for a long while. Personnel at the gate were very unhelpful and displayed an unusual unfriendly attitude forgetting customer service is pivotal in this kind of industry.

### Avianca customer review
SJU-BOG-CLO 12/20/2013 Flights: AV259 AV73 (missed). With over 4.5 million miles flown I have experienced all types of airlines and routes. None however match Avianca in sheer mediocrity. Our issues began with their phone reservation system we made some changes that were never registered when we arrived to check in. Our flight connected through BOG but the check in person did not know whether or not our bags would go through. She said "ask in BOG". Ok. Our flight was 1 hour and 40 minutes late so we missed our connection. No one from Avianca was there to greet connecting passengers. No information. In customs we were told by one Avianca person to wait for the bags then another to go to the connecting flight area. We had three possible connecting times but their poor handling of passengers made us all miss them. Turns out the bags were not checked through but my wife found them an hour later in the carrousel. We spent the night in Bogota paid by Avianca and then proceeded the next day chaotic conditions throughout. Never again. All flights miss timetables but it's how the situation is handled where the good are separated from the bad. Avianca doesn't even make the "bad" category. Their fleet is modern Airbuses but the pitch is so tight that forget using your laptop to work on the plane if the person in front reclines. So that's bad too. Avoid this airline.

### Avianca customer review
I flew from Bogota to Manizales just a few days ago. The aircraft appeared brand new and was very clean and comfortable. The staff were most professional and the service (not much as it was such a short flight) was more than adequate. The only problem was the Manizales airport which is often covered by thick cloud and therefore closed because the pilot has to land by sight. Instruments are definitely needed! I wasn't paying for the flight so cannot comment on value.

### Avianca customer review
San Jose to San Salvador and to Belize City. We were greeted with friendly smiles and offered sparkling wine or orange juice or water. The staff was impeccable and service first class. Avianca use porcelain dinner wear glass and linen etc. Just try getting sparkling wine on any US Flight.

### Avianca customer review
Bogota to Rio in business class. Seat is sit up type for overnight flight. Very uncomfortable. Shower unavailable despite new lounge. Check-in was badly handled by a zealous but poorly trained staff.

### Avianca customer review
I moved to South America 1 month ago I have taken 4 Avianca flights to Chile and Argentina but the one last Sunday from Argentina to Lima was a disaster no air-conditioning so it was really hot the meal of chicken was so salty it was not possible to eat it they insulted us by putting 2 kids movies on back to back on an evening flight full of adults. It was miserable and never want to take a flight like that again! The crew were not pleasant. I felt they had no regard for customer service.

### Avianca customer review
Flight BOG-MAD-BOG. Both legs on Business Class. Comfortable VIP Lounges both at Eldorado and Barajas. Priority Boarding worked perfectly. Welcome champagne and peanuts were delicious. Although the seat is not fully flat 170 it was very comfortable and I was able to sleep during almost all the journey. Food was delightful and the coffee was simply great. Staff smiled all the time and were very attentive at all times. They voluntarily brought you cookies and other small meals at different times of the flight. Flight arrived on time and the luggage was priority. Great Choice.

### Avianca customer review
Took several legs. SJO-SAL-UIO-LIM-CUZ-LIM-SJO. ALL flights on time. Sufficient staff at the airports to keep the check-in lines short. Never had to wait longer than 5-10 min. Ground crew as well as flight crew friendly and efficient. They give you the feeling that you are a guest and not just a pax. Decent on-board service on mainly brand-new airbus aircraft. The brand new ones have 'mood lightning' in the cabin which is very nice on night flights. Decent on-board service. Even on a 1hr-flight they serve a small snack and beverages for free incl. alcoholic drinks. Full meal on the 2hr flight UIO-LIM. Food quality is nothing fancy but it's ok. In theory they offer also a free in-seat entertainment system. However not all aircraft are equipped with it even not some brand new ones. On the 2 legs where it was existent it was out of order. Here is room to improve and provide the same standard at least on flights over 2 or 3 hrs. So if you need entertainment bring your own or a good book since you don't know what you get. Overall a pleasant experience and I will fly Avianca again.

### Avianca customer review
GRU-BOG-JFK all A330-200. First time flying AV. Pleasantly surprised with comfortable seating in business and VOD (heard other negative comments on the same flight using the smaller A319). Meals were satisfactory for the flight as both flights were red-eyes and full. Flights arrived on time and El Dorado Airport (BOG) is a convenient airport to connect (although I spent two-days in Bogota for business). Business class lounge is large comfortable and offers subdivided room for a more intimate feel. Appetisers were abundant as were beverage selections. Will fly them (although will fly LAN next to compare).

### Avianca customer review
GRU-BOG-MEX - good performance GRU-BOG on A330 and BOG-MEX on A320 both with good seating and individual IFE. Food and beverages fine friendly competent crew. BOG-MEX with quite a delay as some luggage had to be unloaded officially missing passengers but from what was unloaded more likely wrong freight. Check-in in Bogota was one of the longest I had in many months despite only baggage drop! If my check-in time was typical you should calculate some 60 minutes!

### Avianca customer review
BOG-MAD business class. Flight on time nice amenity kits and average welcome drinks. Very poor catering and wine on offer.

### Avianca customer review
SCL-BOG-SCL with side travel to San Jose on TACA. Excellent flights on Avianca with superb service food and wines on modern A330s. Unfortunately Avianca do not have a business lounge at Santiago (which took me an hour to discover). However Avianca's lounge at their home base of Bogota is very good and an interesting location in Bogota's modern terminal. The cabin crews' uniforms are quite stunning!. I recommend this airline for travel through and to South America.

### Avianca customer review
Flew from SCL to MAD via BOG - Airbus 330. The service was superb. Food is good. Not as many wines as on LAN but I paid one third of what LAN charges on the same route same dates. Seats are very good even though not fully horizontal. Good headphones. Some of these planes have good space for carry on baggage others are way too small. Their frequent flyer program is very good. Some nice details are the flower they put on the meal tray and the a small package of Colombian coffee they give you as a present to take home.

### Avianca customer review
Early June flew Avianca #24 from LIM to BOG. Nice A330 widebody which always makes the flight better. Boarding was delayed and once they called the flight it didn't matter which cabin you were in - people flooded the gate. Once on-board it was smiles from the flight attendants. Pillows and blanket on each seat. Flight was full - drink run and dinner served. Food was good and watched movies and TV shows on their great entertainment system. FA's came around multiple times with water - and always friendly. Landed in BOG during a rainstorm - parked on the tarmac by the cargo area. Had to be bussed across the airport (took 25 minutes cramped in the bus) - immigration was quick and bags came out rapidly. Overall very impressed with Avianca and would fly them again.

### Avianca customer review
I have flown several flights with Avianca - within Colombia (Bogota San Andres Cartagena) and international (Bogota-Madrid). Planes have always been clean food has been good and flights on time. On all flights domestic and international the turn out of the crew has been exceptional immaculate uniforms and grooming - A sense of pride which is something that I see less of in European and American Airlines that I have flown with these last years. Only issue I have had was being turned out of the emergency exit seat on a domestic flight when the crew member briefing me on the emergency procedure for that row discovered I didn't speak Spanish. Since most the passengers did not speak English there was not much I could say really. Of all options available from London to Bogota (and that's quite a few but none direct unfortunately) Avianca from Madrid is my preference. A good all round airline with exceptional crew turn out and service in my experience + prices are good.

### Avianca customer review
MIA-BOG on May 11 BOG-MIA on June 11. On time departure A330 very comfortable. Great inflight entertainment. Food was good. The best of all the price I paid only $303 for a round-trip. Overall good and professional service both at check in and onboard.

### Avianca customer review
AV93 CUR-BOG. Check in ok. Boarding by rows on time FA welcoming and nice. On boar A320 comfortable seating good seat pitch. Only 1.5 hr flight served snack and drinks. Early arrival at Bogota. The only negative comment on the disembark by buses (old ones uncomfortable long waiting and way to the terminal). Once cleared immigration luggage on belt fast. Good quality airline.

### Avianca customer review
I have been flying with Avianca from Washington DC to Bogota since they opened that route. I always had a good experience with them and the service has been pretty good. The only complaint I have is how high their rates have been lately. I think they need a competitor "soon" with direct flights from WAS to BOG. I used to go to BOG twice a year to see my family but with those rates now it is just getting difficult.

### Avianca customer review
San Jose to Bogota on board an Airbus 320. Flight departed on time. I was impressed with Avianca because they offer a full lunch meal for a flight lasting only One hour and fifty minutes. Crew were very helpful with passengers and very professional in their work.

### Avianca customer review
This is the latest airline to offer domestic flights in Brazil. The fleet is modern. With A320 and A319 aircrafts. I flew from Sao Paulo to Natal and back both flights involving a change in Brasilia all 4 fights were full the seats were equipped with seat back video and a snack and drinks were offered on all sectors the cabin crew were very smart and professional and there was nothing to fault. All in all a good experience on a very well run airline which was a joy to fly forget TAM or GOL try Avianca if they fly where you want to go you will not be disappointed.

### Avianca customer review
Waiting for AV 21 from JFK to BOG in the barely acceptable Swiss lounge AV is using at JFK. 3.5 hour delay. These things happen though this particular flight is late out of BOG 28 of 30 times (I tracked last month) and 12 out of 30 times so late that the return from New York has to be pushed back. AV personnel of course calls every delay an "unusual regrettable incident" but after a couple of years lies wear thin. Isn't it time that management create a schedule which can actually be completed? In the meantime I will take AA whenever I can. Better a predictable layover in MIA than AV's amateur act (not to speak of the consistently ghastly food on this run).

### Avianca customer review
Recently flew 4 flights with Avianca throughout Colombia (BOG/MED/CTG/BOG) and was a pleasant experience on every one. Check in was a breeze and all flights departed on time. Quite comfortable on board and staff were very accommodating. On one flight to Costa Rica I was delayed a day due to not having my yellow fever certificate with me. Check in staff at Cartagena were more than understanding and helpful of the situation. For the price I paid it's the best value airline I have flown. Other people have had problems accessing cheap flights with a foreign credit card but with a bit of research I found a way to access them.

### Avianca customer review
BOG to ADZ (San Andres Isla) on March 31st and back on April 4th: everything went smoothly flights on time operated by nice and new planes with comfortable seats and good service delivered with a smile. Both A320 had the personal TV screen which is not common on a less than 2hr flight and a good entertainment system (suffering some rebooting problems during the return flight). Tickets not very cheap though (USD 900 for two persons) but very close to the only two competitors available for this route (LAN and COPA). The only problem with Avianca national flights is the Puente Aereo terminal they use in Bogota kind of small and overcrowded building while the brand new international terminal (El Dorado) is a state of the art facility. Will surely consider to fly again with them in the future.

18/3/2013 BCN-BOG-PEI. Easy check in at BCN airport smooth boarding and reasonable comfort seat on A330. Transfer in Bogota without complications to flight to Pereira on A321. All on time. Inflight entertainment is very good meals basic but okay. Friendly staff. 2/4/2013 PEI-BOG-MAD checked in too late to have baggage labelled to Madrid had to collect baggage in Bogota and check them in for flight to Madrid. To have this done you need to be there 3 hours before your flight leaves. Bogota is airport is very efficient checking in baggage was done quick. Worth doing this option as to wait for 3 hours on flight at Pereira airport. Flight to Madrid left and arrived on time. Good service will definitely fly Avianca again. Very good value for money.

### Avianca customer review
MAD-BOG business class. Cheaper than Iberia sometimes much cheaper. Overall not bad but certainly does not let you feel "special" as when flying with the Middle East companies. Food is good. Staff are kind but not attentive. Don't provide pyjamas. Food is served in trays and the table is not laid for you they will just give you a set of cutlery. Linen are cheap quality not sure if it is cotton. In the bathroom low quality paper towels. Toothbrush is in two pieces and is uncomfortable to hold. No razor nor shaving cream. Only a dozen films to choose from.

Flew from Bogota to Neiva and the Fokker 50 turboprop-powered plane was noisy. The views of the Andes were excellent though. The drinks were good but the coffee was not very tasty which is odd for a Colombian airline.

### Avianca customer review
JFK to BOG on March 19th in Business class. Check in was quick however made to wait in a long line before being let into the dedicated business class line. Directed to the Swiss Airlines Lounge which is nice enough. Onboard everything was great. Flight attendants were nice and helpful. The toilets were clean and usable. Seat (1K) was comfortable enough but they should definitely have the option to lie flat for longer flights. Gave us amenity kits which contained L'Occitane products. One of the biggest selling points for Avianca is their Inflight Entertainment System. Served breakfast shortly after take off and it was rather good but afterwards flight attendants disappeared until one hour before landing. I would expect to be offered drinks or other services in between. Arrival had no issues and the new international terminal in Bogota has made a huge difference for international travelers since the building is comfortable making visitors feel welcome. Hopefully they will continue to improve their service.

Mar 12 from UIO via BOG and MAD to ZRH in Economy. Flight from BOG to MAD was on AV 26 with an Airbus 330-200. My aisle seat was very comfortable and fortunately I brought my own entertainment for the flight because in-flight entertainment from Avianca is very basic. The worst was the service and the quality and quantity of the food. The stewards were never seen in the cabin except during the meal distribution. During the flight we got two small hot meals which were both poor in quality. I had much preferred a single but better quality hot meal and before the landing a small snack. I got a cheap ticket on Avianca for this reason I don't complain and next time I will bring food for the flight. Avianca is fine if you can get a really cheap ticket from Colombia to Europe.

### Avianca customer review
Flight from Madrid via Bogota to Cartagena on March 10. Check-in staff at Madrid unfriendly I had only one bag with 23.8 kg and they made me remove exactly 0.8 kg otherwise I had to pay baggage excess. Departure on time but flight turbulent. No information that flight would be one hour longer than expected. Seat pitch poor. Food okay nothing special and small portions. Due to turbulence no drinks were served but we were not able to stand up due to seat belts sign being on for almost 8 of 11 hours flight. Dinner served before landing but in such a rush only water was served with it. Change of plane in Bogota change to domestic terminal with bus due to delay - less than an hour to reach the flight. Connecting flight on time crew a little bit arrogant and poor English skills. No food served on one hour flight! Only some coffee cheap juices or water. Positive: in seat screens even on the domestic flight but don't need this really. Bag did not arrive and had to pick it up at the airport no delivery to hotel offered!

LHR-MAD-BOG-PEI (return) 29 Jan and 6 Mar 2013. Suitcase checked straight through to destination both ways no customs check in Colombia. Departure level of new Bogota airport now operational and efficient. Uncomfortable 2-hour queue to have case contents briefly checked in Pereira airport on return leg. No electric fans or air-conditioning in the humid airport. Presented with another passenger's boarding card PEI-BOG and a surly attitude for the correct exchange. Bogota airport shop prices extortionate. LHR-MAD sector on Iberia: must pay for any food and drink. I had pre-booked special meals 6 weeks earlier BOG-MAD. Once on board the cabin crew made absolutely no effort to identify myself as recipient as had been my experience on many Europe - Far Eastern trips. It was a night flight with evening dinner and breakfast being served. On deplaning the chief steward showed me the diet printout with my correct name and seat number being one of only three and admitted it should have been served. Stewardess on my section claimed I had been 'asleep'.

### Avianca customer review
Took various international and domestic flights with Avianca in February and was mostly very impressed. Good IFE fairly good food and quite helpful cabin crew (though not entirely smiley). Even had IFE on jet-based domestic flights so was able to keep entertained with Solitaire! Seating very comfortable on domestic legs but tight on international flights. Competing with Iberia probably keeps standards low on flights out of Madrid. Most flights on time though on two of the domestic flights one of our group's luggage went missing (though was sent on soon after). Am not convinced we will be able to check in online for our Cartegena to Bogota to Madrid flights but we will see and I will review those legs separately.

### Avianca customer review
Very good service. BOG-JFK-BOG. Aircraft A330 brand new. Crew members very helpful and polite. Food was good. Business class seats very comfortable and on board service very good. Check in at the counters fast and efficient. I have flown other airlines all over the world but this one is for me among the best in the scale of services they offer.

SDQ-BOG-CCS-BOG-SDQ. A320/330 Business class. A320 interior clean and comfy. A330 worn out and 170 degrees flat seats not important on 1.5 hr flight. Food is not the best. Only one choice pasta on all sectors no wine or spirit list. Crew polite but not really interested and very poor English. As far as lounges are concerned its a farce. The Bogota lounge is a section of the departure haul. No wine no spirits a few cheap sandwiches and a little fridge with a couple of beers. The fridge was locked and does not unlock till after 4pm. Unbelievable. CCS - no lounge. Will not use them anymore.

### Avianca customer review
3 legs with them: UIO-BOG (operated by AeroGal) and BOG-MDE-BOG. Everything okay in the air with nice planes (A320) smiling crews and overall a good service. Late arrival in Medellin due to foggy conditions. Problems start on the ground: I had to change my return ticket from Medellin and this was easily done in less than 5 minutes but was told I should pay the USD 40 modification fee in Medellin. Upon arrival in MDE I directly went to the ticket counter in the departure hall. After one hour in line I decided to leave. Later in the afternoon I found another Avianca office in Medellin - another 45 minutes before I could talk with an employee. My simple operation took 20 minutes. Never had such an experience before with any of the many airlines I have flown . My final rate is 8 for the air service and 3 for the ground service that they should absolutely improve or they are going to loose many customers including myself in the future.

SSA-SDU on Friday Jan 4. Brand new A320. Great IFE for a 1hr 40 min flight. Hot sandwiches. Good beverages. Smiles from the crew. Expensive ticket but much cheaper than the competition.

### Avianca customer review
Flew JFK-BOG-GRU on an Avianca's A330 and other then the fantastic fare appearance of the aircraft and warm attitude of the crew it is not worth flying Business Class. The seat is extremely uncomfortable if you try to sleep and the lack of international standards in service makes you wonder why didn't you fly coach! Again the crew cannot be nicer but their disregard for the basic concepts of business class service could be amusing if they did not include things such as not picking up glasses before landing and the way they serve meals.

BSB-GRU in A320. No thrills reasonable legroom good individual IFE system for a domestic route. Would be a good option if the company had a more robust network and consistent and reliable services.

Cali-Bogota-Barcelona. Disappointed by Avianca this time. Check-in at Cali airport chaotic extremely slow service and employee at counter robotic. Changed our previous pre-selected seats without comment. Cali-Bogota delayed 30 minutes arrival at Bogota at domestic Puente Aereo. 20 mins waiting time for bus transfer to international terminal. Fortunately we had 3.5 hrs connecting time less is too tight! Long queues at emigration. Plane Bogota-Barcelona full. New A330-200 but not very well maintained - seats and carpet had stains trash in seat pocket. Some staff friendly others were not and uninterested. No help placing handbags in the bins. Inflight service mediocre. Food quality bad (chicken was dry and rice tasteless) only plastic cutlery. Beverage service average. Poor headphone quality and also uncomfortable so it was not a great entertainment experience. Recommend to bring own headphones. After meal service crew disappeared drinks only upon request during the night. Very bad breakfast before landing served in a hurry 1 hour prior to land coffee was a shame for a Colombian airline. Seats uncomfortable for such a long flight. Entertainment box under the seat took me precious legroom. Staff at de-boarding tired and not so friendly. All in all average experience imagined service and comfort would be better. Customer service and food quality and quantity should be improved.

BAQ-MEX. With one stop in BOG to change planes. A319 from Barranquilla (BAQ) to Bogotá (BOG). Quick flight nice service only beverages in that short flight. Arrived to Bogotá Puente Aéreo is a chaos. Connecting flight on time. Long queue in emigration but not so annoying. Staff friendly on gate. Inflight service attentive and nice. Lunch was delicious with a good selection of beverages and coffee. The only drawback was IFE not good sound. Seats must improve for a flight of 4 hours. Will use them again.

J Class flight BOG-BCN. New aircraft (A33-200) good seating although not lie-flat nice comforter but tiny economy class-like pillows. Crew helpful and attentive offered preflight drinks (a decent Chilean sparkling and coconut lemonade) good quality amenity and sleeping kits and food and beverage menu The only disappointment was food. Very poor sausage canapés and shrimp "ceviche" and as a main course a horrible dish of chicken legs in a kind of passion fruit sauce or a hard over-cooked pepper steak. Good beverage offer the wine list has improved. Overall a nice and very punctual flight.

### Avianca customer review
We flew from Orlando to Rio de Janeiro with a change of planes in Bogota. In Orlando the business check in counter had no attendant so someone from the economy class came to assist us. We were also told that there was no business lounge in the terminal. Seats on the A319 did not recline and the food and beverage were of mediocre quality. We arrived in Bogota and the VIP business lounge was almost full. Very poor quality food being served and in the male toilets one was out of order and the other was filthy so I used the toilet outside the business lounge. The flight from Bogota to Rio was on the same kind of plane the A319: no decent reclining seats and the most annoying announcements that lasted all night long and did not allow you to sleep. They even woke us up in the middle of the night reminding us that you could not use mobile phones on the plane.

GIG-GRU: It's a shame Avianca aren't more of a presence in the Brazilian market; for this short hop I paid just over £25 one week before travel - far less than TAM Gol Webjet and Azul were all offering - and this included a 25kg piece of hold luggage plus food/drink on a flight little over 40 minutes. Possibly the fastest check-in security and boarding I've experienced and a more generous amount of legroom than other carriers. We got an old Fokker 100 on this route which despite showing a few signs of its age was very comfortable and smooth throughout. The cabin crew were all smiley and pleasant and served everyone promptly and we were reunited with our baggage all of 10 minutes after getting off the plane. A flight this long usually isn't worth writing about but if you're travelling domestically in Brazil check them out!

BCN-BOG: Great service in flight we left on time from Barcelona and arrived early to Bogota. The plane A330 was in immaculate condition. Throughout the whole flight there was open bar in the rear part of the plane. Meal was good and the great service by a friendly crew.

BOG-MDE PEI-BOG BOG-MDE MDE-BOG - All flights excellent service. Especially after a long haul flight from Europe with Iberia. Beverage and snack offering very good compared to European connections. Very friendly staff even though some didn't speak English. I would strongly recommend.

Medellin to Cartagena business class. Quick check in and near security. Good bag allowance. Upgraded at gate drinks service on short flight. Great seats and all announcements in Spanish and English. Much better that any USA carrier would compare with a good BA flight.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-PTY-BOG. Out in C back in Y. I had never flown AV before but found the service and aircraft configuration to be far better than anticipated. In C the seat is comfortable and has an adjustable leg rest in addition to the recline - a feature usually found only on long haul aircraft. The IFE array in both cabins was extensive and included USB and power at every seat as well as video on demand. In Y the seats also had footrests. The service was excellent and the food was tasty. From my point of view quite an undiscovered gem.

SSA-GRU: Excellent airline. New Airbus A-320 with a very good entertainment system for a 2.30 flight (individual screens). Captain kept making announcements about the weather conditions and the flight path. Check-in in Salvador quick and efficient. Avianca is the best domestic airline in Brazil. It's a pity they're still small and lack of more options.

### Avianca customer review
Flew BOG-CTG-BOG-ADZ-BOG. Very reasonable fare considering the journey was booked the night before travel. Very comfortable planes with inflight entertainment offered even on short journeys. Soft drinks and a small snack served. CTG-BOG flight was delayed which meant we missed the BOG-ADZ flight Avianca provided lunch and put us on a flight a couple of hours later that afternoon.

### Avianca customer review
I spend a lot of my time travelling on business in Colombia. Ecuador and Chile. I fly nearly exclusively Avianca and although the airline has its faults I think it provides an excellent balance of service and cost in particular when compared with US airlines flying in the region. Expect a lot of queue jumping and some confusion in particular at Bogota airport. The equipment they fly is up to date and if delays ensue one needs to take into account the prevailing weather conditions in the region. Inside the cabins are good and for the most part the inflight service fine - sometimes though you do run into 'lazy' crews. If there's one bad thing it's the food. In business it isn't 'C' class quality. Pricing is good as is the LIFEMILES program.

### Avianca customer review
Original itinerary CLO-LIM-EZE cancelled because of the weather conditions as Avianca Elite member I was given upgrade with a new itinerary CLO-BOG-EZE. Usual delays and dirty interiors at El Dorado Bogota but it is not the fault of the airline. Very nice business class section on board of A330. Seats are very comfortable and easily can be turned into almost flat bed. Big screens with a decent choice of recently aired movies. Welcome champagne is offered on boarding as well as amenities such as better-than-usual headphones. Colored menu is given with an interesting choice of meals. A number of cocktails offered with good wine as well. Food is tasteful and served beautifully. Shortly before arrival another meal is offered. Overall excellent.

### Avianca customer review
Ticketed by Avianca to go Bogota-Mexico City connecting onto Aeromexico to Los Angeles. I had 2.5 hours to make connection in Mexico City. Physically not possible to arrive in Mexico City go through immigration get luggage clear customs change to the other terminal check-in for new flight in that amount of time. Flight left Bogota 45 mins late but then sat on the runway for 30 minutes. In Mexico City it took 90 minutes before any luggage arrived. Upon missing the connection they told me it was my fault they offered no compensation or accommodation in Mexico City and suggested I purchase a new ticket. Finally after 2 hours they agreed to issue me a new ticket. The flight itself was actually quite nice with a good meal and friendly service.

### Avianca customer review
Four flight segments all in Y-class two pax senior age. MIA-BOG and BOG-SCL. We picked them because of convenient departure times out of MIA and due to a considerable price difference compared to LAN Chile. All 4 flights - domestic and international - were in almost new Airbus A320 and A330 planes thus impressively clean. Departure procedures at MIA and BOG international airports were chaotic the domestic terminal in BOG plus the terminals in Cartagena and Santa Marta are acceptable. Inflight service is ok for the domestic part - the service on international flights is probably the worst we have ever experienced. The only thing they care about is selling onboard duty free items. If you want to save money take Avianca into consideration their planes will still be pretty new in 2012 - if you want/need more quality and service you have to pay the higher fares of LAN!

### Avianca customer review
There is actually one flight with decent business seats from BOG to JFK that's AV 20/21 which uses an A330. Very comfortable angled lie flats with comfy blankets and pillows. The flight north is a late overnight so food is not a big issue. The flight south leaves early in the morning - make sure to eat something in the lounge because both breakfast and snack are up there with the worst food I have ever tasted on a plane.

### Avianca customer review
BUE-PTY. Arrived at Buenos Aires 5.30am for 7.30am flight and the line was unbelievable. Told by customer services that the flight was delayed so not to worry about a 1 hour wait. When I started to ask her about our connection being effected in Bogota she walked off saying she can't help. We went back 30 mins later and there was no one helping out and only 2/3 desks open operating very inefficiently. The flight did leave late and it took about an hour to dump our bags without any information but once onboard it was good new seats AVOD etc and the change over in Bogota was fine. FA's hopeless. I think it's worth paying extra for reliability.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-JFK in business class. Continue to use A320 on long haul routes which are flights of 6 hrs or more. Business class seats on A320 are only adequate for a 3 hour flight because there is almost no recline or pitch space. Food is the worst thing 8 out of 10 dishes come with corn bell peppers and inedible sauces. Planes are new and staff do their job with a smile. Usually there are many delays in Bogota airport due to delays from domestic destinations so I would not recommend for connections. None of the airlines that fly from Bogota to US offer decent business class seats.

### Avianca customer review
IAD-BOG-GRU. There was bad weather in WAS so we missed our flight from BOG-GRU. They are not required to give you anything except a flight to your destination in the case of an impossible connection. This being said is they paid for everything 3 meals and a four star hotel. Their planes are nice the service alright. They are a little slow in the way they get things done but other than their organization no bad comments tickets are cheap don't expect the best luxury in Economy but you get a good deal.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-CLO in coach. New A318 with an exit row seat with the seat removed in front of me. Seat felt narrow but excellent legroom. No snack service offered just a drink on the short flight. Check in and security was a breeze in Bogota. All in a pretty good experience.

### Avianca customer review
Madrid to Cali seats were comfortable staff pleasant and nice. A330 airbus is welcoming and the service onboard was good. I flew from UK with a connecting flight in Madrid then on to Cali. Aircraft was on time. Menu was nice especially on flights going to Colombia.

BOG-BCN-MAD-BOG with my two kids. A330-200 very modern great entertainment system. Seats in Economy are terrible for long-haul and the food was very poor. They were cheap tickets though.

### Avianca customer review
LIM-BOG-MIA round-trip. Service was poor crew members did not smile during the flight just when leaving the plane. Food was not up to standard. We passed security in Lima with no problems once we arrived in Bogota we passed another security point even when we are on international connecting flights and another one once you are called to the waiting room in addition they called my name to let me know I needed to open my luggage for a random inspection. When I went with my keys they could not find the luggage. On the plane I tried to watch a movie but even with full volume on my speakerphones I could still hear the plane engines. I saw a bottle of 7-up in beverage/food cart and asked for that FA said that they did not have any but just coke or apple juice without apologies.

### Avianca customer review
Excellent airline. I flew with them between Bogota-Caracas-Quito-Bogota. Efficient and helpful staff. We were on a rather tight connection in Bogota-Quito and the queue for the security x ray machine etc. was such that we would miss the flight. I approached a passing lady wearing an Avianca uniform and explained our predicament within seconds a military lady with rather large gun ran up to us screamed "Quito" and gestured us to follow her. We were whisked to the head of the security queue and escorted to the gate where the ground crew were anxiously scanning for us and on to the flight. Aircraft very clean and flight crew polite and efficient.

### Avianca customer review
ZRH-MAD-BOG-CLO on A330-200. Madrid to Bogota was very pleasant good ground staff accommodated my last minute seat change request. Friendly cabin crew plane in great condition with in-seat entertainment system. Compared to competitors (Air France Iberia) you get great value for money. Only negative the meal was rather disappointing quality and quantity wise.

### Avianca customer review
MIA-BOG-EZE on new A330 clean and in excellent condition. Check it at MIA quick and efficient and priority access through security. Lounge in MIA was America's club which was very basic but staff friendly. Very friendly Cabin Crew offering Champagne and menus prior to departure. Meal service was quick and efficient - basic for business class but good. Meal on BOG-EZE less substantial than the 3 hour from MIA which I didn't understand and I've received much better quality and quantity of meals when flying Singapore Airlines economy. The seat on the A330 is difficult to sleep I'm 6'1 and I kept sliding down which made it hard to get comfortable. I found Avianca great value for money - considering its a new product and the US airlines business class on the same legs are old and tired.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-SCL-BOG. Avianca's new business class is bad. I used to be a fan of Avianca. It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.

### Avianca customer review
JFK-MED-BOG-JFK Avianca business class is taking a rapid nose dive. It's not just that food is getting worse (the new menu to NYC is basically inedible) you can't get a glass of wine on domestic routes (free rum and whiskey only) the uncomfortable A320 turns up on more and more NYC routes and the lounges are stuffy and overcrowded. The most disappointing part of the service is that Avianca makes absolutely no effort to ease the way for premium passengers through the deplorable Colombian airports. There are no dedicated security lines no fast track through immigration (which can take up to two hours in BOG on bad days) and when you finally make it to the plane there is no priority boarding. Obviously equal misery for all is a well tested concept - it's called the discount airline. That seems to be where Avianca is headed - surely with its present state of service there is no way to mistake it for the serious world class airline it wants to be. The only reason I keep recommending Avianca is because Delta Continental and American are hardly attractive alternatives. But if LAN ever opened a route between NY and Colombia.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-JFK return business. Most of the time Avianca uses A319/320 in this route. These planes have a terrible business class seat with limited recline. They are good for a 2 hour flight but not for a long flight such as BOG-JFK (aprox 6 hours). If you are lucky to fly 767 or the new A330 in this route you will have a good service from Avianca but not in these smaller planes. AVOD has a decent choice and food service was OK (although I think that travellers would prefer a breakfast before arrival at 6am than a dinner at departure time on mid-night). It's sad to see Avianca placing a bet on this seat configuration for long routes such as Santiago or JFK since comfort level is substandard.

### Avianca customer review
Miami-Bogota-Guayaqui-Bogota-Fort Lauderdale. With the exception of BOG-GYE on a Fokker100 all segments on a new A320. Good legroom and large individual touch-screen entertainment- including a nice pillow blanket and quality head-seats. A small but tasty meal is served with colombian coffee and good-quality whisky. All free of charge! Female flight attendants are courteous and attentive but their male counterparts can be less so. One downside not Avianca's fault is the international wing at Bogota's Eldorado airport. Completely uninspiring not providing even an intercom system. Flights are called by the gate agents in loud voices as if we were in a bus station. However major construction is already underway and it should improve considerably the experience for the connecting passenger. All is all this is one of my favourite airlines when flying to South America. Not top-notch but above average at competitive prices.

### Avianca customer review
JFK-BOG-MDE. Overnight flight from JFK on A319. Ground staff efficient and did a good job of trying to control excessive luggage. Still overhead bin room ran out fast with arguments ensuing. Onboard service fairly dismal - a small cold wrap offered by a mostly unfriendly and uninterested crewe xcept one young FA. Cabin felt excessively hot and uncomfortable. Seats fitted with PTVs but uncomfortable. Only water round was before landing on a 5 hour flight - not even OJ offered. Connection in BOG at dawn was fairly easy. Domestic flight was on an A320 fine legroom for a short segment. A drink offered. Crew seemed much more professional and interested in doing their job than the ones on international flights.

### Avianca customer review
CLO-BOG-SMR return. All flights on time new A320 economy cabin seat equipped with a footrest and IFE offering good choice of short movies music and flight info. Juan Valdez coffee juices and small snacks are served. In addition web check-in is working and useful.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-MED-BOG in economy class. Flights late both ways with no explanation. No announcements in English only Spanish so you just have to follow the crowd. Inflight service is virtually non existant with the exception of lousy coffee. For a Country that exports some of the best coffee in the world Avianca serves the sludge. Shame as the flight attendants look good in their uniforms but that is where it ends.

### Avianca customer review
MAD-BOG in A330 with the family. Very attentive FAs serving in a very friendly way. Quiet and comfortable cabin lie flat seats with slight angle but comfortable for seating and sleeping. Good AVOD with nice selection. Food excellent although they should change the menu and wine card more often it has been the same for years now! Good amenity kit duvets good breakfast selection excellent. Nice little details like typical Colombian flowers accompanying the dinner and Colombian coffee as farewell present.

### Avianca customer review
LAX-BOG-MDE return in Economy. Seating very tight and food inferior on both the long legs. On the return MDE-BOG we were mingled in with passengers coming in from Madrid to Medellin and it was quite chaotic getting back into the domestic group in Bogota as I was staying a day there. I felt there had been a serious decline in passenger service in the last 12 months even allowing that when I did the same trip a year ago it was in Business. But the check-in staff at LAX were very friendly more-so than in Bogota. Too little English spoken inflight and I think the non-Spanish speaking passengers get a pretty raw deal.

### Avianca customer review
Had my flight scheduled for night of Nov 1st from Bogota to New York. They let all passengers check-in process through security and to the waiting room. Flight was scheduled for 11pm. At 1130pm when all passengers are seated waiting for boarding they announce Flight cancelled (Delayed according to them). We have to leave and come back at 5am. They keep the bags. They seem to have joined to flights since new faces showed up at the 0715 flight. We confirmed with them that since it is another plane are bags will make it to JFK on the same plane with us and 3 staff members say YES to this. We arrive at JFK and and on baggage claim there is one lady from Avianca. She announces that over 100 bags were left in Bogota and they do not know when they will come. The plane in which we came was smaller and could not handle all the luggage. Bottom line is we are getting a run around on the bags and nobody knows when and if I might get them. Never again with them.

### Avianca customer review
Bogota-Guayaquil in F100 flight 1 hour late due to thunderstorm at El Dorado airport flight very nice meal service with starter main dish dessert and welcome champagne on the ground. Seat 2x2 configuration wide enough and seat pitch decent. Crew very attentive on this flight offering a very personalized service. As it was an early afternoon flight even the AV lounge at El Dorado airport was enjoyable almost empty so lots of space and tranquility. Regrettably the same poor food and beverages in the lounge.

Madrid-Bogota-Madrid via Medellin - horrible flight delayed of around 4 hours waiting on the plane due to technical problems no information about the issue until people started to complain. The service was unfriendly staff did not speak good English food was bad the plane is uncomfortable for such a long trip. Baggage missing worst experience ever.

### Avianca customer review
Avianca was my choice on my last trip to Washington with an 1 hour connection in Bogota. Nice planes (A330/A320) good flight attendants IFE. On the way back to Lima a storm stopped all operations at IAD. The flight attendants were courteous and polite with passengers serving drinks all the time we stood stranded. On arrival at Bogota Avianca quickly rebooked all of us on other flight to Lima the following day. They sent us to the Crowne Plaza a four star hotel and covered all the expenses.

### Avianca customer review
BOG-GYE-BOG operated by Avianca’s SAM subsidiary although you would never know apart from reading that fact from the small notice printed on the side of the aircraft and the aircraft a Fokker 100 the entire fleet of which in Avianca colours are operated by SAM. However for all intents and purposes this is an Avianca service and after check-in I went to the Avianca Business Class Lounge at Bogota. This Lounge proudly advertises the fact that it has won awards for the best Business Class Lounge in Latin America – it’s difficult to understand why as it is large very impersonal and depressing and has the absolute minimum of food choice. It seems that when the Fokker 100s are used on international services they are parked off-gate on a remote stand which means the dreaded bus. Business Class comprises a cramped 2 rows of 2x2. The hot meal service started about 1 hr into this 1.5 hr flight. Even then service was slow and by the time this service reached Row 2 where I was sat we were well into the descent and the service was withdrawn. The return service was much better but the on-time arrival benefit was lost whilst we awaited a tug to push us back onto the remote stand and then another delay waiting for the bus. Meanwhile another two international flights had arrived and a huge line awaited us in the Immigration Hall.

### Avianca customer review
Recently in J class BCN to MED connecting through BOG. The transatlantic leg pleasant. The connection through BOG a total disaster. Tight to begin with and even tighter after a delayed departure. Nobody to meet transit passengers at the gate (J class plus highest elite status apparently not worth any extra attention). On own initiative despite an endless line I still made it through immigration with half an hour to spare plenty of time to make it to connecting plane. But no transfer desk looked aghast at my early appearance and stood firm that all domestic transfers had been closed. Overnight in Bogota but oops all of Bogota sold out except the downtown Tequendama which I don't wish on my worst enemy. That's where this airline despite major improvements over the last couple of years still allows bureaucracy to kill customer service initiative. Had there been an agent to take us through immigration and put us into a car to our connecting plane AV would have made friends for life. (And saved a bunch of money.) Which by the way wouldn't be a bad move after having drastically cut the benefits for their top frequent fliers.
