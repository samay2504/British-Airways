### “TAG rep refused to understand”
It is the worst airline I have ever traveled on. My final destination was Cancun and I was going to take a bus (ADO) in Belize City to Mexico, unfortunately, the ADO website doesn't allow buyers to book online when you depart from Belize city. Therefore, you have to take a taxi from the airport to the Novelo's bus terminal in Belize city to buy the ADO bus ticket in person, the TAG rep refused to understand this simple fact. She didn't realize that Belize is a very underdeveloped country and demanded a bus ticket (reservation) to allow me to check-in.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified | Avoid this airline at all costs. We booked a flight with them and a few days after booking the cancelled and rebooked our flight to 6 days earlier. That obviously didn't work for our itinerary and I asked for a refund. They claim the refund process takes 12-15 weeks! To be eligible for that refund they require that you fill out additional forms including sending them bank account information. I'm also incurring hundreds of dollars of extra costs having to rebook other flights around this one. I will never be booking with them again

### "overbooking the flight"
We showed up 2 and a half hours before our flight even tho they only require 2 hrs. At check in we were asked if we would be willing to take a flight 4 hrs later due to them overbooking the flight. No one said yes and they needed 14 volunteers to accept a dinner. Really a dinner the equivalent of what $10 at best. Last minute they requested a larger plane so that all passengers could catch their flight. So they chose to neglect the fact that they knew they needed a larger plane in hopes of people choosing not to go. Once we got past the ticket counter and got to security there was no movement due to the equipment not functioning aka the x ray machine and the 1 worker just standing there looking at there keys. Once we had been in line for another 20 minutes or so and the line grew 3 to 4 times the length then the worker asked another person for help I'm assuming the manager who was only 15 ft away. You would think that person would have done something but no not till the employee asked for help. At this point security went out the window to clear the line. Unzip the bag look inside and be like yeah your ok to go. Still waiting on our flight. Original flight was to be in the air by now and the replacement plane is not here and they still have to clean it. Who knows when we will leave. We were suppose to go to tikal today from Flores but I don't see that happening now and we all know they will not cover the cancelation for the hotel there and the price of where we can find to stay tonight. You would think a small airline with tourists destinations within there own country would have it locked but according to the regular flyers here a 3 to 4 hr delay is extremely normal for this airline.

### "10 hours delay"
Not Verified | 10 hours delay. Poor communication. Wasted a full day of my holiday. When asked for the reason, none was given. An email notification indicating the delay would have been nice so I could have planned the day differently.

### "a deficient experience"
Not Verified |   This is the first time I have ever had such a deficient experience with an airline. I booked a flight for my mom, which did not take-off on time due to inclement weather. Perfectly understandable. However, the airline was shifty enough to reschedule her returning flight, because, as customer support detailed, the flight was no longer available. This meant that my mom lost an entire day from her trip to Guatemala all due to a terrible logistics system of TAG Airlines. Esta es la primera vez que he tenido una experiencia tan deficiente con una aerolínea. Reservé un vuelo para mi madre, que no despegó a tiempo debido a las inclemencias del tiempo. Perfectamente comprensible. Sin embargo, la aerolínea fue lo suficientemente astuta como para reprogramar su vuelo de regreso, porque, según detalló el servicio al cliente, el vuelo ya no estaba disponible. Esto significó que mi madre perdió un día entero de su viaje a Guatemala, todo debido a un terrible sistema de logística de TAG Airlines.

### "run by a group of clueless amateurs"
40+ years of flying, 500+ flights with 80+ airlines in 75 countries, but this was the worst airline I've ever flown with. We booked a nonstop flight from Flores to Cancun in September for a Saturday morning in November. About a week before the departure, they cancelled the direct flight and rerouted us through Guatemala City with a 6 hour layover. When checking in at Flores airport that morning, our bags were checked through to Cancun, but at the airport in Guatemala City the onward flight to Cancun was nowhere to be seen on the departure board. I contacted a TAG agent standing in front of a TAG departute gate for a flight to Belize City that was heavily delayed. This very young man told me the flight to Cancun was cancelled and I could fly the next day at 6pm. I overheard his conversation in Spanish with his colleague who informed him that only 5 people had been booked on that particular flight so they cancelled it. The agent led us to the baggage carrousel where we could retrieve our bags and accompanied us to the check in counter so that we could speak to his supervisor. This young lady was not particularly interested in our situation and repeatedly stated that they could give us a hotel room and we could fly to Cancun the next evening, which would have meant two days wasted at the airport while our hotel in Mexico had already been paid for. Luckily I saw that there was a flight to Merida that had been scheduled for 11am to leave at 7pm. We told them to book us on that flight which they happily did in order to ged rid of us. Since I was eager to get out of that hellhole of an airport as well we flew to Merida and arrived there at around 9pm. That gave us sufficient time to catch a night bus to Cancun. We arrived at our hotel at 7am after spending an awful lot of money for a convenient flight that never happened plus the fare for the bus. Needless to say they never reimbursed us for the night missed night in our hotel. Do yourself a favour and do not book this airline which seems to be run by a group of clueless amateurs.

### “Awful airline”
Not Verified | Awful airline. Tried to charge us over $200 USD for extra weight, and we negotiated down to $175 - still unreal expensive. We will NEVER fly this airline again, and we will advise our friends and family also against flying TAG.

### "price was ridiculously high"
There were no other options for me to fly from Guatemala City to Belize City, so I had to book with TAG. Flight times changed multiple times. Luckily I was notified by Trip.com so I didn't miss my flight. Flight from Guatemala to Belize, plane was only 1/3 full. Chose seat 10A when I checked in online, was given seat 14A when they printed my boarding pass. Had to walk on the tarmac to enter the plane. Small plane, narrow seats, but the arm rests did have a hidden button to lift them up and out of the way. Flight attendant was friendly and professional. Got a kids juice box as my beverage! But the flight was less than an hour, so I guess that's fair. Flight from Belize to Guatemala, minor flight time change. The desk was Tropic Air with a small sign for TAG that is barely noticeable. The Belizean desk attendant was very helpful to me with the Guatemalan forms that had to be filled out on my phone by scanning a QR code. Plane boarded late. No signage at airport to indicate it was TAG. Had to walk all the way across the entire airport outside in the sun to get to our plane, which was parked way out on the tarmac. I was given the exit row seat and I asked to be moved, which they did once all passengers had taken their seats. Flight attendant was on her phone during takeoff and landing. Got a full bottle of water for my beverage. My arm rest was broken and a sharp piece of metal was poking my leg. The price of my ticket was ridiculously high for a one-hour flight. I think TAG has the monopoly on this route (GUA - BZE) so they can charge what they want.

### "attitude was rude and unprofessional"
I've flown with airlines globally, but my experience with TAG Airlines in Guatemala was extremely disappointing. The staff attitude was rude and unprofessional. It felt like a scam, especially with their baggage policy - charging $3 per extra pound is exorbitant, considering their bags already weigh close to 20 pounds empty. This can add up to more than the cost of the flight itself, which is outrageous for travelers. I strongly advise against flying with TAG Airline. There are far better options available with more reasonable policies and better customer service. Do yourself a favor and choose a different airline. The negative reviews for TAG Airline are justified, and I hope my experience can help others make a more informed choice.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. They changed our departure time three times, all three changes were in a period of one day. We arrived at the airport and after having spent five hours waiting, they told us that the flight was canceled at 12 at night and they scheduled the flight for us until 1 in the afternoon of the next day (which ended up leaving at 2:15), They transferred us to a hotel near the airport (low quality and even unsafe). Due to the cancellation of the flight, I missed the other flight I had with them the next day and they did not take care of anything, they do not refund you and if you did not pay the plus fare, they do not give you the option to reschedule the flight for another day. Do not schedule flights with them, there are other alternatives to make the trip Guatemala - El Salvador, which are better.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown and will never fly again with TAG Airlines. No office at airport and no attendants to help. Delayed at least 2hrs and had to stand at counter to wait for their attendants to show up.

### "Horrible corrupted company"
Do not book with this company. If you have to fly, check other airlines and otherwise go by bus. They ruined our holiday with cancelling the flight each time. First on Saturday, rescheduled to Sunday, cancelled again (all a few hours before) and they offer a flight a few days later. Unacceptable and that one won’t 100% sure not fly as well. They don’t give a reason why, only a phone number that you should call. When you do, they disconnect the line the whole time or do not even pick up. Horrible corrupted company.

### "couldn’t print our boarding tickets"
Our flight was scheduled to leave at 9:10AM. We arrived at 8:10AM and the attendant told us they had already closed the computer terminal and couldn’t print our boarding tickets (3 people). I asked them to put us in the next flight. They told me they couldn’t do it because I bought the tickets via Booking.com. That I had to buy new tickets. Which I ended up doing because We had reservations at Flores, for Tikal and hotel reservations. They even made pay a higher price than with Booking.com. It was an ordeal because , the new tickets, I had to buy them through a phone call because they many staff working told me they couldn’t help me. What Tag airline did was a robbery.

### "Decent flight of 1:15 hour"
Cancun to Guatemala. Decent flight of 1:15 hour. Nothing special, all went well except for a delay of 4 hours. Flight attendant was friendly.

### "Flight personnel very unprofessional"
Flight to Cancun was excellent. I love the jet prop Saab 340. Flight personnel very unprofessional. Never any information from the pilot. Elevation, weather etc. No service. Just water. The return flight was terrible. We departed 21 Oct at 23.00 instead of 14.10. Little information from TAG. Only gave us water. We didn't arrive in Guatemala City, instead they landed in Flores at 01.00, 22 Oct, and put us up in a hotel. We departed 22 Oct at 08.00, arriving in Guatemala City at 09.00. The entire experience was 19 hours, instead of 2 hrs 10 min. On landing in Guate City we were promised a free return flight to Cancun. But they didn't explain how to receive it. I'm sure they don't want us to go through the red tape to claim it. I chose TAG instead of conventional Volaris A320 jet because I wanted a bit of adventure? The departure from Cancun was set as 14.10. I arrived at the gate coming from Valladolid 40 min. before boarding. Perfect timing? TAG first posted a 30 delay departure, and then endlessly extended it on the board, without speaking to the waiting passengers. Finally TAG said, the plane had been hit by lightening and they are sending a replacement plane and departure was set for 20.00. I don't believe it was lightening, I suspect it was equipment failure. We should come to the gate at 19.30. I sat and waited at the gate for an hour becoming thoroughly chilled by the AC and then decided to take the 30 min. ADO bus back to the terminal downtown and look for a pleasant restaurant. Good choice. When I returned to the gate the German group of four were surprised to learn that a passenger can leave the terminal and return. They were jealous. Departure was repeatedly pushed forward and we confronted the timid man at the gate and he told us, 'Oh, the replacement plane is on the way. Be here soon'. Airlines always lie to passengers. We were then told we would depart at 22.00, landing at Guate 23.00 local time. (2 hr flight, and one hr time change.) That didn't happen either. Then they began moving departure forward 10 minutes each 10 minutes. The plane arrived and we departed at 23.00, set to arrive 24.00 Guate time. I put in earplugs to shield the rattle of the Saab 340 and slept soundly awakening to the plane touching down. This doesn't look like Guate airport. The pilot landed at the wrong airport? No. Bad fog at Guate and inadequate radar, so we landed at Flores Guatemala at 01.00 and it then took them 1.5 hrs to get us to a hotel. I slept from 02.30 to 06.00, feeling quite good. Many passengers were angry. We had only been given water once all these hours, and no food, and little information. Two brave Guatemala men stood and berated the TAG staff. I jumped in and said, "What do we want? A hotel room immediately, and a full refund of our tickets. Silence. We departed Flores at 08.00 for Guate and the flight was fine. Weather good. I've written TAG asking how I can receive my free rt ticket to Cancun. No reply.

### "Very friendly staff and crew"
A Saab340 plane in good condition, both flights were on time. Quick check-in at airport. There was no service on the 1 hour flight. No e-check in. Very friendly staff and crew

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  They have the worst customer service. It’s a shame they’re the only airline operating between Peten and Guatemala City. A disgrace for the country. I’ve flown with them many times and always wish I had another options, the past few months have purchased over 20 tickets from them and have shown up for the flight from the jungle to the city (tiny airport, takes 3 minutes to get through) anywhere from 1 hr to 20 minutes before the flight leaves and have always been let through. Today I showed up 40 minutes before the flight left and they said I could not board because they close the flight 45 min before take off. Which is something new. I apologized and said now I know for next time and if they could please make an expecting, it was 5 minutes. They asked if I had prechecked online but i was never emailed an option to precheck. I was traveling due to a medical emergency and there was zero comprehension or understanding, They hadn’t even begun boarding. And I was less than 50 steps from the boarding gate. That’s how tiny the airport is. I asked if I could please speak to a supervisor and they had me call the call center. A call center! I asked to speak to customer service. Customer service is a joke and offensive. All they were interested in was the money to rebook me on the later flight. They charged the full price of the ticket to rebook. Felt like extortion. And zero comprehension for an actually emergency. It just makes me sad that ppl have to deal with this airline in what is otherwise and beautiful and charming country.

### "Horrific customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Horrific customer service. I showed up long before my flight and was not aloud to enter because I was told I was too late. I sat there for thirty minutes arguing while I could see the plane, and their was no line to enter. The employees were no help and rather rude. I can not stress how terrible this company is. Do not use this company if avoidable. After everything that has happened with them I just hope I can save at least one person from having to support such a horrendous company. They make Spirit and Frontier look like first class service.

### "this is a big disgrace"
Not Verified |  Originally, we had a plan to visit Tikal so we booked our roundtrip flight with TAG airlines from Guatemala City to Flores. Unfortunately, as a result of covid-19, Guatemala president decided to close the borders and we couldn’t make it. The only compensation TAG offered us is airline credit and they refused to give us refund although we tried to explain that an airline credit is worthless for us because we are Israeli citizens and this airline doesn’t operate in our area. I think that this is a big disgrace.

### "terrible customer service"
Guatemala to Flores. Do yourself a favor and fly Avianca. The last time I flew Tag I told myself I would never do it again because of the terrible customer service and sup par safety. I should have stuck to my gut and not chosen TAG for this last minute trip but I did, and nothing has changed. Same terrible customer service, and they won't give you a factura for flight payment which is illegal. And even though my reservation said my first bag and 1 carry on was free, they charged me at the check-in, and said to take it up with the company I did my reservation with. They also charged more than the listed baggage fee online for the weight I was carrying.

### "chose Avianca instead"
Guatemala City to Flores, I specifically chose to book on TAG airlines to support a local company versus a larger corporate entity. After purchasing these tickets, the only confirmation that I received by e-mail from TAG was a “Factura” or receipt for the amount paid. There was no information directing us to check in or policies of the airline. The morning of our flight we were dropped off by our hotel shuttle at the municipal airport in Guatemala City for our flight to Flores. We went inside the TAG office there and the workers looked at the Factura and indicated that unfortunately we were at the wrong location. We were very confused because we were in the TAG location. The worker indicated that we needed to be at the International airport (for our domestic flight). We asked what we should do and they were unable to provide any direction in English. Upon arriving at the international airport, we proceeded to the TAG service desk but there were no employees anywhere to be found. We frantically looked for someone to help us but there was no one despite the fact that TAG employees from the municipal airport said they would notify the international airport that we were en route. We proceeded to the security checkpoint but were not allowed to proceed because we did not have a boarding pass. Eventually we were able to persuade the security officer to go to the gate in order to find a TAG employee. Two employees returned to the security checkpoint after we were waiting for twenty minutes. One staff indicated that “boarding was closed” despite the fact that it was still prior to the scheduled departure time. She continued that it would be impossible to board at this time and we must return to the service desk with them to further discuss the matter. We returned to the service desk, explained the reason for our delay and that we had been misdirected to the municipal airport for our domestic flight and that no one was at their service desk when we arrived nor were we able to find any TAG employees to assist us. They explained that 30 minutes before departure employees from the service desk must go to the gate to conduct the boarding process. We were surprised by this because normally airlines have someone at the service desk to help with arrivals and customer needs (especially when the have been notified of a delayed passenger which is listed on their flight manifest). We were obviously disappointed at this stage because we had already been frantically trying to catch this flight which we had now obviously missed. We were expecting that they would schedule us on afternoon flight and that we would have to hang around the airport for hours waiting for this next flight. Instead, she informed us that in order to go on the later flight that there would be an additional charge in order to re-book the flight. We were incredulous at the notion that we would be asked to pay additional money on top of the chaos and inconvenience which we had experienced while trying to catch the morning flight. Needless to say we did not fly on TAG. We chose Avianca instead and received the same flight, same cost, much better service, and experience. Don't use TAG when there is a better alternative available.

### "excellent flight with TAG"
Excellent flight from Guatemala City to Flores and back with TAG Airlines. First flight was a Embraer, second was a Saab 340. Very nice, smooth flight. On the first flight a small snack box was given, on the flight back a soda, chips and cookies were given.

### "overall a nice little airline"
Day trip from Guatemala City to see the Mayan temples at Tikal. Closest airport is Flores (which actually is not where the airport is located - it is in Santa Elena a couple miles from Flores) and then an hour drive to Tikal. Check in at the small domestic terminal at GUA at 5:15am for a 6:30am departure. TAG flies from GUA to a few cities in Guatemala, then to Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Belize, and all flights are on smaller prop planes from this little terminal. Check in quick and agents very friendly. You get a plastic boarding pass that is colored based on your destination (like the old Southwest Airlines used to do in the 70s and 80s) and then they call "blue" or "orange" and you board when your color is called. Flight was on a Saab 340A in decent condition and totally full. Nice flight attendant and friendly greetings from the cockpit. Delayed take off with inbound traffic, and a bumpy cloudly 10-15 minutes after take-off but then smoothed out. A drink and snack were served on the 45-minute flight. Quick landing over beautiful Flores (which itself is just a tiny island in lake Peten Itza) and taxi to the terminal. Only carry-on so thru to the exit and off to Tikal. The return was the same (6:30pm departure) except to pay the departure fee of QZ20 (about 3 US dollars) and then go through "international screening security" to the gate. It was a domestic flight so was kinda funny to be told "go thru international screening". Snack bar and air conditioning so that was good. Full flight back with the same crew as we had flying in that morning - again friendly smiles. Take off and landing on time. Overall a nice little airline but expensive ($250 roundtrip for a 45 minute flight) but beats a 9-hour one way bus ride.
