### "give my luggage bag for check-in"
It was really a worst and inappropriate service given by check-in staff. They tried to force us to give my luggage bag for check-in and pay the outstanding amount. Initially when i came from manila with airasia they allowed same bag with in cabin and even i told that your airline member allowed earlier and I traveled with this bag for 6 years around world. But she told that I don’t for AirAsia Philippines. They forced and took 1400 pesos and told to make 15 kg weight if i want to transfer from other. We requested but they were acting like they own airasia just by sitting at checkin counter.

### "do not recommend AirAsia"
Not Verified |  I work internationally and fly very often. I do not recommend AirAsia. Here are the issues I experienced on my recent flight. The crew  worked very hard to try to insist that my 8 kg carryon would have to be checked at an exorbitant fee. The flight remained on the tarmac for more than three hours before takeoff. No food or compensation was provided. When boarding, there was a period of 45 minutes with an advertising jingle for the airline. It is loud, repetitive, and abrasive. Crew were unwilling or unable to help me. There is no means if contacting anyone if you experience issues. Customer support is a bot with limited ability to help. You will most likely not save any money taking this airline, even if it seems like you will from the ticket price. You will pay in nickle-and-dime tactics and with an atrocious customer experience.

### “the worst customer service”
It was bad from the start to finish. They gave my spouse and child second-class treatment for some reason and put us behind other customers at the check-in desk. They then gave us extra payment for every fraction of a kilo after the decimal. I went to the customer service and complaint desk at the airport authority and they changed their tune. I also afterwards complained to the hotline on the website and they closed my complaint promptly without a response for some reason. The conclusion I have is Air Asia Philippines is worst. The air conditioning on the flight kept turning on and off, so we were going between sweating bullets in the back of the plane and freezing ourselves the entire flight. Also, for some reason, the plane was going straight through the turbulence without adjusting the course or altitude for 3 1/2 hours. We also had to takeoff tarmac one hour and 45 minutes us 2 1/2 hours late overall for our arrival in Don Mueng Airport at Bangkok. Thanks for the worst customer service and follow up. They also refuse to accept my Malaysian ringet for my meal.

### "most unreliable airline"
Not Verified |  It is my first time flying with them because I saw good reviews so I want to give it a chance. Yet, I made a mistake. The flight is supposed to be 8:50pm that was rescheduled to 1:15 am the following day and when we arrived at the airport that was changed again to 2am. The most unreliable airline.

### "lack of a way to contact customer service"
Not Verified |   This review is for their AirAsia ASEAN Explorer Pass and for total lack of a way to contact customer service. They do not give you any way to contact them, except perhaps to drive to the airport and hope to speak to someone. I suspect that is not going to be successful. Not, for the ASEAN Explorer Pass. I purchased it for me and for my wife. What they don't tell you: It's nearly impossible to book on weekends. You cannot check availability unless you have purchased the pass already. So you buy the pass and hope it is worth it. If you can travel weekends, perhaps it is. Otherwise, don't buy it. Availability during the week: They post a seemingly convenient way to check for seat availability. But when you try to book on an indicated available date, you'll get a message saying those dates are not available for purchase with the ASEAN Pass. It is an extremely frustrating experience. Needless to say, I can't contact anyone, except for the idiotic and useless bot, "Bo" which is a complete insult to their customers.

### "Entire flight was smooth"
Entire flight was smooth, however boarding time was a little confusing and the assigned gate, they suddenly changed it so it caused more confusion. I ordered pre-book meal, it tasted good but the food itself was somehow cold. For me, airline’s baggage policy was highly favorable as I was able to check in 30 kilos regardless of number of luggage.

### "customer service was pretty bad"
My wife and I booked the Premium Flex ticket for our flight from Caticlan (MPH) to Manila (MNL). This should have given us the option to change our flights quite flexible. This is done in the online account. To login you need to verify your email address and phone number with an OTP. This OTP is not being send to my phone number from the UAE. You have 3 chances and then you have to wait 24 hours for the next try. Which again didn't work, as nowhere is written that the OTP is not being send to most countries. The entire online customer service is done by a badly programmed chatbot. There is no option to talk or chat with a real person. Theoretically you can change the flight with the chatbot. For this you have to enter all kind of data. And at the end it doesn't recognize the correctly entered email address, which is associated with the booking. So the option of using the flex-ticket is not possible from our country. The flight had more than 1 1/2 hours delay. On a day of good weather. Eventually we had 20 seconds of spare time until missing our check-in closure for our next flight. Fortunately we were lucky, after running and telling the taxi driver in Manila to drive as fast as possible. We told the ground staff in Caticlan about our situation. A quick airport transfer would have helped us a lot instead of waiting for our suitcases and then needing 15 min to drive from Terminal 2 to 3 in Manila. Again, the customer service was pretty bad. Dealing with all this at an airport where the wifi is not working is the worst possible situation. Especially you don't want to have this stress on the last day of a beautiful vacation. The only good thing is the friendly and pretty cabin crew. After my flight I get daily mails from AirAsia. Clicking on the unsubscribe button doesn't work. We will not fly with AirAsia anymore.

### "been delayed repeatedly"
Twice in a single week we have been delayed. First time  was a couple hours- but when the plane arrived in Manila they immediately off loaded passenger and load us. With about 15 minutes notice. Second flight has been delayed repeatedly and is now over 3 hours late. Terminal has no real concessions available and the room temp is maintained in the 60’s. Total disregard for passengers comfort.

### "never fly with this airline again"
My flight was postponed from 12.35 pm to 3.05 pm and I booked the flight the day before to January 3, 2024, 12.35 pm. This flight was postponed 3.05 pm. I will never fly with this low-cost airline again.

### "too late to reschedule my flight"
Not Verified |  After multiple voicemails (with no response) and multiple attempts at using AirAsia's online agent, I'm now too late to reschedule my flight to an earlier time. I had to call into a voicemail first in order to talk to an actual human. Including the multiple reschedules on the way into Iloilo that AirAsia has added to our vacation, their terrible customer service makes them one of the worst airlines. In my opinion, no one should have to suffer the same way I have in dealing with this service, especially when there is so much competition.

### "Absolutely unreliable airline"
We booked 4 flights with this airline. Either on the day, shortly before the flight or a day before the flight date, they changed the flight time. And i don't mean to a reasonable time. For example, one flight was changed from 3pm to 2:20am the following morning. Absolutely unreliable airline - do not book with them if you have connecting flights, if you have booked trips or activities, if you intend to be somewhere at a certain time or time period. Some delays are acceptable but changing 75% of flight times is incredibly disruptive, poor planning and embarrassingly poor customer customer services. Incredible that they can offer you a flight date, time and price and then change it a day before you fly.

### "Hours of flight delay"
Hours of flight delay, flight cancellation, wasting your time booking with this airline. I travelled the world and utilized many airlines. This by far IS the worst airline. They need to reconsider the way they organized their operations. Wasted my time with this airline, my first and will be my last with AirAsia Philippines.

### "encounter delay after delay"
Tried to come early too to airport as advised to be at the airport at least 3-4 hours for check in formalities. Then AirAsia Philippines keep delaying the flight. For the last 30 yrs of traveling its my first time to encounter delay after delay.

### "Was asked to check in my luggage"
Terrible airline. Was asked to check in my luggage for a being a few pounds overweight. I complied, but was shocked to see that the airplane was full of much heavier and bulkier hand-carries. When I asked the flight staff, they were abrasive and dismissive. The ground staff seem to enjoy forcing some passengers to throw items away.

### "what’s going on with my supposed refund"
Not Verified |  The day before of my flight they emailed me to reschedule my flight from morning to midnight, so I chose to get a refund instead. Its over a year now (August 22,2022) was the date when it was being processed. I tried to log in ln my account to follow up and the “my cases” tab has now become empty. Don’t know what’s going on with my supposed refund.

### "very hard to follow-up on them"
Very disappointing service and the flight cancellation is too close. The refund to my credit card was applied since September 2022 and up until now it is not yet returned to my account. It is very hard to follow-up on them.

### "experience was just so absurd"
My wife and I have done around the Oceania trip from June to July this year going from Korea to Australia, from Australia to Bali, from Bali to Philippines and back to Korea. Given the multiple trips we had to make, we booked each leg separately as we planned our trip to the next destination. While almost all the other leg's trip went relatively smoothly (except Cebu Pacific losing our golf clubs for 6 days), we faced rather a “lost-for-words” issue with the last leg of our trip - from Philippines to Korea. We made sure we are traveling with the allowance of checking in 2 x 20Kg luggage and 2 x 20Kg Sporting Equipment, but for some reason, it was shown on their system as we have only booked for 2 x 20Kg Sporting Equipment and no additional check-in allowance. Who in the right mind would only purchase the check-in allowance for Sporting Equipment when traveling around the globe for 45 days? If this was the other way around where I have only purchased the check-in allowance for the regular 20Kg luggage and not the sporting equipment, this could make little more sense, but this was not the case. Even in their website it is clearly stated that the "Value Pack" from the ticketing option specifically allow 20Kg check-in luggage for each of their passenger. I have gone extra miles to specifically remove my “obvious right" to check-in 20Kg luggage (with the Value Pack option), but instead I chose to pay extra 2400 Pesos to “only" check-in my sporting equipment. Although myself and all the employees at the airport could clear see that we have specifically selected the option to check in our normal luggage along with our sporting equipment, only because it is not stated the same way in their system, we were forced to pay 6.5 times more for our additional luggage we had, so we do not miss the flight. This experience was just so absurd and dumb, I am lost for words.

### "would not check me in"
I had a connecting flight from Okinawa to Osaka that was delayed by two hours. That airline made every accommodation to help me to make the AirAsia flight to Manila. Despite sprinting through the airport and arriving at check in 50 minutes before the flight was supposed to depart AirAsia would not check me in. I didn’t even have check baggage.

### "still waiting for our refund"
Our flight was cancelled 2 weeks before departure. We followed the instructions in the email for refund since Oct 2022, we are still waiting for our refund. We are a group of 7 pax, nobody receive the refund yet. Apparently, this is a common practise from Air Asia. I feel I'm being scammed. Never encounter such lousy customer service for a refund.

### "it was disappointing"
Flew this airline for the first time from Manila to Tokyo Narita (roundtrip ticket). I get that it’s a budget airline, but it was disappointing. In my opinion, when you add the budget fare with add-ons such as bags (bags are only 1 piece, 20kg), you’re paying even more than you would a 5-star airline where there is at least 1 free checked bag, 23kg. The ground staff were friendly enough. The boarding passes were printed on receipt-like paper, a cost cutting measure I don’t really mind. While waiting at the gate, there was no announcement that the gate had changed. There was just a sign  facing away from us indicating where the new gate was. Good thing my group saw a friend on the same flight, who had checked in much later, and we found out that they had a different gate printed. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable. The cabin crew were fine.

### "Horrible experience all around"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience all around. Purchased 2 tickets at the same time for my girlfriend and I, the airline sat us in different seats without resolving the issue. Technical difficulties at the counter which caused long check in times. I do not recommend flying this airline if you're not from the region. I don't recommend flying this airline even if you are from the region.

### "food on board are salty"
The food on board are salty and expensive. Our flight going to Phuket was delayed but the boarding crews didn’t inform the passengers. Coming back to Philippines, check in crew was grumpy and the boarding crew was not friendly

### "had to fall in line again to check in"
Checked in online, we already have e-boarding pass but we had to fall in line again to check in again and again. We thought that online check will be easier and hassle free. Not in this airline.

### "Takes ages for a bag drop off in Manila"
Takes ages for a bag drop off in Manila after online check-in. Attendants, although pleasant, ask too many questions. Aircraft was so hot, we stayed on tarmac for half an hour, 30C in the cabin, no drink offered. I appreciate wider seat as a plus size person!

### "over an hour delayed with no explanation"
Awful airline, avoid at all costs. Firstly it was over an hour delayed with no explanation. The organisation by the staff was a total mess. Then herded into buses to get to the plane and left waiting on the bus for nearly half an hour while those in the previous flight got off (why couldn't this be done before?). Then totally inflexible and clueless cabin crew and took forever to get bags the other end (again zero communication or explanation for this, no respect for customers).

### "can't recommend at all"
On Sunday 13/11/22 I was going back from Iloilo to Manila and had a connection with Emirates. Between 2 and 3 am I got an email that my flight is delayed by like 4 hours. Of course I was only aware of this around 8 am when I woke up. So needed to rebook the Emirates flights which I barely managed to do because of time concerns and cost me an extra 260 pounds. Also what if I can't rebook it how do I get home? When I asked for some kind of compensation they answered since I didn't have an insurance I am not eligible for one. All I got was a little rice with McDonalds chicken and some water. If this was not enough after we boarded they made us wait another hour inside the plane so the originally 13:15 flight took off around 17:50. The first 25 mins they announced, but the rest was not communicated at all. This was my first and last travel with the company. I am disappointed and can't recommend at all

### "human element to this flight was excellent"
Late late late. A short trip from Boracay (Caticlan) back to Manila. We were originally booked on flight Z2 224 buy when we checked in at Caticlan (MPT) they moved us to the earlier Z2 226 because 224 was delayed. 226 ended up delayed anyway, so we were still late. Whilst I cannot recommend them based on punctuality, the cabin crew were lovely (and apologetic), the seats were fine (we had 8D and 8E, so quite near the front) but looking at Flight Radar 24, the plane is 15 years old and this was very noticeable. I had a snack on board and a coffee, and these were distinctly average. The human element to this flight was excellent (ie the cabin crew) but everything else was average at best, and bad at worst.

### "I cannot fault this flight"
I cannot fault this flight - a short hop from Manila to Boracay. It's only a 45 minute flight, we left on time and arrived early. Like many budget airlines, Air Asia doesn't offer major luxury or anything, but for the price paid, for the punctuality, the polite cabin crew, I was very happy. I travelled with my partner in seats 6A and 6B, and being at the front we were very comfortable and able to disembark quickly.

### "I still don’t have refund"
Booked flight to connect with my international flight arriving in Manila. Airasia brought forward the flight to a time which I couldn’t make due to my flight arriving later than the rescheduled time. Tried many times to get refund but just get invalid claim due to flight not being cancelled by AirAsia. There is no way to get in touch with them to get refund. I still don’t have refund.

### "again there will be delay of flight"
I booked a connecting flight from Manila to Tacloban few weeks ago then Airasia cancelled and rebook my flight 1hr after my arrival from international flight. Then when I tried to re book the customer service is doesnt want to entertain my issue. I had no choice but to rebook it the next flight. I have waited 9 hrs at Manila then 2 hrs before the scheduled departure they announce again there will be delay of flight.

### "so many schedule changes"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. I’ve never known an airline that makes so many schedule changes a few hours before boarding time. We’re already on our way to airport then suddenly I receive an email from them that our flight schedule have change from 6pm boarding to 10pm. I cannot recall how may times they’ve change our schedule but i got home at 1am. I will never fly again with Airasia!

### "so many schedule changes"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. I’ve never known an airline that makes so many schedule changes a few hours before boarding time. A few days ago they’ve changed the flight time to 6 hrs later, and on the day of the flight, they’ve changed it to at least 4-5 times. When I got to the check in counters, it’s the longest of lines I’ve ever seen in different queues with literally no one specifying which category is which.

### "thus far refused to refund"
AirAsia Philippines has thus far refused to refund the sum of a cancelled flight back to my bank account, even though it promised to do so. Out of all airlines I have used, this one seems to be the worst. There are no words for the lack of service I have received after putting so much trust in them.

### "need to try and up their game"
Hopeless airline for advance planning and reserving hotels etc. Twice now I have booked AirAsia from Clark to Catilclan and both times they have changed the flight dates with only one month before flying. For Boracay it is a requirement to have pre-booked hotel accommodation so this now has to be changed - assuming we can. Last time we had to book an extra night in Caticlan as the flight date and flight time were changed. Why are they so useless at planning their schedules. Trying to book and then change hotel dates is a nightmare with Air Asia flights. They need to sort out their schedules in advance and stop being unprofessional. I know they are a budget airline but they need to try and up their game and stop behaving like one.

### "still waiting for a refund"
The worst experience with dealing with an airline, that I have ever had in my life. My two friends and I booked 3 flights with AirAsia as it came up as the cheapest option on our routes. What are the odds of one airlines messing up all three flights? Well, somehow AirAsia managed to do exactly that! Two flights they cancelled before our travels commenced. This meant we had to rebook our flights with a different airline at a much higher late as it was closer to the travel date. More than 2.5 months after AirAsia cancelled their flights, we are still waiting for a refund. They are taking this long to refund us for flights that they cancelled. I have followed up multiple times with no success. The third flight was moved earlier about 4 hours, which was frustrating as we had to get up at 4:30am to be able to get to the airport on time. It was annoying but we did it because we were just grateful that they didn’t cancel this one. At the airport it was absolute chaos, they had one single queue for all of their flights, so we stood in line for about 2 hours for check-in. It was getting close to the time that our flight check-in time was going to close, so we proactively approached the ‘last call’ desk to let them know the situation and request that we be able to check-in. The Air Asia staff at the counter told us we couldn’t yet as our flight hadn’t been announced for last call and to return in 20 minutes. So, we waited for 20 minutes as she had told us to and returned to the last call desk to check-in after that. Now their staff told us that we were too late to check-in and we couldn’t board the plane? After telling us 20 minutes ago that it was too early for last call check-in and to wait for 20 minutes, they changed their story and said we had missed last call check-in and were unable to board. The first staff member had given us incorrect information, her superiors apologised for her miscommunication but still would not let us board our flight. AirAsia took zero responsibility for the mess that they caused. We had to book our flight with another airlines for 3x the price of our original flight plus bear the cost of the missed Air Asia flight. We also had to wait at the airport for 4 hours and miss the activities we had planned for that day.

### "seats should be purchase online"
This is the airline I experienced that the system will choose the seat number. We are 3 on board, checked in 5 hours before the flight, checked in together and how come that we are seated far from each other. As per the staff, seats should be purchase online. Really? Way to make money! Our flight was rescheduled and there is no even sign of gratification even having just the great service to compensate the delay.

### "decided to cancel my flight"
Second time i have flown with AirAsia Philippines, reason being the flight time was ideal for my connection coming in from London, it gave me 2 hours to transfer from Term 1 in Manila to Term 4. Well that's what i thought until Air Asia decided to cancel my flight and transfer me to a flight some 7 hours later with no explanation. Upon checking in no apology was given, however my blood shot did cause a stir, i explained it was a burst blood vessel which was confirmed by my doctor in the UK, the member of staff on check in, told me to wait as she needed to consult her supervisor. I was told by the supervisor i needed to see a doctor who was based at the airport, i tried to explain but he wasn't having any of it, it was either i saw the doctor or i wasn't be allowed to fly. Eventually i was seen, firstly by a nurse, who took my blood pressure & asked me a number of questions about my eye, i did inform her that i was not feeling any discomfort, no itching, no blurred visor, in-fact nothing at all. Even telling them i had flown some 7000 miles for 15 hours from London with no problem. The doctor as soon as she arrived said it was ok for me to fly if i sign an indemnity, after all that i asked why they were so interested in my eye, yet no tests / questions were ask regarding Covid, no answer. Once on board all was ok, I am not a mask wearer as this is not required at home, i know "when in roam" but within the airport & on the plane I was never asked to wear one.

### "not allowed to get my money back"
One of the worst airlines have to deal with. Air Asia cancelled the round trip flight from Cebu, Philippines to Davao, Philippines for June 25, 2022. Requested via email to refund my money but refused. Was credited the amount for further flights but explained to them that I no longer am able to fly with the airlines because I am just gonna be there on vacation. Why am I not allowed to get my money back when the Air Asia was the one who cancelled the trip not me. Just like a lot of reviews online with Air Asia, it is very very very hard to request anything from them. They will make you go through a lot of verification and protocols over and over again. Such a disappointing experience considering this is my first time with them.

### "AirAsia is not a reliable airline"
AirAsia is not a reliable airline, often flight schedule changes, and does not care for customers welfare. It is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. My flight ticket was from MNL-CGY and vice versa. First, my MNL-CGY flight scheduled at 14:20 was moved to 19:45, though there was one email prior notice. However, on my CGY-MNL return flight originally scheduled at 14:10, upon arrival at Laguindingan Airport, I and other passengers were told that the flight would be moved to 20:30 without prior notice. As we were waiting patiently, time has passed and the earlier announced 20:30 became 22:00. Air Asia ground crew did not even show courtesy by asking for apology nor give any explanation, and did not even offer water to the customers during the tiring and frustrating nine hours of waiting just to appease our disappointment. The company did not show any care or respect to their customers. I strongly discourage other flyers to try flying AirAsia.

### "standing for 2 hours in the check-in queue"
We booked AirAsia Philippines as we still have a credit from the covid cancelled flights. The flight from Caticlan to Manila was okay, however, there was a delay by air traffic control. Then we had to check in for our flight from Manila to Bohol (Tagbilaran). Arriving at Manila Airport 3.5 hours before departure was a good thing as we were standing for 2 hours in the check-in queue. The had only 4 agents for 500+ passengers. The agents were working very slowly and made long explainations to the customers. According to the security working there, it happens every day. The Cebupacific check-in was working much faster. There is no family check-in. Everyone had to stay in the queue in the terminal. After boarding we had the next unpleasant surprise. When the plane made it to the runway the captain reported a technical problem and we had to go out of the broken plane and enter a replacement plane. So we were 2.5 hours late in Bohol.

### "This airline ruined my long-planned vacation"
This airline ruined my long-planned vacation after canceling my flight from Boracay to Cebu which left me with only 2 choices, travel fund or reschedule a month after the original flight booked because they canceled the route. I asked them to fly me from Caticlan to Cebu via Manila because they still operate those flights under AirAsia Philippines, but to no avail. After spending almost 1000 dollars on advanced bookings, my only option is to purchase new tickets which costs almost 8 times more than it was before with another airline. AirAsia is selling fake flights to grab your money and keep it with them as much as they could, limiting your options to impossible and doesn't care ruining your holiday. I've been reading several comments on their Facebook page even way back to 2018 postings, this is a common practice for this airline as ranted by thousands of people who had similar issues as mine. I wonder when the government would revoke their franchise for fooling a lot of people already. The major swindler of the airline, probably in the whole world. My only wish is for this airline's closure.

### "they rejected the refund"
Not Verified | Airasia calcelled my flight from Bali to the Philippines because of covid19. I was promised to get a refund for this specific cancellation. After waiting for it for 4 months they rejected the refund. Even tho it was even promised on their website. So now i dont get refunded nor i get credits and lost 200€ for a flight that never went up in the air. Plus it is impossible to contact AirAsia  in any way accept for the automatic AVA.

### "I wasn't eligible for a credit"
Not Verified |  The only number available to call anyone for help is long distance to India and after waiting on hold for an hour (paying for a call to India), they say they only handle domestic flights in India. At least the Indian guy confirmed that there is no other number and you have to "chat" online, and the wait is over an hour for that too. And there is no countdown to your time to chat, and no audible alert when your agent is available, so you have to literally stare at the screen for an hour and hope you happen to see when they show up. If you don't respond within 60 seconds, they end the chat. If you are waiting for the agent to type or look something up for longer than 60 seconds, it ends the chat. So you have to keep typing "still here. Absolutely ridiculous. I was contacting them because they had sent an email saying I am eligible for a flight credit for my flight that They cancelled, but their website is so bad it didn't let me claim that credit. Nothing but errors and missing flight information. Then the agent said I wasn't eligible for a credit, despite the email They sent affirming that I would get a credit. I sent him the email, and he didn't budge.

### "worst airline I have ever booked"
AirAsia Philippines the worst airline I have ever booked and flown with. They ghost their customers regarding refunds, constantly disconnect/change the phone lines, don't have email support, and no one answers DMs on Facebook or Twitter. The only other support you get is Ava which is a useless, infuriating bot. I tried to go to the airport to speak with them but the security told me AirAsia Philippines doesn't allow face to face. I had my flights canceled four different times, and finally on the last one I just went to the airport and asked to be put on another flight because there were empty seats. They kept saying it was full. I insisted that this was unfair and pointed out several examples of hypocrisy and finally they let me on, but not before charging me $120. I had $150 in credits but they wouldn't let me use that towards the flight even though I purchased travel insurance and premium flex which is what this is for. They are trying to avoid letting people use their credits.

### "original flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  My original flight was cancelled one day before the supposed itinerary due economical reasons by AirAsia. A full refund on the credit card was promised. After 3 months I got a credit for future flights without having an option to choose. In the end I tried to move to flight to a later date without any success. I was the chat several hours waiting. The emergency hotline if you get connected kicks you out after 10 min in the waiting line. When i got connected to service staff, she was not helpful to move the flight. Overall contact from the customer to the airline seems not to be wanted from the side of Air Asia.

### "just give me the flight credits"
Manila to Bangkok. This multiple cancelations of flight due to COVID has been a total nightmare with a system like this. Since they did not have any live chat I went through their chatbot to see the recourse available for those no longer willing fly. Going through their available options I made a case for voluntary cancellation since there were no other options for cancelations and their offer here was to give you flight credits valid for one year for the same amount you initially paid which I figured was better than nothing, after three days after filling my case I was sent an email offering me an option for a full refund since my flight was canceled due to the government banning all flights. I took up the offer and filled for the full refund case. I checked with the chatbot to cancel my initial case since I wanted the full refund instead but no option was available. I tried to get in touch with them so many times so that I can remove the initial case and only go through the full refund but I cannot reach anyone. After a month they processed the flight credits refund, I got in contact with their live chat (yes I had to way and hour) to explain my case mix up but they're adamant to just give me the flight credits rather than a full refund!

### "impossible to obtain a refund"
Not Verified |  Caticlan to Manila. They make it impossible to obtain a refund on flights they cancel because of covid19. The only way they will allow you to interact with them is via a chatline, which invariably takes hours to get through to. Once you're through, they try to fob you off with a credit and when you insist on your legal right to a refund, they tell you it could take 6 months and even that is not guaranteed. Don't be put off by taking a credit if you don;t want that.

### "haven't received any money back"
Manila to Tacloban booked for September 2020. I booked a ticket no problem using a combination of miles and cash (paid by credit card), but after a month I received an email saying that they couldn't process my booking with miles so I have 48 hours to pay the extra fee, otherwise the ticket will be cancelled and I will get my money back. However, after more than 2 months I haven't received any money back. I tried to contact the airline through Twitter, I received a message saying that the payment was late so there is no booking, I asked them to return my money, as they promised in their email, but no reply since then.

### "no respect to customers"
Cebu to Davao. Has been delayed and delayed with no reason? My flight Is at 7am. Has been delayed with no reason to 8:30am, they start to say “due to operation” and delayed again to 9am and announced again with just saying “further delaying” to 10am. I’m not sure if I can take this flight today. There’s no respect to customers at least have to provide a reason or something.

### "couldn’t get in the flight"
Worst experience with an airline. Very disappointing I bought a flight ticket to Hanoi with a transfer in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The Taiwan government site says I do not need a transfer visa as long I don’t leave the airport. However AirAsia doesn’t have the facility that allows me to remain in the airport without a visa, so I couldn’t get in the flight and they didn’t refund me. They should have given the information when the purchase made.

### "record of the transaction"
Cebu to Puerto Princesa. The web site is slow and if you get it to work it will not be transferred to the airline. I paid twice for additional baggage to be told at the counter there was no record of the online transaction.

### "Kite bag wasn't accepted"
Davao to Manila. Kite bag wasn't accepted as sports equipment. I've been to kite festivals in Philippines, China and Indonesia and never had a problem. The thing that made me mad was when the supervisor laughed at me when I paid the extra money.

### "no information provided, no apology"
Puerto Princesa to Manila. Flight was delayed for 1hr 20mins with no notification. Only realised when the boarding time exceeded its stipulated time and no ground crew were seen at the counter at all. After half an hour, the crew finally appeared. Asked the ground crew what time was the flight arriving and they said they don't know, just wait, with a bored face. Flight finally departed 1hr 20mins later which caused me to miss my next connecting flight. No notification, no information provided, no apology and no help rendered.

### "changes every minute"
Our flight was smooth at first. We enjoyed our trip from Manila to Cebu. But during our return to Manila, our flight was delayed from 5pm to 5.50pm then to 7.20pm to 7.10 pm to 7.25 pm and lastly to 7.50pm. Due to these changes every minute, we have been confused and were not able to go to the gate 20mins before the final time of departure. We arrived 6 mins late and were not accepted on the gate. Our flight was forfeited and we need to book another flight to be able to return to Manila. It was so devastating and heartbreaking as we have to incur another expense to return to Manila that costs us same price of round trip from Manila to Cebu and vice versa.

### "seat comfort is good"
Not Verified |  Manila to Taipei. This is really good, the flight attendants were pretty kind when entering the plane. They have food I like, the seat comfort is good and the landing is smooth.

### "have been delayed"
Singapore to Cebu. Very sad about this airline. I have flown with them 3 times and all my flights with them have been delayed.

### "No reasons for the delay"
No reasons given for the delay. They'll just announce that there is delayed and that's it. 2 hours delayed without nothing. And no timing as well if which time will it depart. It's difficult for us traveller of if we dont know anything regarding the flight. There are some reason that are valid or not but still have the right to know.

### "could not carry on a regulator"
Not Verified |  I flew round trip from Davao City to Cebu. On the flight to Cebu I had my dive gear in an Akona Bag and was going to carry-on my regulator. They stopped me at X-ray and told me I could not carry on a regulator, so I had to go down a check it in as a checked bag. Coming back from Cebu. I prepaid for 25 kilos for my dive gear but did not tell them it’s sports equipment. So, when I checked the Akona bag in, they said it’s sports equipment and I would have to pay between p3000-5000. They said I cannot put clothes in with sports equipment. I only had that bag and a carry-on back pack for me and my girlfriend. They said I have to take the clothes out and put them in a separate bag (which I did not have). He called his supervisor and let me get away with the way I had it this one time only.

### "The seats are miserable"
Singapore to Cebu with AirAsia. Overall disappointing. First, departure was postponed for 2.5 hours. (and you can only get the money back if it is 3 hours and over!) then departure was postponed 2.5 hours. The plane was filled up and the staff spent a lot of time placing hand luggage. The seats are miserable.

### "had to ask them for the food"
Cebu to Manila. Crew were not paying attention after I ordered food and paid for it, I was told that they will heat it up for 7 minutes. They did their usual selling merchandise after offering meal and after I followed up my meal, the stewardess just said ok, but didn’t bring back the food. Until they passed by the row of my seat, I had to ask them for the food again and it was brought to me cold as the 7 minutes turned out to be about 20 minutes!

### "delayed almost 4 hours"
Cagayan de oro to Manila. Would it be hard to inform passengers that their flight will be delayed almost 4 hours? We have amongst us those who have to transfer to another flight. Passengers have to stand up and and approach staff when it is clearly their job to inform and update us.

### "zero info about delays"
Boracay to Manila, a 45 mins flight, zero info about delays, no screen to let people know, a few announcements here and there and a 4hr delay plus being stuck in the plane on arrival.

### "very long queues at Immigration"
Manila to Seoul. I checked in my luggage at Terminal 3. When arriving at the Immigration there were very long queues. I tried several times to overtake it and to talk to the Immigration Officers asking them to process my payment for resident aliens and my passport. I was told that I had to go behind the line. Once I paid my fee I was asked again to go back to the end the other lines for having my passport stamped. During my time waiting I saw ground staff of Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Cebu Pacific asking for passenger for their flights and accompanied the passengers to overtake the line and to be attended to immediately. Nobody from AirAsia was in that area. Arriving at the gate, I was told that the flight was closed and that my ticket was forfeited. My luggage was offloaded and I could retrieve it from the check-in counter. I had to purchase a new ticket. I tried to claim some amount from AirAsia's insurance company who rejected my claim.

### "at best mediocre"
Manila to Puerto Princesa. I’m not sure how some travelers rate this airline above a 3. Nearly every encounter I have with them is at best mediocre (can’t get seats together with my travel companion) to horrible. Horrible includes the fact that they are always delayed but if you are running behind they charge you a $100 “rebooking fee,” which is about what it cost for a ticket anyway. But they will tell you that a ticket costs $200 one way, which is nonsense. If I could find another way to my destination I would never fly them again. They price gouge and are inconsiderate. In fairness, their staff although appearing to work in a chaotic environment, are courteous. I sympathize with them for working for such a terrible airline.

### "get credit card charge refunded"
I purchased a round trip for my in-laws to visit us in Korea and made the reservation by phone direct to Air Asia Philippines. After accepting and charging my card successfully, their fraud/review department declined the transaction on the same day. I was only able to find out by calling them again the day before the flight. My in-laws ended up paying in cash at the counter in Manila and made the flight. One month later, I am still trying to get my credit card charge refunded. After 4 different support case numbers, I am still waiting 'for their investigation' even though I received an email stating the refund was made/authorized one month ago. My bank shows no incoming transactions and Air Asia would not/could not provide their transaction number that initiated the credit card refund and state that the delay is from inaction by my bank.

### "refused to allow her to board"
I booked a ticket via Expedia for my girlfriend to fly from Cebu to Manila on 14th January at 17.40. The flight was confirmed to me via email along with the seat number allocated. However, when she arrived at the Air sia desk they refused to allow her to board saying that the ticket was not paid for. I insisted that the payment was made but they still refused to allow her to board. The following day I noticed that my account had been deducted for the full cost of the flight from Air Asia. I wrote to Air Asia to complain about the service and demand a refund. I had a letter of apology from them yet more than 15 days later still no refund.

### "missed my international flight"
The fight got delayed from Kalibo to Malina for almost 3 hours on Jan 1, 2019, for that I missed my international flight, when I asked them for a solution, they rebooked my flight which is 2 days later, they said that's the only flight with an available seat. I have to bear all the losses, my schedule has been shattered, I have to pay two days accommodation fee and extra costs, but those were not the worst part. At the check-in counter, I asked the check-in lady to provide me with a paper for the delay, so my hotel I was supposed to stay could redeem me, the lady reassured me that they would bring the paper at my next check in, that is Jan 2 10 pm, flight took off at 00:05 am, and I asked them to not forget the paper. On my next check-ins, no paper, the check-in lady was not willing to help anyway, she is very reluctant, I asked her many times, she just said "wait", still nothing is done.

### "so many hidden fees"
Clark to Cebu. At first, I was very happy with the price. But then I went to fully pay and the credit card processing fee was a whopping 15%! That is insane. Then I get to the airport and they tell me my toothpaste and wires need to be checked! They assured me that this was normal. I had to pay a lot extra for a checked bag and then they had a terminal fee, again overall so many hidden fees that made me furious. Just give me the right price, not some made up price and in nowhere in the world is it ok to charge someone 15% on a credit card.

### "a good experience"
Not Verified |  Manila to Taipei. It was our first time flying AirAsia. The flight turned out well, the ride was safe. We experienced some turbulence because of the bad weather, but overall it was a good experience. The seats were a little tight, not enough leg room. If you’re looking for an aircraft for short distances, try Air Asia. We also flew with AirAsia going back from Taiwan to Manila. The flight was better, and the plane and boarding were on time.

### "cannot fault their service"
Davao to Manila. Swift checking again, having used this airline many times when travelling internally in the Philippines and I cannot fault their service. Crew are always friendly, cabin always clean more so price wise very competitive.

### "A very pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Manila to Davao. A very pleasant experience. The flight was so smooth and relaxing. We had a great time. The plane arrived ahead of Schedule and we arrived at our destination almost 30 minutes earlier. True value for the money we have paid. I will be flying with this airline again.

### "more hassle than I'd like"
Bangkok to Manila round trip. Don Mueang to Manila was 1 hour late and the return leg nearly 3hrs late due to technical problems with the aircraft. Check in in Bangkok was a zoo, Manila a little better. Flights themselves were no frills fine apart from the delays and in neither case did the captain apologise for the delay or even acknowledge it. Fare price was cheaper than Philippine Airlines or Cebu Pacific but routing through DMK instead of BKK resulted in more hassle than I'd like. Not a good choice if you have connecting flights.

### "There was little legroom"
Manila to Puerto Prinsesa. Flight was not delayed, our flight was 5:55 we were boarded 5:20. But the aircraft didnt leave until 6:20. While waiting inside the aircraft I can hear was how annoyed the cabin crews at the back. The crews were not friendly. There was little legroom. I’m writing this review while waiting for my delayed flight going back to manila.

### "More than 75 minutes delay"
Cebu to Manila on 16th March. More than 75 minutes delay and add to the delay with ferrying passengers by bus. No timely or accurate information about the delay. At one point the announcement was that our aircraft had not yet departed from its originating Airport, it took a passenger and his app to show the ground staff that the plane was actually half way already.

### "delayed for 4 hrs to depart"
Cebu to Manila. AirAsia delayed for 4 hrs to depart from Cebu bound for Manila, and their delay caused me losing my international flight bound for Doha. This led me to spend US$230 to revalidate international flight for next flight schedule and stay in Manila city for two nights. When I complain and ask for compensation AirAsia don't recognize the claim and simply gave me a nonsense reply just to wash their hands. And after they reply in next 30 mins they send another email "Congratulating me that they successfully close the case". What a shame. Anyone who is concerned about right use of money, time and has next flight commitment should not use AirAsia at all.

### "not recommend this airline"
As I sit typing this review, our flight originally departing at 8.40pm has been delayed more than 4 hours and we have yet to begin boarding. Estimated time of boarding was at midnight. Upon check-in at 5pm this afternoon, I inquired upon an earlier flight since we have had a sudden death in the family, namely, my grandmother. We were supposed to attend her wake this evening. I was informed by airport staff that there were no earlier flights we can transfer to. Since then, we had to wait in the over-crowded and freezing cold pre-departure terminal. Food stands ran out of food due to the volume of passengers waiting at NAIA and we have been informed of delays pushing back every hour, preventing us from being able to make a decision on the most comfortable arrangement with regards to changing or keeping our flight in lieu of an overnight accommodation in Manila. Suffice it to say, we will never be flying AirAsia Philippines again and would not recommend this airline.

### "book with a different airline"
If you want to wait 2-3 extra hours due to delayed flights, AirAsia Philippines is the airline for you. Along with my boyfriend, we experienced at least a two hour delay each way from Manila to Puerto Princesa and back. The flight attendants are kind, however, all of the check in staff from Puerto Princesa airport were rude and careless. Even though you save a couple bucks with this airline, save yourself and book with a different airline even if it costs a few extra dollars.

### "we find it affordable"
We are frequent flyer of AirAsia Philippines since we find it affordable and we're comfortable with your company. But there's a need to be calibrated when it comes to your hand carry bags requirements. We're able to fly from Manila to Tagbilaran via AirAsia on October 14with our backpacks as hand carry but when we were about to fly back they insist one of our backpacks to be checked in because of the size. We asked them how AirAsia manila was able to allow us without checking it in and they are not. They are not even accomodating to help us.

### "simple and straightforward"
Cebu to Puerto Princesa. Upon our arrival an hour in advance at the pre-departure gate we found it crowded and full of other passengers from a different flight and seats were all full, we had to wait a bit farther away from our gate. Our aircraft arrived earlier than scheduled and the gate was opened for boarding 30mins than what was posted. Boarding in our plan was organized and peaceful as passengers were called in with respect to their seating assignments. The aircraft turnaround time was quick and methodical. Our flight to Puerto Princesa began with no incident and we landed safely in the new Puerto Princesa Airport 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall the flight was simple and straightforward like any one hour domestic flight should be.

### "Unfriendly staff"
Manila to Cebu. Delayed. Unfriendly staff. We were transferred from one plane to another. Our baggage arrived earlier than us, we end up in Cebu looking for our baggage and we do not know where to find it took us 3hrs before we got our baggage. The staff shouted on us and said that we are not paying attention when our names were called!

### "most disappointing airline"
Manila to Caticlan. AirAsia Philippines is the most disappointing airline. Our flight going from Manila to Caticlan was delayed for 3 hours. Which meant we had to wait in the airport for 6 hours altogether. When we actually got on the plane we waited for a further hour until moving. The crew was apologetic however they were giving different reasons as to why we were being delayed. One reason was that the runway wasn't free and the next was there was a problem with a machine to get the engine going. Me and my boyfriend were expecting to spend 2 and a half days of sun in Boracay, however, because of this we wasted a day off our short holiday. Despite the low fare, the waiting isn't worth it when you could get to your destination on time by spending a bit more money on a different airline.

### "changed the flight departure time "
I was supposed to travel AirAsia Philippines from Cebu to Manila. AirAsia Philippines changed the flight departure time from 20.10 to 23.20. No compensation and an unengaged staff that couldn't care less. Will never fly them again.

### "hidden fees and information"
Kalibo to Manila. We purchashed our tickets online prior to arriving to the country. We were surprised by the online booking fee that appears right befor paying. It was in the amount of half the actual fare per person. Once we arrived in the Philippines we received an email to inform us that our flight from Manila to Kalibo was going to be delayed. Once we arrived to the check in counter to see if we can get on an earlier flight they were able to accommodate this. Our original flight was for 530pm. We were able to get on a 330 pm flight. We had to check in 1 baggage with a weight limit of 21kg that costed again half the cost of the flight? Sitting around the airport we were informed that this flight will be delayed, not once, not twice, not three times. Our rescheduled flight was now 530pm. On the way back, they decided a checked in baggage weight maximum of 10kg, so going there you are expected to drop half of what you brought? If we arrived 4 hours earlier (who does this for a domestic flight?) the fee would be cheaper. So another surprising fee. So now we are here and our flight is delayed for an hour and a half and this is the first flight of the day from Kalibo to Manila. I wonder if we are delayed 4 hours if I would get the difference back for the fee I paid to check in my 10kg luggage. I am so happy we did not bring our children on this flight, it would have been a nigtmare. Lovely staff, but why all the hidden fees and information?

### "happy with the overall experience"
Manila to Tacloban was delayed for almost 3hrs, however, Air Asia was prepared by providing snacks. Tacloban to Manila was on time. Consistent on board service. Friendly cabin crew. Online booking still smooth. Keep it up. I am still happy with the overall experience.

### "staff were great as per usual"
Great flight with AirAsia Philippines flying from Kalibo to Manila. Boarded the aircraft exactly 40 mins prior to departure which is extremely unlikely for it to be so efficient, especially with a budget carrier. Plane was clean, staff were great as per usual and the flight landed 25 minutes early which was even better!

### "only saving grace was the always great onboard service"
Check in staff at Seoul Incheon were unenthusiastic and seemed bored to be at work. My flight was rescheduled from Manila to Cebu and they reluctantly put me on the flight before as they told me to wait until I arrived in Manila but in 4.5 hours time maybe the early flight would have been full with others that had the same idea as me. Nice flight to Manila, when I arrived in Manila we were stuck on the plane for an additional 30 minutes as they couldn't connect the air bridge to the aircraft. Luckily the Manila to Cebu flight was delayed so I had an extra 25 minutes, the security staff at budget terminal 4 were unbelievably rude. The second A320 we were on to Cebu was so old. The only saving grace was the always great onboard service.

### "communication unbelievably miserable"
Manila to Kalibo with AirAsia Philippines for a Boracay visit. Being a low cost carrier and short flight we didn't expect much except being on time. On the Manila to Kalibo leg our flight was delayed by almost 2 hours with very little communication from the ground staff. We are sitting in the Kalibo departure lounge right now for our return flight to Manila. The flight should have left 30 minutes ago. Ground staff told us that it will be around 45 minutes late. AirAsia website and Flightstats however show the flight to be 105 mins late. No word from the ground staff yet. AirAsia's communication is unbelievably miserable. Their customers are forced to inform themselves about their flights departure time. And don't expect your online check-in boarding passes to be emailed or sent to your smart phone. Tried both and we are still waiting. As said before, I don't expect much, but I expect to arrive at my destination on time and be proactively informed if there are delays. AirAsia Philippines gets an F-Grade on both. Never again.

### "haven't had a bad experience from them"
I have been flying with AirAsia Philippines for a number of times, and also a member of their loyalty program. I said that because I have been used to their flights being delayed that its no longer an issue for me. This trip Manila - Cebu - Manila was no exception as both flights were delayed. However, I will still give them a better score as the other factors was generally OK. From their online booking, to their online check in, to their ground staff, to their cabin crew, all were excellent. I haven't had a bad experience from them. I just hope that they will be placed in a better airport in Manila, this is not their fault.

### "staff were crass and unrefined"
Cebu to Manila with AirAsia. The positive thing is that they are very affordable especially when you book a week before and all the flights have become quite pricey. The downside is that more often than not, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service. As I was boarding back to Manila the gate staff were extremely rude and unpleasant. They tore my boarding pass carelessly without a bit of finesse. When I passed they abruptly went after me and rudely said that they had to weigh my bag. They weighed it and it exceeded 1 kilo more than the allotted 7kg. I brought the same things I did when I came to Cebu last week so I was surprised, but they demanded I pay. Luckily I have someone with me who’s carrying less than 4 kg worth so they got my excess 1kg but the staff were extremely angry and unpleasant. It made my flight tense and uncomfortable. The plane was half empty by the way. Staff were so crass and unrefined for the hospitality business. I understand that for a low-fare airline we get what we pay for but I don’t think it should come with cheap staff and cheaper service. Truthfully, AirAsia is a big help to a lot of people and travellers, but would it hurt to treat them with respect?

### "a lot of bad excuses"
Manila to Tacloban with AirAsia Philippines. First problems with the check in, the day befor we traveled from Copenhagen to Manila we had 2 bags with 25 kilos each, but when we check in the next day there is 8 kilos too much and we didn't add anything? And they told us the flight is delayed about 3 hours because of problems with the runway. It was around 5 hours delay in the end and we didn't get any food or water the first 4 hours form AirAsia. Just a lot of bad excuses so they don't have to do anything.

### "delayed our flight again"
Our flight from Manila to Hong Kong from NAIA Terminal 3 was delayed by an hour. Our flight was supposed to be at 6:15pm and they delayed it by 2 hours (8:15pm). At the time, that was tolerable. But going back, they delayed our 6:50pm flight and already told us before the day that they delayed our flight again for 2 hours (8:15pm). Then today, they delayed it for almost 3 hours (10:50pm). We've been at the airport since 4.45pm. I don't think I want to fly AirAsia ever again.

### "was delayed 8 hours"
Flight from Kalibo was delayed 8 hours. Arrived in Seoul at midnight when the rail system is shut down. A bus provided to Seoul Station but this is useless as only a hotel is helpful now. Requested hotel but was denied. No remuneration or anything for 8 hour delay. Planes don't even have a flap on the back of seat to put your water.
