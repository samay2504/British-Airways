### "For short flight is OK"
Basic airline, clean airplane, friendly crew, departed on time. Boarded the aircraft using the bus. They did not offer anything nor was an option Buy Menu. For short flight is OK airline.

### "avoid AeroItalia at all costs"
Terrible airline. Avoid at all costs. My wife & I had a Palermo-to-Rome flight booked, and when the flight was less than 24 hours out, we attempted to check in using AeroItaliaâ€™s phone app and their web page. Neither would allow us to check in. We attempted many times all the way up to 2 hours before the flight with no success. We kept getting an error. Consequently, we were forced to check in at the check-in counter. The AeroItalia employee at the check-in counter insisted that we pay 70 Euros to check in. When we explained that we attempted many times to check in via phone and web page, but were not allowed to, she had zero sympathy and insisted on the 70 Euro payment. Clearly, this company is unscrupulous and is scamming their customers. There was another couple that we met in the line who had the exact same poor experience. So again, avoid AeroItalia at all costs. Fly ITA Airways instead. Even if you have to pay a little bit more. My experience with them was flawless.

### "don't even answer my emails anymore"
Absolute crooks. Had a flight from Ancona to Rome on December 3, 2023. Flight was postponed 6 times in three hours and then cancelled! Had to organize a taxi to Rome, cost a fortune, and missed my connecting flight. Waiting for my refund ever since! Now they don't even answer my emails anymore.

### "impossible to check in online"
Only 1 check-in desk open for a full plane and impossible to check in online. Amazingly bad! Flight crew is friendly. Pilot flying into Milano on April 1st did a very bad landing.
