### "shoulder every extra cost myself"
Our flight’s scheduled evening departure slid from one time to the next until midnight became sunrise, yet the only help Norse Atlantic offered was a single voucher code that never worked. Families with toddlers hunted desperately for hotel rooms while gate agents were clearly overwhelmed and could only repeat, “try the website again.” By dawn we were told to sort out our own accommodation and “keep the receipts,” still with no explanation for the delay. Because Norse provided no written reason even after repeated requests, I had to shoulder every extra cost myself, including a costly re‑routing on another airline just to reach Berlin a day late. Months later, follow‑up emails remain unanswered. If predictability, communication, and basic passenger care matter to you, choose a carrier that doesn’t disappear the moment something goes wrong.

### “the check in process is a torture”
First of all, the plane, cabin crew were excellent. No issues there. However, the check in process is a torture. I have travelled a lot and have never witnessed the chaos. Two flights, one to JFK the other to MCO. Instead of separate lines we were all put together. A lot of passengers had luggage carts and were unable to negotiate the tight turns. I constantly asked for a chair and the person directing the flow wouldn’t help. It took an hour and a half to check in. I am not looking for compensation, but I will not recommend Norse Air due to the check in process. Ryan Air does a better job than Norse. If they had a 0 rating for ground service, I would give it.

### "airline has lost my baggage"
This airline has lost my baggage for the past day and are not being responsive to any of my communication. They also didn’t seem to care when I originally told them either.

### “a most average experience”
It was a most average experience across the Atlantic. The check-in and gate staff at Gatwick were professional yet brusque, didn't seem like they had much of a sense of humor or desire to be there. The seat was clean enough, until I noticed some dust and grime around different tray tables and arm rests at, as well as in the area around, my seat. Some prior customer had even stuck chewing gum in the seat back pocket in front of me, camouflaged with the color of the seat back so that I didn't notice it until almost takeoff. Gross. The meals, snacks and drinks served on board were perfectly fine, if pricey for what they were, but then I understand that's how budget airlines the world over make their money. I noticed a change in attitude from flight attendants after about two hours into the flight, after all of those meals, goodies and drinks had been purchased en masse by the passengers. That change, at least in my interpretation, was that the flight attendants went from being quite chipper, to just professional and aloof (although there was one FA who was consistently friendly and sweet throughout the flight, period, so credit where credit is due). Another thing, I wish that Norse would include a flight map to track the route, like Spirit in the US includes for its flights. Lastly, it was telling that the same type of American who flocks to Florida en masse to vacation, is basically the same type of British person who treks across the Atlantic to Florida - the type of person who takes trashy clothing and cheap sweatpants to an art form. In all...I would make this flight again for the right price point, but I would also come in with zero expectations of anything other than getting from point A to point B.

### "go online and read the baggage policy"
When we arrived at the check-in desk the representative weighed our bags and demanded 18 dollars for 2 pounds overweight. After I told him to check again because I had weighed the bags before, he changed his attitude and claimed that we had too many carryon bags and backpacks for the plane and claimed that we would have to pay 130 dollars for another check-in bag. After much argument, the representative pointed out that we would only pay $126 for overweight (after moving one of the small bags into one of the checked-in suitcases) and we could take both backpacks and small carryon bag on the plane without additional charges. And so, the check-in issue ended with a lot of embarrassment, very bad treatment. The answer by the representative was always "go online and read the baggage policy and do the check in again after". When we arrived at the boarding gate the shift manager met us again and said that we had too many carryon bags and backpacks and that we would have to pay an additional amount for another bag. They threatened that we would not board the flight if we would not pay and she will call the police and security if we argue with her. After all the money the shift manager demanded from us, we decided to pay the premium class and demand a refund for the suitcase/overweight that we paid for at Check-in. After we paid 700 dollars for the premium class, the representative claimed that there are no refunds for overweight, even though in the premium class we deserve 2 checked-in suitcases of 23 kilos each plus larger carryon bags and backpacks and they refused to give us back the 126 dollars we paid at the check-in.

### "claiming that I need a visa to transit"
They do not advertise that they won't allow you to fly to London if you will be transiting there. Nowhere on their website does it say this, and nowhere during the booking process does it say this. I even checked with their customer support and they refused to say whether they will let me board, saying I need to do my own research. I checked the visa requirements for transiting landside in London on the UK government's website using the "do I need a visa" tool, and it confirmed that I am allowed to transit landside in London without a visa. I made a printout of this result page and took it with me to the airport. The staff refused to let me board, falsely claiming that I need a visa to transit in London and quoting internal, unadvertised company policy about transits. I believe they don't really know the visa requirements. It was only after begging them to call the UK border force to confirm that I can transit landside in London that they let me board and everything eventually worked out. I am happy to add that I didn't spend a cent on their in-flight sales during the entire 12 hour flight.

### "worst flight I have ever been on"
This is the worst flight I have ever been on. Plane was tatty / dirty, hardly saw cabin crew. Told no drinks / snacks available as they had no stock. Old Guy in seat next to us was could not stand and was not fit to fly under any circumstances, had his nappy changed 4 times during the flight. I complained to P&O who chartered the plane On top of this we paid an extra £1000 approx for the pleasure of premium. Never in this world would this be premium service.

### “no customer care, no empathy”
Norse is the worst airline I have ever travelled with. They bullied me at the check in to put my case in the hold - saying I had not paid for carry on, just a hold item. (On my return from NYC they turned this hold item into carry on - so why couldn't the check in woman have done that for me at Gatwick on my way out?) They made me pay for a carry on for my daughter - even though I clearly showed them that my booking specified I had a small bag and a small carry on. They told me Expedia (who I booked through) hadn't paid for the carry on bags and insisted I paid, the girl was useless and almost forgot to give me my checked in bag stub - which I definitely needed as guess what? they lost my case. So my 20th wedding anniversary in NYC was ruined - a 3 day trip taken up buying clothes and toiletries because of there total neglect to provide a good service. My family - including my 13 year old, were all sat apart. The food cost a fortune. It was greasy and cheap tasting. Vile. On my return journey the check in guy was so rude I actually asked him if he was having a bad day. Again - they told me 'we updated our baggage law in September ) - so why not email your customers? I had no idea. They made me pay 85 dollars for a carry on EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST MY BAG and it NEVER arrived on my holiday - they didn't even think to put me in a seat with more space - and there were two directly in front of me, the whole flight back. They showed no customer care, no empathy, no understanding. They want to grab as much money a possible and give you the cheapest, meanest experience. I will never travel with them again. They are the worst. Avoid at all costs.

### "$215 due to 2 overweight suitcases"
We purchased this flight after our original flight was canceled. we are a family of 5 and came with 5 Suitcases to Check in and 5 to take on board. The crew was so rude, unhelpful and unpleasant from the first moment. We asked to sit together or at least 3 together and the other 2 together, they wouldn't allow it to us (They sent 1 to be at the back). Later we found out that the airplane was half empty so we could easily sit all 5 together. Regarding the luggage they made us pay additional $215 due to 2 overweight suitcases. The crew was pleasant at the flight too and when we asked for water in the flight (8.5 hours) they made us feel we are asking too much. Will never do this mistake again

### "they had just closed the doors"
Not Verified | Our flight was delayed from Charlotte to Orlando. We ran to the gate where our plane was waiting and they had just closed the doors. They refused to open them even though they had closed the doors 15 minutes early. They do not let you check in online and they said if you’re not checked in at the airport an hour in advance they don’t have to let you on the plane. It’s impossible to check in when you are still in the air. The only way to reach them was by email, which obviously is too late when you need to leave the same night , their employees were extremely rude and didn’t try to help at all.

### "didn’t give you free headphones"
Not Verified | They book you at a price lower than their competitors but tell you at time of booking you only have to pay for your seats. When you get to the airport they charge an astronomical amount for checked bags and $49 for carryons. All you are allowed is a backpack. On the plane you can’t get a glass of free water on a 9 hour flight. You have to buy a horrible dinner for $20 and water is $3.70 a bottle. Seats are uncomfortable and crew was not nice to me. By the time you add all the charges on, you would be better off flying Delta or American, and getting a decent dinner then breakfast along with pillows and blankets. Norse didn’t give you free headphones on a 9 hour flight. You had to buy them.

### “anxiety experienced with online booking”
First the good news: the two flights (L/Gatwick – NYC/JFK – L/Gatwick) were satisfactory i.e. the Ground Staff were helpful and the Cabin Crew efficient and helpful. On both occasions the touch-down times were as expected. However, much anxiety was experienced with the Norse online booking arrangement on the 15th July 2024. The UK webpage handled the booking and, for payment verification, passed me to VISA, which verified the payment and then returned me to Norse, where there was nothing! I refreshed the web page several times but nothing. Back-stepping the webpage only indicated that VISA had forced released the connection, as had Norse. Norse advise UK passengers on their several webpages that there is no telephone number available and that for ‘security reasons’ no Norse Staff will call passengers. There is a telephone number for USA passengers; perhaps the USA/FAA demands it? So what do Norse UK passengers do when there is nothing to confirm their online application? I sent an email immediately requesting assistance on the situation. All that was returned was an auto-reply advising that the points listed therein their text would cover the query. They didn’t! Altogether eleven emails were submitted to Norse over the next few days with only auto-acknowledgements returned. Meanwhile enquiries of my Bank indicated that the VISA amount £823 had been debited within 48 hours, apparently by a recipient in South-East Norway. Enquiries of the UK Civil Aviation Authority indicated that they had no responsibility for airlines booking arrangements. A similar enquiry of the UK Citizens Advice Bureau indicated that the airline would need an UK address and to establish that and to then send Norse a signed-on-delivery letter giving them 7-14 days to reply regarding this matter before seeking VISA to reimburse the payment. This was duly followed, yet no Norse reply was forthcoming. On the 14th day an application was therefore made to my Bankers to arrange reimbursement. After a long discussion the one representative requested that I put the Norse debit reference code into the Norse computer to see what resulted. Luckily, when I tried, it did indeed reveal my booking details. Bear in mind that there are usually other commitments dependent on a long-haul flight i.e. hotel bookings. What of Norse? On the 12th August 2024 (28 days after the date of application) a casual email arrived saying, in effect, the same advice as my Bankers suggestion. Thus, if there are no Norse staff to assist their customers, Norse should add such information to their webpages/email auto-reply. Otherwise, I suggest, the above clearly indicates a dilatory attitude to their passengers etc.

### "charged me $65 for each bag"
Not Verified | I will never fly this airline again. It is absolutely not cheap after they get you for baggage. On top of it - there is no wifi on an 11 hour flight. The carry on and personal item allotment is extremely small and they charged me $65 for each bag so I ended up not saving any money. To top it off, they also changed the carry one and personal item bag sizes at the airport - when I did baggage check in - the bin that they use to measure what bag size is allotted was much smaller than when I went to the gate. When I went to the gate, they had a larger bin size to show how big your bags could be and the one at checking was much smaller forcing me to pay more for my personal item which would have fit on the larger bin measurement device. The attendant at the gate told me it was not accurate and turned the bin around even though on it it said economy was covered. Bottom line - if you are genuinely trying to save money - do not fly on this airline if you are trying to carry and reasonable baggage or they will get you on the backend. They know how to get their money and you are forced to pay- do not be fooled. And not to offer wifi on an 11 hour flight is absolutely ridiculous!

### "Overall awful experience"
Not Verified | They don't let you check in online so earlier to the airport I went, even earlier than usual because you never know if it's gonna be quick or long. For nothing. Took like 3 minutes to check in so then I had to wait a crazy amount of time. I get to the airplane and didn't see the usual little pillows and blankets on the seats. Norse had them on their menu for $6.50. They also sell their headphones and really anything else. No free meal either. No WIFI on a 7+ hour flight is complete insanity. The seats are super uncomfortable. The toilets were disgusting. Everything on board was expensive, they sell you low quality food for crazy amounts of money. I got a noodle soup that they brought in one of those round packages that you buy at the store for like $2 and charged me $10. Not to mention other prices that I can't even name right now. Overall awful experience.

### “Norse did not care”
Not Verified | What can happen if an airline does not allow pre check in online prior to a flight and does not have a customer service phone number and no representative at an airport? I will tell you. I was present one hour prior to the flight, not earlier due to a connection which was delayed (not my fault). There were 16 of us. Norse had left the counter, had no customer service number to call and had no representative at the airport. Even though I was present an hour before the flight, I was unable to check in and get a boarding pass. Without a boarding pass, I could not proceed further at the airport. Every other airline I have flown with allowed me to pre check in online thereby registering for the fight and obtaining a boarding pass. I could not do that with Norse. They had closed the flight even though I was there an hour before with 16 other passengers. I had to spend the night in Athens, Greece and arrange for another flight at three times the cost. I had to get back by Monday for health reasons (cancer issues). Norse did not care. They have not treated me (or my girlfriend) with any patience, understanding or a semblance of customer service. They will not reimburse me for anything. I will not fly with them again. I wanted to share this experience with you in case you are considering them as an airline.

### "a pleasantly nice experience"
Fly Premium Economy. Almost all negative reviews for Norse are for economy. We flew Premium Economy LAX-LGW yesterday and had a pleasantly nice experience. They're an ultra low cost carrier, sure, but the Premium Economy product more than sufficed, especially for the cost. From other reviews, I was under the impression that the food would be scant and bad - Nope, I was full and it was "good enough". Reviews on the more limited IFE were accurate - there's probably just enough to make most people a little happy, but it's limited. So - if you're on the fence because of all of the economy reviews, I'm fine saying ignore them.

### "such an awful service"
The worst airline EVER! They don’t provide online checking causing a huge line at the airport. Every carry-on and hand bag has to be put in metal bins to confirm measurements. No entertainment on 9 hours intercontinental flight, no food, not even one sip of water is served during the flight. Everything has to be purchased at an additional cost. Electric outlets are not working. I have been flying for 50 years, but never experienced such an awful service. Never again!

### “Norse is a big NO, NO”
Oh boy! Where do I start? We booked our flight from Orlando to London through Kiwi. Never heard of this airline before and accepted the offer just because it came up as Atlantic which I took for Virgin Atlantic. We travel very light with just a small backpack which easily fits in the seat infront of you. Anyhow at the airport we were told we need to pay additional $86 for each backpack! Really? After service began it turned out that you had to order your meal in advance. Since we did it through a third party we did not know that. Our bad. We asked if we can pay on board. No! So your options are only squashed, awfully tasting, weird looking kind of sandwich for $10.50 or Noodles that you buy at the supermarket for less than $1 for $6. In case you don't have a card with you, you can't even get water! Everything else that you may need for a transatlantic flight is available only for a heavily overpriced fee. Blankets, pillows, headphones, etc. I am an ex flight attendant and I travel a lot. I have flown low cost airlines (AirEuropa, WizzAir, RayanAir, Norwegian and so on) but I have never seen such things. So a piece of advice from a regular traveler - even do the ticket price seems reasonable, after paying for your essential needs, the price becomes more expensive than regular airline so save yourself some time, inconveniece and disappointments. Check for example what you get with Turkish Airlines for about the same price. For me and my family - Norse is a big NO, NO. Never again!

### "one of the worst airlines I have ever flown"
Easily one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Customer service is beyond atrocious and there is ZERO accountability. They don't even pretend to care about their customers. I was treated very rudely for no reason by a check-in agent. The agent was not wearing any name badge. When I inquired about her name so I could send an email to escalate, she said she wasn't going to provide it as she didn't want me to complain about her. Then I finally managed to find the on-shift manager on my own, who said she understood my frustration, but couldn't do anything about it. She told me to email the Customer Support email. I then wrote a lengthy email to customer service and this was their reply: "We are sorry to hear about your experience with a ground staff, please understand that staff at check in airport are from external companies however we will share this information with the appropriate department. So essentially, they take no responsibility for the behavior of their ground staff and basically say they are really not going to do anything about it. I then escalated to a manager, and after multiple times chasing, I got a generic email saying sorry with no resolution or accountability. In the future, I will happily pay an extra 20-40% more to never fly Norse again!

### "the hardest long haul flight"
This was the hardest long haul flight I have ever done. For me it was 12 hours off uncomfortable hell. I understand the long haul low cost concept, but actually doing it is another level. The seats were extremely uncomfortable and rigid, although the leg room decent. There was no free food/snacks or beverages offered, even water. For water it was 5$, for a hot meal after take off and a snack before landing it was $50. I didn’t pay the $80 for 10KG, so all I was allowed was a personal bag. Smaller than a standard backpack. There is IFE offered but you have to buy the headphones and the choice is very limited. No blanket or pillow. The crew weren’t friendly, my seat was at the back off the plane and I ended up knowing everything about there personal lives and plans for Bangkok. The crew were extremely loud for the whole flight, which stopped me getting any rest. It was quite an empty flight. After takeoff the crew announced that people could move seats when the seat belt sign was off. It created a mass frenzy, full on arguments over seats. I was also slightly annoyed as I had to pay 40$ to secure my seat. I had a return flight but bought another ticket with another airline, there was no way I could put myself through that torture again.

### "charged $85 dollars for my personal item"
In London they gave me a hard time but let me through when I spoke with the manager and she saw that my bag fit. Got on the plane and saw that the space under the seats is way bigger than that slot they use to make people measure and humiliate them. I even took a photo of both to compare. The man at the desk also agreed the space is bigger. So they made me fit it in, and still made me pay $85 even when it fit, because it wasn’t within the measurements. So in the manager’s words, even if my bag is 100% empty, she can charge me $85 if the bag’s dimensions go over their apparent limit. These people are the worst airline I have ever ridden. While I understand they are a budget airline, that is the reason I flew them, so I wasn’t okay with being charged $85 dollars for my personal item which clearly fit in the thing. Despicable.

### “such a low quality experience”
Not Verified | This hands down was the worst transatlantic airline I have ever taken. I travel often between Europe and America and have never seen such a low quality experience. The airline does not offer online check-in in the year 2024. They do not offer free cabin bags for a transatlantic flight which should be the minimum expected. How could anyone travel transatlantic with only a small personal item. The plane is passable at best. The flight was equally as expensive as flying a much more respectable airline like BA or TAP before getting charged for merely existing. Do not fly with this airline.

### "pay for absolutely everything"
Not Verified |  As others said you have to pay for absolutely everything. I had to pay for blanket and headphones. No pillow was provided. Spent £600 for this flight for 4 days and we did not get a meal and had to pay for all drinks. This flight did not come with hand luggage, only allowed a personal item. The worst part was when coming back to the UK, at JFK they told me I had to pay an extra 80 US dollar as the personal item could not fit in that bag measurement box. They did not allow online check-in so that you had to come to the airport so they can check everyones personal item bag measurements in order to make more money from it. So beware, they check the measurements of the personal bag. Be ready to freeze without a blanket and be uncomfortable without a pillow and ready to pay for all refreshments on your long-haul flights. Will never fly with them again!

### "staff on board were much nicer"
Not Verified |   I knew this was a budget airline so packed carefully and pre ordered meals, and so didn't have some issues others here reported. However, the ground staff were awful all the way anyway. At check in they were rude, almost disappointed that my bags did in fact meet requirements. At boarding they barked impossible orders: with no microphone expecting a crowd of hundreds of travellers to "form 2 straight lines or we won't board" then getting angry when people struggled to hear and so couldn't comply. I've already told you 3 times. If you all don't make 2 straight line we won't board the plane". People were not pushing, just waiting for their group number to be called. No signs, no guide posts, nothing. Thankfully the staff on board were much nicer, though you have to buy everything, even headphones to watch movies if you don't have your own (terrible quality, could hardly hear the movies, 6.50€) Its quite squashed on board but doable. The 20€ pre ordered meal, gluten free, was tiny but quite nice (chicken breast, mashed potato and broccoli) If you need a cheap flight and organise yourself well, it's fine. I'll avoid in the future unless desperate.

### "out of order and unacceptable"
Worst airline. First got an email from Norse to say my flight is delayed for 4 hours. Then got to the airport realizing the flight is cancelled. I never got an email or phone call from them. Tried to contact them, they don’t have a phone number, the website directs you to either an email or Bot. The bot isn’t helpful, can transfer to an adviser instead asks you fill a form so that someone can reply via email. Absolutely out of order and unacceptable.

### “You have to pay for everything”
Not Verified | I fly with them and it was 11.5h long. I was shocked that we didn’t receive food nor drinks. I went to beg for one cup of water and that was it. You have to pay for everything even if your ticket is $300. Shameless.

### "We had to purchase everything"
I booked a round-trip flight to the U.S. for my family via Skyscanner, with TAP Portugal for the outbound and Norse for the inbound. This was my first experience with both airlines, and it was nothing short of a disaster with Norse. I paid extra for both a cabin bag and a carry-on, but that did nothing to spare us from the nightmare that followed. Norse's communication is abysmal, to put it mildly. They wait until you’re at the check-in desk to spring their policies on you. Their baggage policies are nothing short of a scam. My cabin bag was just 1 lb over the limit, and they had the nerve to demand an outrageous $130 fee! Their carry-on bag size is a joke—practically only big enough for a purse. It’s clear they’re trying to squeeze every penny out of passengers. The staff is incredibly rude and utterly unhelpful. They don’t just speak loudly—they shout at you, and they absolutely refuse to listen. At one point, they even threatened to leave my family and me stranded, all while ignoring any attempt we made to resolve the issue. The level of disrespect is astonishing. I was traveling with my wife and two sons, aged 15 and 9, to our shock our seats were scattered all over the plane! They even wouldn't spare a 9 year old and were happy to split him with his dad or mum! At one point during the flight, my wife came over to ask me what I wanted to eat, and an air hostess ordered her to return to her seat. The level of disrespect was appalling. This airline doesn’t provide complimentary meals on transatlantic flights. We had to purchase everything, including water, which cost us $6 for a 500 ml bottle! The meal we ordered was nothing more than a disgusting pot of noodles, likely costing them less than a pound. They don’t provide free earphones, blankets or drinks. The seats are the most uncomfortable I’ve ever encountered. Every time someone walks past, you’re jolted awake by a nudge, and if a larger person walks by, brace yourself for a bruising. I was constantly elbowed by air hostesses. Overall, flying with Norse was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy. Do yourself a favour—pay a few hundred pounds more and fly with a real airline.

### “cannot believe the treatment we received.”
Not Verified | My review is for Norse Atlantic Airways at Berlin airport. Was charged $155 for two backpacks because they said they were not personal items when other people were clearly going on with backpacks right next to me and not paying for them. Major equity issues and inconsistencies, which will eventually get them into trouble. My family of five cannot believe the treatment we received.

### "It's no-frills airline"
Not Verified |  I fly a lot and this was first time on Norse. Worst experience ever for long haul flight. The seat had metal part right across it on the lower back part - couldn't believe it. Had to refuse to sit there and ask for a different seat. It's no-frills airline and only thing you can get free is tap water. Earphones, blanket, everything else you need to pay for separately. Bag check in policy is quite unclear too and designed to extract extra money also. Avoid.

### "luggage heavily damaged
Both luggage pieces were heavily damaged when claimed back and I looked for their service desk according to the process described in the Norse Atlantic website. There the damaged luggage was supposed to be inspected in order to be reimbursed. However, noone appeared in their desks for more than 1 hour and finally I left. When contacted them through email they initially responded to collect my complaint and then never responded again. Although I knew that nothing is provided on board, I expected at least some water. Better get another airline more expensive for your transatlantic flight. You will end up saving more money and spare the frustration.

### "bag cost 85 to be a carry on"
I hate this airline. You think your getting a reasonable flight price and then they are so greedy making a bag cost 85 to be a carry on. I really recommend using another airline.

### "will never fly Norse again"
Not Verified | Terrible experience with the 6 bag classification, charging individual triple the price during check in despite seeing incorrect sizes may have been selected. I will never fly Norse again despite the flight attendants being courteous and understanding. I was also place in front of two children who kicked my seat for 8 hours and my husband and I could not be moved.

### "weighed our carry on bags"
I just had the worst experience (and my first experience) checking in at Norse Airlines. We paid extra to carry on four bags, and upon arrival, the attendant told us our bags were seven pounds too heavy. They weighed our carry on bags. They said we had to check them, but would not credit us for the carryon bags- they wanted $85 a bag. We tried to move seven pounds from one bag to another, and they told us if we wanted to do that, we would have to wait in the hour long line again! Horrible horrible service, I will never fly this airline again

### “cabin was very cold”
Not Verified | No water on board, you have to purchase it, cabin was very cold, not possible to check - in online, long queues to check in counter, although I have to admit they're cheap.

### “Norse were the best by far”
I have flown the Atlantic six times in the last few weeks and I must say Norse were the best by far, you wont find a better value for money Airline and if your lucky enough to afford Premium Economy its way better than all the competition, you also get to board first and leave the aircraft first and that means shorter lines at immigration, a real plus.

### Norse Atlantic Airways customer review
Not Verified |   This has to be the worse experience I have ever experienced. The airline does not offer any online check in therefore you sit in a “check in” line for multiple hours to be rudely greeted by a desk agent. Their baggage policies are out of this world and designed to drain money out of you. For an international flight they did not offer free water or a snack.

### "a great flight with Norse"
Not Verified |   We had a great flight with Norse, from NYC to Rome. We booked late for our first ever Europe trip, so we didn't want to buy expensive tickets. We took a risk going with Norse, since it's cheap, about $250 one way. We were nervous, seeing all the bad reviews especially with cancellations. Turned out to be an awesome experience, on time, no turbulence. We had a amazing family lifetime trip to Europe. I highly recommend Norse.

### "Would definitely recommend"
Not Verified |   
The crew and service were very good on my flight on Friday July.12.24 , ground crew also very good. The PE product was better than BA , Virgin , United etc . Flight was on time other than slight delay on arrival due to gate congestion. Would definitely recommend.

### "check in my carry-on for 130 USD"
We flew in from Gatwick had no issues at all. in Orlando it was a whole other story, they have someone chase you about the size of your personal item. I'd travelled all over with my rucksack as a personal item, fits under the seat just fine but then it was considered too big to be a personal item. They treated my backpack as a carry on and had me check in my carry-on for 130 USD. All of that while being rude and condescending. Not to mention the flight was delayed for over an hour while it was on the tarmac (they wouldn't let us board) Honestly never flying with them /recommending them ever again!

### "terrible corporate policies"
There were no notifications or online check in ahead of flight. Service at the desk was slow as they forced almost everyone in line to pay extra (approximately $80 USD each) to bring onboard anything larger than a purse, including standard backpacks. This policy was not made clear in advance. Additionally, they did not charge us for our LAX to OSL flight, but they did charge us on the return. Must pay extra or be assigned random seats, which may be apart from others in the same party. Not made clear in advance. No food or drinks provided for a 10 hour flight (including water). Meals were only available for pre-purchase, which was not made clear in advance. No pillows, blankets, earbuds, etc for flight. Flight attendants and gate agents were polite and courteous but had clearly been put in an uncomfortable position by their terrible corporate policies.

### "worst airline I’ve ever used"
The worst airline I’ve ever used. Zero customer service. Bad attitude. Impossible to talk to anyone. Their robot chat line is a waste of time and effort. They just don’t care. The prices are ok but it is worth paying a little bit more and using an airline that actually cares for its customers rather than Norse. The hand luggage allowance is a complete joke. Couldn’t even check-in ahead of the flight. Nothing good to say about this airline.

### "buy blanket pillow and headphones"
Not Verified |   I booked a 3k US dollar ticket with my 2 kids to fly from LA to London Gatwick and from here it began. A day before the flight I discovered that there is no web check in for Norse may be i should have inquired before but seems like this is the basic thing every airline provides. Secondly after airport check in and security when i entered the flight could not see any pillow or blanket on our seats, I thought may be later they will distribute. After half an hour my daughter just checked the screen options available and told me you have to buy blanket pillow and headphones. I was happy i booked the meal before as we are vegetarian and yes if you want to have a second meal you have to pay extra but this was mentioned while booking the ticket so its fine. The meal arrived and by looking at it I thought its a kids meal or a starter maybe before actual meal but seems like it was same for all three of us - very little quantity of noodles with a sprinkle of veg - 6 pieces of fruit 2 grapes 2 chunks of watermelon and 2 chunks of pineapple and a small bun with butter. I provided my kids with extra food i was carrying. I have booked my return flight with them now no option to change so will carry everything on my return flight.

### "entertainment system didn’t work"
I was nervous about having to take discount airline Norse Airways especially transatlantic, but I didn’t realize it would be this bad. It was an omen when I discovered they didn’t even have an app. Their mobile web browser indicated that they needed my address but a bug wouldn’t let me enter it. Luckily I had an iPad on which that worked. When I then wondered why I couldn’t check in 24 hours ahead of time and there was no online check in, something they of course never bothered to tell me. The check in counters were open 4 hours ahead of departure, and seeing as they shamelessly expected you to pay $45 even for a middle seat I figured I might as well be comfortable in premium economy getting to the airport early. Although the seats were decent their entertainment was via the built in arm rest method meaning you couldn’t watch anything until at cruising altitude and had to stop on approach. The icing on the shambolic penny pinching cake was when the entertainment system didn’t work plane wide. It’s been 12 years since I’ve been on a plane without a working entertainment system. The pilot even had the gall to say that on the bright side the online duty free store was working.

### “the next level cheap airline”
Not Verified | This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. They don’t provide anything. They put AC on the plane so LOW that you are forced to buy their blanket. Not even water was provided on 10 hour flight. You have to buy it. In Los Angeles, they did not charge us for the bags, but in London for the same bag they charges 136 pounds for 2 bags. This is the next level cheap airline do not ever buy it, unless you wanna spend double amount on all extras that are not included.

### "lost our checked luggage"
Not Verified |   Norse lost our checked luggage. After 5 days, they found it. The reimbursement they offered us was 3 pounds. We had to buy all new toiletries, some clothing, and other necessities. None of it was covered by the airline.

### "close check-in one hour before"
This is a horrible airline. Yes it is "budget" but their practice of the physical boarding pass is outdated. They close check-in one hour before departure. They will not accommodate you with anything including a discount for the flight the next day. All customer service will talk about is contact your flight insurance. If I had flight insurance I'd be on a different airline. Of course no phone line, so it's easier to say no. 366$ down the drain. I should have just gone British airways or delta and not worried about paying extra for everything.

### “no support from their employees”
Not Verified | This was my first experience flying over to Europe, although not my first time in Europe and this has been the worse experience I’ve ever had flying period!! First I get to the Airport 4 hours early, I start checking in & no one informs me that my flight has been delayed over an hour. Because of them I missed my plane to Spain. On my way back from Spain go figure easy jet is late. I miss the gate the check in by 15 minutes & the employee just says you missed your flight & walks off. No options, no help trying to find another flight. I had to wait 30 minutes before I saw another employee & asked if there is any other flight I could be put on. She exclaims no—but doesn’t bother to look for any thing that would be helpful. Aldo she informed me that Norse is not responsible for any missed flights as long as they are not more than 3 hours late. I’m still sitting in the airport & had to pay over a thousand dollars in total for a flight back to the United States. After I make it home I will never fly Norse again!! I do not understand how their indiscretion costs me money & there is no leeway if we have an indiscretion. There was no support from their employees, nothing. At least with Easy Jet they did their best to help me find another flight to Palma. I felt they at least cared. Norse is garbage & I will continue leaving reviews everywhere I can so that others know to stay away! !

### “Service was excellent”
Not Verified |  I flew their Premium cabin which is located in the front of the aircraft. Flight left on time and Premium passengers get priority check-in. Comfortable, wide seats with leg rests which recline 3/4 of the way back with excellent leg room. Service was excellent. Very good food—two meals were served on the 10-1/2 hour flight with frequent beverage service in between. Entertainment was decent and the plane was very clean. Very reasonable fares, lower than most premium economy fares on other airlines and the seating is superior. I would highly recommend.

### “Stay clear”
Not Verified | Norse's online booking form broke down multiple times while I tried to book. Finally I managed to book and got a single confirmation. A few days later they charged me twice and are now refusing to refund even though their booking system had issues. Stay clear.

### "both times were fantastic"
Not Verified |   Love it, we did New York-Oslo and Oslo-New York, both times were fantastic. Flight attendants that speaks more than two languages, Spanish in my case, was easy for me to communicate also I like that fact they knew my kid's name went they serve their food! There was a Venezuelan flight attendant he was super nice on our first flight, and Xavier on our second flight! Great fly, my food was gluten-free, was ok, the flight was I believe 7 hrs and the airplane space is better than others!

### "tried to fly Norse Norse Atlantic yesterday"
Not Verified |   We just tried to fly Norse Norse Atlantic yesterday out of LAX and had the worst travel experience ever! From the start, the check-in process was slow, they don't provide luggage tags, nickel-and-dime you for everything and have horrible customer service. We arrived in plenty of time to catch our flight and missed it, due to the fact that they never communicated that the shuttle service would take 40 minutes to get to our gate and they will automatically take your bags off the flight if you aren't there (even if you're in transit) exactly 20 minutes before they take off. If you have any complaints, they tell you to "email" customer service and all employees (even supervisors) claim they can't do anything to help you, nor will they provide you their names. It has been 20 hours and we still haven't heard from customer service regarding our re-booking our our flight. I am still dumbfounded that an airline service can operate with this type of model. I feel bad for all of the families like ours, that may be in the same situation!

### “absolutely no customer service”
Flying Norse Atlantic was a horrible experience. I fly frequently and wanted to give them a try. Norse Atlantic has NO PHONE NUMBER, thus absolutely no customer service. On my flight from LAX to Paris for a wedding, they lost my luggage. There was nobody to talk to and they never responded to numerous emails. The bag arrived 2 days later and was ransacked. No communication with the airlines at all. Communication and customer service are very important. This was a huge disappointment.

### “Awful from the very first minute”
Awful from the very first minute I set foot on the airport. The customer service at the desk was awful. The customer service at the gate was even worse. The pilot slammed on the breaks at the time of takeoff and aborted it to the horror of passengers and crew and then it took him 5 minutes to explain why he did that. We remained seated for one hour without A/C until he let us know that they found the problem and it was fixed. We attempted to takeoff a second time and he slammed on the breaks even harder a second time aborting take off again. It took us another 30 minutes to deplane to a deserted airport with no Norse Atlantic service reps available. After another 30 minutes an agent came to the desk just to inform us that we would be getting information via email. The only compensation offered was a hotel room but no rerouting or offer of another flight.

### "experience was extremely disappointing"
My recent flight experience from London to Los Angeles, throughout the 12-hour journey, I encountered several issues that significantly impacted my comfort and overall experience. I was informed that even a glass of water would incur an additional charge. Due to swelling in my feet, I temporarily moved to an empty chair with more space. However, I was approached by a flight attendant who demanded an additional $50 for the seat. Overall, the experience was extremely disappointing, and I ended up paying significantly more than anticipated. I strongly advise against purchasing tickets from Norse Airlines to avoid such issues in the future.

### “wouldn’t even give us compensation”
Not Verified |  Firstly our flight got cancelled, and then they couldn’t get us a flight back AND they wouldn’t even give us compensation. Secondly, if we wanted to get a flight back we had to buy another ticket? The customer service was so awful they kept cutting off the call and there was no one we could speak to directly and had to email instead. Never flying with them again.

### "The WORST customer service"
Not Verified | The WORST customer service we have ever received. Our flight got moved 7 hours earlier without any email. We found out ourselves when we went to check luggage online. They wouldn’t then let us change our flight and the emails they were sending were blunt and some of them were even ignored. There is no contact number so you can’t talk to anyone directly. When speaking to the staff at the airport, they even said they couldn’t speak to anyone directly, only through email. When we got to the airport our luggage was 0.5kg over so instead of just letting us take out 1 item quickly, they sent us to the back of the whole line. Will never be flying with this airline again and will be sure to pass this on to whoever we know is.

### "Nickel and Diming Fees"
Poor Customer Service, Double Billing and No Refund. Because of a glitch in their online ordering system, I was billed twice and a month later still don't have a refund. They don't have any support - no answers on emails, no phone. Their chatbot is a joke. With any problem, you're on your own. Nickel and Diming Fees. They will hunt for every extra inch and pound to force you to check your luggage and pay $130 for each bag. They even charge a foreign transaction fee in the US, despite having an office in Florida. The plane was new and the cabin crew is professional. Adding all the fees and the nerve-wracking situation when you have a problem with charges, flights, or luggage with no support available, you have to decide if it's worth it.

### "utterly disappointing experience"
My recent experience with Norse Airlines was deeply disappointing and marred by poor customer service and exorbitant fees. Traveling from JFK to Gatwick plus the return flight I encountered numerous issues that made this journey one of the worst I have ever experienced, especially given the stressful circumstances of attending my mother’s funeral. First and foremost, the carry-on baggage policy was appalling. Despite trying to check in online (it’s not available) and noting the carry on bag fees of $80, we were shocked to be charged $130 per carry-on at the airport since our carry on bags exceeded the 22lbs limit, ours were 23, 24 and 29lbs. First we were forced to place our bags (which are officially sized carry on suitcases) in the metal sizing machine, which crushed them and scratched them pretty badly, only to be told they all exceeded the 22-pound weight limit. This resulted in an additional cost of nearly $400 to check our carry-ons—bags that we have carried on multiple international flights without issue. To add insult to injury, there was plenty of overhead space on the plane, making the forced baggage check feel like a blatant money grab, since the weight is the weight whether in the overhead or in the cargo hold. Moreover, the seat selection fees were another expense. We ended up paying an extra $60-$100 per seat to ensure our family could sit together. When tallying these costs and the ridiculous carry-on charges, our savings compared to other  airlines dwindled to just a few hundred dollars. The in-flight experience did nothing to redeem the initial frustrations. My onboard food was inedible, including the vegetarian option. This only added to our dissatisfaction and discomfort during the flight. Overall, this journey with Norse Airlines was a nightmare from start to finish. From the extortionate baggage fees and poor customer service (at the airports) to the subpar in-flight experience, it was a far cry from the smooth travel experience we had hoped for. Given the additional wait times at both JFK and Gatwick at baggage claim, along with the cumulative extra costs, I honestly regret not choosing another airline. This was an utterly disappointing experience during an already distressing time in my life, and one I will never forget.

### "All in all a nice flight"
I used Norse Atlantic Airways to travel from Rome, Italy to New York. Check-in was smooth. The boarding was uneventful. Went straight to my seat as I was one of the last to board. Seat was comfortable. I ordered a meal from the meal service in advance. It arrived hot but was nothing special. The flight was around nine and a half hours. I watched a few movies. All in all a nice flight.

### "never fly with Norse again"
$78.00 for one carry-on luggage. Meals were awful, small box with 3 ounces of overcooked chicken. I'll never fly with Norse again. We had to walk forever to the check in, employees were rude.

### "Norse ruined my vacation"
My luggage was lost and the company made no attempt to look for it at all. It's good that I wrote to the airport in Berlin, thanks to them I found out where my luggage was. Very limited contact with the airline. After a week, the luggage arrived in Miami - but I received no information where I could pick it up. I spent 5 hours at the airport and no one was able to give me any information. I wrote to all available emails - no response. After 5 hours of running around the airport, I managed to find their point, I picked up my suitcase, which was  damaged - I bought a new one before leaving. The service lady said she would take care of reporting the matter, but when I returned it turned out that I had to report it again. I didn't have luggage for 9 days, I had to buy clothes, cosmetics, shoes.... I spent almost $400. Today I received a reply from the company that they will grant me compensation of 16.97? It's ridiculous and sad to suggest such an amount! On the way back I was charged excess baggage for $120. I had to buy things for the whole week. I wanted to leave them, but the staff wouldn't let me. Norse ruined my vacation! I have never experienced worse service on any airline, and I fly a lot.

### "ridiculous fees for carry on"
Not Verified |   We fly Allegiant all of the time so we are accustomed to budget airlines. However, this airline charges ridiculous fees for carry on bags after claiming you get 2 free bags. You don't! You get 1 checked and they will charge you $100 for an additional bag. Service was terrible. 9 hours without free water. Ordered bottled water and flight attendant too busy on their phone to deliver. Took over an hour to get water.

### "We are very disillusioned"
Not Verified |   We were cheerleaders for Norse Atlantic until now. Flying out of LAX was a nightmare. The saltiness is in a new terminal with no airline lounge. So we went to a restaurant to wait. At checking we’re told that although we checked in really with bags, our bags were not included. $260 later, they included the bags they erased. We had to board a bus to get to the plane. We sat in two unmarked seats only to find out the seats were only for wheelchair clients. We are forced out of the seat to accommodate two people, younger and healthier than us,. We are in our 70’s. We are very disillusioned. We used to fly out of DC, but they cut that route. We’re stuck with the lesser airports.

### "The service was terrible"
Not Verified |   This was the worst flight I have ever taken. We purchased an upgrade at an additional 6000 kr in hopes that we would have free drinks and snacks, good seats that were comfortable and large and excellent service. The service was terrible. The flight meals were less than lacking. Tasteless and doughy. The staff was not interested in offering any extras and the lights went off as soon as we took off. After 8 hours of flying, I ordered two sprites for my companion and I. After 20 minutes no one showed up. My companion than verbally expressed to staff that we wanted two sprites, they than expressed it was too late to order and that the drink cart was locked. We received no compensation for the delay of 6 hours due to bad weather. I will never fly with Norse Atlantic again. My parents flew back with us and we had to put my mother’s purse in my backpack because they said that would be an additional cost to her for carry on. A woman’s purse?? When is that additional?? They will also never be flying with Norse again. I am outraged over the lack of service and cost of our flight. Total was 24000 kr to Miami and back to oslo for two people . The upgrade was totally unnecessary and overpriced with no additional bonuses.

### "don’t recommend this airline"
They are advertising cheap tickets, but you end up paying extra for everything. Carry on baggage, food, drink, blanket etc. At the end I ended up paying more then ever. I don’t recommend this airline. I will never use them again.

### "Can't fault them"
Not Verified |   You can tell a lot by some of these reviews where people clearly have not read anything before buying a ticket. Got me and my husband to Boston return for £500 total. You don't get anything on board if you buy the cheapest ticket but it says this when you make a booking. The planes are new, the staff super friendly and the value amazing. Can buy most things on board and all seats have screens. Not as bad as some of the people in here are saying, but then again it seems like none of them actually bother to read anything when they buy a ticket. Even buying meals on board still offsets the price of legacy airlines. Can't fault them at all, except for the seats, which are thin - but to be expected!

### "they don't offer food"
Basically you are enticed in by a cheap ticket , you then realise that they don't offer food (almost 9 hours flight) and either have to buy a tiny meal from them for $30 or buy food before to take on. They also charge pretty much for any baggage at an eye watering amount ($85 or $130), staff are pretty rude too and not helpful at all. Ffirst and last time I'll make the mistake of flying with them.

### "my review is never again"
Not Verified | Flew from Gatwick to Orlando, thought it was a good deal until I boarded the plane, seat was so cramped so I went and sat on an empty seat. Was surrounded by air stewards, you cannot sit there unless you pay $50 fair enough, payment had to be made straight away. Anyway this flight is not good - $48 for 6 miniature beers for me and my family. If you do fly with them take your own food and drinks, earphones, blanket, everything essentials as they charge and it’s not a good or fair price. Toilets were disgusting worse I’ve ever witnessed, Boeing 787 flying out different plane coming back which was even more cramped, so out with the purse again this time $79 dollars for an empty seat coming back. 2 kg over travelling out ,that’s ok as your hand luggage is only 6kg, (perfect). Coming home 3 kg over, get your purse out again $54. So my review is never again, don’t think that it’s a deal because it’s not.

### "cheap ticket isn't worth it"
I would never fly with this airline again. On the surface it looks cheap, but the economy ticket means you don't get so much as a glass of water for free. By the time you've paid for a standard cabin bag, bought enough food for an 8 hour flight, bought a cup of tea on board and paid 6 dollars for cheap earphones you may as well have flown with a better airline which provides this for free. You even have to pay for a blanket if flying overnight. The seats were also so uncomfortable I had to sit on my coat. they don't do online check in which means you have to get to the airport insanely early to stand in a queue for 2 hours just to check in. Honestly, the apparently cheap ticket isn't worth it and you'll end up spending just as much as you would with a better airline.

### "backpacks were too big"
Not Verified | I do not recommend anyone this airline. I was charged 155 euros at check-in because two of my family's three backpacks were too big. During my trip, I flew with 5 airlines and only Norse Atlantic did not fit hand luggage. There were no headphones attached to the monitors.

### "Very unfriendly staff"
I've flown with them a couple of times. Very unfriendly staff and stressful experience. The seats are very uncomfortable. If you can go with another airline I would recommend that.

### "Appalling services"
Not Verified |  My baggage was lost in a direct flight from LA to London. Zero interest to inform as to whereabouts, no response to the emails, issue still not resolved and I have no idea or information about my baggage. They have given me a reference code which is invalid to track my baggage. When I emailed them to compensate me for my lost items and baggage I received no answer. Worst company ever. Avoid at all costs. And we paid almost £2000 for the tickets, that includes no meal and not even headphones which they charge you £6 for. Appalling services.

### "the best crew I ever seen"
Not Verified |  This company has the best crew I ever seen. The on-board staff are taking care of themselves. I have rarely seen a company with such friendly and attentive staff. The flight from Miami to Paris on January 29, 2024.

### “Zero comfort in flight”
La peggiore compagnia con cui abbia mai volato. Riprogrammato il volo di rientro due volte, anticipandolo di due giorni. Zero confort in volo, tutte le aggiunte sono a pagamento e con prezzi ESORBITANTI. Dopo quasi 11 ore di volo senza coperte, poggia testa e senza un bicchiere d'acqua, le hostess poco prima dell'arrivo hanno lasciato due merendine sui sedili... probabilmente perché in scadenza. Non credo sceglierò più questa compagnia. -  The worst company I have ever flown with. The return flight was rescheduled twice, bringing it forward by two days. Zero comfort in flight, all additions are paid and at EXORBITANT prices. After almost 11 hours of flight without blankets, head rests and without a glass of water, the stewardesses left two snacks on the seats shortly before arrival... probably because they were expiring. I don't think I will choose this company again.

### “I'd rather swim the Atlantic”
Not Verified | I'd rather swim the whole Atlantic than fly Norse Atlantic Airways! Like every passenger, we took the tickets because of the low prices and then paid extra for what we needed. We took a one-way flight - thankfully - from Orlando to London, and as extra services we clearly knew we needed a 23 kg- bag and two carry ons for which we paid quite a bit, online. We arrived at the airport, and unlike other airlines where you check in online, you don't have this option with Norse. You have to go to the check-in desk instead, whether you have a checked baggage or not. You get there and before you go to the check-in counter one or two employees check each bag, whether it's carry-on or a bag with a Disney World Orlando souvenir, the bag has to be put in a box and approved by some employees who probably hate their job so much that they become rude and absurd. In our situation, there was a young lady who couldn't decide whether a backpack was bigger or smaller than the requirements given, you just have to put it in a box in a very specific way. Later, when the employee is malicious, you discover that the backpack that meets all the requirements does not fit. Why? Because she says so! We've been traveling around the world for almost 8 years and this is the first time I've encountered such a rude staff and such policies. To have your backpack in that box, be even smaller than the box and be told it doesn't fit is something I have never encountered! Afterwards, at the check-in desk your luggage is weighed. Apparently, our luggage was over the limit, and there are huge fees for oversized luggage. The next day we were shocked to find out that our checked baggage was not 23kg, but only 20kg (basically, the next day we flew from London to Milan with British Airways, and our very same baggage became 3kg lighter overnight). It was the same with the smaller bags. After you get your ticket, and your luggage has been checked twice, you figure that boarding will be quick and you won't have to go through the same discussions and checks. Well, you're wrong! Because you arrive at the boarding gate where there are three employees just checking your bags, again! And if you've been shopping in Duty Free shops and have an extra duty free bag, good luck! You'll have to put it in your luggage or explain what's in the bag and why! Our experience with Norse Atlantic Airways was definitely our first and last and it was the worst one! I wish I had read the reviews before buying the tickets because everything written is true! Poor quality service, unfriendly staff focused on making you pay more fees, on the plane you don't even get a glass of water or headphones (a pair of headphones costs $6). And if somehow you want to buy a ticket, it might be cheap, but it will cost you more later. And as a conclusion, I'd rather swim the whole Atlantic than fly Norse Atlantic Airways. And I don't even know how to swim! PS. We had a luggage tag and they removed it without our consent.

### "no food, given no blanket"
Not Verified |  Long flight around 11 hours. You need to purchase headphones, no food, given no blanket. Everything you can buy, enormous big prices, for example headphones 6 euro piece. The staff are rude.

### “they are fueled by greed”
I have flown them 4 times, the last 2 times were nightmares, they resold my premium seat from me which was purchased MONTHS in advance, I get to the airport and they made me wait hours to find a solution because they are fueled by greed, cannot be trusted and will double dip to try to get more money at your expense. I contacted support about this 4 times with 0 response.

### “Huge problems to fix in customer service”
Not Verified | Disgraceful airline who take advantage of their customers, avoid at all costs. January 5th 2024 for the 10:00am flight to Miami met with rude customer service representative at Gatwick airport on who forces you to pay 67 pounds for a regular light carry-on bag under 10kg which has never been a problem on any other airline, to rub salt into the wound the representative smirks and makes faces at you avoiding answering any of your questions and rudely picks up her mobile phone to make calls whilst totally ignoring the customer in front of her. Shockingly, no food or beverage is offered on the 9 hour 30 minute flight (only paid menu food) like on other long distance economy flights and not once do the cabin crew even offer passengers water. Only positives found were that the seats were not too uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment options are descent. Huge problems to fix in customer service.

### "The crew was friendly"
Everything went according to plan. The crew was friendly. The plane was not fully booked, so I had a full row at my disposal and could sleep lying down in between. I had read the reviews after I booked, so I was afraid it would be a bad experience. So that certainly didn't happen.

### “I too had my flight cancelled”
Similar to others experiences, I too had my flight cancelled and the only options available were to accept the flight that was 1 day earlier than booked, or get a refund. Due to circumstances, leaving a day early was not an option. I would have preferred other options (such as other dates, or even cities) but there was no reasonable means to get in touch, as others have also experienced. Extremely disappointed as I had scored a great deal, and now have to spend double the amount on flights that take longer. I really wish it had worked out, but buyer beware.

### “Seats were uncomfortable”
Not Verified | Seats were uncomfortable, pillows and blankets were not provided (available free of charge traveling in a comparable class from every other airline). Meals were an additional charge as well.

### "carry-on was charged for $130"
I understand that this a low-cost airline. I've flown with low-cost airlines across Europe and I've never experienced any problems. This is my first low-cost Transatlantic flight, and I was unfortunate enough to have chosen Norse Atlantic Airways. I read all of the baggage requirements. I had my personal item handbag, and I was prepared to pay extra for my carry-on since my ticket only included the personal item bag. Everything cool, until I get to the counter at Miami Airport, and the person there contributed mostly herself to my worst experience with an airline. My personal item handbag would fit in the measurement samples that they had, but she was decided that, apparently, my bag didn't fit. I was charged $85 for my personal item handbag that now turned into a "carry-on" thanks, and my carry-on was charged for $130, and I couldn't take it with my on board. They told me that they had a full flight and there was no space for me to have my bag and my carry-on with me on the plane. I get to the plane, and I saw at least 10  available seats, so there  was space for both my items. I had a connecting flight in London towards Barcelona, and I almost missed my flight because the staff made me check my carry-on as big baggage. Unfortunately, I still have to return to Miami with Norse, but this is the first and last time I choose this airline.

### "the lack of customer support "
I used to use Norwegian before they ceased operations and I never had 1 issue in the 15 return flights between LGW-LAX. Fast forward to 2023 and I decided to surprise my family over xmas so I booked a return flight for 23-30 December. First problem was the website, its quite laggy and unresponsive at times and the first booking went through with relative ease until I noticed the 3rd passenger wasn't included on the list. So I immediately cancelled and then nothing for 2 days,opened up a support ticket, ended up getting a reply to that eventually on the 23nd. The only way to get a quickish response is to email and within 2 days of emailing they initiated a cancellation and the money was back in my account after 6 days. The next booking was easier but because I now 2 weeks nearer to departure the flight costs increased $200 pp. I eventually got the coach with checked luggage (which came with a bump in price) So the day of departure we arrived at LAX in good time, 3 hours before take off. \the queue for check in was very very long, as there is no digital check in or anything remotely modern. We eventually spent close to 2 hours checking in and once through TSA around 15 mins we got the bus to the poor part of the airport and we made boarding with 10 minutes to spare. Flight was ok, cabin crew were polite and friendly and it was a flight in coach so I wasn't disappointed or surprised. Waiting for baggage at LGW and we had 1 big checked case and 2 smaller cases, after catching the carousel for 45 minutes we realised our case was missing, the big one, the one with all my wife's clothes and Christmas presents. I eventually found the Norse baggage desk (no one there) and a note on the desk telling you to fill out 2 forms for "delayed" luggage. If anytime anyone has been there you'll know that this part of arrivals where Norse is there are at 50 suitcases from all over the World and whilst there 2 more people joined me to fill out forms and I ended up helping one guy whose English wasn't first language. As all of you know Norse don't really have a phone number and after several emails a norse rep gave us a list of numbers, all were out of service. So its now xmas day, we have no clothes, no gifts and no idea where our case is. I'm going to buy airtags for the return journey to make sure our cases actually get loaded onto the plane but yeah, although these are old Norwegian planes repainted thats where the similarities end. I understand that airlines lose baggage all the time but it's the lack of customer support that's frustrating and for that reason and the check in fiasco, this will be my first and last trip using Norse, and if I'm honest they don't deserve to be in business carrying passengers, they are better off doing freight.

### "pay more and more for baggage"
Not Verified |  Worst company I could have taken, catastrophic service with compulsory registration on site, we wait more than an hour while this manipulation can be done online (as all companies do) but at Norse we apply the model Ryanair to make you pay more and more for baggage. No meals and limited service. Except for the plane which is new, it's not even worth a star and this type of company should only be authorized to do regional flights! I was loaded on the way back while on the way out I was able to travel without having to take cabin baggage. This policy needs to be reviewed, we are on a long haul, wake up! Your prices are low at first glance but when you add the hidden costs, you are more expensive than traditional companies which have the merit of delivering a real service and classic economy packages. Pire compagnie que j’ai pu prendre, un service catastrophique avec un enregistrement obligatoire sur place, on attend plus d’une heure alors que cette manipulation peut se faire en ligne (comme le font toutes les compagnies) mais chez Norse on applique le modèle Ryanair pour vous faire payer toujours plus de bagages. Pas de repas et un service limité. Excepté l’avion qui est neuf ça vaut même pas une étoile et ce type de compagnie devrait être autorisée uniquement à faire du vol régional ! On m’a chargé au retour alors qu’à l’aller j’ai pu voyager sans devoir prendre de bagage cabine. Là politique est à revoir, on est sur du long courrier, réveillez vous ! Vos prix sont bas au premier abord mais quand on ajoute les coûts cachés, vous êtes plus cher que les compagnies classiques qui ont le mérite de délivrer un vrai service et des packages en economy classic.

### “cancelled a lot of scheduled flights”
They cancelled a lot of scheduled flights and randomly changed both legs of my return flight to something that doesn't work for me, and didn't even give me options! Those new flights don't work for me because I have connection flights and an onward journey which were already booked. I tried to contact their customer service, but apparently they DO NOT HAVE A PHONE LINE, and I got no reply to my emails. And if you want to submit a support ticket, you have to log in to their website. Guess what, the log in doesn't work! It keeps throwing me error messages when I tried to login, when I tried to change password, when I tried to register a new account. Basically nothing works!! And when I reported this login issue with them, they basically told me that I don't need to login to view my ticket! That was their answer! I still don't have a solution to my flight connection issue. DO NOT BOOK NORSE! You might be fine if everything works smoothly but just seeing how many people have had issues with them, that's a HUGE RISK to take on! I don't know how a business like this is allowed to run!

### "moved our flight to a day later"
Awful experience and customer service. Norse has moved our flight to a day later without any notification. We found out when we tried to check in for the flight. Then we emailed them and they said they did not hear from us after they notified us so they cannot do anything about it per their policy. Once I asked them to send confirmation or screenshot of the email notification, they never responded. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight and had to pay for another one. This was my worst experience with an airline so far. No notification about flight change via email or phone and no empathy whatsoever. The only way you can find out about a flight change is if you log into the website daily.

### "was expecting a little bit more"
Too bad one cannot do online check  in and has to go to the counter at the airport to get the boarding pass. Very nice flight attendants. I can only praise them. Both flights (LGW to LAX and return) left on time and both arrived more than half an hour early. Compared to Norwegian, food quality was about the same (satisfactory to good). But in-flight entertainment was deceiving: there was no map or info about where we were, except altitude, outside temperature, and ETA. This was frustrating since this is what I like most to watch. One could see also that the ex-Norwegian 787s need some maintenance regarding the seats: the screen was difficult to deploy from the armrest with a lot of squeaking and was not adjustable to a good horizontal position. The lavatories were perfectly clean. So the aisles. I would have given an 8/10 for the overall rating if I had traveled in economy class but was expecting a little bit more in premium economy,

### "changed the flight to 3 days earlier"
Not Verified |  I made a reservation months in advance. 3 weeks before my flight I was emailed that the time of my flight had changed. However, instead of a change of a few minutes, they had changed the flight to 3 days earlier. I could either accept the change or cancel the flight. I cancelled but finding a flight at that late a date was challenging and I had to pay double what I originally paid. Beware of Norse Airlines!

### "we missed our connection"
The flight was delayed by approximately 5 hours or more which meant that subsequently we missed our connection. This led to an overnight stay in JFK. Norse shunned any responsibility did not offer to refund the flights under the EU rule or to cover any costs despite frequent attempts to contact customer service and claims. The airline took additional money from our bank accounts for onboard purchases. When contacted in regards to this they just gave an email and said it’s a separate company. A disgusting airline that takes no responsibility for its duty to its customers. Unless you wish to experience this I strongly advise avoiding them.

### “great service”
Great experience, great service, very comfortable seats. Cabin staff made many runs asking if the pax needed drinks etc. much more attentive than PE on mainline airlines. Many complaints about low cost airlines come from people not reading the bag rules or expecting mainline style service if something goes wrong, it is a risk one takes when flying with them, if they cancel a flight, don’t expect them to rebook you on the same day, specially if they don’t fly that route every day.

### “they have stopped communicating with me”
In July 2023, we booked premium flights to Barbados with Norse. The flights were scheduled to land at 3pm and we had connecting flights to our end destination at 6:30pm. We usually fly Virgin or BA but I saw the opportunity to fly premium at about the same price as economy on Virgin. It was only after booking did we start to hear the horror stories. Norse then changed our landing time in Barbados from 3 to 5:30 so that it would be impossible to catch a connecting flight. I spoke to Norse and they agreed to change our flight from 14th to the 13th so we had to book a hotel in Barbados. Today, I received an email from Norse saying that they had once again changed our flights back to the 14th from the 13th. So now, we were back in the same dilemma; missing our connecting flight and with a hotel in Barbados that we could not use. I tried speaking to Norse about this but they have now stopped communicating with me. This holiday was very important to us so we have now booked another flight with Virgin. Norse has cost us thousands of pounds for nothing. There are so many people saying they have had the same experience that I do not think this airline will survive the winter. Norse, Winter is coming!

### "stuck paying twice for baggage"
I paid USD80 for hand baggage but when it did not the requirements, Norse then proceeded to charge me additional USD135 to have it checked in. When I asked for a refund on the hand baggage Norse pointed to their so-called "policy" stating that they cannot refund anything and I will be will stuck paying twice for baggage. If you don't want to get ripped off  stay away from this airline.

### "Staff lovely, friendly and helpful"
Not Verified |  The airplane was clean, good facilities. Food was nice. Staff lovely, friendly and helpful. No window shades but tinted windows in this model craft, they were easy to use and blocked out most of the light.

### "customer service was terrible"
Not Verified |  Paid for window seat, but no window at 38a. Asked crew 3 times to change seat and there was a lot available. I am afraid of flying, but helps to look out. I was forgotten all 3 times, many others changed seats. They apologized on arrival and told me to contact customer service for pay back or upgrade on next flight. Answer from customer service: we can't do anything, it is your fault, you should have known there was no window at 38 a. Direct flight is good, but for me customer service was terrible onboard along with support service.

### "fantastic crew"
Not Verified | That was my first time on Norse Atlantic, I did not have any expectations. Basic fare, Basic seat, no food etc. Instead thanks to the fantastic crew, I had the best flight experience. I got moved to a window seat after I requested one, and I was treated like I was flying Business class! I hope to meet these great professionals and fly Norse again soon.

### "wanted $120 per person to select seats"
On booking the flights we selected our seats, but just before we left Norse said we hadn't and wanted $120 per person to select seats. Of the three of us, two paid it. I wouldn't as I felt it was a total rip-off. Coming home from Orlando they changed the seats! Then on their booking system, it updates to the newly allocated seats. Trying to get any sense out of the inept staff at the Orlando was impossible. They were totally uninterested. To add insult to injury the plane was delayed 2.5 hours.

### "Appalling, dodgy, rude and very cheap."
Appalling, dodgy, rude and very cheap. I was utterly disappointed by my experience flying with Norse. The member of staff at the airport was extremely rude, seemed as if she hated her job and was suspicious of all customers she dealt with. When I asked to speak to someone about an issue I had had trying to check in online, she asserted herself as “the highest authority” and that nothing would get past her. She was demeaning to me and other customers. I have tried to reach out several times to Norse about this experience, they took over a month to get back to me and sent me a poorly written automated response.

### "What a rip off"
Not Verified |  I could not see a ticket ahead of time. When arriving at the airport I am told I have to buy a “carry-on-pass”, which costs $85. That price typically covers a full - on checked bag of 23kg. There is no food or drink during the 7 hour flight, yet my one way flight NYC - London costs $555. What a rip off.

### "a foul-smelling plane"
One of the worst airlines I've ever traveled with. Firstly, they rescheduled our flight by a whole day, and they were unwilling to accommodate us. Thankfully, after much insistence, I managed to book an alternative flight for a different departure date. But it is absurd that their customer service doesn't even have a phone number to call. The 8-hour flight from Los Angeles to London was on an old, worn-out, and, above all, a foul-smelling plane. Not even a complimentary glass of water in all those hours – it's a shame. They had in-flight screens, but the headphones for the plane cost $6, and so did the blanket. I've never experienced anything like it.

### "Unacceptable customer service"
Not Verified | Due to a family emergency we needed to cancel the flight, we contacted Norse to which they were initially helpful and asked us to pay an additional fee to upgrade us to enable them to cancel the flight, over 2 weeks and they have ignored our requests, taken the money and no refund has been granted even though they offered a full refund after we upgraded so now we are down the cost of the flight and the upgrade fee. Unacceptable customer service.

### "my checked suitcase was missing"
When I got to London airport my checked suitcase was missing. I told the lady working for missing baggage for Norse (in London) that I had another flight to take to Malaga, which was my final destination. She told me that my suitcase was going to be sent to Malaga whenever they found it, to my home address. I pointed out that I lived far from Malaga and that I wasn’t going to pick it up in the airport, but she reassured me that they were going to send me the suitcase to my home if they found it. In that suitcase I had great part of my belongings (my flight back home from San Francisco was from a 3 months period working in EU). On the 14th of October I had to take another flight because I was moving outside of Spain, in order to study, so I bought another suitcase and clothes to prepare everything, because my suitcase hadn’t been found. It appeared the 12th of October (two days before moving out), broken, and they made me go to the airport to pick it up because Norse didn’t work in Spain and they didn’t have a mail delivery agency, so they had lied to me. I tried to complain to them via mails, but they won’t answer. It’s been almost a month since my first complaint mail. Neither they have a phone where I can call. I don’t think they have a good client assistance, and they made me spend money on suitcase and clothes. It is frustrating when you can’t even complain directly.

### "expected a much better experience"
On my flight to Rome, one of my suitcases was destroyed by the baggage handlers. Since I did not report the damaged suitcase immediately in the middle of my Italy vacation, Norse is not taking responsibility. I have pictures of the damage suitcase which I forwarded to baggage dept but they deny responsibility. Norse has in my opinion a bidding scheme for the outgoing flight to Rome to upgrade to what they call “Premium”. Don't fall for this scheme because there is nothing premium about the experience. It is certainly not worth an additional $$$. We were expecting a near 1st class experience which it certainly was not. The entertainment was stale and very dated. (no recent movies or shows). It did not have any live programing like many US Airlines have via satellite. (Domestically we are Jet Blue frequent flyers). We were served a boxed dinner and very small bottle wine) On an 9 hour flight I would have expected more food and drinks. The company does not offer online check in so you have to wait on long lines at the airports. The company charges for everything imaginable. These miscellaneous charges quickly add up, making Norse no longer a low priced airline. On the return flight back to New York, we weren't offered an upgrade (I wouldn’t pay additional money even if it was offered). On this return flight to New York which lasted nine hours in economy, we were not offered anything to eat or drink. We even asked to order from the menu at additional cost but were told there wasn’t anything left after the pre-ordered meals were served. To have this happen on a transatlantic flight is unconscionable. Our overall experience with Norse has been very disappointing. I expected a much better experience with a Norwegian airline.

### "ensure you will be able to change your plans"
Norse Air cancelled our flight from London to LAX on 10/05/23 and rebooked us for 24 hours earlier on 10/04/23 while we were traveling in Europe. The only known reason at this time is that they were combining the two flights together because their planes were not full. We did not get enough notice to cancel our hotel for 10/04/23 in Sorrento, Italy so we had to pay for 10/04/23 even though we did not stay there. We also had to pay to change our flight from Naples to London to one day earlier. Norse rebooked us without giving us our $200 extra legroom seats (which was the main reason we flew with them) and they changed it to a nonrefundable fee on our invoice. The Norse flight attendant also charged us $210.02 for our two wines which were $21.00. They have no customer service desks at the London or European airports we flew in and out of and we have been unable to reach anybody by phone that could help us. The agents we talked to at the airport do not even work for Norse. We have sent multiple emails to their customer care department over the last 30 days and have only received one response to date, other than new ticket numbers. They agreed to give us back the $200 for the legroom seats we never received. We are still diligently reaching out to any agency we can hoping they can help us with the $189.02 we were overcharged for the wine and the $312 it cost us for hotel and air. Fortunately, EasyJet was willing to help us, as best they could, to keep our costs down for our flight changes and the Holiday Inn in London changed our room without charging us a cancellation fee. If you are thinking of using Norse Atlantic Airways please ensure you will be able to change your plans if they do this to you. Being from the U.S. where customer service means something, this was something we never expected.

### "ZERO customer service"
Horrible Airline with ZERO customer service. My flight was delayed for over 48 hours which forced me to buy a ticket a last minute from a reputable airline. Norse will NOT communicate or return my money.

### "I spent around $100 on a carry on"
I chose to fly with this airline as I was quite impressed by the low prices of their flights. Turns out this was a deceit. Regardless of how low the tickets are, you will most likely end up spending more than what you paid for the tickets just on baggage alone. I spent around $100 on a carry on and because my check in luggage was over the 23kg limit by 1kg, I paid around $200 just to check this in. $300 just on baggage was way more than the tickets themselves. Considering the Norse flight was around 7.5 hours from London to Boston, and around 6.5 hours from Boston to London, you would think to at least receive complimentary drinks or snacks on a flight this long - this was not provided by Norse. You just about get a free cup of water every 3 hours when the attendants come around. Food was absolutely ridiculously expensive, I paid around $15 on pasta which was described as “Arrabiata pasta” which ended up being a pot of instant pasta in a cup of hot water with diluted tomato sauce. I saw the odd piece of dry chilli floating around. That’s about it. It was disgusting, hard and uncooked. The burger meals were around $30, their “fries” are microwave fries, dry and tasteless. I can’t imagine willingly spending this much on disgusting food. Best thing is, on airlines like JetBlue and BA, you get meals free, complimentary snacks and drinks; sometimes including alcohol. You’re actually treated with care on the more prestigious airlines - and believe it or not, you actually end up spending less overall. Do not get deceived by Norse cheap flight prices. You will end up paying an extortionate amount just to not stay hungry or thirsty on a 7 hour flight and on baggage alone. You have to pay $6 for the old 1990’s wired Jack earphones just to watch a movie on the flight.

### "Not family friendly"
Not Verified |  Not family friendly. This is a discount airline and the flight itself was what you might expect with a discount airline. The seats were okay. I had read that the seat pitch was the same as other airlines, but it felt much less spacious than say, United. It was extremely difficult to get out of my window seat to use the restroom. If the whole row wasn't cleared out there would have been a 0% chance of me getting out, and I am a fairly small woman. My biggest complaint with the airline is their seating policy. On the website it says if you don't purchase a seat assignment, they will try to seat families together, but you should arrive to the airport early to check in. For a family of 4, purchasing seats is very expensive and by the time we purchased seats, paid for a carryon, and bought airport meals to bring on the plane, the cost would have far exceeded a ticket with a "normal" airline. So we opted to go check in at the airport as early as possible (4 hours before the flight). On the way to Gatwick I was sat with my 2 children and my husband was sat in a middle seat 4 rows away. The aisle seat next to me was open for the entire flight. They clearly sat him separately on purpose. We hadn't specifically asked to be sat together, so on the way back we arrived 4 hours early again and asked if we could please be sat together. We were given 2 seats on the same row, but on opposite sides of the plane. I checked the available seating on the web after we checked in and the entire row was still available. They again sat us separately on purpose. This was mildly annoying, but the family sat in front of me was also separated from the rest of their family, who was on the opposite side of the plane. The father had a medical emergency during the flight and everyone was scrambling trying to communicate with each other from across the plane. I'm assuming the idea of not seating families together is to convince people to buy seats next time, but I will absolutely not be taking my family on this airline again so there will be no next time.

### “the worst experience”
Not Verified | I never ever leave reviews but I want to leave this one to stop people from making the same error I did. This is the worst experience I have ever had not only in the air but maybe in my entire life. The airline might come across cheap online but they slap a $100 fee just to put your luggage through. Furthermore, have you got a connecting flight? Now multiply that figure by 2… I had an old lady in the queue next to me and the guy at check in was taking advantage of her and making money signs with his fingers regarding the luggage. The lady who checked me in was disgusting too. I appreciate that you can’t always get a window seat once your seat is booked. However, the hostility the staff provided me with just for asking was disgusting itself. What did I do in the end? Picked up my luggage and booked a ticket on a proper airline for $150 dollars more. However tough times are in your life to think you should choose this airline please take my advice and don’t. You’re better than that.

### "pleasantly surprised in the end"
Not Verified |  I thought our flight was just fine. We were at checkin early, on the dot of 6.35 a m when the check in opened, and we walked straight up to the desk. The seats in economy were more comfy and spacious than I had anticipated. Having read the reviews we took our own food on board which turned out to be fine. A lovely stewardess, Concita from the Canary Islands seemed to take us under our wing and was so friendly and pleasant, checking on us several times and even arranging complimentary tea and a small bottle of wine for us. All the crew were professional and friendly so I certainly didn’t have the negative experiences during the flight that others have commented on. However the huge negative was awakening one morning just over two weeks from our flight to read an email reading ‘Your flight has been cancelled! The airline had unilaterally decided to discontinue its San Francisco route, despite it only opening this summer. And then you were on your own, no offer of an alternative flight, you sort yourself out to find a flight home. Well, that’s just not good enough and it cost us an extra £300 to do so, returning to London via Frankfurt. The refund did however come thought without a problem. This airline gets almost zero points for communication as you cannot contact anyone by phone, and they simply don’t bother to answer emails. Why allow such poor customer service when you’re a relatively new start -up, and presumably interested in giving a good impression? However I picked up a tip via another reviewer to use their Facebook page, and that does work! Answered usually within an hour or so. So, lower your expectations to be reasonable, expect little, and then be or pleasantly surprised in the end, as we were. But having your flight home cancelled is still the pits, and so prevents me from giving anything but a low score.

### "I recommend this airline"
This is an low cost airline and you can't expect much, there are no headphones, pillow or blankets provided. Also, each meal and drink cost an additional. But, you have to be well-aware that you're paying what you get for. Everything is explained in their terms & conditions and no hidden cost is applied. Norse will take you from point A to point B safely and cheaper that many airlines. Just be sure to bring your own pillow, food, headphones and you're good to go. Also, I suggest to arrive early to check in, since another Norse flight might be next to yours and lines can get slower. All in all, I recommend this airline if you want to cross the Atlantic ocean cheap and safe.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Avoid this airline like the plague. It is impossible to get into contact with them. They canceled two of my flights months before I was supposed to take it and have shown zero interest or effort in adjusting the trip, refunding the trip, helping me in anyway or contacting me. I haven't even spoke to anyone yet. It has been weeks of trying to get in touch with them. No success whatsoever. I have sent dozens of emails. They don't even have a phone number to call them with. I will be attempting to get my money back at the very least. I might have to consider legal action if I do not hear from them anytime soon. First trip to Europe down the drain. Do not fly with this airline. Zero stars out of 10 across-the-board.

### "Absolutely appalling tactics"
Norse created a new international route, offered tickets on sale, then cancelled the route completely, and are currently ignoring my request to be rebooked onto a new flight. Norse Airlines cancelled my flight from London to San Francisco three weeks before we were due to fly. Their email stated we had 14 days to claim a refund. In their very fine print their policy document stated that we also had the option to be rebooked onto another flight, so we emailed them to request this. After replying promptly the first time about potential other flights, Norse have since completely ignored my repeated emails asking to be booked onto another flight (despite what their policy says). I only have three days left before the window to claim a refund expires, and it seems clear that they're hoping I panic and give up hopes of having them rebook me onto another flight, and claim the refund instead. It looks like Norse have actually cancelled the entire route from London to San Francisco, after obviously selling a bunch of cheap tickets on a sale. That means to refund me would cost them a lot less than it would to rebook me onto a flight with another airline. I've emailed them 6 times, have had my partner email, have tweeted at them - at this point I am absolutely convinced that their policy is to ignore requests to rebook a flight in hopes that a customer requests a cheaper refund instead. Even if I get the refund, I will now have to buy a brand new flight to San Francisco, which will cost thousands since it's 5 days until my departure date. Absolutely appalling tactics.

### "worst airline I've ever flown with"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I've ever flown with. From the moment of check in, it was the worst experience I've had with any airline, both leaving the UK and coming back. Advertising the price cheap and then charging crazy amounts to get baggage on board was horrendous. I also travelled with a guitar. All in I paid around £1000 for a flight that used to cost around £400 with Norwegian, the best airline I've ever used. Booking through trip.com there was no option to order food. $21 I was charged for a shrimp risotto. It had 3 tiny prawns on top and the worst risotto I've ever had. The flight for 9 hours was the coldest flights I've ever been on too. Other airlines give you a little blanket Norse charge you £6.50 Even the movie selection was terrible. I'll try my hardest never to fly with Norse ever again. Lucky for me on the way back when Norse were trying to charge me £89 to get a small carry on case, the machine was broken for taking payment and I got off with that. If you can, look for an alternative airline to Norse, the Ryanair of the Boeing 787 world.

### "couldn't ask for nicer cabin crew"
Not Verified |  We booked return tickets London to Orlando due to the fare cost. We also added carry-ons, and a checked bag on the return (for the shopping!). Then I started reading the reviews, and began to regret the decision. The main area of concern was the sizes of our on board bags, so I spent endless hours finding suitably small personal item bags and checking them religiously for size. We also read about the horror stories of 2 hour queues, so added priority check-in. Well, suffice to say that I turned my hair grey for nothing. We were at Gatwick (three and a half hours ahead of the flight time), and were checked in within 5 minutes of arrival at the desk. The normal queue was about 50 strong, so the priority check-in was well worth it on this occasion. They weighed, but didn't measure either of the carry-ons, and didn't even look twice at the personal item bags. The flight left on time, and the cabin crew were extremely helpful and friendly. We only paid for one meal going out, but received two, and were not charged for the coffees that I requested for from the galley. We'd booked early, and had chosen the exit seats by the window, so had about 6 feet of legroom. There was no wi-fi, and headphones were only available at a cost, but that was all in the website blurb, so we already had all our entertainment downloaded onto tablets, and our own headphones. The return flight was pretty much the same, except that there was no queue at the check-in at all, but we were 4 hours early, and they didn't even weigh the carry-ons time. Again, we couldn't ask for nicer cabin crew. We had a slight delay on landing as there was no-one to drive the walkway over to the aircraft, but by the time we reached the baggage hall our case was already on the carousel, meaning we were out of the airport about 40 minutes after arrival. Whether I'd fly with them again is debatable. On the strength of our experience, I'd say yes (hence my recommendation), but I can't help feeling that considering the rest of these reviews, we may have just been lucky.

### "better off using a reputable airline"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrendous customer service experience. Half the people on the flight lost their bags so we were directed to a portal where we could log delivery address and track the progress of the bags. The portal was never updated and it took 4 days for our bags to arrive. Not only that, it was impossible to reach anyone and they replied with the same response of, "keep checking the portal for updates". Upon requesting compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the lost bags, we are still yet to receive any. It has been 2 months with us frequently reaching out. Highly advise against flying with Norse as it will be a one and done experience for us. You're better off using a reputable airline as the costs end up being the same after all the add-on fees that Norse applies.

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
Avoid this airline if you can, zero customer service, shockingly rude, but the pilots did their job.. The only thing more astonishing then their incompetence was their complete lack of any customer service skills. Our flight was slightly delayed, which isn't an issue, but when I approached the "customer service" agents at the gate they attempted to ignore me. I know it was intentional because we literally made eye contact and they looked away deciding to instead carry on their conversation. I politely greeted them and asked what time we would be boarding. They did not have a time or even a time frame and just said to wait for their announcement. Before I was out of earshot I could hear them bad mouthing me as I walked away. Unfortunately it didn't end there. The flight attendants were slightly less rude so thats a plus. The pilots did their job though so that counts for something.

### "zero customer service skills"
I was booked on Norse to travel from LGW to MCO on 9/23/2023. My flight landing in LGW was delayed arriving and I was denied boarding on Norse due to only being 40 minutes early for my flight and not 45 minutes early. The supervisor had zero customer service skills. She told us that we were not able to check in (no online check in is possible with Norse) and that it was our problem. She did not offer any empathy, solutions, or help. We found our own solution and asked her to book it. She told us we had 30 minutes to make the new flight (funny, we had 40 minutes for the original flight and were denied boarding passes) and we ran through the airport to the very last gate. When we got there, we found out that she was incorrect about the time, and we had much more time to wait.

### "a terrific small airline"
Our 4th time using Norse Atlantic, and the airline keeps getting better. We've used them between NY and Oslo and now NY and London. Don't let the prices fool you, this is a terrific small airline that is well run, consistent, with excellent planes and great on board staff. From a value standpoint, nothing really comes close. We used their premium service 4 times, and it is reminiscent of older business class seats on most carriers pre lay flat seats. The pricing for these near business class seats was less than coach on the same routes from the larger network carriers. Depending on the "package" you buy from them, it includes most of what you'll need, unless you really want full refund eligibility, which I guess is important to people. But the basic prices are excellent. Seats do cost money, but it doesn't matter, its still the same or less than almost every other option. We checked bags each time we've used Norse, and they showed up fine. We don't expect much from airline food in general, and the food service was completely fine. In premium, they served champagne after take off as well. The planes are fairly new, clean, and bathrooms were clean on all our flights. The cabin crew was happy and attentive on all flights as well. The pilots were very professional and kept us up to date. All flights were on time. All in all, I can't think of a better way to get across the Atlantic. I have lifetime status on 2 large American carriers, and candidly, for the value, Norse is hard to beat. Finally, their flights to both Oslo and London Gatwick means they connect to 2 of the larger European carriers, so using Norse as gateway to Europe is ideal.

### "disappointed in this airline"
Not Verified | I'm disappointed in this airline, and will never ever take either again or recommend to take this airline internationally, they charge more than $140 for luggage, they provide NO meal, NO headphones NO blankets or pillows etc. Those very basic stuff other airlines provided for international flight.

### "don’t think I’ll fly with this airline again"
Be very careful when planning your trip with this airline. They changed my return flight to the day before. Delays happen, but this was the opposite, the trip was shortened. Even though I paid for a carry on, they still had everyone size their bags. I’ve flown many times with my carry on and it barely made it. The worker who sized my bag was quite rude to everyone too. Make sure your bag fits their guidelines, or you’ll need to check it. Corporate was visiting on that day, so the staff were on edge. You cannot check in online. You have to get there early at the airport to check in. They size your bags too, which can take a while with how unnecessarily strict they are. The terminal I flew out of was quite far to walk to. You pay for everything such as drinks, food, etc. There isn’t wifi on board, even to purchase. They even sometimes have seat upgrades you can pay for on the flight, which many of the upgrades are quite affordable compared to other airlines. The one benefit is this is a very low budget option. But I don’t think I’ll fly with this airline again, I’d rather pay a little extra to book with another airline. It’s not just for the basic amenities.

### "I would definitely fly Norse again"
I almost didn't fly this airline, based on all of the negative reviews here and elsewhere. I'm glad I did. Flying Norse Atlantic was one of the best flight experiences I've had in years. I should preface all of this by saying that I flew Premium Flextra, which is the highest class Norse has. That meant that I didn't have to wait in a long line at the airport to get my ticket (a complaint I know others have had, and one that is justified. The line at JFK seemed at least an hour long more than three hours before boarding.) It also meant I flew towards the front of the plane, with seats that reclined almost 180 degrees. All staff were friendly. Flights were on time. Food was not good, and movie selection was limited, but neither of these were a huge deal for me. Also, no wi-fi on either leg, which again wasn't a huge deal. Flight was about $1200 for nonstop roundtrip to Berlin, which was about half what other airlines were charging for coach, often for flights with connections. All said, I would definitely fly Norse again.

### "trip was really very comfortable"
The trip was really very comfortable. The cabin crew was nice and caring. The seats were really comfortable. The food wasn't were tasty, but everything was hot and enough for an adult. The plane flew on time. We were on time in the New York's airport. I can really recommend this airline.

### "havent recieved our refund"
We waited 3 hours inside the plane only to be deboarded back to the terminal. The customer support was nowhere to be seen or heard. They did not even book us hotels to spend the night. The next available flight was fully booked. And we still havent recieved our refund back. We applied also for a compensation.

### "Do not use this airline"
Not Verified | Do not use this airline! The Norse Atlantic Airways LOST MY LUGGAGE and I can't get hold of their customer support. After my last email to them, regarding a compensation the airline stop responding to my emails. I had a long flight +/- 6hrs and the airline doesn't even offer water free of charge!

### "cramped, horrible experience"
Not Verified |  We made it to London from San Francisco. That is the good part of this review. The rows were so close together my face was about 6 inches from the screen on my seatback. The cabin smelled like the toilets. Even though they charged $4.00 for some water, Good Luck trying to get any. They literally walked briskly down the aisles twice on a 10 hour flight, only asking once if we wanted a beverage. The second time in the morning I yelled out "coffee" and they turned around and it begrudgingly sold me a cup. I had one drink of water on this entire flight. No way to buy anything online, so cramped, horrible experience. I am dreading my return flight.

### "great experience"
Not Verified | I flew with Norse Airlines and had a fantastic day. Their customer service is excellent, the seats are quite comfortable, and the cuisine is delicious. I will always use this airline because I believe it is superior to many others. I would like to mention one of the flight attendants that was so patience and wonderful. Thank you, Norse Airline for the great experience!

### "don't be fooled by the base price"
Not Verified |  Not worth it. Ticket was £40 off that from Virgin Atlantic and I should've just flown with them. Reserved my seat and kept a receipt of it only for my boarding pass to give me a different seat and I did not get the seat I had reserved and paid for. No online check in, had to wait almost 2 hours to check in at Gatwick Airport and the flight was delayed for an hour and a half. No in flight wifi, no headphones, no pillow, blanket or anything that is a basic necessity on long haul flights. Slow food service on the returning flight (minus the turbulence), don't be fooled by the base price. You will end up paying for amenities which will equal the amount it would be for a ticket with a better long haul airline.

### "wouldn't recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  It's now been 2 months since the airline has replied to me following the loss of my luggage when I arrived at CDG. The 21-day deadline has long passed and the customer service department is acting as if I didn't exist. I wouldn't recommend this airline at all, as it doesn't guarantee the physical safety of its passengers. Watch out!

### "I’d fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  First time flying Norse Atlantic and didn’t know what to expect. Was offered to upgrade (bid) for premium economy both ways and both bids were accepted. It is a low cost airline which makes sense as to why they charge for a lot of amenities that other airlines may offer. Flight from LAX to LGW: The premium economy ticket came with priority check-in which is worth it tbh (you can purchase it without having premium economy tickets). After checking in, I headed through TSA, then took a bus to where the terminal was. I realized I forgot my passport and AirPods at the TSA checkpoint approximately 20 minutes before boarding. I told the gate agent and they called a check-in supervisor (assuming) who brought it back to me in the just in time. On board, the plane was clean and temperature was nice. The cabin crew was great; they were welcoming, kind, and approachable. They offered soft drinks, juice, water, and alcohol multiple times at a no additional cost. The meal that’s included was alright; small but decently filling. The premium economy seats have quite a bit of room to lay back on but it does make it a bit awkward to leave your seat if the person in front of you is resting/sleeping. The entertainment system is inside an armrest and so is a tray. They offered earphones at no additional cost and blankets as well. The flight was pretty straightforward. No issues in my opinion. Flight from LGW to LAX: Arrived 3hrs ahead of time. Priority check went seamless again. No issues through security and was able to find something to eat. Went to the terminal and boarded the plane. Premium economy area was pretty empty and had about 25 seats free. We were delayed at the gate for about 1.5hrs due to needing a third pilot who was called from standby. The captain was apologetic and nice to update us on what was going on. Take off went without a hitch. Food was good and the drinks were plenty. The cabin crew was really attentive, kind, and approachable. The flight was uneventful and we landed at LAX about 1hr after intended. Personally, I had a great experience on both flights. I had no issues checking-in in person albeit, if not a timely person I can see why this can be an issue. Cabin crew were great. Flights were uneventful. I’d fly this airline again.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, really rude especially a supervisor at check in who was rude and not helpful. Terrible seat and not confortable. You have to pay extra for food and bags and its expensive.

### "9.5 hour flight. was miserable"
The worst airline I have ever traveled with. I travel multiple times a month, and have used many different airlines, I have put up with some annoyances, but this by far takes the cake. I have never written a review before, so this is saying a lot. Do not fly with them. They don’t let you check in ahead of time, they charge absurd prices for check ins and carry ons. I paid 177 £ for a check bag that was the normal weight. I paid 80 £ for a carry on and then they would not let me only bring my BACKPACK, that fits under the seat because it was “heavy”. So I was charged for that as well. The girl checking me into my actual gate was so incredibly rude. She started to argue with me rather than explaining why I had to pay so much, and treated me like I was stupid though I travel very often. I will absolutely never fly with them again. Worth paying more for an airline that cares and actually treats you like a paying customer. Not to mention you get no free meal, no snacks and not even a free drink, you have to pay for every single thing. I drank one cup of water on my 9.5 hour flight. Was miserable.

### "Upselling Con!"
Upselling Con! Selling cheap tickets and then charging (this has happened every time). I will not use them again. The attached images are of a bag in the hold, and bags in the boarding area. You can see that it is normal practice to allow appropriately sized bags to be carried on (and even inappropriately sized bags!) My father is dying in a hospice so I had to fly urgently. Upgraded to 'Premium Economy'. I was the first person to check into the flight and yet was allocated the seat closest to the economy loos sat in the middle of two people. It smelled like faeces when we initially boarded (no one else had been on the plane). When I complained about being given the worst seat on the plane despite being the first to physically check in, I was told 'random allocation'. There were plenty of empty seats in Premium Economy. I brought a standard size carry on. I was charged $130. This despite the overhead compartments for storage being literally empty in Premium Economy. Images herein include massively oversized carry on bag sitting in those overhead compartments and of bags in the boarding area. I've not flown with them since. Really best to pay up front at a respectable airline. I've not had a problem since I stopped using them. Pay an honourable company and be treated fairly. It's actually cost me less to have a 23kg checked bag, additional carry on and a personal bag than any seemingly cheap flight I've taken with them. After weeks and having to follow up their response: Thank you for reaching out to us with your feedback. Norse has specific rules regarding the maximum weight and dimensions of carry-on luggage. These limits are put in place for safety reasons, to ensure that the overhead compartments can safely accommodate all the passengers’ belongings without causing harm to anyone. The photographic evidence attached disproves this. As safety is of outmost importance for Norse, we do not make exceptions for oversized carry-on bags. The photographic evidence attached disproves this. I am vey sorry to hear that there was a smell from the bathrooms when you boarded the plane. I will forward your feedback. I don't know what to say to that one. Company policy that faeces smell upon boarding is appropriate apparently. I will not use them again and will raise my concerns formally elsewhere.

### "made us pay 100 pounds for a bag"
Not Verified |  This was the worst Arline experience that I have ever had. Don’t be fooled by the inexpensive flight prices. You can’t check in online even if you have no bags to check (and your passport info is Already in the system) which is ridiculous. We only had a carry ons and a personal item and the weight can only be 10kg for the Carry on. We bought our hard shell suitcase to the dimension of their requirement and our weight was within the required 10kg. When we put our bag in the measurement bin it fit in, but the attendant said after we put it in that  you can’t use your hands, the bag has to free fall to the bottom , which in their guidelines it does not say anywhere. They forced us to check that bag and made us pay 100 pounds for a bag that was the right dimensions and weight and followed all the rules of the carry on luggage. It is worth noting that they were allowing people who had bags and backpacks that were not the right size to fly and not pay which made us feel targeted. I recommend that you fly any other airlines than this airline that doesn’t even follow their own rules.

### "Really appalling customer experience"
Not Verified |  Shocking experience! We booked premium economy flights for our Christmas holiday, We paid a premium price to fly back on the 26th December (much higher cost than the 25th after all who wants to fly home on Christmas day) Airbnb booked and prepaid and was about to book the 3 additional flights for family members joining us. Email from airline informing that the flight now cancelled and they have moved us to the 25th - result we lose a day of our holiday and cant get refund for lost accommodation day, or we need to find another place to stay and extend to the 27th. The price of the tickets for the other family have shot up on 27th given the 26th flight now cancelled. The switch to 25th has been done as a default but there is no offer of a refund for the fact that the ticket was a cheaper price .. so we either have to drop the money for the lost accom and lose a day's holiday or we need to pay another £1500 for one nights accom (3 rooms on 26th December in Barbados, good luck finding that) and pay a really high price for the 3 family members return flight. Despite emails, twitter posting and raising a support ticket on the airlines website we have had no response so we don't know what flight we are going to be on and i cant book the other family members, all the whilst pricing is going up and up. There is no phone or webchat support for this airline so we are in a complete void. Really appalling customer experience ... will never book them again.

### "worst pre-flight customer service experience"
Having used Norse for a trip on my own from the US earlier this year to the UK and having a positive experience I decided to book my family trip this summer back to the UK with Norse. Due to personal reasons we had to make some changes to the dates of our booking. It took Norse 2 weeks to respond my request for a change to my booking and I have ended up having to forgo our flight and look at make a booking with another airline as a result. Incredible that in this day and age they have such an archaic, slow, non-responsive system for managing customer requests. The worst pre-flight customer service experience I have had in 25 years of personal and professional travel. Based on my experience if there is the possibility that you might need to interact with the airline you book with you should think twice about booking with Norse!

### "finds ways of charging you for every little thing"
I took two separate red eye trips with Norse, first to London from NY and then again from Paris to NY. Both trips were disappointing in different ways, but I’ll focus on the most recent one. I had gone with Norse because the tickets were - at first glance - affordable, considering I was paying for both myself and a family member. However, the airline finds ways of charging you for every little thing. The cost of checked luggage and carry on items are significantly more than I’m used to; luckily I was able to fit my backpack under my seat. Both flights were red eyes, and after learning the hard way on the first flight that they don’t provide free meals (in the past, before pandemic, this was standard on every international and national red eye flight I’d ever taken), I brought my own food and water. But it was a long flight, and I asked a crew member if they had any free snacks or beverages, he literally scoffed at me. Even a little bag of pretzels cost money! Later I saw another attendant give a fellow passenger a cup of water after I’d just had to pay for a bottle of water. When I got off the plane, the same attendant avoided eye contact with me and used a different tone of voice as I left the cabin after our arrival. There is no online check in and if I hadn’t advocated for my family member on flight 1 or gotten to the airport 4 hours early on flight 2, I would have easily ended up in a horrific line and missed my flight. I have done a fair amount of international travel, and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable or dehumanized by an airline and its employees until now. I will never fly with them again, nor will I recommend them to anyone I know. The “cheap” (non refundable) tickets are NOT worth the stress of traveling with this airline.

### "Outrageous business"
Not Verified |  Norse Atlantic Airways cancelled our flight. They moved us to one departing 24 hours earlier forcing us to take additional time out of work and school, and forcing us to pay an unplanned $700 for a hotel. Additionally, we had paid $300 for up front, extra leg room seats. They moved us out of those and out my 3-year-old in a seat alone next to strangers. They put me two seat away and my husband was given no seat. We were not reimbursed for the seats we paid for but did not get to sit in. They have no customer service phone number. They do not respond to emails unless pressed on social media. The fastest way to get help is through Instagram direct messages (a problem unto itself). But even then, they refused to do anything to help us other than finally offering us a full refund for a two week trip to Europe that has already been fully booked, including non-refundable AirBnBs (so basically not an option to cancel). Outrageous business.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible. Missed a flight due to the horrific way that BER airport operates and denied a refund for circumstances caused by the airport. Had to stay 4 extra days because they were unable to help me find another flight. They left about 15 other people at the terminal and we all missed the flights and have all by trying desperately for some ramifications.

### "we got caught by many surprises"
We didn't had many expectations while flying with a budget Airline (Norse), but still we got caught by many surprises. We paid $120 for 2 hand carries and $120 for a checked in luggage, and for our surprise these charges were for one way only. As they were not clear while charging it and the amount was high at first place so we thought it was for a round trip. While on our way back from London to Orlando they took another $300 for same luggage .. so overall we paid $540 for 2 hand carries and 1 checked in luggage for a round trip. Several people in checked in lane at Gatwick got the same surprise which made the whole boarding process very slow If you have complaints against slow boarding process (point 1), they will ask you to pay for priority lane. Main Meal and Pre arrival meals will cost you $50. They will not give you even a glass of water for free, water is for $3.50. No blankets, even for headphones you need to pay. Staff is busy all the time selling food and alcohol on the plane, you will feel like as there is a food stall on plane. 7. Me and few other people requested the Norse manager at Gatwick airport to record our complaint for additional luggage charges and when he saw many people are complaining, he said he doesn't have any authority. Bottom line is we get attracted by such airlines with the price we see at first click, but later if we add up the price of "add-ons" they ended up nearly at the same price as any leading Airlines with pathetic service.

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. It seems affordable at first, until you realize you have to pay an addition $300+ for a seat, carry on, even for the single meal on an 11 hour flight. They don’t allow online check in. This creates massive, horrific lines at the airport check in counter. In LA, they had one person checking in a line of 200 people. I would have missed my flight if I waited in it. They let me go since I didn’t have a checked bag. Then in London, Gatwick, on my way back, the line was 140 people and moving equally slowly. Would have missed my flight again if I had waited in it. At London, an awful attendant yelled at me that I had to wait in line or pay $41 for priority. I literally didn’t have a choice and would have missed my flight if I didn’t do priority! How dare they not allow online check in, then create a line for every flyer, then charge you $41 again on top of the money you already paid just to make your flight and skip the insanely long line. Tons of people missed my flight because of their lines they create. Fly any other airline. The stress alone isn’t worth it.

### "poor communication and long lines"
Not Verified |  Terrible! I have never waited so long in a line to get a boarding pass or check luggage! They have no electronic system to check in ahead of time and the staff did not even know which gate the flight would leave from so passengers got lost and we had a two hour delay leaving due to this poor communication and long lines. Unacceptable lack of organization! I'm sure the airport must be angry with this airline as well. Flight attendants were very nice but why would they have a plane of hundreds wait over an hour and a half for lost passengers? Who does this?

### "didn’t have a printed boarding pass"
My 18 year old son was checked in with a paid seat and they didn’t let him get on the plane because he didn’t have a printed boarding pass and they couldn’t print him one. The plane was there and the door was open but they didn’t care. They didn’t care that there were no flights to the US in the next two days and the airline excuse is that they have strict rules.

### "We quickly felt ripped-off with the upgrade"
I am very disappointed, would not recommend, and would actually discourage others from using Norse Atlantic Airlines based on the service or lack-thereof that we received on our recent flight to and from London via Washington, Dulles (IAD) and Gatwick (LGW) airports. On the first leg of the trip, everything seemed promising. We arrived at the Dulles gate a few hours early and checked in without issue. We were even offered the opportunity to upgrade for $600. After a moment to think about the prospect (an out of budget splurge for us), we decided to take the opportunity on the promise from our gate agent that the seats were “near lay-flat” and that we would have “as many drinks as we wanted.” The plane itself (787) was great, but the rest was disappointing. We quickly felt ripped-off with the upgrade. The seats only reclined slightly more than other seats. Moreover, we did not need a meal, but that was the only service we received. Flight attendants did not come by throughout the evening offering snacks or drinks-even when I really needed one due to the high turbulence (I was awake the whole time - no one came to check on us). The quality of the in-flight monitors did not match the quality of the plane. There were no games, and the movies were all old, poorly rated, or out of order sequels (John Wick 4, but no John Wick 1). Worst of all, there was no in-flight map to watch where the plane was in air (I like to know when we are flying over parts of the world - part of the excitement of traveling). I feel like I blew at least $300 on this “upgrade.” While the flight over had some redeeming qualities, the flight back - rather the whole process - was a nightmare. Everyone is angry. My seven-year-old daughter even commented that we should have flown Delta. We arrived nearly four hours early and waited in line for about three of those hours. The check-in process was a complete disaster. It was disorganized and completely unfair. We waited as gate agents allowed-even directed others to break in front of us. Yes, we realize there were three flights the gate crew was dealing with (NY, FLA, and DC), yet we should not be punished for the lateness of others. For every two Florida flights checked-in, they should have moved a DC guest through. Instead, they held all DC passengers until all New York and then Florida passengers were done - even those arriving mins before boarding. That is poor managements and all on Norse. There was not one single person in the DC line happy with this experience - I expect you will get more complaints. We finally reached the gate agent after this ordeal, and she wanted to charge us for having a bag 2 kg over -same amount of clothes and goods that we took over -so either we were waived on the first leg or the scales were off. Also, I should have had two bag credits as I received a free bag with my initial upgrade on top of the two I paid for in advance. The nail in coffin for this experience was that we had a minor and she put her in seat 40B, while my wife and I were next to each other on row 13. We caught this and had to go back to get it changed to where we were all on row 18 - but more time off the clock to correct this mess. So, we arrived at Gatwick nearly 4 hours early and were now having to run to the flight as it was boarding. We arrived early in an effort to eat dinner, work on the VAT recollection process, and shop duty free. Instead, none of that got done. We were starving on

### "Bring your own sandwiches"
I used them twice, flight from NYC to London was ok, they have new planes, I bought some food at the airport and didn’t use their services. Just slept 8h. Flight back home was different, we changed planes and had to pick up our luggage in Oslo, than go to check in again and security. Do not use them if you have connecting flight, for the first time in 20 years of flying I had to pick up my luggage halfway through. What a nightmare! Almost missed the flight. The onboard staff are rude! Flight nr 001 from Oslo to NYC. I asked 4 times if we can order some food because my teenager was hungry to be told that we have to wait every time. We were in economy. We waited patiently and the fifth time I asked if I can order the food I was told that there is almost nothing left! Bring your own sandwiches. They hire unprofessional people without the proper training. I saw how the staff screamed at other people trying to change seats. So so rude! This is the worst customer service I’ve experienced.

### "most obnoxious budget airline"
Not Verified |  By far the most obnoxious budget airline I've ever interacted with, and not even for budget prices. Even Ryanair doesn't weigh your carry-on—clearly just a way for Norse Air to make extra money, as the plane's luggage spaces were empty. With bag fees (3 expected, 1 not), this flight ended up costing me more than a real airline, and being a far more unpleasant experience (no water, no free headphones, no food, no snacks, etc). Will never fly again.

### "turned out to be a great experience"
Not Verified |  We were skeptical of this new, discount airline offering limited trans-Atlantic service but it turned out to be a great experience. Very helpful service agents in Gatwick. We selected upgraded seats and it was worth every penny - more room, more comfort and more service plus priority boarding. Total cost for the direct flight ended up being much less than a connecting flight we checked. Highly recommend

### "go with simple expectations"
Not Verified | I am so tired of the reviews blasting a BUDGET airline for daring to charge extra for bags, food and seats when this is VERY CLEARLY marked on their site. Who books a ticket without reading and understanding the restrictions. Once again, there will be so many complaints and fussing towards an airline that offers a few of us with limited means to actually see the world. I can live without water for 10 hours if it gets me to Europe for $250. Please quit complaining and low rating for things you KNOW you will be asked to pay extra for and get a grip. This has happened with other budget airlines that folded after. There are some of us that read before we buy, therefore go with those simple expectations. My review - EXPECT to wait 2 hours for check in EXPECT to pay for bags EXPECT to pay for seats EXPECT to pay for meals. How I did it. Packed a personal bag with all I needed. Ate snacks as I waited to check in. Took an empty water bottle, filled it before boarding. Took a good book and walked about the plane hourly. AND GOT TO OSLO for under $300. THANK YOU NORSE!

### "customer service is non existent"
The plane was fine. The cabin crew was fine. The customer service is non existent, and when they do find it in their heart to respond they are condescending and refuse to help. Just terrible customer service. Pay a few bucks more and fly an airline that actually cares about their passengers. This one clearly does not.

### "customer service is an absolute nightmare"
Absolutely terrible experience with Norse Atlantic Airways! Their customer service is an absolute nightmare – they seem to revel in charging for every minuscule thing imaginable, and don't even get me started on the fact that they don't provide food on international flights. It's like they want to see their passengers starve. And good luck trying to contact them if you encounter any delays, cancellations, or issues. They conveniently hide behind the fact that there's no accessible contact number for assistance. Oh, and if you think they'll rush to solve your problems, think again – their response time is glacial at best, and when they do respond, it's with a level of rudeness that's almost impressive. Save yourself the headache and avoid Norse Atlantic Airways at all costs – trust me, you'll thank me for it!

### "Useless customer service"
Not Verified | I have not managed to fly with Norse, they cancelled our flight in November from Barbados to London, leaving us having to find replacement premium economy seats. They have no contact telephone number in the UK and every time I do as they tell me, when requesting my refund on their website, I can't take it further because they have cancelled the flight. They have now had my money for months, keep sending me the same email back when I contact them which is no use and I'm going to have to use charge back on my credit card to get my money. Useless customer service, I certainly won't bother with them again, no matter how good the deal seems. Would give them 0 if I could but the minimum rating is 1.

### "seats extremely tight and barely recline"
Not Verified | Awful. The seats are genuinely the worst seats, extremely tight and barely recline. But the absolute worst part was the baggage claim. Over 30 mins and not one single bag came out. People waiting around with no idea where their bags were or why it was even taking so long. The worst customer service and just overall service.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Norse Atlantic isn't really a budget airline - they make their money back by squeezing it from you penny by penny. In my case, they charged 121 euros to do checked baggage at the airport. I had already paid for a carry on bag and they wouldn't let me credit the money that I already paid towards the fee (my bag was a carry-on size, but slightly overweight). I'd come from a connecting flight with Turkish Airlines whose carry-on allowance was even lower (8kg instead of 10kg) but Turkish Airlines didn't mind, and on my entire trip I was flying with other budget airlines who didn't mind either. Yes, it's definitely true that travelers should stick to the allowances permitted by each airline but given that each airline has slightly different requirements for baggage, and some are more strict than others - I think this can be a real nuisance for travelers on long trips with many flights, to figure out what the actual rules are. Norse Atlantic disallows online check-ins so they can weigh and measure carry-on luggage, and charge for it - the flight plan I had booked ended up taking longer and costing more than a direct flight with a more reputable company. Add to that the fact that there is no food without paying extra - this airline ranks as the worst airline I have ever flown.

### "Excellent, neat clean aircraft"
This was the first time I flew Norse. Excellent, neat clean aircraft, very helpful check in staff as well as the crew. We flew from London to Washington on the 5th June and then I and my daughter had to fly back on 8th July, but after checking in and nearly boarding we had an emergency - my niece had to be taken to hospital so we off loaded. Ground staff helped and especially a lady named Majda at Dulles airport and her colleague were so cooperative. I requested for any refund and we were told to email. My daughter emailed and we were given a refund voucher of 1040 dollars, to use within 12 months on any Norse flight. I cannot thank them & Norse enough. A suggestion, please have a helpline number as you don’t have any.

### "NOT a budget airline"
I took my first (and most probably last) flight of Norse yesterday. As mentioned by many, it is NOT a budget airline. You purchase a low cost ticket and this airline tricks you with add-ons charges and you end up paying way more than normal airline. Norse, as you are charging for every small aspect, a small suggestion to you to increase revenue. You can also charge passengers for utilizing lavatory depending on number of minutes used.

### "trying to get a refund"
Not Verified |  I had an emergency that required me to return home 2 weeks earlier than originally planned. The airline doesn't have a customer care line to speak to someone directly, and they take over a day to respond via their email correspondences. When I tried to change my flight, their website was deceptive on the price it would cost. I thought I was booking a new flight that had the same price as my original ticket and thought the cost to change was only $200. Turns out they charged me over $800. After complaining and trying to get a refund and my original flight back, the customer service agents informed me "there was nothing they could do". To me this was ridiculous because as agents working for the airline, it seems like they are the only people that should be able to do something. After inquiring several times for an agent to talk with over the phone and where I could file a formal complaint... there was no communication from the company. They also nickel and dime you for absolutely every cost, never in my life did I have to pay for my meals on an international flight especially after paying $1000 extra dollars. Worst airline ever, never fly with them.

### "We were very satisfied"
Not Verified |  I cannot confirm or understand the negative reviews. We 2 adults 3 kids were very satisfied. Leg room was good, board entertainment was good, all staff were very friendly. We knew in advance that you had to pay for the food and it wasn't a problem for us. We travel a lot and will continue to choose this airline in the future. All information about meals, blankets or headsets are mentioned several times when booking, as are the baggage rules. But you save a lot on the ticket price. Super Service. Also ich kann diese negativen Bewertungen nicht bestätigen oder nachvollziehen. Wir 2Adult 3 Kids, waren sehr zufrieden. Die Beinfreiheit war gut, Board entertainment war gut, alle Mitarbeiter waren sehr freundlich. Das man das Essen bezahlen muss wussten wir vorab und war für uns kein Problem. Wir reisen sehr viel und werden auch in Zukunft diese Airline wählen. Alle Informationen zur Verpflegung, decken oder Headset werden bei der Buchung mehrmals darauf hingewiesen, genau wie die Gepäcksregeln. Dafür spart man doch deutlich am Ticketpreis. Super Service.

### "In this case, cheaper isn’t better"
Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Waited in a 3 hour check in line because they don’t do online boarding passes. Rude workers. Carry-on is not included so I was forced to pay $70 at the plane. Food is also not included (on an 8 hour plane ride)! In this case, cheaper isn’t better. Fly Delta and pay the price, this airline isn’t worth it. Would rate this airline a zero if I could!

### "bilked and bullied by employees"
My wife and I are traveling with soft backpacks clothes only. Our packs were weighed both were fine. Then we were asked to fit them in the size pouch. With gentle push both packs fit, separately. She said because we pushed we would be charged. We asked to readjust so they would set in and she told us we would have to go to the back of the line. Do not be fooled by discount tickets only to be bilked and bullied by employees at the airport.

### "Carry ons aren’t free"
Only reason I used this airline was because I had someone else book the flight. First and last time I do that, first and last time I fly with Norse. Upon arrival everyone waited at least 40 minutes to get checked in. They charge for everything. Norse is the spirit airlines for international travelers. Carry ons aren’t free. Food isn’t free. $5 for headphones. I’m sure blankets, pillows or any other commodity isn’t free. If you’re trying to save money because this airline has a cheaper ticket price, spend the extra $200 on a better airline with all the amenities.

### "most dreadful flight experience"
This was undeniably the most dreadful flight experience I've ever had, from start to finish. It all began with a simple yet frustrating mistake—they misspelled my name on the ticket. Despite my attempts to correct it a few days before departure, it nearly caused me to miss my flight. Once onboard, the service for economy class was abysmal, the worst I've ever encountered. Everything came with a price tag, and they barely provided any amenities. To add insult to injury, they only offered a single serving of water for a 10-HOUR FLIGHT! The entertainment system was outdated, and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable. The staff was unqualified and seemed disinterested in the well-being of economy passengers. It was evident that they lacked the proper training and didn't prioritize customer satisfaction. Needless to say, I will never subject myself to this airline's services again. They have lost a customer for life.

### "actually it is not that good a deal"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. Although the flights are cheaper, there are so many add ons that actually it is not that good a deal. Waited 90 minutes in line to check in as it would not allow me to do so online. Finally arrived at the gate and it is now 80 minutes after boarding should have started, no apology or explanation from the staff. Started boarding 10 minutes before scheduled take-off. I paid $60 for my first checked bag and had to pay an extra 72.35 GBP at check-in because it was a kilo and a half over. Meals are an extra $50, No water served if you have not purchased food. You will get a middle seat unless you pay extra. Extras today will cost me $250.

### "Zero value for money"
Not Verified |  Absolutely by far the worst experience. Zero value for money. Long lines at the check in. Absolutely understaffed, not to mention worst food ever. Stay away from this cheap airline.

### "not been given free food or water"
I flew with them from LA to London recently. Never in my life have I not been given free food or water on a 10+ hour flight. Of course we could have purchased it but it’s not included in the fare? They also did not provide a pillow or blanket. The headphones had to be purchased to watch movies. I would never fly this airline again, even if it was my literal last option.

### "Absolute rip off airline"
Do not be fooled by low fares unless your flying with a backpack only and dont need to drink or eat in 11 hours! Flights initial cost was nearly half what it ultimately cost! Absolute rip off airline, not Norwegian Airlines in any shape or form! I am going to suggest far worse than that well known UK based cheap airline that flies all over Europe. 500 pounds to just under £1000 and a further £200 charges at airport for slightly (4.6 kg on one and 5 kg cabin bag) overweight luggage! I flew over with Virgin in June and paid £740 including 3 meals and 3 cases and a nice spacious economy seat. The meal that cost £30 was abysmal, wasn't filling and for that money too! A small bit of fish and two potatoes with a green veg with a small biscuit style desert). I am 5ft 4 tall and was cramped in my seat which was so hard, as very little padding. You have to pay for any form of entertainment as well, free with Virgin on way over as it was with United and American last year for less money in February July and August 2022. I would urge you to look at legacy carriers, whilst not cheapest by far the better service in Economy and premium economy. I repeat this is not Norwegian Air who I flew with many times prior to their demise.

### "We had an awful experience"
Not Verified |  We had an awful experience flying with Norse from London to Orlando on July 16, 2023. We stayed in line for 2.5 hours to check in to get our boarding pass (we had already checked in online and still had to wait in line for 2.5hrs). We had to run to go through security to make it on time with small children. We didn't have time to use the bathroom, buy water or eat and we were traveling with children. It was not a pleasure at all flying with Norse. I do not recommend Norse to any of my friends, the employees were rude and stressed out. Even the lady at the counter was rude that the passports were not on the "right page". I had just ran to pass security with two children, had to use the bathroom, didn't eat or drink water and the Norse employee was rude and not understanding. We ordered tapas in the airplane, and we received it 30 minutes before landing. My children were hungry the whole time and did not have time to eat as we landed and threw away since we couldn't got through customs with the food. I will be putting on my Facebook and Instagram with hundreds of followers my experience with Norse. My best wishes for the future of this business.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Not Verified |  First time flying Norse Airlines. I went Premium economy. Seats were comfortable. A lot of movie choices especially on a long flight like this. Food choice was good. Friendly staff on the plane. When they make announcements on the plane a little too cringy for my liking on the excessive explanation ie every time there was some sort of turbulence they would repeat the same announcements which took about 2-3 minutes. Other than that I really enjoyed the flight.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience with Norse. The flight was comfortable with ample leg room for a discount ticket. I didn't buy any meals because the flight was in the middle of the night for my time zone, and the flight itself only ended up being 5.5-6 hours total. I have no issues or complaints, I got to Paris from the US for only $180.

### "Staff was very unorganized"
Horrible, system was down. Staff was very unorganized. Arrived early just to be cut by priority and people who arrived late, priority line barely moved and was treated to last resort. Fly else where.

### "Had a great experience"
Had a great experience with Norse, went with premium economy. It was the same cost as economy from other airlines for same route. The seats were wider and reclined better. We were served drinks on the plane as soon as we got on. We got two meals for our eight hour flight. I received two 187 ml bottles of wine with my meals at no charge. The plane left on time and arrived early in Washington. The priority check in at Gatwick went quickly. We got checked in in about 15 minutes. Much longer check in time for regular passengers. I flew delta from jfk to prague about 10 days earlier via economy and was miserable. Seats were small and cramped. The premium economy on Norse was well worth it. Everyone was very pleasant.

### "won't be rushing back to fly with Norse"
I won't be rushing back to fly with Norse air again. The meals are very small. The meals are tasty but quite pricey. I had chicken & mash. The snack before we landed was Sorrentina tomato and mozzarella, tasty, hot, but tiny! They give you wooden knife, fork, spoon, very hard to cut with their flimsy wooden knife. If you don't order a meal you have to pay for tea and coffee. Normal coffee is $3.50 usd on the plane. They only served drinks twice in 11 hours on the flight from London to Los Angeles. First cup of tea was barely lukewarm. Coffee was hotter but not hot. Exit row was empty, many passengers asked could they move to the exit row after we got into the flight but they were told  only if you pay usd 50 for an upgrade. So three seats in the exit row stayed empty the whole 11 hours. I thought it was a bit mean. Movie selection was the best thing about Norse. I paid extra for an aisle seat in economy - not much room, got up on my feet every hour to stretch. Will definitely chose the competition, instead of going with Norse again, they had a big launch for their July London to USA flights, but the passengers don't get treated to any luxury. Also checkin at Gatwick was very strange, you had to wait to get into the queue for the checkin ... I overheard passengers being told by checkin staff, monitoring the queue.... to get off their mobile phones when they are in the Norse queue - very strange indeed. You have to pre-order & pay for the hot food online before you fly. You have to pay for a blanket and you have to pay for earphones.

### "No meals, no hotel, no compensation"
I flew from New York to Oslo. They checked us in, kept us on the plane for three hours and asked everyone to leave at 3 am. The terminal was empty and not a single representative. Communication only by email and only for the next flight in 2 days. No meals, no hotel, no compensation. No other flight alternatives. If you complain, they just don't reply to your email. People slept on the floor in the terminal for two days! No compensation after that. They just don't answer emails. I sent more than 20 emails and no answers.

### "Boarding pass not available online"
Not Verified | Boarding pass process is not available online so you have to prepare extra hour to wait in line on airport. There is only 1 counter distributing those passes so don't fly ever with Norse!

### "I had a fantastic flight"
I had flown Norwegian long haul many times before so I had a pretty good idea what I was in for. My sister and I had snagged up the flights for a deal, we are good travelers, no checked bags- just cary ons. I selected exit row seating when booking- 6'4 and I really need that extra room and it was so worth it. The plane was freezing but I noticed they were selling blankets for $5 so I think this was a tactic. I am unsure why there is no Wi-Fi onboard. The onboard entertainment had a decent selection with USB changer on screen. I didn't use the inflight entertainment with the limitations of bluetooth headphones - flying with Norse again soon and I did purchase some traditional head phones so I won't struggle to download shows to my phone. All in all they are a budget carrier, I had a fantastic flight both too and from, no food was provided that's an extra $30- but we knew this and came well prepared. Flight attendant was nice and was a hold over from the previous Norwegian Long Haul. If you are used to Norwegian nothing about this airline should surprise you.

### "Line for checkin in Gatwick was insane"
Not Verified |  Line for checkin in Gatwick was insane. Arrived early yet the line still took over 1.5 hours. Completely unacceptable. Manager said she was managing the lines. I completely disagree. They need to hire more checkin people. Upon landing the crew got their bags and disappeared. Over half the plane had to wait another 30 minutes to get their bags before heading to a very long customs line. They need to manage the offloading of luggage to provide to customers in a timely manner.

### "Worst airline, incompetent, missing baggage"
Not Verified |  Worst airline, incompetent, missing baggage. Do not use this company. You think, cheaper tickets, but when you add it all up, you pay more than you pay a reputable airline company. Had to pay for ticket and checked in luggage, giving only 15 kg option for checked in luggage initially. You have to go along with it, you have to pay £30 for a single meal on flight. Then, when your ticket is confirmed, you find there are other baggage choices available but no way of changing your option. You have no choice but to pay extra for choosing any other option. When you are checking in, the staff weighs and checks the size of each n every bag you are carrying. No flexibility, even if you are 100 gms over the weight limit. My daughter flew to Florida with them. This is her first trip to America on her own. Her checked in baggage went missing. She was so distressed at the airport. No Norse staff was available at the baggage claim area. The security guard had to help her. Poor girl was tearful, stressed and anxious and completely besides herself. She was looking forward to going on a youth bus tour. Norse promised to look into it, but it had been 5 days, and still no news. My daughter had essential items, clothes, toiletries, medication, contact lenses, etc, in her checked in baggage. There is no phone number for customer service. Email responses are rubbish. My poor girl is so stressed without her bag, and her trip has started with such a bad experience, thanks to Norse! The company is totally incompetent and very unhelpful.

### "Awful experience"
Awful experience and do not recommend. We had to wait to check in for 2.5 hours because they did not plan on having so many flights leaving around the same time and only having 4 people working. They ran out of all but one meal option - which we had paid for ahead of time to only not be able to eat it due to it being spicy. Drinks were not offered for 5 hours on the plane. When we land, our luggage takes over an hour to arrive and there is no one to tell us what was happening. When I emailed customer service, the only response was - you could have gotten a water for free. Will not fly again.

### "I won’t fly with them again"
Terrible experience flying out of Gatwick, an hour to check in for Premium. Total chaos, calling forward customers whose flights were about to depart, even for Premium. An hour in line just for document check, as we weren’t checking any bags! They need proper online check in! No comparison to the airport experience that Virgin provides at Heathrow. Onboard in Premium is fine, but I won’t fly with them again just because of the high stress airport experience. It also reminds me never to fly out of Gatwick. Norse also do not support TSA precheck/KTN for departing USA. A real pain all around. I won’t fly with Norse again.

### "Do not recommend it"
Would not recommend it. It may look and seem cheaper than other airlines but in Economy Light they make you pay for meals, headphones, blankets, pillows, water, coffee, seat selection, carry-ons, and checked luggage. Can't check in online, so you have to wait in long lines. Horrible communication and customer support and they will try to charge you for every minor thing if something inconveniently happens. Do not recommend it!

### "Non-existent communication"
Terrible customer service, my flight home was delayed for over six hours without explanation which meant I missed a family wedding. Non-existent communication from ground staff. Norse have failed to give an explanation for the delay and after over three months of persistent emailing I have still not received the compensation I am legally entitled to: their default customer service line has told me my complaint is with their 'claims team' but I haven't even received an acknowledgment of receipt from them. I will not fly with Norse again and will tell all my friends and colleagues to do the same.

### "insisted on charging me $72"
This is the worst airline I've flown overseas. My bag fit in the carry on size checker and they still insisted on charging me $72 to take it as carry on. When I asked for them to print my boarding pass the woman threatened to call the police.

### "Back to BA I go"
Not Verified |  First of all, a toddler would have been more capable to complete the job than the so-called cabin crew on board! They are absolutely rude and definitely are in the wrong job. The service is non-existent, and they call it premium economy, but it’s worse than economy on British Airways. The flight was delayed, the TV was broken – and the food was diabolical. Will never fly with Norse Atlantic again. When I asked if they had any other food options, the crew member, I rolled at me and walked away. Back to BA I go.

### "Will fly them again"
Check in and gate agents were friendly but did make me check the size of my personal item in measuring bin. Even if you have checked in online, you still need to do passport verification at the airport before getting boarding pass. Ordered two meals, the first, Salmon was nice but the second I could not finish. Flight was not full so had three seats to myself. Entertainment system was good. Will fly them again. You just have to know what you have to pay for.

### "charged us 120 euros to check a bag"
My flight from JFK to Berlin was fine. No complaints. On the flight back, though, they charged us 120 euros to check a bag that they accepted as a carry-on in the US. We noticed on our flight back to the US that the plane wasn't anywhere close to full and that the overhead bins had abundant space for our bags. This is clearly another budget airline desperate to rip money out of passengers' wallets at the last moment, and I'm happy they're cutting off their JFK-Berlin route in late August. Two stars not one though since their flight attendants are universally lovely - maybe the money getting scammed out of my wallet is going toward actually paying them well.

### "my bag was too large"
I booked two Norse Airlines flights and it is doubtful that I will ever be booking another one. A great budget airline if nothing goes wrong; however, any complaint will go unresolved. My flight from NYC to London Gatwick was all right. You can only receive your official Norse boarding pass 2-3 hours before your flight actually arrives, so expect to be waiting in yet another line at the airport. The movie selection changes often and is lackluster compared to most other airlines. To their credit: they are a budget airline. If you're flying Norse, the goal is to get from point A to point B as cheaply as possible. At least that was my goal, and it was going great! That is until I tried to fly from Berlin to my home country of the United States. Here's where my real complaint begins. At Norse, you are at the mercy of the employee who gives you your official boarding pass (if something goes wrong, you're on your own because they have very few staff members to help you). After waiting in the Norse line for ~1 hour, they finally began signaling for prospective passengers to receive boarding passes. Unfortunately, I approached the most unfriendly woman I have met in my entire life (and I worked in food service for 2 years). From the beginning, she was impatient and rude, rolling her eyes when I asked simple questions and asked if she spoke English. Then she proceeded to claim that my bag was too large to count as a personal item. I was backpacking in Europe for 22 days and boarded multiple flights using budget airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. My backpack fit in all personal item containers, including the Norse Airlines' container from NYC to London Gatwick. It is also worth mentioning that all 3 of my travel companions (with the same size backpacks) were met with Norse employees who happily provided them with personal item tags. This service worker charged me $65 and classified my bag as a carry-on item (it also fit underneath my seat on the flight). When asked for her employee ID number so I could file a complaint, she declined.

### "no phone service or online chat"
The planes are nice but a little cramped for taller passengers like me. The staff were lovely too. The prices seem good to start with but then you realise that everything is extra. I guess it's standard fare for a budget airline. By the time you've added luggage, food etc. you might as well go for a better airline. Even checking in online is extra which means that if you don't want to pay you have to queue - even if you have no hold luggage. I also tried to change the names on some of my tickets but the cost to do this was nearly the same amount as the original tickets - so pointless basically. Same story to change the dates - if you're looking for flexibility then Norse are not for you. I cancelled some tickets in the end - thinking at least I'd get some airport tax back but by the time Norse had taken their "admin fees" off of this it amounted to barely anything (I'm still waiting for this a week later too). My main bugbear with Norse is their communication - there is no phone service or even online chat for problems/queries - you need to raise a ticket online and if you're lucky they will get back to you in a day or 2. This starts an email thread where questions are answered by a slew of different people - sometimes giving conflicting or unclear information. So frustrating as some of my enquiries could have been answered in minutes rather than the 3-4 days that it actually took.

### "rip-off airline"
This was the worst flight experience I have ever had. First, they charged $120 to choose a seat. I understand there's a charge in general for this, but that seemed excessive, but let that pass. What I will not let pass is the fact that Norse charged 59 euros for the pleasure of stowing my carry-on bag over my seat! I have never had to pay to use the compartment above my seat before. Then, I learned that one had to pre-order (at cost, of course) 24 hours ahead of time for a meal. I received no email from Norse about this ahead of time and only discovered this once I got to the gate - so I had nothing to eat for the entire flight. On top of that, in order to use the in-flight entertainment, they charged 6.50 euros for headphones (I couldn't just use my own earbuds, because they wouldn't work). They even charged for water! Virtually nothing was complimentary. I've never encountered such a money-grubbing enterprise in an airline before. And the flight staff was rude on top of it. I will never fly Norse again, and I will make sure to relay my experiences to others so that they are not subjected to this rip-off airline and its nasty staff.

### "lost everything we paid"
Not Verified |  Do not fly with this airline. If something comes up you will lose all of your money. We were supposed to fly to London and our little one’s passport never arrived. And yes, we didn’t start renewal process in the last minute and we paid for expedited shipping. We have been waiting for it since February. No matter how many calls we made to congressmen and passport agency we weren’t able to get in person appointment for same day passport but we were assured that paying $80 for 1-2 days shipping will get us passport on time. Anyway, who ever from passport agency was working on passport have decided to slap us in the face and charge us days before trip but creates shipping label on the day of our flight. We wanted to call this airline but there is no number. We emailed them and explained what happened and asked them just to help us switch our departure flight from Thursday to 2 days later (Saturday) with of course paying some fee. We were offered $940 credit and to book departure and return flight again. Few minutes after that we got new email saying that offering $940 credit was mistake and that they are willing to offer just $240 credit and that we have to book all flights again which in this moment costs over $4000. We lost everything we paid for this trip.

### "service is good if you know what you are getting into"
This was my second time flying with Norse between London and New York. Overall, the service is good if you know what you are getting into. It is a no-frills airline, the Ryanair of long haul. You pay for a ticket and that is it - if you want anything else e.g., bags, pillow, headphones, you have to pay. Staff are friendly on board and the cabin was clean and comfortable. Both flights were extremely punctual. Some issues I found: - Everyone has to check in at the airport, regardless of whether you checked in online or not - I assume this is so they can weigh and measure everyone's cabin baggage ($45) and see if they can charge ($90) to put it in the hold as it is slightly too heavy or large. This caused huge and unnecessary waiting times. Baggage took forever to arrive at LGW, not sure whether this is the airline's fault or the airport but other reviews have mentioned it. Prepare to wait up to an hour after the border force. Marked up prices on everything - $30 for food, $4 for a coca cola.

### "hope you have a better experience"
Not Verified |  
When I depart from New York to Oslo they approved my carry on luggage which by the way I paid extra for the carry on bag fee. But when returned from Berlin to New York with the same carry on bad they said I have to pay 118.03 Euro because it needs to be check in. So frustrated with their money making business. I think this is what you deal if you’re booking a budget airline , got to prepare for their inconsistencies. Never again to fly this Norse Airline. For those who are intend to fly with this airline good luck, hope you have a better experience.

### "wouldn't refund our tickets"
Do not use this airline. They have terrible, anti customer policies and do not deserve your hard earned money. My sister and I had tickets to Paris, but had to cancel our trip due to our grandfather's death. They said that since he didn't pass on the day of the flight, they wouldn't refund our tickets. They have refused to grant a refund of grieving customers because they want a couple hundred extra dollars. Trash customer service.

### "Crew was friendly"
One way flight from Oslo to Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $680 per person (including taxes) which was a bargain. They have economy and premium class and we bought premium and all the options which usually come with a US business class flight. Checked in online 24 hours before departure. Departed and arrived on time. Seats comfortable with lots of leg room and ample recline. Each seat had video monitor and good selection of movies on demand. Had USB port to plug in your phone or laptop. Alcoholic drinks were included. First meal was salmon, mashed potatoes and spinach and chocolate mousse which was delicious. Second meal was ham and cheese calzone which was average. The windows had tint control. Crew was friendly. Premium class was almost full while economy class was only 50% full so several economy class passengers slept in the middle section seats. We look forward to flying again on Norse.

### "comfort aboard is awful"
Greedy company. 160$ extra for 5 kilo exceeding weight, this is unbelievable. The ticket itself is not that cheaper from other company. I tried and it will be first and last. Moreover, the comfort aboard is awful. Luckily, onboard crew is nice !

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever: 140$ for the checked bag (way too greedy). Earphones for 10$ (are you serious?) They charge for everything water, snack. Was surprised toilet was free. No customer service - zero Lost my bag on direct flight and after 24 hours sent me email saying that it wasn’t lost and I didn’t pick it up upon arrival. (We were looking for the bag with 2 persons from lost and found) So they are not going to deliver the bag, you have to go to airport to pick up.

### "No nonsense and professional"
No nonsense and professional. Delayed several hours getting out of JFK, but once you're on it's a comfortable, clean flight. The tint control on the windows of the Dreamliner aircraft kept the ambient light in the cabin nice and dim until the approach into the afternoon light of CDG. If you can manage to keep yourself occupied (i.e. asleep and/or entertained), it's a quick slip across the pond.

### "end-up with exorbitant charges"
Not Verified | Norse tricked me in, with their low "initial" pricing; however, they didn't allow my carry-on on the flight and i had to pay $105.00 to check it in. Bottom line, you pay less initially, yet you end-up with exorbitant charges for anything, even a soda. thank you

### "planes and cabins were fine"
This was I thought a budget airline but by the time I had added the extras ie checked luggage, carry on, meals etc I believe I could have gone cheaper by British Airways, I thought I had checked in on line 24 hours before but was only given a seat number and then had to wait probably 45 minutes in a queue at Gatwick to check in. There was no information about which terminal at JFK. I thought it was Terminal 7 which I'd told my son who was meeting me. In the end it was terminal 1, he had to move his car and pay 2 parking fees. On the return flight I arrived 2 and a half hours before departure time. I had difficulty finding the check in desk as there were no signs at the check in desk I joined a very long queue for check. There were only 3 check in staff and it took 1 and a half hours. I am 77 years old and fortunately quite fit but I pity anyone who is unable to maintain a standing queue for this long. The meals at £25 were quite tasty but miniscule. If I had wanted a blanket for overnight return I would have had to pay. The planes and cabins were fine. I didn' use the entertainment or WiFi

### "crew were very nice"
The crew were very nice and helpful, they were just the best! Served us with such a lovely smile and much more.

### "hard time recommending this airline"
I would have a very hard time recommending this airline. First of all, there is no online check-in option available. Once to get to the airport, you are forced to wait in a very long line to check in. We waited a little over an hour. Secondly, I pre-paid for a carry-on bag. I used the same carry on bag for 10 years with multiple airline without any issues. weight of the bag was about 7kg and way under their 10kg limit. However they made me put it into a metal frame during check-in and my bag was less than 0.5 inches too long. They then charged me another $125 to check my carryon. Meanwhile I already paid a carry on fee when I bought my airline ticket. So I paid twice for my luggage. I contact costumer service to get a refund for the prepaid carry on fee. They said it was non refundable. This airline is a scam. You think you are paying less but in the end you are paying more for a low budget flight. They don’t even offer you water. Beware!

### "7 hour delay while already boarded"
7 hour delay while already boarded. They left us in our seats on the runway the entire time and wouldn’t serve any food or drink “until the aircraft is in the air” - which is never was, the flight was cancelled after 7 pointless hours on the tarmac. The staff were rude and gave us very little information. When we asked what we should do about missing a connecting flight due to the delay, they said “next time book a longer connection between flights”. Worst airline experience of my life.

### "Highly recommended"
Highly recommended. An excellent choice in both directions - Paris/JFK and return JFK/CDG. We were worried after reading the reviews but had an excellent experience. Arrived early both times, luggage arrived very fast and flight crew were great. Great entertainment system and food (it was part of the ticket in our return) was fine. No need to buy it, it’s a relatively short flight. Flights operate from smaller terminals in both JFK and CDG so no lounges and limited options for food, etc. but that also means much faster check in and security on both ends. We were out within less than half an hour from landing. Mild cons: It is a low cost airline so luggage is restricted to what you bought but it’s very straightforward and they were not petty about it.

### "not a pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  The ground staff was rude and combative, but the flight attendants were kind and helpful. The planes were nice. Overall, not a pleasant experience. By the time they have hit you with all the fees, you might as well have flown on a regular airline, in my opinion. Dealing with the fees and staff did not make the trip worth it.

### "one of the best experiences"
Our family chose Norse Atlantic Airways to fly from Europe to USA in March 2023. Having flown dozens of airlines and hundreds of flights, we all agreed this was one of the best experiences. We purchased Premium economy tickets which included seats in front of the plane, priority boarding and 2 meals for the fraction of price we would have paid on other airlines. Check in and other services in Oslo were fast and efficient, boarding was on time, plane was new, etc., but the main difference between Norse and other airlines was attitude. Norse's team really made this trip more special. Besides being professional, there was sincerity. The seats do not recline to a lie-flat position, but the space in Premium cabin seats is huge. It was a decent meal and the crew went the extra mile to find something different for our kids. Our Premium light tickets included 2 pieces of on-board luggage that was enough for our trip. Overall, our experience with Norse Atlantic Airways was great.

### "my second 2.5 hour delay this week"
Not Verified |  Seats are comfy and the staff are nice. They need to be because expect your flight to take off about two and a half hours after you board the plane. I'm actually writing this review during my second 2.5 hour delay this week. Maybe we'll get pretzels for this. Doubt it.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified | There was a computer issue at JFK and the flight was nearly 6 hours delayed. I had to forfeit my flight as this affected my other connecting flight. Norse to this day has not offered ANY refund or credit. Would not use this airline. They just blamed JFK airport for their issues, but haven’t even attempted to give the slightest credit to those this inconvenienced. Poor customer service.

### "be flying with Norse again"
The staff on this aircraft were polite, kind, and very attentive to people around me, and myself who was not feeling very well. They helped me move to a more spacious seating area as soon as boarding was complete. They were understanding and very quick with service. I will definitely be flying with Norse again. Thank you

### "loss of points with online checkin"
First time travelling with Norse. Our business decided to try a different airline than Norwegian to give us a few more options. Nice staff and nice plane but the main issue that makes me reluctant to book for business travel again is the online checkin. It won’t give you a boarding pass. After contacting their support desk (who by the way are very responsive, so bravo), they said you have to get one at the airport. This means queing with all the people who are checking in their bags, even if you’re just flying hand luggage. Adds about another 30 mins atleast with the additional Que and check in at Gatwick airport. Until they can sort out their online check in and provide a good app and digital boarding passes, unfortunately we can’t book with them again. Extra points for speedy customer service but loss of points with online checkin.

### "very civilized way to travel"
I booked premium economy as the final leg of my vacation after a terrible experience with TAP Portugal. Right from the get go, the ground and flight crew were friendly, personable and made me feel right at home. The seats are spacious, very comfortable and recline far without encroaching on your neighbors. The food was fantastic, I had the salmon which came with spinach, bell peppers and mash potatoes with a touch of radish mustard. Drinks are complimentary, so red wine was had. Also added the tapas, not sure i’d recommend it - not terrible, just not that great. Finally, you get charging ports, a fold out entertainment screen, and if you’re a window seat, control of the window shades on the large windows. Having flown a lot, I’d rank Norse as my favourite experience yet. A very civilized way to travel.

### "Absolutely loved the airline"
Not Verified | We traveled from Ft Lauderdale Florida to Oslo December 21-22, Absolutely loved the airline, great flight all the employees were super. My luggage was lost but was delivered to me in Sweden Christmas Eve which was 3 hours away from Oslo Airport. Can't say that about Southwest which is the airline we were supposed to get back to Arkansas the 29th.

### "we don’t recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  My family of four traveled from New York (JFK) to Oslo, with Norse Atlantic Airlines. It is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. It took two hours to check our two bags due to a long line. Our flight was delayed for more than an hour. During a eight hour flight, we were not served water or anything else once. Everything is extremely expensive. Just getting a typical airline blanket is $25, with pillows sold separately. One of our screens didn’t work, and some were glitchy or frozen. Our charger did not work either. When we had finally landed, it took over two hours to receive our luggage. For our flight back, our family’s seats were all spread apart and we had to pay extra per seat to get seats together. Overall, we don’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Amazing value"
Friendly crew, seamless check-in processes. Amazing value. I flew round-trip from JFK-Oslo and look forward to flying with them again. Their planes have modern entertainment TV's per seat. I believe the food/drinks are a la carte but not a deal breaker with how they price their flights.

### "Experienced baggage issues"
Not Verified |  Travelled from London Gatwick to Oslo in September 2022. We were delayed for over an hour at Gatwick firstly because the Flight Crew were awaiting their loadsheet (weight and balance) of the aircraft and then the Captain said there was a further delay because the fuellers had put the fuel in the wrong fuel tank. We eventually left with over an hour of delay. When we arrived at Oslo the baggage took over about 1.5 hrs to arrive and by that time myself and others had missed our internal flights in Norway. Experienced baggage issues on Norse going out to London from Norway. Baggage and all other kind of problems seem to follow Norse. Between the outbound and return flight on Norse I waited 4 hours for my bag. Definitely would not recommend Norse Atlantic Airways.

### "the baggage took forever to arrive"
Travelled with Norse Atlantic Airways in August 2022. Travelled from Oslo to London Gatwick. This flight took just over 2 hours. When we arrived at Gatwick the baggage took forever to arrive and there was no information from the airport or the airline or any representative. People were calling Norse but getting a recorded message and no help whatsoever to where everyone's bags were. Eventually +2.5hrs later the bags came through. Some passengers had already ready left the baggage hall as they thought their bags were lost. Norse are dreadful.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I flew from Berlin Brandenburg Airport to New York JFK Airport and back to Berlin Brandenburg Airport in September 2022 for my vacation. As soon as I landed back to Berlin Brandenburg Airport from my holiday in New York, I noticed that my checked-in luggage did not arrive at the airport. The airline lost my luggage between, it was very difficult to get through to them after not answering emails and calls, then after about 2 weeks, they located my luggage. However, then it took them another 2/3 weeks for them to deliver my luggage because their service is horrible and they were not getting in touch with me regarding my address and information. I tried so many times to call and get an answer from them or an email to check about why my located luggage is not being sent to me, however no answer whatsoever. After contacting some workers on LinkedIn I managed to get some info and got my luggage delivered to me finally! However, when I went to pickup my luggage, I found it partially damaged. Obviously I asked for a compensation form and filled in the amount which was due for items which I had to buy that were in my luggage through the duration that it was missing for about a month. I bought basic day to day stuff like underwear, pants, socks and shirt and some liquids, which amounted to only around 200 euros. Also, I listed down the cost which was due to me for my broken luggage. However, their customer service, afterwards told me that since I got my luggage back, I am due to no money back whatsoever on items that I bought. Absolutely horrible after all the stress and hassle they passed me through with lot's of my stuff missing. That's not all of it, the cherry on top of the cake is that they blamed me for not having a durable enough luggage to withstand transit and that they will not refund for my broken luggage which they broke due to them not doing a simple task of handling my checked-in luggage properly. Horrible experience and customer service. I do not recommend this airline.

### "introductory fares were so cheap"
I was excited to fly Norse. The introductory fares were so cheap that the flight for my family of five came to around the same price as a single return on a direct flight to London with a legacy carrier. We flew MCO to Oslo, spent a night, flew to LON then back through Oslo to MCO two weeks later. The flight was on a brand new aircraft, we did the basic ticket packs, (no food, assigned seating or baggage). I don’t like eating on night flights east, and happy to a la carte on the way back. Flight took off and landed on time, spotlessly clean, good food and entertainment. CEO managing check in on return leg was a nice touch too! My go to for regular MCO - Oslo - LON from now on.

### "refused my boarding"
I came to the gate 23 minutes before the boarding and there 5 employees standing there and advised me that the gate was closed and refused my boarding. I was running from another connecting flight and came to the gate gaping for air and begged literally to let me in since I saw there was a lady still entering the plane but they just refused. I contacted the customer service after and they refused to help and refund anything since the gate crew stated I was late. That was quite a mistreatment that cost me $650 for a new one way flight and hotel and taxi fare for one extra day.
