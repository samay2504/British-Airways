### “Absolutely awful across the board”
Absolutely awful across the board. Flight took off an hour late because there was some issue with the cargo. Service on the flight itself was poor, crew treating passengers like a burden all flight long and seats are absurdly narrow. Finally upon landing, late, after 1 hour of waiting at baggage collection, Air Seychelles reveals they offloaded 60 suitcases before take off they delivered the message with a total 'don’t care' attitude. Never fly with this airline.

### "the last time I use this airline"
On collecting my baggage from a return flight from Mahe to Johannesburg, I discovered that the handle of my suitcase was ripped off. I immediately reported it at Air Seychelles at baggage collection, and was told that someone would be in contact to assit with either repairing the damage or replacing my suitcase. To cut a long story short, had to contact them multiple times as the first report was lost, then had a couple of more rounds with contacting people, eventually had to send photos of the suitcase (twice), to be told at the end of the saga that the damage is minor and I should claim from my travel insurance. I queried this again and no reply. Will be the last time I use this airline and others please be beware that Air Seychelles take no responsibilty of your property while in their care.

### "really did a bad job of these meals"
Everything about the flight was fine, except for the food. The salad was undercooked lentils, which was inedible. The main course choice was chicken, fish or pasta and they were all awful. The desert was a stodgy yellow piece of cake. If Sky Chefs are the food suppliers, they really did a bad job of these meals.

### " my worst flight experience"
Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Mauritius (had to take this as this would be the only direct option with a high price of $300+), and this became my worst flight experience in my life as my original departure time of Apr. 19, 10:00 eventually became Apr. 20, 15:10. A transactional email arrives the night before the flight that the flight will be delayed but new flight time will be released later on, shattering my sleep already as I am in fear that my travel plans will be disrupted (and it did in a serious manner). Had to be at the airport on time nonetheless (as I now know that Air Seychelles will never care about my travel plans and therefore I will have to be at the airport to be at the scene myself) and another email arrives that 13:20 would be the new departure time. But then nothing happens and nobody at the check-in counter knows what is going on except that there is a "discussion" about the flight's fate if it would fly out on 13:20 as planned or not (and it did not). Finally, at around 11:00 an Air Seychelles temporary employee approaches the passengers that the flight is "decided" to be delayed (a quick check on its two A320 Neos reveal that they are flying other routes instead, but no explanations were given at all so how would I know what is happening at all) and that all passengers will have to stay where Air Seychelles sends them to. All passengers end up taking the bus provided by Air Seychelles (after loading their luggage on an open truck's cargo hold) and are all bussed to a terrible resort about 30 minutes away from the airport. Then rooms were assigned arbitrarily (couples were okay but solo travelers were randomly assigned rooms together) and a terrible lunch buffet with only one free non-alcoholic beverage was offered (not even a meal voucher as that would be so much more expensive to the airline). Then we were told by Air Seychelles that the flight could depart any time that day or the day after and that the passengers should wait for the call in their hotel rooms (that is, someone should be in the hotel room instead of being at the beach in front of the resort) as well as frequently consult Air Seychelles Facebook page for updates. Then the hotel calls that passengers should gather by 11:00 the next morning without even telling us what the new departure time would be (had to check myself via the aforementioned Facebook page that the new departure time had been announced as Apr. 20, 15:10). Then the next morning, once again the weird bussing back from the hotel to the airport, and then found out that an Ethiopian B737-MAX8 was there to run the route instead. Checked-in and finally departed at around 15:40, landing in Mauritius at around 18:00 (a whopping ~30 hour delay). Cannot say much about the aircraft and in-flight service as it was provided by Ethiopian Airlines, but it was pretty basic with basic seats without any IFE and a tiny sandwich given during the flight (alcoholic beverages were available though). At the end of the day, my Mauritius travel plans were disrupted without any reimbursement of any kind from the airline for the losses. I heard before that Air Seychelles had financial troubles in the past and now I think understand why. Will never fly again with Air Seychelles, and even give up Seychelles as my vacation destination if Air Seychelles is unavoidable.

### "we are truly grateful"
Not Verified |  We were travelling back to Johannesburg after a vacation in the Maldives when my husband suddenly lost consciousness after about 90 minutes in the air. The cabin crew were outstanding. They found a Doctor on the flight, brought the oxygen, helped administer the oxygen, calmed the family down and were caring and kind for 2 hours. When we landed in the Seychelles, an ambulance was on the runway and the excellent Sara Chang Pen, Guest Service Agent for Air Seychelles, took over. She accompanied us to the hospital and negotiated our admission and treatment there, staying with us for several hours until he was well enough to be discharged. She also booked us into a hotel, organized our passports to be stamped, sent our luggage to the hotel and ensured we were booked on the earliest flight home 3 days later. I do not believe that we could have had better service on any other airline and we are truly grateful for their excellent service.

### "had to reschedule my itinerary twice"
They keep on cancelling the flights. I had to reschedule my itinerary twice before finally cancelling my flight for third time. Avoid.

### "Flight cramped and noisy"
Not Verified | Praslin to Mahe. Over zealous security screening at Praslin when they noticed we had packed a small pack of batteries in our hold baggage. Had to take out every item of clothing until they were found and no time to repack. On check in we thought we had prepaid for excess baggage via our travel agent only to be told it had not gone through. Staff could see that we had completed the process but still charged us the airport price rather than the online price. Staff completely unhelpful and appeared to take great pleasure in making things as difficult as possible. Would not give us any assistance of any contact details. Currently taking up the issue with their customer services and the office of their CEO. Flight cramped and noisy, recommend ear plugs, and very warm. Plus side, it was shorter than most bus journey I normally take. No assistance offered by ground crew getting on or off the plane with flimsy hand rail and low doorway.

### "Air Seychelles is a catastrophe"
We were booked on a one-way flight from Praslin to Mauritius (PRI-SEZ-MRU). The checkin in Praslin was pretty smooth. The lady told us that our baggage is directed to Mauritius, nothing to worry about on Mahé. Great news! After arrival we had to checkin again as the second flight was international. At the counter I mentioned casually that we only have two backpacks as carry on as our checked baggage is transferred to Mauritius. No that is not possible" we were told. You have to pick it up at the baggage claim and check it in again. After some discussions I went back. Luckily a met a couple from the UK that did the same trip as we did. Same problem there. We found an Air Seychelles employee, explained the situation, gave her our baggage tags we got earlier at Praslin and followed her back to the counter. They were having an argue. Unbelievable. Both flights operated by one airline that does not know their internal procedures and processes. After we were told that the baggage is transferred to Mauritius - surprise - the real problems began as my girlfriend was traveling with her wheelchair that comes with electrically powered wheels. We showed them the necessary IATA certificates and technical specs as we always do in that situation around the globe with many airlines. Airlines are generally not pleased to transport batteries in the cargo area due to potential risk of fire. But in this case the batteries are an integrated part of the wheels. You cannot take them off without taking off both wheels completely. So as usual they checked everything and let us finally continue. So far so good. After boarding was finished the captain announced that we were actually early some minutes. But suddenly the lady from the check-in appeared at our seats to tell us that the wheelchair will not be transported by Air Seychelles because an approval was missing. We had no idea what she meant. As I already wrote we had shown them the papers. And by the way we had sent the all the documents five days ahead of the flight as requested by Air Seychelles. We never got a reply to that email. They still insisted an approval was missing. Just to mention again: No issues with the same airline on the first flight segment before... However three to four employees were discussing at the aircraft door. After 30 minutes the captain explained the situation to all passengers via speaker. He said they are organizing the missing approval and are waiting for it. What missing approval and how are they organizing it by themselves when the complained that we did not bring the approval. Simply does not make sense at all. After an hour I accidentally could observe a guy walking right next to the aircraft carrying the wheelchair's wheels with the batteries. Minutes later we took off without further information. After arrival in Mauritius we found the wheelchair in parts lying on the floor in front of the special baggage counter. Some idiots bent one of the shafts that connect the wheels to the chassis. Without any tools and with pure force I could barely fix the shaft. Otherwise our trip had ended at this point. We have never ever experienced that kind of discrimination against people with disabilities anywhere on the globe. Totally unprofessional and completely intolerable. The Seychelles are probably the most beautiful places we have ever seen on earth but Air Seychelles is a catastrophe. Shame on you!

### "Air Seychelles do not respond"
Our flight was booked to fly in December 21st but Seychelles was closed to visitors from South Africa due to COVID. We never flew. Since then I have been asking for either a refund or travel voucher as we are expecting to re-book for December 22. But after several emails and requests Air Seychelles do not respond. What is one supposed to do to get what we paid for?

### Air Seychelles customer review
I had booked flight back from Praslin airport where we had our hotel Lemuria back to Mahe for our international flight. So we booked flight at 5th of may directly in the airport, becouse it was near our hotel. So my trip back to Mahe was like scary movie, and all of a service for the Air Seychelles was awfull. First of all - our flight was booked for 9th may - thats sunday, this is a day off at the airport - so nobody will take phone, nobody will answer you on email, and only service for flight who dont know anything will work at the airport. Be very careful to use their flights on Sundays. In the morning 9th of may at the day of our departure we noticed that a storm comes to an islands, but we saw flights still are going, and nobody told us that something will be wrong (we had flight at 18 -40), so we packed everything and were preparing to leave. Thanks to Lemuria hotel crew at 12 o clock we were told that the airport is closed and there will be no flights today, they also sent their man to have duty in the airport if something else happened, and he called every 30 minutes. Air Seychelles didn't even get in touch with us in that day, didn't answer the phones etc. The ferry that goes only 2 times a day was already sold completely for that day. So we and other passengers had to book boats not to miss their international flights. When we arrived to the airport for our flight, planes from Air Seychelles still were not flying, and we get back home. After we get home I sent email and all information air Seychelles manager asked us for ticket refund, and we get only about 30% of money for our tickets, because we were charged for "no show" at non working airport, and refund charge. That's a total disgrace. If you use them you should have some additional money for private boats. Be ready for "no calls, no service" at critical situations, cause you may get to the airport and it would be closed in case of weather and other transport (ferry, boats) will be unavailable at the time you noticed it.

### "Below average service"
Seychelles to Johannesburg. Below average service from in flight attendants. Appalling attitude, inability to carry out basic duties. Do not respond when they are buzzed, and expect you to walk to the back of the aircraft to get what you need eg a glass of water. This is a problem as the lavatory is also at the back, so at any given time theres a queue of passengers trying to navigate through the narrow aisle at the back of the aircraft. Furthermore, they are absolutely not child friendly, and made the flight very unpleasant for me and my family.

### "Crew rather reserved"
Not Verified | Johannesburg to Seychelles. Online check-in for Codeshare flight from Etihad is not possible. Airplane is a brand new 32N, no issues there. Seat comfortable, even for a five-hour flight. Wifi-based IFE has a very limited choice of films. Crew rather reserved and looked a bit bored and annoyed at the same time - friendly if approached though. Crews English is tough to understand. Loved the bright red blankets!

### "forced to go to hospital"
Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe. My wife and mother-in-law travelled with our 5 year old son and 1 year old son. While flying from Johannesburg to Seychelles, our younger sons cries more than normal day in home. My family reached Seychelles island and cabin crew decided that my baby has high fever and not to show of next connected flight. My family was forced to go to hospital and the doctor decided that it is not high fever and having ear infection. First of all the airport doesn't have any facilities to check this kind of basic things. While coming back from airport, the lady who followed with my wife forcefully taken the medical report from my wife. May be they can use that for getting some extra money somehow. The drama starts now. Initially they told that they will arrange everything, but they changed the decision. I was in south Africa and I never had a medium to contact with my wife and airport wifi also not working as like other. So I couldn't able to tell everything at right time, so unfortunately I don't have Dr report. Seychelles support staff said that only option is to book the accomodation and book Srilankan Airways which is the next flight to Mumbai and will be reaching Mumbai after 36 hours or something. So ideally we need to book everything from our pocket and even they will not help for getting taxi to the hotel. My family has three check in bag and two child. With help of my friends here in SA, I immediately booked Emirates flight and my wife told me that she will wait in airport for 8 hours for emirates. My family waited 8 hours without anything to eat. You cant get anything to eat if your family waiting for the flight that time. I am waiting for my family check in from Dubai.

### "Didn’t get to see the Seychelles"
Not Verified |  Well, we never got to actually fly. It was supposed to be a two-day break in the Seychelles on the way from Madagascar to the UAE. First it became a one-day break because the airline changed the flight from the morning to the evening. It then sent several emails asking to bid for an upgrade. But on the day of the flight they didn’t bother to tell us that they had decided to cancel it. We showed up in the airport and were in limbo for nearly 24 hrs about when and whether we would fly on. At the end we bought new and more expensive tickets on South African Airlines to get to work on Monday. Didn’t get to see the Seychelles. Didn’t get our money back. And have yet to be able to reach anyone at Air Seychelles — the call center doesn’t appear to be staffed. Avoid at all cost.

### "cancelling flight with 3 days notice"
Not Verified |  Mauritius to Seychelles. Nearly ruined my honeymoon by cancelling a flight with only 3 days notice. Had to scramble to book / cancel hotels and transfers. Will never use them again and will advise friends and family not too either.

### "avoid Air Seychelles!"
I purchased a ticket directly from Air Seychelles for Mauritius to Mahe In the end, I was not able to travel, and so I did not make the flight. I have been trying to get in touch with them about a refund (not a full refund but a refund of all fees and fares less some penalty), but all they did was send me an automated reply saying that they were working on it. I even tried to get in touch with customer service, whom I previously had some contact with about another ticketing issue. And all she said this time around was that she would refer my case to the "appropriate department", which never happened, as this happened in March and we are into July now. So in one word, avoid Air Seychelles!

### "most unfriendliest you'll meet"
Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe. The staff in flight and at the airport must be the most unfriendliest you'll meet. For the entire flight of passengers there's 2 people at 1 counter doing the check in. Takes 45 mins. For a flight half full. The guy at the luggage scan asked us to make it quick as the flight is leaving as if it was our fault theres only 1 counter receiving check ins. There is no time in transit, you're shipped from 1 flight to the other. There is no place to smoke. But was advised by a guy that smoking in the toilet isn't permitted but allowed. It's the smallest airport I've been to with barely any facilities. Taking all this into consideration I see no reason why they should have an attitude. Flights itself are clean but outdated in entertainment. If you not fussy this is a cheap alternative. If you need to travel in some comfort pay more.

### "Worst service encountered"
Abu Dhabi to Mahe. Worst service we have ever encountered. We booked a vegan meal by email and received confirmation for both flights (return). On the first flight we were told that they had no food for us, as in they never received any food that is meant to be for us in the first place. On the second trip back, we double checked with check in staff about our meals and they said there was nothing mentioned next to our names on the system! we then asked them to add it again and they did while we were standing. Again on the plane we were told our names were not on the list to begin with so no food for us one more time. Food aside, we were moved to from an 8pm flight to 10pm flight without prior notice. Also, we knew other groups that were boarding the same flight as us by they were not shifted but they kept them on their same flight. Initially we were told it was due to system error and all 8pm passengers were shifted to 10 pm but if that was the case then how come we were the ONLY ones shifted?? Will never ever fly again. Also, many people in the airport were complaining about having their flights being shifted TWICE! Avoid this service.

### "My luggage never arrived"
Johannesburg to Mahe. I have never received such disgusting service as with Air Seychelles. My luggage never arrived from Johannesburg and I had to deal with a rude lady in Mahe who told me my bag would be on the flight the following evening and sent to La Digue. They gave me a number to follow up on that when finally someone did answer they just said they don't know where my luggage is and put the phone down on me. They put the phone down on my mother as well. Surprise my luggage never arrived.

### "extremely rude and unhelpful"
Johannesburg to Mumbai via Seychelles. Terrible airline to fly with. They will try to scam money out of you any way they can. Staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. Do yourself a favor and pay a little bit more to go with a reputable airline.

### "Its the worst service"
Johannesburg to Seychelles. On the 4.5 hour flight the cabin flight attendants made only one trolley run with food and drinks, and that only after two hours in the air. By contrast, Air Namibia on a 1.5 hour flight do a drinks run, a food run and still a coffee tea run afterwards during the flight. Kenya Airways on a 4 hour run from Johannesburg do several drink runs in addition to the food run during that time. Air Seychelles cabin staff are not friendly and do not really care about the passengers. Its the worst service I have ever had on a flight.

### "we missed connecting flight"
Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe, connecting to Hyderabad with Jet Airways. Flight was delayed in Mahe Airport for 4 hours then we missed connecting flight in Mumbai and we waited more then 5 hours in Mumbai Airport as they booked flights. There was no one to help us, it was bad customer service. Passengers were struggling to get the tickets for connecting flights. They made us to stood at counter for more then 2 hours, tickets had to be booked before we reach Mumbai Airport but they booked later we reached in Mumbai airport. Accommodation must be provided if there is a delay for more then 4 hours, but they didn't provide anything and didn't respond well in Mumbai Airport.

### "a horrible experience"
Me and my husband had a horrible experience flying Air Seychelles from Mauritius to Mumbai via Mahe. Particularly poor was the flight from Mahe to Mumbai. At Mahe airport when we asked for a seat selection, we were rudely turned down. We could see other people standing behind us get the front seats. This was unfair and uncalled for. To top it off on the 4.5 hour flight from Mahe to Mumbai we were not even given blankets. When we asked about the blankets, the cabin crew told us that they had limited supply. Complaints to management fell on deaf years. All they offered were 5000 measly miles which could be cashed in on our next flight with Air Seychelles. Avoid if you can.

### "not a good experience"
Not a good experience with Air Seychelles from Durban to Mumbai via Seychelles. Flight to Mumbai cancelled once we landed at Seychelles airport. Staff very unfriendly. stranded overnight. On return, staff had to be called several times to ask for blankets. No choice as to meal as meat was finished. TV screen never worked. Despite sending an online complaint, I still wait for a response. Their service seems to be very bad. No apology for the cancellation of the flight which affected our entire itinerary. I have completed the online survey and send a personal email but no acknowledgement or response. Will never use this airline or recommend it to anyone. I will stick with Emirates despite the longer route

### "worst flight I've had"
Seychelles to Mumbai. The worst flight I've had. After a 3.5 hr delay, they refused to provide any assistance and staff was too confused to help us at Mumbai. Would recommend taking some other airline rather than wasting your money on this one.

### "experienced such a bad service"
Antananarivo to Abu Dhabi via Mahe. I have never experienced such a bad service! Lots of delays,mechanical problems with aircraft. No clear communication what was happening with the engine problems and updates so very stressy for all passengers to make connections. Very outdated aircraft. Problems with boarding pass issuing for many passengers while transiting in Seychelles! Frustrating with inadequate ground staff follow up! Halfway the food service some meals where already out of stock. Super rude check in at Antananarivo Airport. I have a silver frequent flyer card from Etihad which is their partner and normally my allowance was 40 kg. I arrived with a surfboard back and had to take out 8 kg as they said they only allow 32kg. My other bag was already checked in so i had to take it all as carry on.There where laughing and showed no mercy at check in-no humanity. I can't understand why a world class airline like Etihad teams up with them. This is island style aviation at its worst! Will take my business somewhere else.

### "had a horrible experience"
Mauritius to Mumbai via Mahe. We had a horrible experience flying Air Seychelles. Particularly Mahe to Mumbai. We took Air Seychelles flight from Mauritius to Mahe - at Mahe airport for our onward flight from mahe to mumbai, when we politely requested to give us seats in the front of the economy - we were rudely turned down. How difficult is it to give 2 tickets in the front where in the tickets that were given to us were in the last and second last row - not even together - really unprofessional, unfair, rude. To top it in the 4 and half hour flight from Mahe to Mumbai we were not given the blankets. When asked about the blankets, the cabin crew told us that they had limited supply and they gave it to seats 6 to 15. The cabin crew did not even come and ask us about disembarkation form.

### "worst air travel experience"
We had the worst air travel experience with Air Seychelles, flying from Antananarivo, Madagascar to Kathmandu, Nepal on 11/4/2016. We had two transfers - Mahe and Mumbai. We were treated like illegal immigrants and forced to stay at the airport overnight because the supervisor on ground in Mahe. We flew from Tana to Mahe. When we arrived Mahe, they refused to issue us boarding passes for our next two connections (Mahe-Mumbai-KTM) because we did not have onward tickets after Nepal. We explained that we are backpackers. We travel by land mostly and plan to cross the border by car from Nepal to India. The supervisor told us she will check and disappeared. When we asked about our flight, she said we still have time and she will not leave us behind. We waited in the airport until 9:10pm when our connection flight to Mumbai was boarding. By that time, we've purchased our onward ticket from KTM to Delhi as we cannot afford to miss the flight. We showed our ticket to one of the staff. The first thing she told us is we cannot boarding our flight because the gate is closed! Then when she phoned the supervisor, who demanded to see our India visa, which was completely irrelevant. We waited there thinking the supervisor will come back to us, but they just let us miss the flight like that! Even after we had all the documents they asked for. In the end, the supervisor never showed up and they did not let us board our flight even though we had the onward tickets. We were dumped in the airport without any explanation. We did not know why we need to show the airline our India visa while we are just flying to Nepal and what should we do for the flights that we've missed. When the supervisor showed up around midnight, she said we will have to wait for the next day to rearrange the tickets and just disappeared again. They tried to send us to a hotel but it was too late, the immigration officer didn't let us pass. Therefore, we were forced to sleep in the airport. The next day we spoke with numerous staff about our issue, including the supervisors and duty managers. None of them helped. In the end, we were able to board the flight that day withy the same documents we had a night before, which means we could've boarded our original flight!

### "would definitely recommend"
Johannesburg to Seychelles. First time travelling with Air Seychelles and I was very impressed. Ground staff was very helpful. Food was excellent, cabin staff was friendly. The flight was comfortable and there was a variety of entertainment on board. Great airline would definitely recommend.

### "pay more and go by a  reliable airline"
I wanted to bring to your attention the pathetic experience I have recently had flying Air Seychelles and its partner Etihad on the Mumbai-Dar Es Salaam-Mumbai route. I  booked a confirmed Air Seychelles Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Mahe return flights on January 2016 for July 2016. A month later we were informed that Air Seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi. I confirmed with the Mumbai office of Air Seychelles and the flight was confirmed. A week before flying I checked with Etihad online and they informed me that my Abu Dhabi to Dar es Salaam sector was not confirmed. Neither Air Seychelles nor Etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation in spite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in January! If I had not followed up I would have been stranded in Abu Dhabi. The Air Seychelles ground office in Mumbai was equally clueless. Repeated emails from them to Air Seychelles and Etihad (on highest priority I was told) went unanswered. Only after I threatened to take action did they swing into action and book us on Kenya Airways. As a gesture we were informed that a special request for upgrade to Business class has been put but of course as expected there was no record on the system during check in. Also the complimentary chauffeur service from Etihad was not available as the PNR was 'not registered' in the system. The only explanation that I was offered was 'a system glitch'. This is irresponsible of both Air Seychelles and Etihad. I will definitely not be flying either airline. I would rather pay more and go by a more reliable airline like Emirates or Qatar Airways. Both Etihad and Air Seychelles promise a lot but once the money is exchanged forget their responsibility.

### "hardly any leg room"
Uncomfortable, hardly any leg room and the cabin was so hot that it made it almost unbearable to be on the flight from Abu Dhabi to the Seychelles. However, on the return flight with Air Seychelles it was much better with a cooler cabin and much nicer staff. There were not as many passengers on the way back so we got to lay across the seats and sleep. Don't bother getting the front seats have don't have anymore room than the ones behind.

### "food served is appalling"
Abu Dhabi to Mauritius via Mahe. Previously the schedule and food were much better. One could leave around 9.20 am same day and arrive around 16.00 hours. Now, with Air Seychelles, one has to leave residence at 11.00 pm to reach destination around 12.20 next day, ie very odd hours. On top of that the transit time in Mahe, is now more than 2 hours. Seychelles has plenty of quality fish, yet the food served on both legs is appalling, only 2 breakfasts. Overall, only the dessert was good. It is preferable to pay partly for the food and obtain better quality.

### "faced too much problems"
First of all while booking online, only Credit Card payments are allowed - they don't allow netbanking or debit Card payments. No Option of changing your meal or seat preferences after booking. No Option to enter loyality Programme Details after booking. No option of online checkin - real shame who has design this Website. Before flying itself faced too much problems.

### "service very slow"
On original check in at Durban could check in baggage but SAA could not print Air Seychelles boarding pass. Re-check in at Johannesburg very slow with long queues, although very pleasant staff. Aircraft showed lack of cosmetic maintenance despite being fairly new such as loose seat pockets. Decent legroom and A330 seating configuration 2-4-2 preferable to Boeing. Service very slow after take off, first hour spent handing out immigration forms. Food was good but drinks, water or wine, in tiny quantities with no offer of refill. No walk around service after meal, although call button was responded to. Reasonable flight but do not be taken in by "Creole experience" punted on their website.

### "friendly staff"
Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Praslin Island. Friendly staff, but a tiny plane (as it was a 10 minute inter-island flight), so small that I couldn't stand up, but it was clean and new. The flight was smooth, and non-eventful. The seats weren't comfortable, and there were arranged in a two-one layout. The plane's livery needs a mention - it was one of the best I've seen.

### "delighted to end our flight"
Johannesburg to Praslin via Mahe with Air Seychelles. Our flight departure time was at 14h00 and the arrival time in Mahe very close to midnight. From Johannesburg the service was extremely slow as our trays were cleared more than an hour after the service commenced. I will not even comment on the food served as my tray went straight to their exit bin. The departure time from Johannesburg is clearly problematic if one considers the crew on duty had just come from Seychelles and with a turnaround of possibly an hour or less, they must have been on duty from very early morning. It would be interesting to know whether the same crew returns the aircraft or whether there was indeed another crew returning to Seychelles. If a different crew did duty on the return flight then their tardy service is unforgiveable. If the reverse is true, then surely their hours on duty exceeded the norm. For folk travelling from South Africa and seated in the economy class, sleep well the night before your departure. Do not try and extend your seat and then expect the passenger behind you to be happy having a stranger sleeping on their lap - when service starts you have to be asked to please place your seat in the upright position. On our return the menu was just as terrible - fancy being told they do not have the omelette which is first on their very fancy menu card and your choice is frittata or bread pudding for breakfast. The service was better, the crew were well trained but the noise from passengers and children was chronic, we at times wished their was an escape route and a parachute available. We have travelled to many destinations on various flights - longer flights do deserve the extra charges which we willingly pay, but never have we been so delighted to end our flight. Mahe Airport is in serious need of better seating and air conditioning - being the departure point from all the islands. Praslin Airport was cleaner and better equipped.

### "friendly efficient crew"
Flew Air Seychelles from SEZ to BOM. Purchased an upgrade at the lounge in Mahe Airport - handled in a professional manner. Seat comfort ok for 4hr 30min flight. Entertainment was Etihad ebox so there was plenty of choice. Dinner served was excellent - fish roulade, chicken curry. South African sauvignon blanc was good. Friendly efficient crew. wifi and sms available. On time arrival into Mumbai.

### Air Seychelles customer review
We flew AUH-SEZ and return on Air Seychelles operated by Etihad Aircraft. The flights were both very empty with no more that 35 passengers on each sector. The flights left on time or even 30 minutes early as we found when leaving Victoria. The crew on both sectors were very friendly and professional. The quality of food was good on all flights and the crew continued to come round with water throughout the night. The entertainment was from Etihad's ebox selection which was very good and had an up to date film television and music selection on demand.

### Air Seychelles customer review
We flew JNB to Seychelles on 21 April and back on 1 May 2015. The Cabin was good and the seat comfort very good - not completely lie flat but very close and much more comfortable than Emirates Business Class. Service is what you would expect from Business class. Outward bound trip from Johannesburg was good. Nightmare was on Inbound trip. The flight departure time was 8am but at around 5pm the evening prior to the flight they sent an email out to the travel agents that they have moved the departure time 1 hour earlier. They didn't contact the customers themselves and no one with authority at Air Seychelles was available to talk to. For people on Mahe the 1 hour earlier departure wasn't the end of the world but for people on the outlying islands who relied on a regular ferry service there was no way to make our flight and flights for next 3 days were fully booked. In the end we had to charter a boat to get us to the airport on time we were the lucky ones - others missed their flight completely. It seems that customer service is not something Air Seychelles understands. The flight back was uneventful except that 2 of the seats in business class were out of order and that the cabin staff were extremely noisy talking non stop at high volume throughout the flight. Sleeping wasn't easy but they just didn't care.

I fly to Seychelles frequently and unfortunately as a Silver member of Etihad I fly Air Seychelles from Abu Dhabi to Seychelles. The services are terrible. Firstly they talk way too much all those announcements! From fasten your seatbelts to marketing their duty free it is in 3-4 languages. They start in English them French then Creole. Safety info presented in English and Arabic. Fasten seatbelts warning start with Chinese. The whole flight you listen to this nonsense. Entertainment system is very limited food is not great either. The most annoying thing for me is that as a Silver member I have never been able to upgrade with miles. They will not do it at the airport and even the manager on duty does not know how this is done I find it very annoying what is the point of being the frequent flyer then?

Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong return using Air Seychelles. The journey was made easy by the service provided by the air crew. The food was nice there was a decent selection of drinks and the seats were comfortable. I would travel with this airline again and I would definitely recommend. I am a Gold card holder with Etihad and was initially dubious about flying with a connected airline.

In October this year I flew AUH-HKG-AUH HM86 and HM87. Although slightly late leaving Abu Dhabi due to a catering issue the entire experience with Air Seychelles was brilliant. Although they were not particularly new A330-200 aircraft's and the entertainment system a bit old and limited I found the cabin crew quite possibly the best in the business. They were an energetic and enthusiastic crew working hard to give excellent customer service to passengers. The flights were not full on either sector so having 2 seats to myself was great and comfortable. After friendly chats about the airline with some of the crew in the galley I was brought champagne and chocolates to my seat a lovely gesture. Air Seychelles was a stark contrast to their partner airline Etihad.

We travelled AUH/SEZ/AUH April 2013. The flights were both excellent. On time comfortable and with enthusiastic cabin crew. Even addressed by name in economy class!

### Air Seychelles customer review
Possibly the worst mid haul airplane I've been on. Was booked through Etihad (superb airline) but got Seychelles instead! Frankly it felt like Ryanair or Easyjet. Give it the widest berth! I'll even avoid Etihad to avoid the chance of this tin pot airline.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Flew JNB-SEZ and return. On both ways we had the same aircraft an older but very well maintained A330. The seats in economy are very comfortable and the service and catering were outstanding. Even the toilets were cleaned several times during the flight. Only the inflight entertainment could be better but I had my own iPad.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Flights in economy from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi via Mahe on 27 March. On time excellent service comfortable seating and adequate entertainment. Was a joy to travel with them and transfer at the Seychelles airport easy. Airport is old and small - just a short walk to plane - not much to do there but fine for transfer. Highly recommended. Disgraceful service.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Travelled with them from Dar es Salaam to Mumbai on 23 Dec return 4 Jan 2015. Inflight service from Dar to Seychelles was awful. We had ordered chicken meals instead were given pasta. Because of the time factor and that they had only 2 attendants to serve 120 passengers they didn't respond to our call and when they did it was as if they were doing us a favour. Seychelles to Mumbai and back the service was good.

### Air Seychelles customer review
After waiting in a very long slow que we were told that our flight from JHB to Seychelles was delayed 3 hours. We were given lunch vouchers for Jackson's or Mugg and Bean. Jackson's would not honor the voucher. Once again we had to queue for a long time before we could board the aircraft. We have a 6 year old and should of been allowed to join the front of the queue. Nobody from Air Seychelles assisted us. Immigration on Mahe are extremely rude and the luggage took forever to come through. After all the delay and run around they lost my sons stroller which was only found after all the passengers had left the terminal. No apology from any of the staff at the airport. Disgraceful service.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Seats in economy are very comfortable with enough leg room. Unfortunately the staff are not well trained and rude. My airhostess required light was on for the almost entire 5 hour flight from JNB to Seychelles as I was trying to request a glass of water for my son eventually my husband went to the kitchen where they were standing and obtained a glass of water. When they served lunch they would serve 3 rows and then start clearing plates from the first row! That is how slow the service was!

### Air Seychelles customer review
AUH-SEZ round trip on A332 great service very polite staff food was tasty and plentiful. You cannot check- in online but you can request a seat. Even though they received the plane last year it has old IFE has limited movies around 8 and few audio channels. Some screens were not working. They will receive another A332 this year wishing will have better IFE. Good experience I would travel with them anytime.

### Air Seychelles customer review
We were due to fly at 19.30hrs the flight was diverted to Madagascar due to bad weather. We were kept in the terminal until 02.00am. None of the staff knew what was happening. They offered us food vouchers at 00.30hrs the queues for the one food kiosk were so large that it closed before all passengers could get their food. Staff did not give information and were rude. The plane landed from Madagascar about 01.00hrs but they didn't tell us they shipped us off to a hotel at 02.00am. The next day the girl at the desk just put our hand out for my ticket. No apology for the delay no smile. We ended queuing at Mahe for a further 3hours because they were unable to confirm our connections. Once again no-one giving water to passengers we were left like cattle just stood there. I have family in Seychelles but won't be going back until BA return or I'll fly Condor from Frankfurt next time.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Service was excellent staff friendly meals were good. Boeing 767-200 was very very old. My son went to put his seatbelt on and it came off in his hand. The seat adjacent to that one had a table that wouldn't stay up. They do need new equipment but flight was otherwise uneventful.

### Air Seychelles customer review
LHR-SEZ outbound in Pearl via Milan return in Economy via Rome. Very unique feel to this airline it's a small airline serving a small population plus tourists. Impressed by food service in both classes one of the best breakfasts I have had in Business Class and on the return offering 2 hot meals on a day flight was impressive. Staff were very friendly the whole thing did seem a little dated but in a good way. The IFE is still overhead TV screens with very lame films. The stops in Italy make the flights long but not too bad.

### Air Seychelles customer review
We had to travel to France from Gatwick to catch our flight. Staff are warm friendly and helpful. I have never come away from a flight thinking how awful it was.

### Air Seychelles customer review
I flew Air Seychelles (code share with Air France) Business class from Paris to Mahe. I regularly fly Business and I have to say on this particular flight the service was as good if not better than many of them. The crew were very good the service was excellent and the food great. Beds were 95% flat (not enough incline to notice). Even the comfort pack had organic creams and oils flower essences etc. I cant comment on the entertainment as I worked and slept most of the flight but I remember being impressed with the overall service from beginning to end. I flew again a week later again in Economy which seemed about average in comparison to other airlines.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Paris to the Seychelles. The cabin itself is in good condition. the staff seemed a bit awkward and on the return flight was the entire crew were rude and arrogant. Food was as expected in the Economy. Despite seat reservation I had a different seat in the middle of three. I got no answer as to why my seat was changed.

### Air Seychelles customer review
The planes were very old - on our return flight the notice about life vests was in Hungarian. We paid £1000 each to travel business class in conditions that might have been acceptable many years ago but came nowhere near what one expects in 2011. The cabin looked tired carpets and seats scruffy and cabin crew off-hand. The food was below par particularly breakfast on the home run. We were delayed 4 hours at Mahe in 80 degree heat waiting for an incoming flight from Zanzibar.

### Air Seychelles customer review
I flew to Mahe from London Heathrow via Milan. Everything was done on time and service was excellent. Crew were friendly and took great care of my sick mother thought the flight. I really enjoyed the flight and will recommend the airline to anyone who wants to travel to the beautiful Seychelles.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Originally booked our flight from Chennai (India) to Seychelles but were sent an email 4 weeks before departure saying this route had been cancelled and we were now flying out from Singapore. Air Seychelles paid the difference but we then had to fly into Singapore from Australia and lost the cost of our original flight to Chennai. We feel we should have been informed about this when we first booked and this would have saved us a lot of money. Apart from that we were pleased with the service of Air Seychelles. The service on board was excellent the food was pleasant and the comfort was of a superior class to many other airlines we have flown. Plenty of leg room and as the plane was only half full we were able to have two seats each. Personally we would recommend Air Seychelles to anyone but the flight to Singapore is only 6-7 hrs long so we have not experienced a really long flight. An enjoyable experience and we will definitely go the Seychelles again on Air Seychelles.

### Air Seychelles customer review
In April 2011 we were booked Johannesburg-Mahe return. On the way to Seychelles we left with 3.5 hr delay losing all the further connections from Mahe to other Seychelles islands. On the return we arrived at the airport very early in the morning only to find out that the flight was cancelled and will fly only next evening. Did not care to tell us the night before knowing our location in Mahe! Disgusting indeed! They offered us to spend the night at the worst (and cheapest) hotel !The hotel was closed a month later because of sanitation problems even based on Seychelles standards. I complained to the Customer Service no answer at all.

### Air Seychelles customer review
LHR-SEZ-LHR. It's true that there aren't personal TVs like on Virgin or BA but this wasn't particularly important to me - I'd rather read a book. The food was tasty and drinks are free. My only niggle is that it wasn't that clear that we would be stopping.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Seychelles to Paris. A middle age Boeing 767 clean and seems to be well maintained. No PTV's which is now a must have. Seat pitch okay crew was nice and professional. The food was excellent aperitif was served with Champagne and all beverages free of charge.

### Air Seychelles customer review
SIN-SEZ-SIN avoid Air Seychelles! After paying for my flight they sent an e-mail (without a subject even) to inform me that they've completely changed their flight schedule (by two days). This would make me miss my international connection back home to the US from Singapore. Now they refuse to refund my credit card and are offering me a bank transfer! And to top it off there's no form of compensation or assistance in any way. They have just left me high and dry.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Very disappointing when you think how much they charge. We had a super holiday in the Seychelles but had to return to the UK on Air Seychelles. Delayed in Frankfurt for 3 hours the cabin was very scruffy and worn. Not recommended - they did not even have the courtesy to respond properly when I e-mailed my complaints.

### Air Seychelles customer review
SIN-SEZ B767-200.Meal served very tasty. Aircraft clean and seats weren't too bad in terms of comfort. Flight only half full. No seatback AVOD but main screen showing movies on old VHS reel. Impressed with service and professionalism of crew. Water runs by crew through flight. Whilst not near the standards of larger airlines I was impressed with flight and Air Seychelles overall.

### Air Seychelles customer review
CDG-SEZ-CDG Business Class. We traveled on the (only) B767 with the new business class seats (angled lie flat). These seats are a great improvement compared to previous Pearl Class seats. Outward flight on time inward flight with 1h delay due to late arrival of plane (from CDG) and slow boarding at SEZ (due to passengers having to walk in heavy rains on the tarmac to reach jet). Food and wine so-so. Nothing terrific but strangely enough on CDG-SEZ meals were not at all what was shown on the menu (staff apologized). Personal DVD players given for entertainment - provided adequate offering of movies. Overall a decent experience in Business Class.

### Air Seychelles customer review
CDG-SEZ-CDG. My wife and I along with 200 other passengers were held up for 4 hours in the SEZ terminal for SEZ-CDG waiting for passengers to arrive from one of the other islands. The staff were totally incompetent in every way possible. The flight was held up because there was a problem with one of their other planes and Air Seychelles decided to boat them over to SEZ holding us all up. My wife and I missed all of our connecting flights and had to pay significant fees to change all of our tickets to get home 8 hrs later than we were originally planning to. Air Seychelles staff were useless throughout this process. They kept bumping the flight departure time up one hour at a time reassured us that things would be handled (which they weren't) and began to lie to us to keep us quiet. Every request we made to speak to a supervisor was completely dismissed and ignored. Their choice to inconvenience 200+ passengers for so few to cover their airlines obligations is despicable.

### Air Seychelles customer review
LHR-SEZ-LHR for our honeymoon. Flight out was okay - 767-200 aircraft was ancient there were a scattering of CRT monitors showing three films which were difficult to watch without a revolvable head crew inattentive and bored looking. Returning on a 767-300 we were first in the queue for check-in because we we wanted to try to get exit aisle seats which we were told we had been given but when we boarded we found ourselves right in the middle of a section in the middle row. If we'd been told this when we checked in this I'd have understood but we were obviously disappointed to have been lied to. I mentioned our dismay to a crew member who said she would speak to the ground staff and get back to me but she didn't bother. Apparently seats are pre-allocated on the return leg so make sure you try to organise this on the way out. My seat was broken so wouldn't stay in the upright position much to the dismay of the person sitting behind me. There was a projector showing the film which would have been an improvement on the tiny CRTs on the way out but wasn't because the image had massive horizontal stripes running through it and the colours were completely out. The staff were surly and rude and mostly ignored you. I called for service and was responded to two hours later. They stood at the back chatting and you pretty much had to physically grab them in order to get their attention. The plane was knackered one of the films broke and had to be restarted and when the announcements were made the film kept playing so you'd miss chunks of it. The food was awful; the dinner like school leftovers breakfast consisting of grey-egged tortilla and chicken that looked like it had been condemned. The only benefit of Air Seychelles is that the fleet is currently so ancient the seat pitch is fair which I'm sure they'll change because according to the inflight magazine the fleet will be upgraded.. Their staff need some proper training and to learn the importance of customer service. Any decent airline would have sacked most of them by now. Very disappointed.

### Air Seychelles customer review
LHR-SEZ-LHR Economy. Quite simply the worst flights ever. The plane did not offer the level of comfort we have come to expect from other airlines on long haul flights. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped and could do with reupholstering. IFE is of the old fashioned type with screens in the middle of the cabin. Film choice limited. We were sitting in window seats and because of the angle the screen took on a green/yellow hue. The cabin crew were bordering on hostile (both legs) and passengers were made to feel like they were an inconvenience. On the return leg one member of the cabin crew dropped a full food tray onto a passenger. She did not say anything at all to him and offered no apology (but she did go and get him some tissues for him to clean up.) ( The outgoing flight was nearly full but the staff managed to put all their belongings onto the back 2 rows that were unoccupied so that they could spread out when they took a break. Passengers were told that they could not use these seats. The staff had a major attitude problem on both legs. The food was virtually inedible. Customer services at Mahe - made a point of visiting the Air Seychelles customer services office to complain about the outgoing flight. On the 3 occasions we visited the office was empty. When we did finally manage to speak a representative they listened to our complaint nodded a lot never offered an apology. The day before we flew home we managed to speak to another Air Seychelles rep who was able to move our seats to the centre aisle and block off the spare seat to give us a little more space which is what we had asked for and was a satisfactory outcome. Still no apology though. They handed out customer satisfaction questionnaires on the return leg. I can't think that they had many favourable reviews judging from what the passengers around us were saying as well. Never again! Not a great start or end to our holiday in a beautiful country. We'd go to the Seychelles again but not with Air Seychelles.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Frankfurt-Mahe return. Simply terrible. Arrived for departure with three small children and asked the staff for seats in the front part of the cabin. Finally they put us in the back of the cabin close to the toilets. All our five seats were broken in different ways; two of us had to sit on seats without the tilt working one seat where missing the foam inside the pillow and all the multimedia was a disaster - headset-contacts simply not there. And finally 4 hours waiting in Mahe due to technical problems.

### Air Seychelles customer review
CDG-SEZ-CDG. Good flight with B767-300ER. The aircraft has a nice blue relaxing interior in Pearl class and service was okay. Inflight entertainment system very simple and not very good. Cabin crew good and replying on anyone's request. Food was better than expected. Seat was comfortable but not electronic powered. I heard Air Seychelles is going to have a new IFE and lie flat beds later in June.

### Air Seychelles customer review
MRU-SEZ-MRU. The 767-200ER on this route is showing its age; I hadn't realised that cabins with a single video display still exist (making it difficult to see the safety video from the rear of the cabin). Visiting the toilet after the outward take off all the cupboard doors were open and the hand wash bottles were rolling around in the sink. The recline mechanism in my last row window seat was broken. On both legs cabin service was unenthusiastic. Seat pitch though is reasonable.

### Air Seychelles customer review
SIN-SEZ-SIN. Used Air Seychelles as it was the most direct flight since travelling with 2 young children but now I wished I had travelled via the middle east. Air Seychelles staff arrogant and unfriendly. Asked for food for kids to no avail. Had to get up and fetch it myself. They had loud conversations with their co-workers across the aisle while serving food. Upon arrival to SEZ airport my youngest was sleeping on my shoulder and needed help with hand luggage while going down the stairs to the tarmac. Instead of helping they stood there and watch me like I was their circus act for the night. Thanks to a fellow passenger who came to my rescue! The Air Seychelles cabin crew really has a chip on their shoulder. Didn't look like they were very happy to be doing what they were doing.

### Air Seychelles customer review
LHR-SEZ-SEZ. Our family trip was without incident. Plane was pretty empty on the way out so plenty of space to move around. Fortunately our flight was the first schedule for the re- opening of air space due to the volcanic ash. Plane full to capacity as expected. Cabin crew very accommodating able to obtain refreshments at any time.

### Air Seychelles customer review
Heathrow from Mahe - 12.5 hours of hell. We had a seat that you could not tilt and I had a very sharp part of the planes interior sticking in my leg. I asked the stewardess if she could do something - she looked at me as if I had asked her to jump out of the plane and then gave me a cushion to put between me and the broken plug cover. So we had to sit bolt upright in these terrible seats with me having to try not to move or the cushion would fall down.. I have to say I was in tears in the end. I did notice there was another lady in the opposite seats to us and she was in a very distressed was too. Wrote to Air Seychelles hoping for an apology and an explanation as to why they let anyone travel in these most terrible seats. I have not heard a word. Very upset. Next time we will go with another airline and I will have no second thoughts about telling any of my friends to do the same.

### Air Seychelles customer review
CDG-SEZ-CDG. Overall average airline that left me with mixed feelings. Outward flight delayed by 2 hours due to technical failure with chaotic (or no) information given (AF staff and Aeroport de Paris are responsible). Inward flight was on time. Smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight. On both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept (no lie flat no electrical control). IFE is a joke (not on demand personal screens show only two channels) but crew can provide on request some DVD like personal readers with a (limited) choice. 5 movies that are on demand. Aircraft are old but food (choice of international and creole) and wines (1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines) were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts. Unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight. Beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley. Lounges good (but AF at CDG). To sum up decent aircraft with modern cabins are needed and some cabin crew need to improve their attitude.

### Air Seychelles customer review
CDG-SEZ-CDG. Aircraft pretty clean and comfortable. IFE is very limited - 3 movies were screened all of them with a French soundtrack. Meals excellent and we were served champagne for the aperitif. Crews nice and helpful.
