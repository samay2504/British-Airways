### "Pleasant surprise"
Pleasant surprise. Planes were new and clean. Staff was attentive and efficient. Flights were on time. We pre-booked meals, which were quite nice. We booked during holiday season, so tickets were on the more expensive side, but all in all good value. Would fly with them again,

### "closed both toilets in the back"
The crew had closed (locked) both toilets in the back. The "fasten your seat belts" sign never went off during the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes flight, and there were perhaps light turbulences for only 15 minutes. The crew seemed to discourage passengers from using the restrooms, making it the main focus of their attention. At one point, I had to go to the restroom, and a crew member opened the rear toilet for me but promptly locked it again when I exited. Passengers had to practically beg the crew to use the restroom, and only the front toilet seemed accessible. It is perplexing as there were no significant turbulences during the flight.

### "both flights went really well"
I read lots of bad reviews about this company and was quite nervous to fly with them. To my surprise and relief both flights went really well. The check-in was quick and problem free, everything very efficient. Staff very helpful and friendly. Both flights left on time. Would highly recommend it as a budget airline.

### "They have poor customer care"
Not Verified |  My flight was suppose to have departed at 20:20 from Gatwick, however after checking in, the flight information kept changing and finally departed at midnight. No information was provided as to why the flight was delayed. On board, there was no space for my hand luggage and had to have it under my feet throughout the journey. No apologies or any explanation was given. I arrived in Tunisia early in the morning and missed a night of my holiday. They have poor customer care and the stewards are so abrupt.

### "an enjoyable flight"
It was the smoothest landing ever and an enjoyable flight overall. The crew was very polite, and the departure and the arrival were on time in a minute.

### "Avoid travelling with this company"
Not Verified |  The worst service ever as my luggage was received after 3 days with no communication or support and after I traveled all the way to capital Tunis to collected and I contacted them for compensation for my travel and wasted time and money to collect my suitcase even I called and sent emails few times but no support. Avoid travelling with this company

### "Better to avoid this company"
I had a terrible experience with Nouvelair on the flight BJ510 30/04/2023. I booked a flight for 07:30AM 30/04/2023, on the 13/04/2023 I received an email they reschedule the flight to be 17:30 PM without given any options. After the flight a 2 hours 23 minutes delay so instead of arriving at 11am, I arrived at 11:23pm. Better to avoid this company whatever the cost.

### "never fly with them again"
Absolutely awful airline whose primary aim is to scam as much money out of you as possible. they sold me a ticket that included checked luggage but when I turned up at the airline to check-in they charged me £75 to check in a bag both on the way out and back in. The information they provide with the ticket and booking is so limited and everything is in french despite booking from the UK. The customer service is a complete joke. I will never fly with them again.

### "A very bad experience"
A very bad experience with this company. The aircraft is dirty, more than one hour delay they use dirty bus to take as to the airplane. Expensive and nothing free even water.

### "worst experience ever"
Toulouse to Tunis. The worst experience ever this company is a joke. They sound aggressive and don’t even know customer service. Long time waiting to the check in area the hostess was extremely exhausted and talking very inappropriate. Make sure you add a suitcase on your ticket they will make you pay all kilos one by one and not even add a supplementary suitcase. No food, no water on the plane. 1h30 late and no explanation. They are rude and they look like they don’t even know what they doing. This company really was a joke. I started to laugh at them because I was exhausted and felt like I was watching a show. I will never take this company again and I wanted you to all know how bad Nouvelair is

### "were not able to get the flight"
Me and my fiancée were not able to get the flight because they did not accept people from different passport other than Tunisian, even though I am flying from a different country and have not been in my passport country for over 2 years. I showed as a proof my Canadian PR card, my ticket  from Canada to Istanbul, and I was still refused to get the flight. I was also not told how to proceed next, how to get reimbursed or being scheduled for a next flight. Tried to call many times and still not able to speak to anyone.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. I am supposed to fly out of Paris to Tunis on 10th of July but due to the new covid variant delta and the number of daily cases in Tunisia, I decided to cancel my booking or reschedule my flight. The only way to do that is through the customer service or their own agencies, I have been trying for one week to call all the numbers available on their website in order to get in touch with them but unfortunately no one even picks up the phone or calls back, even through emails and Facebook messages. Nouvelair you are the worst airline company I’ve ever seen, unprofessional people looking for profit only and you don’t care about customers.

### "Customer service is non existent"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Rude check-in and onboard flight staff. Customer service is non existent and they do not reply to any online correspondence. Would never use this airline again. Also cancelled flight 4 times with very short notice and totally ruined plans as connecting flights, hotel were all booked to match up with this flight.

### "table was attached with tape"
Not Verified |  Düsseldorf to Monastir. I found my seat and the table was broken and attached with tape. In the storage pouch  in front of your chair there was chewing gum. The flight itself went well, but the rest can be better to my knowledge. We return from Monastir to Düsseldorf and there is no Nouvelair plane .. I found this very strange. With a 20-minute delay, we are taken by bus to a plane with another airline called Electra Airways. The chair of the person in front of me was broken and  that of my mother was also broken. We were not even offered food? Also not paying or such .. we ask if we can order food, they say that they arrive within 5 minutes and 1 hour later there is still nothing, yet I have seen nothing of food the entire flight, I was at 3:00 got up and only landed at 11:20. The only thing we were offered was a cup of drink.

### "Very friendly staff and excellent service"
A very pleasant surprise for my first time on Nouvelair flying from Monastir to Paris CDG. Very friendly staff and excellent service on the ground and in the air. Reasonably priced food and drink on board. Flight was generally on time. Great and easy experience flying out of Monastir airport. Overall, so much better than the national Tunisian carrier.

### Nouvelair customer review
Outward bound flight was a joke when we booked in we got the boarding passes for the seats that we had pre-booked for £45. Flight arrived in to Belfast International from Humberside and when we boarded the aircraft we found a family sitting in our seats. When I spoke to the head of the cabin crew he told me to find an empty seat anywhere on the aircraft. Everything on the flight was priced in Euros and the staff was unable to work out the exchange rate on both flights and charged everyone in sterling. The toilets were a disgrace less said the better. The aircraft was an A320 which was over 20 years old and should have been scraped a long time ago. There was no safety whatsoever on the plane we landed with rubbish all over the floors tables still down and many had their seat back still down. This company should not be taking people on holidays until they train their staff to the standards that is expected in 2013.

### Nouvelair customer review
We left Manchester 40 minutes late (02/06/12) and were seated 1A 1B. The aircraft was TS-INI the oldest of their fleet the cabin interior was tired and the seats were uncomfortable. Before departure the cabin crew did not come round to check everyone had their seat belts on bags stowed etc. The safety demo was spoken in bad English. The flight was very uneventful. About an hour into the flight they started their one and only service for the flight which consisted of soft drinks and hot drinks sandwiches and beer. They had very little stock. No tax or duty free service. On a couple of occasions the Purser left the flight deck door wide open whist chatting to the Captain. 3 hours and 15 minutes we landed and we were all glad of it. After speaking to some other passengers on the flight at our hotel there were a number of broken seats about half way down the aircraft. On the return flight (16/6/12) we were delayed approximately 60 minutes. Our aircraft was TS- INL second oldest in their fleet. Our seats we 23C 23D and the aircraft looked in a better state of repair and the crew were much more helpful. We had 1 drinks/food service and the only alcoholic drink they serve is beer. They also did their Tax and Duty free service. The crew were happy enough for you to purchase alcohol on this service and open the bottle to drink for your flight. All in all I was pretty disappointed by Thomas Cook using this airline as were a lot of other people we spoke to there. If you want any food or drink for your flights take it with you!

### Nouvelair customer review
We went to Djerba on 5th of May. This has got to be the worst airline I have ever been with. The plane was old and grubby toilets needed a good clean. The crew served drinks once no alcohol even though there is a price list in their inflight magazine. No duty free the crew sat in the galley most of the flight their English was poor. The only plus side was that the plane was newer on the way home but still rubbish service and rude crew.

### Nouvelair customer review
TLS-DJE-TLS. No problems with check-in plane clean crew friendly & helpful. Did not try food but advised by others that it was satisfactory

### Nouvelair customer review
Nouvelair Airbus 320 in March 2005 Helsinki-Monastir-Helsinki and found the airline good value. Being a charter carrier the leg room wasn´t too good for a tall chap (187 cm) like me but a hot meal and non-alcoholic drinks were served free of charge. It was the usual airline food both ways: turkey & rice plus pasta bolognaise and Tunisian red & white wine plus beer were available (wines 250 €/beer 150 €). The crew were professional and attentive and the flights were on time - that´s all I needed.
