### "quite an acceptable airline"
Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen to Cairo and back. A comfortable and cost effective alternative airline to use between Istanbul and Cairo. It's quite an acceptable airline, especially considering the price is about half of its main competitors prices. The check in process seemed a bit slow at SAW, the flight was a bit late to depart but arrived on time into Cairo Terminal 1. On both flights, the crew were friendly and helpful and the cabin interior of the former Air Arabia A320 was clean and tidy. The meals served were nice, with a selection of non alcoholic drinks available. This airline arrives into and departs from Cairo Terminal 1, which is an older smaller terminal that seems to have mainly flights to and from the Middle East. During busy periods, it was very crowded in the small terminal. On the return flight the check in was again slow at Cairo Terminal 1. Passport Control confusing, make sure you check which queue to join as the Turkey flights have separate counters for passport/immigration. Overall, a good experience when taking into account the cost saving. Down side is - perhaps a bit more time spent waiting in the Cairo Terminal 1 and flying into and out of the less popular airport in Istanbul.
