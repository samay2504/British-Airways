### "never flying with them again"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight through Chase with my maiden name. I wasn’t let on the flight because of the discrepancy with my new name, so I rebooked, without my husband for the following morning. My return flight was then cancelled because I was a “no show”. I booked a flight the next day with them for an additional fee. We spent over 8 hours on the phone with Chase and Copa trying to get on my return flight, ruining nearly 2 full days of holiday. A $107 name change fee would apply for my reservation, which we paid. Once we went to check in Copa then told us I was no longer on the flight. Now that there was no longer a seat on that flight we would have to pay an additional $100 change fee plus a $600 difference in flight rate. All of this to make a change for the original $300 flight. There is a constant runaround and company lines. They don’t care about what you do because there is not enough competition where they need to care. We visit family here several times a year. This is not the first time we have had an issue with Copa and will never be flying with them again. I will certainly book through competition Avianca, United, Spirit, or American Airlines.

### "cost $650 to change my flight"
I got to the airport 1 hour before departure, a quiet airport that wasn't busy. They told me they couldn't accept my bags due to being 3 minutes late. They offered me zero help. It then cost $650 to change my flight. What a terrible company

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever flown with. Outdated and uncomfortable planes, terrible service, rude crew, dirty bathrooms upon arrival, extremely uncomfortable seats. I don't understand how an airline continues to operate flights in such poor conditions. Horrible and traumatic.

### “I am appalled at Copa's behavior”
My girlfriend and I had planned a 5 night stay at the Marriott in Aruba. We did a lot of planning and I took care of getting our Copa plane tickets from David, Panama to Aruba. I went to the Copa office in David to buy the tickets and I asked the agent if we needed to have anything besides our passports to travel to Aruba. She told me no, that all we needed was our passports to be current. About 10 days before our departure, I went back to the Copa office in David to inquire about our connection in Panama City. We only had 1 hour and 5 minutes to make the connection and the airplanes arriving from David and departing to Aruba tend to be in different terminals with no good transportation between the two, plus you have to go through security again. She assured me that the flight would wait on us. I was skeptical since I had been left by Copa at least twice in the past on other connecting flights when the flights ran late and not because of weather. In those instances Copa did nothing to accommodate me even though it was their fault. I asked her again if we needed anything else to fly to Aruba. No, she said, just your passports. We checked in online yesterday and printed our boarding passes. Today when we went to the airport and went to the agent desk to drop our checked bags, they informed us that we had to have a Yellow Fever card. I explained that I had asked on two occasions at the Copa office regarding any other requirements beyond our passports and had been told nothing else was needed. After getting nowhere with the agent, Diego Polando, I asked to speak to his supervisor. The lady supervisor, Ashley Duarte showed up with armed police and informed me that no we could not fly. I was shocked that she would show up with armed police. We never raised our voice or showed any threatening behavior. After it was obvious that they were not going to let us go on the airplane, I asked for a refund. They refused. Needless to say I am appalled at Copa's behavior. They are the worst of the worst and I have been flying for over 50 years. I only fly them as a last resort. Avoid them if you can.

### "special meals should be automatically included"
I am very disappointed with Copa Airlines. I’ve had a few flights with them lately, they are fine on short distance, but absolutely horrible long-haul. I’d understand their low standard if it was a budget airline, but their flights certainly weren’t cheap. I had a 7hour flight from Panama to Las Vegas. There was only one meal, no snacks, as you’d get with most airlines. But what was shocking is that they don’t have any special meals. As a vegetarian I couldn’t select vegetarian meal in advance, assuming they’d have a veggie option during the flight. How wrong was I! The two options they had was beef and chicken. Just as well I had the sense and bought something (overpriced) at the airport, so I wasn’t left starving the whole flight. I was very disappointed though, at this day and age special meals should be automatically included. Their staff doesn’t seem to be well trained or have basic customer service skills either. Felt like they selected a few spare people at the airport, threw them into the plane to act as stewards. One was walking around and shouting like he was at a market stall, the other two seemed to be more interested in sharing their personal lives than us as paying customers. And another shocking part of the flight was that there are no screens on seats. For a long-haul flight. The only option was to connect to their Wifi, which was free for the entertainment channel, and watch it on the phone. With own earphones. Which was hard since I needed to charge my phone and had only wired earphones with me. The government in Panama is trying to entice tourists to visit their country, promoting it everywhere, but they should first look at their main airline. I wouldn’t go back to Panama if I had to fly with them again.

### "paid for business, changed to economy"
Not Verified | I paid for business and they changed to economy. They gave me 400 dollars but it doesn’t pay for business ticket. They simply don’t care about customers. I have sent a complaint but they even care to answer! Worse airline!

### "not fly with them going forward"
Today I flew with Copa Airlines from my home POS to PTY. I typically pay for seating with extra leg room as I experience lower back pains, and the lack of leg space exacerbates this, so and this was no exception. As the flight finished boarding all of its passengers I noticed there were many empty seats, both in coach and business, as such I asked one of the attendants if there was a possibility to be upgraded to business, more some comfortable seat for my back. The attendant then asked me if I had status with Copa to which I said I have not flown with them in a bit, and my miles had expired. He proceeded to tell me to fly more and maybe next time. Now, I understand I did not pay for business, but if I politely ask considering many empty seats, and being that I also paid for my seat, I would think that the airline staff would wanting me to fly more would accommodate and upgrade, but the fact that I was told to fly more, in my opinion is a reason to not fly with them going forward.

### “complete lack of respect for customers”
Copa Airlines turned our travel into an absolute nightmare. My partner was denied boarding at check-in despite having the proper documents to enter Colombia. Their staff clearly had no clue about travel regulations, and they refused to take responsibility or even communicate with us properly. Calling their customer service was just as bad—rude, dismissive, and unwilling to help. They shrugged off our ruined trip like it didn’t matter. Copa’s incompetence and complete lack of respect for customers are shocking. Do yourself a favor and choose any other airline—this one is a disaster.

### "currently stranded at Panama airport"
Were awaiting flight CM314, destined to leave from gate 207 at terminal 2 from Panama to Trinidad, boarding at 836pm,as indicated on our boarding pass and screen at gate 207. We sat for 3 ours in the seating area next to terminal 207. Approximately 40 mins after boarding time we were confused why no announcements were made for boarding and proceeded to step to the terminal gate 207 for assistance as a representative had only recently arrived. Terminal 207 was in our site at all times and displayed our flight information as our boarding pass. At this point a different flight appeared on the terminal screen and we were informed our flight had just left from a other terminal 20 minutes walking distance. Further adding to our confusion and panic no gate was seen assigned on the screens, after we were informed of the flight departure. The airline app also showed no change and we received no emails regarding a gate to our flight either. There was no call for boarding or individual names called on the announcement systems at any point in time. We proceeded to the COPA airlines help desk where we were informed that we had to pay in full for ticket changes for the next available flight. Our credit cards were at their limit but luckily the bank accepted else we would be stranded for good. We are currently stranded at Panama airport with no idea where our bags are, having no rest and feeling cheated and robbed. The airline attendants were completely dismissive, unpleasant and unhelpful. They informed us that “gates are subject to change without notice at any given time” and that we should have” looked at the screen” In all our years of international travel , never have we missed a flight or encountered this problem. On the morning of September 27th 2024 at 540am COPA airlines representative at terminal 2 Panama International Airport admitted that "something was wrong with the ‘Tocumen’ system and that we need to check in with her regularly to get gate changes. She further explained that this was a regular occurrence here and gates do not get updated on the monitor at the gate until close to boarding. COPA airlines needs to rectify this and make regular announcements or warn passengers ahead of time. This experience has left us traumatized.

### "very dishonest airline"
Not Verified | This summer I came across the airline Copa Airlines, booking a ticket for flight from San Jose to Panama for $233. I was given a reservation number, to confirm it I called the hotline, where the lady informed me that I didn’t have a ticket, because they couldn’t (or rather didn’t want to) contact the bank. I had to buy a new ticket but this time at a price of $487 for 1,5 hours of flight. This time there was no problem with the bank. A very, very dishonest airline. I am writing this to warn other passengers on what principle this company with a star in its logo operates .

### "I wouldn’t recommend it"
Not Verified |   On the plane the staff hardly gave us any water and the water tasted like the plastic cup it was in. I am not surprised if anyone got dehydrated. The legroom was good and the seat was okay. Overall it was okay, I wouldn’t recommend it.

### "unreasonably bad and negligent"
Copa is an unreasonably bad and negligent company. Our packages did not arrive despite the plane being empty. The support on the ground was absolute trash, negligent, rude and unhelpful people all around. From the support staff to the check in gates staff, to the manager in Rio everyone treated us excessively poorly. The food on board was also inedible. Never fly Copa

### "customer service is exceptional"
Not Verified |   Copa's customer service is exceptional. I have been scheduled for surgery and had to cancel a round trip flight leaving 4 days from now, with a return flight in 2 months. I have a full credit for me and my spouse, no hassle, with 1 year window. Other carriers provide flyer miles that expire, have black-out dates (so you can't fly), or change programs mid-stream. Copa has a heart and a sensible, efficient customer policy that places the customer first! Thank you Copa. Just one more reason to leave the USA and move to Panama!

### “my request to cancel was refused”
On October 17th, 2023, I purchased a round-trip flight from Boston to Sao Paulo. I opted for a more expensive option (Economy Classic - $130 more) to have the flexibility to change flights if needed. When I attempted to change the final destination (to Salvador), I was informed that I couldn't even change the date because such changes must be requested more than 8 days ahead of time. This means I paid $65 for the ability to change the outgoing date within the next 2 days. Despite receiving conflicting information from various customer service representatives, my request to cancel the entire flight due to the unsuitable itinerary was refused. They offered credit for the same route, valid for a year, but I requested credit for a different destination within the Star Alliance's network, which was also denied. Having to adhere to the original itinerary resulted in a long layover and a change of airports at my final destination, causing additional problems. On my return from Salvador (November 8,2023), my flight was scheduled to arrive at 3:30 pm in Sao Paulo Congonhas airport. After arriving at Guarulhos airport at 5:30 pm, I waited at the terminal for my flight. It was past midnight, and the airport had few travelers. Despite waiting in line ahead of time to check in, when I finally made it to the check-in counter, the agent claimed they had called for passengers for my flight, but I did not hear any announcements in English or see important messages on the screens. The boarding crew was unwilling to wait, and the agent could not recheck me for the next flight. He provided a piece of paper and advised me to call Copa Airlines customer service for assistance. Despite calling for the next 6 hours, no one answered the phone. I also tried reaching out by email (Claim# 2077578) and wrote an urgent request but received only an acknowledgment of the claim on November 15 (7 days after). When I finally reached customer service by phone at 7 am, they rescheduled me for a flight 24 hours later with a long layover in Panama City and charged an additional $75 for processing the request. My travel time from Salvador was from 12:55 pm when my flight departed to 6 pm the next day when I arrived in Boston. On November 22, I received a final response stating that Copa Airlines is not responsible for the poor performance of ground services and will not issue a refund or compensation for my time, cost, and delays. Flight Details: - Booking Reference: BF5QHE Outbound flights: - Boston-Panama City, Wednesday 3:39 PM, October 25, 2023, Flight Number CM-705 arriving at 8:26 PM - Panama City-Sao Paulo, Wednesday 9:16 PM, October 25, 2023, Flight Number CM 759 arriving next day at 6:08 AM Returning flights: Original itinerary: - Sao Paulo-Panama City, Wednesday 1:43 AM, November 8, 2023, Flight Number CM758 arriving at 6:39 AM - Panama City-Boston, Wednesday 7:40 AM, November 8, 2023, Flight Number CM 704 arriving at 1:18 PM Actual itinerary: - Sao Paulo-Panama City, Thursday 1:32 AM, November 9, 2023, Flight Number CM0841 arriving at 6:28 AM - Panama City-Boston, Thursday 12:34 AM, November 9, 2023, Flight Number CM0366 arriving at 6:12 PM.

### "Service and courtesy dropped"
Not Verified |   Was a frequent flyer with Copa for 11 years. Minimum of 6 flights yearly. Service and courtesy dropped horribly in the last 2-3 years. We bought a business class ticket return from Montreal, including the ability to change flights. They contacted us months later and told us they could not honor the return trip times as they had scheduling changes. We called as requested and they will not accept new dates unless we pay them another 1100 dollars, "new rules". We had a different incident last year where their Quito staff (including the manager) refused to all us access to our luggage on a scheduled stopover in Panama, though this is against their own rules. It is safer to pay more with another airline rather than accept risks of flying with Copa.

### "got my money back"
Not Verified |   I bought a flight path from Rio de Janeiro to Bogota(BOG) to Panama City(PTY). At one point, the flight from BOG to PTY was canceled so I called to book a new one. I had to spend an extra $440 for the new flight on top of the original $600 that I already paid for the flight path. Later that night, I was switched back to the original "canceled" flight and not reimbursed for the newly charged $440. I spent hours (and at least 25 separate phone calls) trying to get my money back. They said they would refund me and later went back on that. They then said they would provide a travel voucher and went back on that too. When I continued to fight it, they threatened to completely cancel my flight if I continued to try to dispute the charge through my bank. When I got to Bogota for the layover, I did not even have a ticket on the plane to PTY. When I finally did get to Panama City (on a different airline) and they couldn't mess with my flight anymore, I disputed it one final time and got my money back through my bank since I did not, in fact, have a flight with Copa Airlines.

### "I'm absolutely horrified"
My business class seat on Copa was truly awful. The cabin literally  smelt like urine. There is ample leg-room, but that's the only amenity on this plane (I got two itchy, unwrapped blankets that someone left on my seat). No screens, no wi-fi, no stowage room in front of me, and the stewards are inattentive at best. I can't believe I paid $1,500 for this filthy seat. The flight was delayed by several hours and then they reduced the amount of time for the delay so passengers who wandered off were left in the lurch. This is the last time I'll use Copa Airlines. I'm absolutely horrified!

### "the service is horrible"
If you are looking to cheaper ticket don't buy a ticket with a Copa Airlines because the service is horrible. My connecting flight to Orlando was delayed and I walk into the Copa Airlines Service to change my ticket because they had another flight to next hour. I asked the agent to do that and him said the next airplane was full, but on the website was possible see the seats available. After it him said you have to wait, we have a flight to next day, the service of Copa Airlines is closed and if the manager appears here, she can update your ticket to the next flight tomorrow. I have been waiting for like 2 hours to change my flight to next day but nobody else appears, after tired of waiting I decided to buy a new ticket with a different company because on next day was my father birthday. After arrived on home I called to Copa Airlines, and I spoke with the agent to check "What I can do with the old ticket". After explained the situation they offer me a new ticket but a supposed to pay around $600 - $1700 to reschedule the ticket. Thats is ridiculous. Don't chose Copa Airline to your trip.

### "could improve a lot more"
Not Verified |   The seat was trash, the food and drinks was bad, IFE was horrible, worst map of any airline I’ve flown in. But the flight attendants were very friendly. There was no Wi-Fi. I’ve flown with Copa Airlines a very significant amount of times and they’re not that bad, but could improve a lot more.

### "service has been sub par"
Please put this in as a formal complaint against your company. First for the flight being delayed which will make me loss my connecting flight. Upon calling the contact center the agent tells me they cannot do anything from their side and that I should go down past security again and talk to the airlines. Before I did this I waited 1 hour at the gate lounge for a Copa Airlines employee, none showed up. I then took the advice of the customer service attendant of Copa and went downstairs and tried to find someone from Copa in the  checkin. Nobody there as well. I then go through security again, carrying heavy bags and go to the gate that it was originally in  to find that it has now changed to the other side of the terminal with no prior announcement. I then get to B18 gate and am told that they can’t make any changes or reservations for my connecting flight there even though I got told they can through the customer service hotline and that I will need to wait until I get to Panama and see what they can throw us with no additional information they were willing to give us at all. I have no idea if I will be flying same day or have to get a different flight to another day, if I have to pay for my own accommodation etc. The service has been sub par and this has left a bad taste in my mouth that has made my mind up to never fly Copa again.

### "So unhelpful and so slow"
This airline is an absolute joke. We lined up to drop our bags for at least 45 minutes and when we got to the top we were told that our flight from Costa Rica to Ireland that is booked for 2 weeks from now is not enough to prove we will leave Panama. Fair enough we thought, so we booked a bus from Panama to Costa Rica for the next leg of our journey and we spent $120 on those (we are backpackers btw, so it makes sense to get a bus more than an air travel for us). Back up to the counter and we waited another 20 minutes to be told that we cant use a bus ticket and it has to be by air. Which was not mentioned before!! I had to spend another $300 to book a flight from Panama to CR and I was told I had now 5 minutes to go until check-in closed. MWe got to security and clearance without help from staff who should have fast tracked us at this stage and ran to the gate to be treated by another grumpy employee. So unhelpful and so slow. Book with Latam.

### "Copa Airlines has refused to comply"
Because of a Panamanian Immigration requirement that in order to board our flight from Cartagena, Colombia to Panama City we needed to have confirmed onward flights out of Panama, we were forced to buy onward tickets from Panama that we did not need and which would never be used. Proof of our departure from Panama by cruise ship was not accepted. We were advised when we got to Panama that the unwanted tickets would be cancelled and the credit card charge reversed. This did not happen. Despite numerous requests for repayment of the cost of the tickets through both the refund request and complaints channels Copa Airlines has refused to comply. They are fully aware that the tickets were only purchased because of a Panamanian immigration technicality and were never to be used.

### “10 stars and a big recommendation”
I was looking for an inexpensive way to get from LAX to GRU. Skyscanner search engine came up with a roundtrip around 500 USD with Copa Airlines, a company which I’ve never heard from before. Before booking I did some research and almost decided not to book with them due to all the really bad reviews about Copa. I’m glad I gave them a try. I had an excellent trip in almost every aspect. Check in at LAX was quick, friendly and easy. The young lady gave me seats on exit rows for both flights upon request without extra charge. I’m 6-2 so I was really glad to get seats with extra leg space in economy. The trip to São Paulo goes via Panama City, their hub. The connection there was the easiest thing I’ve ever experienced. We arrived at one gate and the connecting flight left immediately next to it. The planes left on time and arrived on time as well. On long distance flights you do get a selection of warm meals. Not bad, not good. Nothing special. If this is important to you: they don’t serve alcoholic beverages. Inflight entertainment works with your smartphone or tablet. You can log into the wifi and and get access to movies and tv shows. It’s not a huge selection but enough to find something you like. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful on all flights. The trip back was basically the same. Everything was fine. For me this was a smooth trip with zero issues. Food could be better, but hey, its economy class after all. So, considering my experience I must give this airline a thumbs up, 10 stars and a big recommendation. Thanks Copa for the smooth and pleasant trip.

### "don't respect your seat"
We pay for a seat at front, at the gate they took our passport and ticket, and don't explain anything. After 10 min they pretend to send us to the row 34 with no refund no explanation. nothing, at least 10 people in te same condition, they don't respect your seat even if you pay for. I have to argue for another 10 min to get better seat, the surprise, when I boarded, was empty seats at front, lack of control.

### "Customer service is rude and is no help"
Customer service is rude and is no help. I booked this airline through expedia, I am 22 years old and a woman, I came to the airport an hour and a half before boarding. No one was in the airport to check my bags, I spoke with someone from copa airlines and he stated that he messaged his supervisor to let him know that I am here and if I can get a flight change to the next morning same time. When I called Copa a few hours later they stated that they never received that message and they cant get me a new flight. So i spoke with expedia and they said if Copa waives the no show they can do something for me. Copa insisted that they will not do that and to contact someone else.

### "wasn't a force majeure case"
Last year, I purchased a ticket to travel to Puerto Rico with Avianca for the outbound journey and Copa Airlines for the return. Prior to the trip, COVID vaccines were depleted in my area, preventing me from completing the second dose on time, leading to the denial of boarding. Avianca understood the force majeure situation and refunded my money. However, I had to sue Copa, as they vehemently refused to do the same. After nearly two years of legal battles, a judge ruled in favor of Copa, arguing that the lack of vaccines wasn't a force majeure case that would allow the application of the then-current presidential decrees to provide relief to passengers affected by pandemic-related situations. While Avianca sympathized with my situation, Copa and the Colombian judicial system turned their backs on me as a user and citizen.

### “flight was satisfactory”
Flew back from a trip to Colombia on COPA and I do have to say there are pros and cons on traveling with this airline. On the first leg to Panama City I checked in at El Dorado and was at the gate within 30 minutes altogether. Because I purchased a basic economy ticket I had to pay to check in a bag but it was actually very cheap only thirty dollars. One thing I did not like was that you can’t buy alcohol at duty free if you travel through Panama City otherwise they’ll confíscate it or make you pay to check it in so I missed out on bringing back rum. Had I known that rule I would have bought it and put it in the checked in bad in Bogota. The flight itself was uneventful, the airplane had private TVs on each seat, flight attendants were normal not too friendly just basically did their job. in Panama City I went to duty free bought some booze which was given to me at the door. On this flight the crew were extremely attentive and very nice. There was a change of planes from a Max9 to 737-800 at the last minute. Headphones were handed out after take off, about an hour and a half into the flight dinner was served but there were no choices it was some kind of beef and beans with corn bread and a cake slice. For drinks no alcohol is offered not even to buy which sucks but they do have some really good guava and pineapple juice. There was another drink service after dinner and two water services after. In the galley they had Coca Cola, juice and drinks for passengers. Overall the flight was satisfactory.

### "it wasn’t as bad as I expected"
I was a bit nervous on how my flights would end up. Surprisingly it wasn’t as bad as I expected. Check in at JFK was a breeze and the lady who helped me at the counter was very friendly. The first leg from JFK to PTY was on a 737 Max9 since we took off at 2 AM most people slept and there was no inflight service until about 3 hours into the flight when breakfast was served. They offered eggs or pancakes, believe it or not the food was very good actually. For drinks I had guava pineapple juice. You need to bring your own tablet or phone in order to watch movies and they have a wide selection of fils to see. Connecting in Panama City I had to walk to a different terminal. The airport itself is quite dull. The leg to Bogota was on a 737-800 which had screens on every seat. The crew didn’t hand out headphones since the flight was only an hour and 20 minutes. They provided some sticks and soda, juice team and coffee. Flight was quite smooth and crew was attentive but not overly friendly.

### "Awful consistency"
Awful consistency. If my bag is the proper size to carry on from Tampa to Panama, it should be the proper size to fly from Panama to Tampa. Does the airport in Panama bend the laws of physics. Weak sauce.

### "necessity rather than preference"
Survivor Show Review: When it comes to flying with Copa Airlines, it's a choice of necessity rather than preference. After ten years, we decided to spend Christmas and New Year's in Brazil, and due to the pandemic, the ticket prices were exorbitant. Copa seemed to be the most reasonable option available. However, our experience with Copa left much to be desired. The food quality was poor, and the entertainment options were just average on flights to Panama City and Belo Horizonte. To make matters worse, both of our flights were delayed. The discomfort of the seats was exacerbated by the fact that they only operate with 737 aircraft. On our return journey to Canada, the flight faced yet another delay, and to our disappointment, there was no onboard entertainment unless you were willing to watch on your own device. Things took a stressful turn when we landed in Panama City just as our connecting flight to Toronto was boarding. We had to sprint and walk for a good 15-20 minutes to reach another terminal to catch our flight home. In the midst of the chaos, our family of three got separated, and our son was momentarily lost. Upon reaching the boarding gate, there was pressure on us to board immediately. However, we couldn't comply as we were anxiously waiting for our son, and we had his travel documents with us. To our dismay, as soon as we finally boarded, the aircraft closed its doors and took off promptly. It was the only flight that departed on time throughout our journey. In conclusion, if you have no alternative, consider flying with Copa Airlines. But be prepared by bringing your own snacks; otherwise, you might go hungry. The crew's performance was satisfactory, but overall, the experience left much room for improvement.

### "worse customer service"
Not Verified | Worst airline I've flown with, even worse customer service than low cost airlines in Europe. Flight was delayed due to Copa internal issues and lost my connection. They didn't want to pay for my hotel or transport since they put me in a flight for the next day in the afternoon. They only gave me 2 meal vouchers which I couldn't use because everything in the terminal was closed at that time (22h). Wanted to use the vouchers for lunch the next day, but couldn't because the date on it was the day before. Copa client service desk unattended for hours, staff are rude and unprofessional, no commitment whatsoever to assist passengers in need. Do yourself a favor and avoid Copa airlines and Tocumen Airport altogether. Wondering how star alliance accepts such mediocre airlines giving the alliances a bad image and reputation.

### "wait time in the check in line is so long"
Not Verified |  It is unacceptable that the wait time in the check in line is so long. I arrived at check in at 8:15 for my flight to panama leaving at 11:30. The average a passenger took at the counter was over 12 minutes. In this day of technology thus is unacceptable. The line got longer as time went by however there was no sense or urgency nor was there anyone managing the lines. This would mean a bottle neck and a mad rush to clear security and get to the gate. Unacceptable service and better can be done with effective leadership

### "No professionalism whatsoever"
Not Verified |  I arrived at the airport at 6:30am. The line was horrific and we soon found out the computer system was down. No one was informed, we had to ask. Then tickets were being written and suddenly they ran out of paper; needless to say, four hours later we finally boarded. No apologies, no empathy at all. The service was mediocre, Upon arrival to Panama. No one was outside the aircraft with notice of where to go or the if we had lost our connection to Bogota, we looked at the schedule board and saw gate 145. Upon arrival we were sent to three other gates and now, the fourth! No one knew anything, no one really cared. This has been the worst trip I have ever taken! No professionalism whatsoever. You have lost a client and I will be letting all my friends and family about this company.

### "offered to upgrade our flight"
Not Verified |  Copa upgrade offer I purchased 4 tickets on with 2 reservations on Copa airlines. The reservations had 2 different reservation numbers. 2 tickets for my wife and I and on the second reservation two tickets for friends. I received an email from Copa today with an offered to upgrade our flight. The email did not have a reservation number. I paid for the upgrade. Then I received an email confirming the upgrade. The upgrade was shown for our friends tickets. When I called Copa I was told there could be no change, refund or cancellation of the upgrade. I had no intention of upgrading our friends tickets which I paid for.

### "has to be the worst airline"
For an airline to represent the Central / South America, this has to be the worst airline. Ask three agent the same question get three different answers.

### "one of the best experiences"
Not Verified |  It was one of the best experiences in a long time on a plane, good service, comfortable seats, food, very friendly staff. I would like Copa to have a direct trip from Washington DC to El Salvador. Fue una de las mejores experiencias en mucho tiempo en un avion buena atencion comodos asientos comida personal muy amable. Como quisiera que copa tubiera un viaje directo de washington dc para el salvador

### "I’ll never fly Copa again"
The worst airline I’ve ever had the displeasure to fly with. Flight attendants unfriendly. We boarded the plane, took off and there was no service of any kind. No water, nothing. Lights off and that was it. 5 hours later, they brought in the breakfast and it was a joke. Churros  with dulce de leche. Dry, rubbery, tasted like nothing. The cup of fruit served had seen better days. Onboard entertainment was your cell phone or tablet sitting on the back of the seat in front of you and connected to their site. The movie choices vary from Beethoven to Scooby-Doo. Seats cramped. 2 bathrooms for an entire, fully packed airplane. I’ll never fly Copa again.

### "They simply didn't care"
The worst experience from COPA ground staff at Boston Logan airport. They made me and my small children (including a baby) queue at both the check-in counter and the gate at the economy class line arguing that they were in line before me and it would have been disrespectful. I even talked to the supervisor and explained that this was not the standard procedure for a passenger flying business. They simply didn't care. The supervisor accepted what I said but did not correct the situation. She, even replied with a "what do you want me to do", to which I politely replied that she should do her job and correct her staff. All that staff was unprofessional, disrespectful, unskilled and untrained at customer care to say the least. When mentioned that I would have reported them, they simply said they didn't care. I am beyond surprised that COPA has that kind of personnel. I have never experienced that poor treatment with any other airline globally. This was BOS-PTY on August 02, 2023. Onboard, the service was impecable with steward Mr. Juvenciano who went above and beyond to ensure my family and I felt well and cared for.

### "I had the worst experience"
I had the worst experience flying with this airline. I originally had a flight leaving Lima, Peru to San Francisco via Panama City on July 31. I was going to have a 50 minute connection and was trusting that I was going to make it, as we were going through the company's hub. However, 20 mins after the plane boards, we got the message that the plane had equipment issues and was going to deboard. Not much more information given after that, and we were taken to baggage claim to get our luggage. I had to find out from other passengers that we had to go to a random airport gate to get rebooked - and this took almost 3 hours. The company booked us a hotel and shuttle to a hotel, but the whole process was very painful and lacked clear communication. The next morning the flight was scheduled to depart at 10am. We arrive to the airport at 7, and find out that the flight then got delayed to 1pm. At 1pm the flight then got rescheduled to 3pm. By this point, everyone would have missed their various connecting flights out of Panama City, including mine, to San Francisco. By the way, there is only 1 flight to San Francisco per day out of Panama, leaving at 6:15pm and arriving at 11:30pm. Instead of making it easier for me and finding a solution, they were going to rebook me on the next flight which would have meant another day wasted. I had to fight them to get a solution to fly me to LAX and then to San Francisco via United. Overall, very frustrating travel experience. I had hopes for this airline due to its Star Alliance status but it was very poor. The staff during the whole experience were very poor at communicating, were on their phones the whole time, sometimes rude, did not try to assist very much. I almost bought a ticket out of Peru with a different airline when the cancellations happened and really wish I did instead of continuing with Copa.

### "Rude and unhelpful staff"
Rude and unhelpful staff. Copa Airline staff members displayed a lack of courtesy and patience when dealing with me and my husband. They were very dismissive and providing incorrect information, which was very frustrating. Their service were Inefficient and slow which caused delays in check-in and slow response times to all Passengers on the baggage claim line causing multiple passengers to miss their flights including myself. Poor communication and refusal to translate information in English, The supervisor said in Portuguese that she will not help Americans and refused to speak English. A lack of effective resolution lead to a negative customer service experience especially at the baggage claim where the agent was on her phone the entire time scrolling through instagram instead of helping passengers. The airport staff failed to address concerns or provide appropriate compensation or solutions so that me and my husband will know what to do and how we will get back into the United States from Brazil. Many airports strive to provide excellent customer service and prioritize passenger satisfaction.

### "friendly staff on-board"
I was pleased with the performance of the friendly staff on-board, they certainly made it worth flying with COPA. The same can’t be said about the ground staff in Toronto. I found them to be somewhat discourteous and uncaring. They seem to focus of getting the flight out rather than taking the time to be pleasant to guest. They could have dont a better job organizing the boarding lines and dealing with customer questions.

### "we had so much trouble checking in"
Not Verified |  First of all the times changed. Then we had so much trouble checking in. Then when we finally checked in we weren't able to get a boarding pass. Now on the airfield they are 45 minutes too late with opening the luggage check-in counters. Their website is horrible. And they have no helpdesk or customers service that is available via the website!

### "customer service is horrible"
First off, customer service is horrible. The staff are rude and poorly organized. My first incident occurred when their communication was so bad that they used 3 different excuses of why the airline was delayed. This shows that they lack organization skills as an organization. The most crazy part of my whole experience is that I booked my flight for June 25th (I have receipts) but the airline had my reservation for July 25th. How does this happens? I spoke to other customers and they also were upset about the service.

### "changed our flight without notice"
Not Verified | Airline changed our flight without notice, they can't help you in Montevideo to solve the problem because of the system. I bought another ticket from another company to return home.

### "charging me for changing the date"
I bought a flight ticket from Guatemala City to New York, I paid Economica Classic which it states on their website that you can change dates for free (one time only). when I decided to change my flight date, Copa Airlines was charging me for changing the date of my flight. I contact them over the phone, and I was told that I could make changes 8 days before my flight. I literally bought my ticket 8 days before the flight, if they stated this when booking my flight I wouldn't have paid for Economica Classic. When booking the flight it doesn't say anything about any restrictions for changing the dates. I tried to make a complaint and not pay for changing dates, and their answer was "if I check the policy changes on their website, it specifies all of their policies, and that they won't reimburse me. My issues is, it doesn't say any about any restriction when booking, that I specifically have to browse on their website for me to know all the policies, I don't think that is my responsibility, and they should be more clear about their restrictions.

### "40 minutes late to disembark"
Positives: - equipment is fine, standard and relatively clean - entertainment is good. Free headphones. Negatives: - Customer service is trash. We had to change itineraries, started with a $1500 three leg ticket, had to change to two leg. Well once we did, the “value” of the ticket suddenly dropped to like $900 (because that’s what the new route would have cost in cash). 6 hours later, after sleeping a little and coming up with a new idea, tried to change it one more time to a different routing that would cash $1050. Copa agent insisted we would have to pay the ticket value difference of $150 (plus a change fee, annoying but understandable). We called back and got a more empathetic agent, she could reduce it a little bit her software literally wouldn’t let her wave the fair difference even though we had clearly originally paid an exorbitant about above the new ticket price. Copa agents routinely told us “that is not possible” and insulted my intelligence when discussing fees. Some of this is language barriers, but not an excuse for the snarkiness. Right now, I’m sitting on the tarmac after a 6 hour Copa flight. We’ve been sitting here for 50 minutes, and they are refusing to let anyone use the bathroom. At least 25 passengers have tried, mostly elderly and women. The flight attendant literally threatened to file an incident report if one of them wouldn’t sit down. We landed on time, but are 40 minutes late to disembark. The flight attendant just got on the intercom and announced “just as a reminder, since we landed on time no one will be getting hotels if missing  flight. Go to a United agent to rebook on the next flight.

### "I will never fly with them again"
I bought economy seats but chose to pay extra for the premium seats. On my flight back from Panama to Atlanta, when I boarded the plane (I paid extra for the extra space seat and to be on the window, row of 3 seats), there was a 3 year old kid seating on my assigned seat and the kid's extremely overweight mother sitting on the center, taking about 6 inches of my seat due to her body size. The row right in front just had one passenger by the window, so I waited for the plane's door to close and I moved over, then an extremely unpleasant flight attendant came and told me to move back to my seat. I told him I had paid extra to be in the window and more room, he told me to tell the mother to move the kid from my paid/assigned seat (Paid an extra $65 btw for that). It was pretty embarrassing to be honest, the guy was on a power trip somehow, so I just sat back and kept my mouth shut, but the whole flight I had to be pushed to the aisle because there was just so much room for both of our bodies. If I had the chance to be on my seat, I could just roll on to the wall and be fine, but nope. The choices I had was to look like a jerk and tell the 3 year old kid to move or to suck it up. It was about a 4 hr flight, and 2 hrs into it, another flight attendant seeing my condition told me to move to the sit in front. The money you save flying with these guys is really not worth the trouble, food was awful, nothing to watch on the screens and most of the staff is unfriendly, they would be better attending to cattle, not humans. I will never fly with them again.

### "no type of compassion"
Of my 20 years of traveling various international and domestic airline companies I have never experienced or came close to experiencing the nightmare I have with Copa. Our flight was stopped mid take-off due to “2 bird strikes” and what we thought would only be an hour delay ended up being 7 hours because they also had to switch the cabin crew. Which in turn made us miss our connecting flight in which Copa did not want to compensate for new flights to my final destination or for an over night stay. We then had to book a new flight back home an extra $1300 & it pained me to give them more money but they were my only option being the main airline in Panama. The 2nd strike was when the travel agent did not fully book our flight home but only booked our flight to a connecting city. I then had to fork out additional money for tickets with another airline to finally get home. They have the worst customer service. I stood at 3 different service desks for more than 2 hours each trying to get some resolution. The supervisor in Panama was the worst type of person with no type of compassion. I will never fly with this company ever again.

### "never fly this airline again"
When we arrived in Bogota and went to get our baggage, my wife’s large suitcase has been damaged and there was one wheel missing. I made a verbal report to a Copa employee that was at the baggage area who took photo of the damage and told me to do a written report online which I did. 4 days after the report I received an email from the airline saying that they could not offer any compensation for the damage because according to them they were not for responsible for the damage . Copa will not accept any responsibility if your luggage is damage during their care. I will never fly this airline again.

### "They are inconsistent"
This is about their baggage policy. It seems that you will get different answers. I flew from MCO to PTY and had a Medical bag with me checked in that flew free. But is seems that going from PTY to MCO there is a fee for a medical bag. I thought that if flying the the USA the airline had to follow our rules. Well I guest wrong. I had talked with their Customer Service department and they told me they charge for medical equipment baggage. They are inconsistent. Also print out everything, once the flight is over so is your online information. Just the basics is all you’ll find.

### "there was no one there"
First, we were rebooked for no known reason through a different country to get home, so the travel time was going to be longer, but that isn't the worst that happened. The bigger problem was that coming back from our wedding, my husband was asked if he could give up his "extra seat" as Copa was overbooked. He told them "no" because that is a comfort necessity for him. After that conversation, my husband started looking for other flights that we could take because he felt bad for the gate agent who was visibly distressed, and he found flights that would work to get us back home earlier and to a better airport. He went to the gate agent with that information, and she was ecstatic that they could get a few more people on the flight while accommodating us. The "original" flight took off, and then they informed us they were unable to get us on the other flights as expected. We were told that we would have a night in Miami on Copa, so we accepted that (not that we had any other choice at that point). When we got to Miami, there was no one there to take us to a hotel as had been promised. After calling, we were told that all agents were gone for the day, so we would have to submit a complaint to get reimbursed, so here we are! If you say you will do something, make sure it happens.

### "never pay for business on Copa again"
Business class in a recently refitted plane provides no inflight entertainment system, no plugs to recharge phone or tablet. We were not provided with a blanket or even a small pillow (contrary to what I had read before booking) and the plane was cool enough that I had to use my down jacket as a wrap. Water was provided once in a small paper cup with no offers of a refresh. Copa entertainment app which I had downloaded not available on my screenless flight. The meal was yuck and only choice left for me by the time the flight attendant worked her way back to row 4 was beef. No veg or kosher options. My meal was identical to the one my friends had in economy. Seat 4E barely reclined So I am not sure what my business bump up actually accomplished. Would never pay for business on Copa again; what they say you will be treated to and what you actually get bear scant resemblance to each other. Icing on the cake when we arrived in Montreal near midnight we were told we would need to wait 45 minutes for our luggage. No explanation provided.

### "frustrating in the extreme"
We booked a roundtrip from Atlanta to Lima (CM881 & CM263), and Lima to Atlanta (CM338 & CM880). Both flights included a brief layover in Panama City. We also booked flights from Quito to Lima (Booking No. SP6MHI, Flights CM158 and CM337). This flight also included a brief layover in Panama City. The scheduled itinerary would've had us fly from Quito to Panama City, then from Panama City to Lima, then from Lima back to Panama City, then Panama City to Atlanta. It occurred to us that the flights from Panama City to Lima and Lima back to Panama City might be able to be skipped, so when we entered the Quito airport we spoke with a Copa Airlines desk agent about that possibility. She worked on the computer with another agent for about 15 minutes and printed our boarding passes only for Quito to Panama city and assured us that we could stay the night in Panama City and board our flight from Panama City to Atlanta in the morning. We stayed the night in Panama City as planned but when we arrived in Panama City airport this morning to board our flight to Atlanta, we were shocked to find that because we didn't board the flight from Lima to Panama City our tickets from Panama City to Atlanta had been cancelled. We had been given assurances by Copa representatives in the Quito airport the previous day that this would not happen. We spent about an hour talking with Copa representatives in Panama City about this but they were unwilling to help or honor the assurance that we were given in Quito. We were forced to pay a $535 penalty fee to re-instate our cancelled tickets to Atlanta. This is frustrating in the extreme and totally unacceptable given that we sought and were given permission and assurances in Quito that everything was in order

### "experience was a total joke"
My husband and kids were returning from a a trip to Brazil. We got on the airplane everything was fine. Upon entering Panamá we had only 1 hour and 30 minutes. The people at the gate checked out stroller cart when we asked for the tag so we could use it in Panamá. We had two small kids and 4 carry ons with no stroller to carry the kids. We asked for help before the flight and when we got into Panamá, both times we were met with "No". We finally got to our gate and had to go through yet another security checkpoint, even though we just had a lay over. So they asked for my green card for no reason. They were rude and yelled at us. After that my kids were hungry and thirsty. So my husband when to go use the restroom and buy some food and drinks for us. When he came back the lady told us we couldn't have food and drinks in the gate area. So my husband called us to the side of the gate area and tried to give my and my kids a drink and the lady yelled at us and said they can't drink it inside the gate area. The lady was standing there watching us. Like WTH. So my kids went out with my husband and I had to stay with the bags. Then when we got to the US our stroller was destroyed. The handle pad ripped, the cloth stained from grease and the sun visor broken. We tried to file a claim with Copa but they just brushed us off. It looks like garbage now. The whole experience was a total joke and just embarrassing for that company. We would rank it a big fat 1.

### "alleged that my carry-on was over-sized"
On may way from the U.S connecting flights in Panama, the staff was rude, abusive and intimidating. They alleged that my carry-on was over-sized, and that my duty-free was not a personal item. They threatened me with no letting me board my next flight and they confiscated my duty free even though other passengers offered to carry it for me. They also measured my luggage in the measurement box they have at the gate, and even though it fit in it and it complies with the requirements, they insisted I needed to check it. No one in the ground on in the aircraft offered any support and directed me to reach out to their customer service but didn't help resolve the incident. The duty free is still confiscated. However, senior administrative personnel from Copa airlines contacted me to process the return of my duty-free purchase. He apologized for the miss-treatment and indicated they will conduct some training as he saw the video captured by their own cameras at the gate and agreed that it has been disrespectful. Because of that I'm rating them with a 5. On my way back, while in line to the security check point at the gate, I was finishing the last sip of a bottle of water. The woman at the check point rudely yelled at me, and even though I politely responded, finished my water, threw the bottle in the respective can, she continued to rave. She went as far as to abruptly hiding her badge so I would not see her identification. when I retrieved my phone to take a photo her coworkers and her threatened me again with not letting me board the plane. I encouraged them to be aware of the cameras and told them I was already in touch with a customer person at Copa Airline given a similar behavior on my previous flight connecting through Tocumen as I was explaining, they decided to turn and walk away letting me stand alone as I was still speaking. They didn't apologize for the treatment or for their threat about not letting me board.

### "No decent inflight entertainment"
Charge for Comfort seats is US$83 for each leg, be it a 3 or 7 hours long flight. No decent inflight entertainment. Shared screens that air whatever they please. Very low quality audio and earphones. They change your family reserved seats to separate middle seats. Food is scarce. Gluten-free meals just for Business class.

### "Their business class is a joke"
We've flown Copa 6 times because there were no options. If you have an issue, there is no person in customer service to speak to. Their business class is a joke. We didn't get priority boarding. The seats were just as narrow as coach. No wifi, you need to plug in with their headphones unless you packed yours. Ticket info is almost always wrong, gates change frequently. We had a major gate issue which caused us to run for 25min to another gate. My wife was 2 pregnant ... the worst thing happened around 20min of that run. I was even carrying her bag so she wouldn't have too much stress on her body. But it happened and she cried for a few hours while on our flight. Her Business Class seat went back and then broke. So she had to lay down for the 7hr flight. During landing they made her take the last seat on the back of the plane.

### "do not recommend whatever the circumstances"
I bought a ticket with that company one week in advance because it was written on the conditions that I could change it with no penalties only paying the difference of price. When I tried to change it, they told me that penalties of $400 will apply (I paid the ticket $350). They told me that it was the normal procedure if we were to make change 15 days before departure. Just that this was not mentioned or written anywhere when I bought the ticket. Instead it was written very clearly that no penalties will apply. When I mentioned that very calmly and politely they hung the phone abruptly. I tried to reach them several times but all my attempts were unsuccessful and they have no physical shop in Rio. For me it is exactly like if I had been stolen from my money. In the end I could not travel and lost my money. I do not recommend whatever the circumstances to choose another company to fly with.

### "service was minimal in business class2
We flew business class on Nov 23 from Dulles to Panama City Panama. It was an old plane but the seats were well maintained and serviceable. However, there were no 110V outlets and no screen or port access to video or music programs. Cabin service was minimal in business class. We were not offered a drink (even water) until over 1 hr into the flight when breakfast was served. The breakfast was adequate but several hours later there was no snack or other food provided. No alcoholic drinks were offered. After breakfast, we had to go to the galley to ask for a cup of coffee or water. The bathroom was in business class with miniscule with no room to turn around. Overall, it was at best a main cabin experience at business class prices on a long international flight.

### "the frills are rapidly disappearing"
Just back from a quick trip from JFK to Medellin via PTY in Copa's Business Class. As usual, they do the basics right, planes leave and arrive on time, cabin service is professional and the seat, while still a recliner, has a lot more leg room than most other airlines serving northern South America. Beyond that, in a supposedly full serve airline, the frills are rapidly disappearing. No pillows, no choice of meals (in Business) plastic tumblers for the wine on the connection from and to PTY, a tiny wifi screen and terrible earphones, disorganized and repetitive document checks and all this comes at quite a price. There is a quite nice new lounge in the recently opened terminal extension, but the only food on offer are so called "tuna sandwiches", in effect stale bread rolls with an impossibly thin layer of tuna paste. Instead of scrimping and cutting incessantly, why not think the other way around and put another $10 on the J ticket? That might fund a little bit more tuna and turn the rolls into an actual sandwich, it might fund the return of pillows and a dinner roll, slightly larger dinner portion, maybe more carefully prepared, a real wineglass and a few more lettuce leaves in the mini salad? Small thing matter to make an 8 hour trip into a less of an endurance test.

### "the cost of business is not worth paying"
Not Verified |  Main point: the cost of business is not worth paying unless you are ok with a limited recliner seat that is only wide though hardly reclines (could recline much further). This service cost me close to 2k return! I believe there should be a description of what is offered inflight especially if it’s less than that of the leading carriers. Time to make changes as Copa is privileged to have many flights and connects through the hub of the Americas. They cannot help but increase business and if management were more attentive to all aspects of service then there would be benefits all around. Unlikely to happen in a quasi monopoly. Further to this comment I can add that linking through the bigger airports in Brazil with higher traffic will get you a more modern aircraft or at least a seat that will go (almost) flat. Do not choose Brazilia to go to Panama if you are coming from another province: until now it will be the limited recliner at an exorbitant cost. Lastly, the app is very troublesome and many times it will not work and is undergoing modifications. Copa now have their own terminal a PTY Tocumen. Why not rise to the occasion?

### "makes such fundamental mistakes"
My family group of six passengers was booked to fly IAD-PTY-POS and return Nov 19 to Nov 27, 2022. I've flown COPA before with decent experiences. Our outbound flight departed on time, but experienced mechanical difficulties on the tarmac and returned to the terminal. Outbound flight was then cancelled. After a ridiculously long wait because only one staff member seemed to be available to rebook, we were rebooked on a United flight to Trinidad the following day. Annoying, but I understand mechanical difficulties and the need to be cautious about them. After our arrival in Trinidad, we heard nothing for a week. Ominously, there was no reminder to check in 24 hours before departure. The website said to call Copa so we did, only to find that our booking but not the flight had been cancelled. Seems that COPA's IT system is too incompetent to understand that a passenger rerouted on another airline because of a COPA failure has arrived at destination. We were offered miserable options. 2 people could go on the scheduled flight, but the remaining four would have to wait for a day. Later that day, it became clear from Kayak that more seats were available on our original flight at 4am the following morning. I called to request that all of us be put on our original flight. The representative insisted that any change to our original flights would require a change fee of $75 per person. And, in the end, he claimed there were no seats anyway. To deal with this, my entire party of six (including a five and a seven year old) went to the airport at POS at Midnight for the 4am flight. We were put at the bottom of the standby priority list (which COPA said didn't exist/wasn't available) and were given the last seats, after many other standbys had been given seats. We had to run to get the flight. What sort of an airline cancels your booking because its system is so incompetent that it doesn't recognize that you flew outbound on the flight it booked for you after it cancelled your outbound flight? And then cancels your return booking? And then demands $75 per person to get back onto the flights it had cancelled in error from under your feet? Such a waste as other important things, like plane quality and service were OK. But it's impossible to give a decent rating when Copa makes such fundamental-- and hugely damaging-- mistakes.

### "lost my first flight due to oversold tickets"
I lost my first flight due to oversold tickets .. all they said was sorry and put us on the next flight for the next day. I hope no one goes thru this situation because I felt terrible upset knowing I planned my vacations for a whole year and lost more than 800 in only one day of my vacations plus parking money. Then in our way back they announced to the public who wanted to volunteer to stay because again they were overbooked! This airline is horrible.

### "customer service is disgusting"
The worst airline I have traveled with, customer service is disgusting, the lack of responsibility towards travelers is nil. After the flight is delayed because there is no runway at the Panama airport, they send it to another airport to refuel and finally arrive in Panama more than 3 hours late, and the traveler misses the connection, and the only thing say you is "We are very sorry, I reschedule your connection for the next day, but it is not our problem where you spend the night". Also the luggage never reached the final destination with the passengers, until more than 36 hours after the passenger arrived to its final destination, the luggage finally appears.

### "Seat was broken"
Seat was broken offering no support to my back. Aircon was not working, it felt like 28 degrees during the 6 hours of the flight A passenger fainted out during the flight, I believe this was due to the heat. Wrote a complaint but did not get a satisfactory answer.

### "satisfied with my two flights"
I was satisfied with my two flights with Copa to and from Curaçao. The airport at PTY is spacious with plenty of staff on hand. Boarding was efficient on both sectors and sufficient overhead space despite busy flights. I was seated in the last row of Economy which was uncomfortable when the pax in front reclined but I was unable to. The crew asked him to come forward during the snack service so I could enjoy my banana chips and drink. Outside of the service I requested coffee which was promptly delivered in a friendly manner. On the return, the airport staff obliged to seat me in the exit row. I find the prices offered online extremely high for the length of flight. The crew gave a good briefing for seating in this row. There was some light entertainment on the overhead screen and also some recent music in the in-seat audio. Flight arrived in PTY T1 but with a clear announcement and signage, made my way to T2 to collect baggage and clear customs.

### "Flight was nice"
Panama City to Bogota. Flight was nice. At the gate I asked for a better seat and gave us exit. Service with chips and drinks on a short flight and even inflight entertainment. Only drawback had 30 mins delay waited for connecting passengers.

### "customer service by phone is amazing"
Not Verified |  I must say that Copa Airline's customer service by phone is amazing. I'm travelling in December 2022 and had a few problems with my itinerary (cancellation, changes, etc). I initially bought my tickets through Expedia, but they had wrong information, so I decided to contact Copa directly. Both times I called to make sure everything was ok and to fix problems, they were quick, gave me solutions and fixed my problems. Even though another airline had cancelled, they managed to make it work and found a replacement for me. So I didn't need to call a thousand places. Thank you Copa!

### "The worst airline in the world"
The worst airline in the world, our trip was on August 29, they canceled the flight at the last minute, they offered an alternate flight almost until the next day without giving security of the connection in Panama, collecting the luggage was a nightmare, the lady at the counter He did us the favor of transferring us to United Airlines because we needed to reach our destination the same day United Airlines charged us for the full baggage ($160) money that to date I have not been able to recover, there is no direct telephone number to make the claim, only via email and every time I send an email they tell me to wait 19 business days for the refund of the money and from 10 to 10 we already go for 1 month and no money. La peor Aerolínea de Mundo, nuestro viaje fue el 29 de agosto, cancelaron el vuelo a último minuto, ofrecían un vuelo alterno casi hasta el día siguiente sin dar seguridad de la conexión en Panama, recoger el equipaje fue una pesadilla, la señorita del counter nos hizo el favor de trasladarnos a United Airlines porque necesitábamos llegar a nuestro destino el mismo día United Airlines nos cobró el equipaje completo ($160) dinero que hasta la fecha no he podido recuperar, no existe un numero de teléfono directo para hacer el reclamo, únicamente vía correo electrónico u cada vez que envío un correo me dicen que espere 19 días hábiles para el reintegro del dinero y de 10 en 10 ya vamos por 1 mes y nada del dinero.

### "Copa Airlines will not refund"
I had to cancel my flight due to Covid positive results 24hr before the flight. Everything was going well at the beginning when we cancelled the flight/ticket, because we have been informed that they will refund. However, after almost 40 days I have been informed that Copa Airlines will not refund. This action is not fair at all.

### "no meals served during the flight"
Copa has to be the world's worst airline! The plane arrived in Panama City from San Francisco without time to make my flight to Chiclayo, so I had to re-route to Ecuador! No taxi or hotel vouchers or any assistance was offered had I wanted to wait until Friday for the next flight. There were no meals served during the flights. The 737 Max is a horrible plane! Crowded, and the customary video screens are missing. On the return flight to SF, a meal was served. But I could not order a special meal. They charge an atrocious $4.20 surcharge (or more) on the ridiculous $35 bag fee. This is because they force you to pay with a credit card! The returning flight from Quito arrives at midnight, so BART is not running! Avoid this airline at all costs!

### "absolutely shameful and disgraceful"
I'll start by saying I really want to like Copa. The staff is really friendly at airports and on board, and they have a wonderful new terminal at PTY now operational. Unfortunately Copa has a unique ability to fail to think through their processes related to the new terminal and completely ruin the passenger experience as a result. They've completely snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and my experience which I'll relay here is nothing short of Orwellian and bizarre. Having had several subpar experiences at the old terminal (T1), I was really looking forward to using the new terminal (T2) on this trip PTY-MDE-PTY. The outbound flight from PTY was a wonderful opportunity to experience it - the terminal is spacious, clean, modern and efficient - everything that the old terminal isn't. Everything worked well from check in to security, passport control and boarding and I was impressed. All Copa flights depart from the new terminal and everything functioned well. I should've cautioned my enthusiasm after my departure experience as I had no idea what awaited me on my return. On the MDE-PTY return for some odd reason that nobody could explain the Copa arrivals came into the old terminal, which struck me as odd. Why would you build a beautiful new terminal and not use it for all of your flights. Be that as it may, the flight arrived at the old terminal, and I went down to passport control and got through quickly but when I wound up in baggage claim to collect my bag I was astounded to hear that the Copa bags are all delivered to the new terminal. So there I was through passport control and in baggage claim and learned I was in the wrong place. I had to exit baggage claim, make my way to the new terminal via a severely under air-conditioned bus or walk in 30 degree heat and rain. I finally got to T2 but because the baggage claim area is secure, it was not possible to freely enter to collect my bag. Airport personnel insisted I solicit help from Copa to get me inside to get my bag. I spoke with about 6 different Copa employees and spent approximately 30 minutes gaining access. The Copa employees were helpful but not terribly sympathetic. They told me it was totally my fault (blame the customer) that I didn't know the bags were to be delivered and collected at T2 despite a T1 arrival. In my defense I heard no announcement on board, was sent no notification via email or text, was told nothing about this when I checked in for the flight, was given no piece of paper that explained this in Spanish or English, there were no Copa employees who met the plane at the old terminal to advise us to stay airside to go to T2 to collect our bags, and nobody in passport control or baggage claim to explain, no screens advising. In short there was no communication on behalf of the airline to assist passengers. Logically any passenger who arrives in one terminal would expect their bag to arrive in the same terminal. This logic was completely lost on all airport and airline personnel as I tried to collect my bag. I simply cannot understand nor accept that the airline and airport are not at fault by choosing to build a new terminal then not use it, force passengers to walk 1 km in the heat to collect their bags at another terminal and then implementing a a scheme that provides zero information about this to passengers at any stage in the process. It's absolutely shameful and disgraceful in every possible way.

### "my seat had been changed"
This flight happened almost 3 months ago and they switched my seat last minute. I paid for premium seats, in the 5th row, in a window seat. Upon boarding, I was notified that my seat had been changed. I had to wait for a new boarding pass while almost everyone else boarded the plane, as the attendant was busy scanning everyone else in and having issues printing my pass so she had to just write the new seat on my existing pass. They switched me to the emergency exit row, in the aisle seat. I watched to see who got my seat and it was a lady with a small child, and children aren't allowed in the exit row so I figured that's why. Also, their stupid site can have programs in place to notify of seat issues when choosing seats for kids. This ruined my experience by 80%. I had really looked forward to the views from the window leaving my country behind, and the views upon entering a new one. Things would've been even worse if I had to join a customs line after that specific flight but luckily I didn't have to. Just a disappointment because I paid extra.

### "gave no solutions to their customers"
Not Verified |  Disgusting the way they treat their passengers after cancelling a flight. After a 7 hour wait at the airport they gave no solutions to their customers, using an excuse that it was not their fault the flight was cancelled, but that “it was a technical difficulty “. No refunds, and the hotel they provided only offered fixed menus at the restaurant without any options for people who are vegetarian or had health diet restrictions.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. Waited 8.5 hours at the airport, and the flight was canceled, claiming weather problems, when other aircrafts were flying out. After rescheduling the original flight, we had a delay of 3.5 hours in Panama city, due to lack of airline crew. After arriving in Sao Paulo, another connection delay of 5 hours and change of airport to be able to get to destination, due to lack of professional manners of airline personnel. Do not choose this airline, or you will have the worst airline experience of your life.

### "Could not check in online"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible airline, avoid at all cost. Could not check in for flight online, had to arrive earlier at airport. I was told there was an aircraft change and only 3 rows of first class. I was seat 3b but somehow was bumped to economy. Took gate agent over 1 hour to figure out. I paid for 1st class ticket but given economy seat for same price.

### "unconcerned about their service"
I am a frequent traveler, but I have never dealt with an airline as frustrating as this one. At the start of my flight I had to surrender my carry on, and I never saw it again. I filed a lost baggage claim in Manaus, and I did not even receive a copy of the claim. The agent told me to photograph the report, which was hand written. Three passengers on the half filled flight lost luggage, including some expensive fishing equipment. When I arrived in Panama City for my layover the baggage wasn't there, and employees brushed me off for two hours. Since the loss of the bag I have sent two emails to Copa, and I phoned them today. The emails have been unanswered, and the call was futile, I was simply told to send another email for them to ignore. This airline is staffed by incompetent people who are totally unconcerned about their service.

### "such an incompetent airline"
Not Verified |  Flight was 2 1/2 hours delayed, so Copa knew well in advance there were tons of missed connections in Panama City. They didn't have any employee at the gate to help passengers, not even a sign telling passengers where to rebook. They have TWO customer "service" people rebooking a huge line of people. Stood in line for 4 hours after being told on 3 different phone calls that Copa couldn't rebook us over the phone, and we had to stand in line. Waited for 4 hours with no food or water only to be told to go to a hotel for 4 days until we could take the next flight out. What a nightmare and I've never seen such an incompetent airline.

### "compensation of 10USD each for food"
Never fly with Copa Airlines. Avoid this company. Copa airline took off 2 hours late on our return flight which made us miss our first connection to Santo Domingo then our last flight from Santo Domingo to Guadeloupe. Copa airline refused to put us on another available flight that would have allowed us to catch up with the next flight, the company made us arrive 15 hours late in the end with compensation of 10USD each for food!? The counter staff were completely incompetent and in the end Copa airline left us with no possible correspondence far from home saying that they can't do anything for us anymore that it's because of their system and saying that it's because weather, but weather problems do not clear any company from taking care of its passengers! Ne volez jamais avec copa airline. Evitez cette compagnie. Notre expérience, copa airline a décoller avec 2h de retard sur notre vol retour ce qui nous a fait manquer notre première correspondance vers Saint-Domingue puis notre dernier vol de saint Domingues vers la guadeloupe. Copa air line a refusé de nous mettre sur un autre vol disponible qui nous aurait permis de rattraper le vol suivant, la compagnie nous a fait arriver avec 15h de retard au final avec un dédommagement de 10USD chacun pour manger ! ? Le personnel de comptoir a été complètement incompétente et au final copa air line nous laissa sans correspondance possible loin de chez nous disant qu'ils ne peuvent plus rien faire pour nous que c'est à cause de leur système et disant que c'est cause de la météo, or les problèmes météo ne dédouane aucune compagnie de prendre en charge ses passagers.

### "not adhere to their policies"
I will never again fly COPA airlines. When I first went to check in for my flight, they denied me boarding because I had an emotional support animal (dog) even though their policies clearly state that they allow ESAs (https://www.copaair.com/en/web/us/service-animals). I was forced to purchase a last-minute ticket with GOL to Sao Paulo for a sum of $800. I filed a complaint with COPA, but they refuse to acknowledge the problem or issue any sort of refund or compensation. In Sao Paulo they did allow me to board with my ESA. The flight leaving Sao Paulo was 4 hours late (the flight after mine ended up leaving before mine) which caused me to miss my connecting flight. Overall, COPA is unprofessional, difficult to work with, disorganized and does not adhere to their policies.

### "selected window seat was reassigned"
I've flown with Copa Airlines on a couple of occasions. The aircrafts have on both occasions been modern and either new or revamped with good air circulation. Value for money trumps many latin American airlines such as Avianca for sure. The main issue to beware is the customer service. My selected window seat was reassigned without my knowledge or consent. I discovered at the gate that I was reassigned a middle seat and my prior seat given away despite holding a ticket for that seat. On the aircraft I was told that I could ask someone to switch seats (obviously I refused to do that!) and then told I had the option of getting off the aircraft! I emailed the customer service department following the flight and they responded with waffle. Terrible service at every juncture. And this for a frequent flyer with platinum status on a partner airline so who knows how much worse they perform for others.

### "Completely unprofessional staff"
Completely unprofessional staff in both Punta Cana and Panama airport. Our flight was delayed 4 hours in Punta Cana due to Hurricane Fiona which was totally acceptable. I would not want to fly in bad weather so this decision was well respected and appreciated. The real issue came with the lying staff that works at the airport. I was told in the airport that our connecting flight in Panama to Miami will also be delayed so that we can make it to Miami same day. They proceeded to say that because it is weather related Copa works well with their customers and makes arrangements to delay connecting flights if needed. We were assured that we would get home same day. I traveled with my husband and three minor children, 10 yrs old, 6 yrs old, and 4 months old. We checked in our luggage, including the infants stroller, straight to Miami. Well upon arrival in Panama we were instructed to make huge lines to speak to Copa staff at the counter. Upon seeing this and carrying my baby I walked to the front of the line and spoke to the Supervisor, and asked for assistance since I had a 4 month. Well the supervisor was clearly frustrated and in a bad mood and took that out on me and my family. She told me to look behind at the line and that I needed to make the line. Well I told her that I take priority because of the baby as it had been the entire vacation while traveling. She told me to sit down that she would be with me whenever she could. About 15 minutes went by, me standing there with my 4 month old baby, and she never once looked my way nor did she assist. Finally the other staff member next to her called me over. We then were hit with the surprise that their were no other flights leaving that night and that we would be leaving the next day. At this time I asked for a hotel stay and she responded "Copa doesn't cover hotel stay due to weather delays". At this point I was livid. After paying $1800 for our flights, checking in our bags and stroller to Miami because of incompetent staff, standing at 11pm in the Panama airport with no clothes, no baby food, no diapers, nothing, and being told "we needed to figure it out on our own" is plain disrespectful. I then wrote a complaint to Copa via email and spoke to  Customer Service, which did absolutely nothing despite the awful experience and treatment that I received with my family. I will never fly Copa again.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. Their customer service is terrible. Prior to my departure they “ran out of luggage space onboard the plane” and claim even though I purchased a carryon bag I had to pay a check bag fee so they can throw my carry on under the plane. I ask them if I can place the bag under the seat because it’s small enough to fit. They of course refuse! I was force to pay the fee and throw my bag under. Upon claim my luggage at my destination I discovered my bag was damage! I took pictures and filed a claim with the airline. I even provided them with the recipe showing date of purchase and amount. This was brand new LV bag. The emailed me back a few weeks later stating the would not cover the damaged “due to the fact that the damage presented may be due to inherent use or quality of the baggage.” This was a brand new LV bag, that I purchase a month prior to the trip. I never used it as a checked bag because it’s small enough to fit in the carry on slot. Even though I have pictures, receipt, boarding pass, luggage’s tags and proof of damages they refuse to take responsibility. Their customer service is terrible! Even if they were offering free flights I’d never fly with Copa Airlines again! !

### "Avoid if you can"
Leaving from San Jose to Panama City, my flight was delayed. There was much confusion and delay in updating the screens of letting the passengers know, they didn't have any satisfying or complete answers concerning any of us being able to get help in Panama with our missed layover to LAX. The flight crew in the cabin did admirably and only gave other passengers seemingly trivial problems. From Panama City to LAX, we had to wait hours after flying in to Panama before even knowing if we'd have flights or where people would be going before reaching their destination. The ground service was laughable, it was one man trying his best albeit not even close to being able to handle the situation with another service member focused on the next flight for the area & sometimes both of them were preoccupied with making announcements or just repeating details to passengers instead of helping us with our issue of being delayed, take that as you will. Others were upset that they would not even adhere to their policies and just intended to let people out to dry due to delays. They were not taking any responsibility for the situation, would not put people up in hotels anymore or give them shuttles or any similar accommodation because as I was told, this was ceased since Covid and that's part of their new restrictions (Allow people to just congest the airport due to delays while also having all over the airport you can't sit or lay down on carpet due to Covid Safety Guidelines) It was so contradicting and beyond that they charged for wifi past 30m unless you paid to stay in an overpriced lounge for 8 hours that I heard from a lady you couldn't even sleep in and they'd keep waking you up to prevent it. Those last two parts are more on the airport than airline but the entire thing was a grossly obvious shakedown. Copa is just aiding and abetting by stranding passengers there instead of helping them. All that being considered, after waiting for hours, I talked to a man that while he gave me questionable reasons for why they couldn't do much and aren't responsible nor had anything else to do than the bare minimum, I was not worried about these other issues as much, I was quite happy he was able to give me a boarding pass for the following morning for my next 2 connections ( I was going from SJO to Panama City to LAX and had my last layover there before finally one additional flight that was with another airline fortunately! ) and he checked all the other flights at my behest to see if I could find something faster or more reasonable. There wasn't but I appreciated the effort and in the SPECIFIC time frame I was talking to him, the speed of getting me what I needed and answering my questions, though I was prepared. All in all, they acted in a way that the idea of a delay was foreign to them, they didn't have any standard procedures to handle it, they had NO sufficient answers and generally no answers to your questions unless you knew what to ask. Be it about luggage, flights, where to stay or what to do. They gave no thought to our situation besides getting us on the next available flight. In my case I had been up for a very long time and was hellbent on getting to the US so I didn't have much in terms of complaints and found the bare minimum acceptable in my case but I sympathized with all the others that got completely f'd over. (Neve rmind, reviews can't contain profanity in effort to censor opinions) Avoid if you can at all reasonable costs.

### "takes advantage of everyone"
Avoid Copa Airlines at all costs, this company takes advantage of everyone, including Panamanians. I had sent some personal effects by cargo from Canada to Panama because I had finished my studies and could not take them all with me in the flight to Panama. On its arrival, I was asked to make a list of every single thing in the suitcase and list its price (mind you that it was clothes I had worn for years and bed linens, school notes, and other personal effects). These people along with the Customs department blatantly scam people. They claimed the Tact Rate in the Air Waybill was how much I had to pay them, yet it is common knowledge for customs people that this is an arbitrary cost used by freight companies and not the actual shipment costs. For reference, the tact rate was $580, while the amount I had actually paid to send the package was CAD$360. In addition, they insisted on us having to hire a customs broker and on having to pay an arbitrary amount to get it out, basically a bribe, but a bribe you can't get away of. Don't do your business with them, as a Panamanian I'm sorry, but please take your business somewhere else where they don't have the audacity and ignorance to scam you and act like that is the law.

### "worst airline I have ever travelled"
In short the worst airline I have ever travelled with and I am a frequent traveller with regular interaction with airline of varied background. There was no vegetarian option for food despite this being requested at booking time, check in staff extremely rude and unhelpful onboard staff were just doing what's required but no intention of helping extra. All I can say is avoid.

### "I will never recommend this airline"
I needed to send my dog from San Francisco to Medellin and had to use Copa Cargo. During the booking process I was misinformed about a document then I had to be the one to call and figure out what I was missing. They had not sent me the form I needed in the initial email and had I not called I would have never known about said document. When we took our dog to Copa Cargo in San Francisco they did not want to accept said document because it had been printed out by our vet and was not an original copy mailed to us, even tho the USDA website clearly states that a completed signed document can be printed by our vet and accepted. We finally got that figured out and they accepted the printed copy because turns out they were wrong and it was allowed to accept that one. Well then in Panamá on our layover we tried to inquire about the well-being of our dog after the flight and we were told at the Copa Service Center that they did not handle that type of thing and that we had to talk to another department. They didn’t even have a phone number or contact for that department tho! The woman at Copa Service Center was no help at all and didn’t take my concerns about my dog seriously. We were fed up and exhausted by this point but it got worse. When we finally landed in Medellin we were not informed about the process of what is needed to successfully and accurately check out our dog from Copa Cargo so we spent an additional 4 hours driving back and fourth from the airport to their cargo building trying to figure out everything that we needed to get our dog. Our dog spent more than 24 hours locked in his kennel, with no food or water because of this airline’s negligence. I will never recommend this airline.

### "airline has sunk to the bottom"
Not Verified |  This is my return trip from Colombia to Mexico. I will not use this airline again! On the first trip I was in line for 1.5 hours to get a boarding pass although I arrived more than 3 hours early. Staff stood around, gave wrong directions. On the return flight, the attendant told me to wait for a male passenger to assist me to put my backpack in the overhead. I noticed she helped the Latino passengers with their hand luggage. Then she squishes my expensive custom medical pillow in the overhead which may cause it to be unusable. I realize travel is not what it once was; however, this airline has sunk to the bottom.

### "This was the worst experience"
This was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. The flight got delayed in Bogota-Colombia by an hour. We arrived to Panama late to make connection to another flight going to Chicago. The gate informed us that the flight had already left. Four people going to Chicago including me were stranded at the airport. The airline told us that they were not responsible for anything. We had to look for a place to stay that night which cost an arm and a leg because they have such an inefficient process. Never again, if they can’t honor their connecting flights and it costs you $200 dollars for a hotel and you waste your time you are better off flinging with a better airline.

### "Don’t expect any customer service"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline my family has flown with! Food was so terrible. Everything is disorganized, almost no English is spoken by people on the planes or at the counters inside the US or in Panama. They do not take care of your baggage either. Lost my 23k suitcase, and did not provide me with a number to call or any information other than it can take 21 business days for them to find my bag. Everything was horrible except for the leg room in the plane that was decent. Don’t expect any customer service either!

### "business class is not worth the money"
If you can avoid this airline, please you will do yourself a favour. The business class is not worth the money, awful seats, zero entertainment options.

### "six people to figure out how to charge my bag"
It took Copa almost an hour for no less than six people to figure out how to charge my bag and issue the receipt for it. When I mentioned that an apology would have made the situation easier, they said I would probably be angry even if they had apologized! I guess you can’t expect much from an airline that only serves a tiny bag of plátain chips as a meal in an international flight.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Rude attendants, long delays in Panama Airport with zero amenities. Our trip started with an on time flight to Panama from Boston, we were rushed into the plain 10 minutes before the boarding time, then we were forced to wait for an hour and a half, not taxiing, no explanation. After getting into the air over two hours after our initial departure time we sat in broken chairs, trays that didn't lock, with attendants who didn't speak English. The food was gross, with no ingredient list for those with allergies. You need to sign into  wifi to access movies from 10 years ago with a few non-notable exceptions. The restrooms were dirty from the beginning of the flight. On our return flight we spent two hours in the checkin line. Our connecting flight in Panama was given away to another flight while giving us a two hour delay, in an airport terminal with no restaurants but a Duty free that sells 9$ USD sandwiches. When bring up the 20% compensation for 2 hour delayed flights we were told it was only a 1 hour and 56 minute delay where they didn't have to compensate us at all. I will never fly with them again.

### "We were seated separately round trip"
Not Verified |  I’ve been traveling with my wife for over thirty years (hundreds of flights) and never had the issue of being seated separately. We were seated separately round trip. I can only conclude they just don’t pay attention to this, but they kind of seek it.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The flight was cancelled, and cancelled, constantly the gates were changing. No info provided by staff. We had to spend a night in the airport, they just refused to put people in the hotel. At the same time, not giving info about the flight or IF this flight is gonna happen at all. Worst airline ever!

### "the gate was changed three times and we missed our flight"
I can’t blame the staff necessarily but the gate was changed three times and we missed our flight because there was no announcement message sent and they didn’t update the board to show the new flight change, on our connecting flight we all went to the gate on our ticket and when we got there they said oh no the gate was changed and it was over a kilometre away to the other side of the Panamanian airport, we got there 15 minutes before the flight was supposed to leave but they already had the doors closed and said because everyone had boarded, they were going to leave early and sorry once we close the doors we can’t let you in. Because we missed our flight we missed our pick up ride that was prepaid and our first reservation for the trip.

### "never fly with this airline again"
The staff at Panama Airport lost or stole one of the items I was forced to check in. They charged me $50 US to check in a skateboard with no metal and no wheels on it. This was a gift for my son. When I got home I filed a claim with the company website which said I would receive a reply ‘within 25 days’ (?). The company representative that I finally reached could not find any scans of this item, meaning that it was not scanned at the point of origin and that it was stolen. I will never fly with this airline again. Pay the extra money and fly with a better airline or take a picture of the staff that checks your bags in case you suffer the same fate as I did.

### "gave me the last row seat in the middle"
I paid seat selection but they did not allow me to select my seat. They gave me the last row seat in the middle, for me that is the worst seat ever and I did not have a say. Also the food is not good and the entertainment on board is very limited.

### "No amount of pleading with the staff would change anything"
I paid extra for all my four flights on COPA to have the Exit row seat 17A for the extra legroom. At Panama airport, upon boarding March 1st to Toronto, the ticket agent ran after me and gave me a different boarding pass, putting me into an awkward, painful middle seat 7B (which is not in my listed preferences). No amount of pleading with the staff would change anything. I questioned the man sitting in my 17A seat and he said that he also paid for that seat online. So obviously I was unceremoniously bumped due to double booking by COPA. Such practices should be illegal. The problems they cause do not help the airline's reputation! Then, my backpack could not be stowed because all the overhead bins were full and it ended up being thrown in cargo and sent on the conveyors to Carousel 12 at YYZ, and it was damaged as well. I was absolutely livid at such cavalier abuse of an old man. I completed a post-flight survey with my complaint but have received no satisfactory response to date. I am a 220 lb 72 year-old great-grandfather who endured an awful, painful flight for 6 hours in a middle seat at the hands of COPA. I have since been in touch with COPA Customer Service (that's a joke) who refunded me $26.25 and offered a $50 travel voucher only good for one year. As if I would ever fly with them again if there were other alternatives.

### "Impersonal service"
On time performance. Seat / sleep comfort affected by the narrow feet rest area. Impersonal service with generic food. Poor amenity kit. Loud advertising running in a continuous loop until take off, not taking in account the late departure time in the night. Good IFE with terrible outdated film choices. Mediocre headphones.

### "worst airline I've ever witnessed"
The airline decides to change our original departure/return times, and we call trying to adjust our flights accordingly a normal procedure for most flights. Copa Air is the biggest scam I've witnessed they basically switched one of our flights to profit off of us by giving us an undesirable flight at 2 am and when we called to correct it they tried to charge us an exorbitant fee of "$3000" to return our original departure time of 3pm. This has to be the worst airline I've ever witnessed. Instead I am forced to pay 300 and rebook with american airlines instead. Disgrace of an airline.

### "the most incompetent airline"
Bag was submitted at checkin counter in São Paulo CM758 One bag never arrived. 2 bags did arrive ok. When I got to LAX I contact Copa Airline for my missing bag and they told me that would contact me back by email but it been almost 3 mouths and still no contact or help from Copa. I called every week and they put me on hold for one hour and never solve my problem. Missing bag is probably in São Paulo GRU, The ID was attached to the bag and the bag went on conveyor behind checkin desk but I’m not sure where is my bag, Copa airlines did not do anything to find my luggage it like they don’t care and all my clothing is gone. I don’t know what to do anymore to get my bag back or to get hold with Copa. I sent multiple email and no answer. Please don’t flight this Airline they are the worst and the most incompetent airline.

### "what a disappointment"
Not Verified |  First time traveling in Copa and what a disappointment, first they changed the schedule in the departure times from New York to Quito with the difference of 4 hours, of course now two people in the group can’t make it and when I tried to change the dates for this people it took me two weeks to be able to change the flights for these passengers. Two weeks calling almost every day with different options for different dates to only find out that my requests were denied by Copa Airlines because it was their convenience not to accept my requests and make this process last as long it was possible, to finally said that now it is high season and charged me and extra $1315. What a shame, what a scam.

### "never again use this company"
Not Verified |  I purchased ten tickets total and needed one more. Instead of helping I was told every time too bad so sad. Horrible experience. 4/4/2022 called customer service There were supposed to be 9 tickets total in my group. There was only eight- when I checked the prices, I saw that they were double the price of what I originally paid for my tickets. I called and explained the situation, I was told that there was nothing they could do to help and that I would have to buy a new ticket at the new price 4/6/2022 spoke to customer service. Tried to explain situation, he stated he could not help and was unable to make any changes. Asked for a supervisor and was told the answer was not going to change and that the supervisor was unwilling to speak to me I placed a ticket on 24-hour hold. When I tried to pay for it later that night, the website would not allow me to make that payment. 4/7/2022 spoke to customer representative, tried calling to pay for ticket since the website was not working. I was told that the ticket was no longer valid. I asked if they could match the price which was $100 cheaper. They said no and that I would purchase the new ticket at the new price. Unable to help me and unwilling to transfer to a supervisor- when i asked why? he said because the answer was not going to change, and the supervisor was not willing to speak to me. Supervisor unwilling to help or make adjustment. My question is it worth to not help your customers over $100 dollars? My family and I make this trip constantly- i purchased ten tickets all together and the unwillingness to help is astonishing. I will never again use this company and make sure that my family members don't either.

### "suggested I bring food from home to save"
2 days before my trip they canceled my connecting flight and "accommodated " me on another one 11 hours later. That turned my 10 hour flight into a 21 hour one. Then they proceeded to remind me, that if I "chose" to cancel, my $500 dollar ticket was nonrefundable. When I told the customer service rep that I would also have to make new transportation arrangements that would cost more money plus buy food for the day, she suggested I bring food from home to save.

### "do not use this airline"
Trinidad to Miami via Panama. My flight was scheduled to depart POS at 3:54 AM on 1/22/22, and it was not until I got to the airport at 1 AM that I found out COPA had cancelled the flight. I was approached by a rep who was not even an employee of the airline, who was good enough to get on to the local rep of the airline and have my ticket re-routed thru Guyana to Panama later that night. As Guyana needs a Covid test to enter (even just to transfer planes) which was not needed for Panama, I had to race around on Sunday to find a lab that could do this test in time for my departure. Anyway, I was successful and returned on time to be boarded on a 30 odd seat 2-propeller plane, and had to pay $30 for them to load my suitcase. You would think that Copa would pick up this tab and the lab tab as well, but no. It came out of my pocket! Guyana was an earthly version of hell, with the Copa staff offering no assistance to passengers transferring to their plane, even hiding their name badges when you asked for their names. I contracted Covid in Florida, and asked an attorney in Panama to rearrange the dates on my ticket; he had no better luck than I would have had, as I basically paid for a new ticket. No credit. Do not use this airline unless you love stress.

### "They have been unresponsive to e-mails"
Flying via United/Copa Airlines from RNO to SFO to PTY to GYE on 3/12/22-3/13/22. Copa Airlines lost one of my bags between SFO and GYE. While on vacation for over a week in Ecuador, I followed up daily with Copa but they were unable to locate my lost bag. I incurred over $1,000 in expenses to replace various items during my vacation. I returned to the US on 3/20/22 and did not receive my bag until Thursday 3/24/22. When I submitted a request for reimbursement of expenses to Copa Airlines, they offered just $150. They have been unresponsive to e-mails and their phone customer service is horrible.

### "go with a company with better reviews"
Not Verified |  I tried for 24 hours to check in but their website would not recognize my booking code. I contacted my agency, they confirmed the code was correct and said I would have to check in at the airport. My flight was at 5:55 am leaving Mexico city which is a confusing airport to begin with and I was only able to arrive at the proper terminal just after 5 which is not Copa'a fault however the people at the desk would not let me check in saying the gate was closed an hr before the flight left however I cant help but think I could have still made it. I asked what I should then do and they gave me a number with the quietest assistant I've ever heard on the other end who was unable to offer anything close to help. I went back to the desk to find it empty. every other airline desk was staffed except for Copa for a full hour and a half while myself and other people waited for help. I eventually had to buy 2 new tickets as I was going to miss my connector as well, and after buying them, I attempted to check in for them right away. after waiting inline for another 45 min after the staff finally came back, I was turned away as they said they would not check in other flights until after they had finished booking the current on and to come back in an hr and a half. I did and they had issues printing my boarding pass, then a supervisor was required who was half an hour late. finally after another 20 min I had a boarding pass with no seat registered. I inquired and they said they had overbooked the flight and that there was no guarantee of a seat which would again mean I would miss my connector and have to buy a 5th ticket from them. eventually I did get a seat on that flight however I will go out of my way to not fly with Copa again. Their web site not recognizing a valid reservation code, the non existent phone help, the 1 1/2 hour pause with no staff at the desk, the complete lack of any attempt to make any of the situation easier, the complete lack of any sense of urgency, and the possibility of missing a connector because of their ineptitude was astonishing. If you're planning a relatively complicated trip, I would go with a company with better reviews.

### "They scammed me and other customers"
They scammed me and other customers. They changed my flight 3 times, this would have make me have 10hrs delayed. Obviously, I’ve canceled my ticket. It has been almost a year and they keep playing with me. No refund confirmation emails, reps don’t know what to do, long waiting call lines, not helpful customer service, no managers to talk to, empty promises of “getting it in a few weeks” and nothing happens, so bad it’s negligent.

### "Do not fly with these people"
I recently purchased a flight from Boston to Lima through Panama and upgraded to premium economy seats immediately. Within a few days I received notice that the airline had cancelled my flight and required me to call and rebook. After a very long wait I was informed that my only option was to rebook a flight with an additional stop, an additional 5 hours of layover oh and I would have to wake up at 2am to get to the airport in time. I was informed that I had a right to request a refund but they stressed several times that it would be months before they would process it. almost trying to scare me into taking the horrible option B. I chose the refund. Upon finally receiving confirmation that I would be refunded the ticket price within 60 days I noticed that my upgrade purchases were not included. Requesting clarification from customer service, they informed me that those purchases were non-refundable. What do you mean non-refundable? The airline cancelled my flight. Absolute Scam. Unethical Business. Do not fly with these people.

### "service was indifferent at best"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Colombia in Business. Three of four flights were fine. With the exception of the CTG-PTY flight, service was indifferent at best. On the PTY-ORD flight, after the meal, the flight attendant did not walk through the cabin until the plane was arriving. I tried to give her some trash to throw away, but she just told me to leave it in the seat pocket. Classy. The breakfast on the way to PTY was pretty bad, but the dinner on the way to ORD was good. The inflight wifi didn't work on either of the two long flights to and from ORD. None of the planes had power outlets. The flight from PTY to MDE (inbound aircraft from YUL) had new business class seats that were further apart, however all the other planes had standard business class seats that would not be good for an overnight flight. Ground staff were friendly and we had no baggage problems. The lounge in PTY was a disappointment. Blaming Covid, there was almost no food, just a few packaged cookies and salty products, and only beer and tiny glasses of wine available. Copa got us where were wanted to go, but there was nothing impressive or especially pleasurable about the experience. I might fly them again because of the easy PTY connections, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.

### "book with a different company"
Not Verified | Miami to Bogota via Panama. Second time this week they canceled us and rebooked a flight from Panama that wasn't compatible with the cat, knowing a strike is about to go down in Panama. Luckily, we are smarter than the average Copa manager and called to make sure the cat could get into Colombia. We were going to be stuck in Panama because nobody cared enough to make sure all our needs were met prior to the auto rebook. Yet to meet a Copa employee that deserves the $ they make, let alone more. Talked to one manager but he dipped at the end of his shift. Waited an hour to talk to the next manager and recorded the lack of a response. Meanwhile we would have missed check in for the flight. We canceled but fortunately, we were able to book with a real airline. My wife just ended her long time frequent flyer status with this airline. Safe yourself the headache and book with a different company

### "not seen such a bad airline"
It was such a long time that we have not seen such a bad airline. Flight almost 3 and 4 hours, you have 28 grams of salted biscuits and 25 grams of sweet biscuits Water comes without a glass. Directly from the plastic bottle And everything like that.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
I don't usually take the time to write reviews of this kind but I have to take the time now after what happened. We scheduled a flight from SFO to BOG on March 14, 2022 and after several weeks waiting found that the flight was delayed for 6 hours. Upon calling, we were told that we could arrange a new flight by talking to the airport directly. Upon arrival I was informed that there was no way for the staff at the airport to help with the change as the staff were hired by a third party. To add salt to injury, we were traveling with pets which proved to play against us as the pets were not in their records (fees had been paid to Copa) and a form was missing which we were never informed of in any of the more than five calls that we had with airline reps. We had prepaid our luggage and were told that they didn't have any records of such payment. We had to show our receipts as proof that we had already paid for our bags. We had paid three consecutive seats in the same row but we were given seats in different rows. We were only allowed to move after explaining our situation to later be asked to move again by a different flight attendant. I don't know if there is a way to make matters worse but they informed us that our connection flight would be delayed another 24 hours. I honestly don't recommend this airline to anyone and hope that everyone learns this lesson.

### "Wasted time and ruined trip"
Not Verified |  Terribly unprofessional organization. Customer service is not existent. No one replies to the inquiries. I purchased ticket with confirmation number on their website only to be told that that it never captured. I was told to write to customer service but never received a reply. Wasted time and ruined trip.

### "Terribly unprofessional organization"
Not Verified |  Terrible service. Totally unorganized at the check in, we waited 2 hours to get our bags checked in. The lady at the desk still assured us we would not miss any flights. We waited on the plane for 1.5 hours, the pilot said the reason was because they had no fuel! What a ridiculous excuse! So we missed our connecting flight and we were told there was another flight at 6.30 (2 hours later) but there was actually no flight until 9.30. We have to sit around the airport for 6 hours now and wait. Terribly unprofessional organization not being able to refuel a plane correctly, lying to the customers about the situation, letting the connecting flight take off even though they knew there were a lot of passengers to take the flight on the way. Disgraceful, do not use this airline.

### "probably the worst I have ever flown with"
This airline is probably the worst I have ever flown with. The staff on board the flights are attentive and helpful, but that’s not why I’m giving them an awful review. First, they are nearly impossible to get ahold of and their website is horrible to navigate. We paid for business class for the longer portion of our two flights, and somehow it was attached to our shorter flight. No one was able to be reached to explain what changes needed to happen. So instead of being comfortable and able to sleep on a very long flight, I was crammed into a middle seat next to a man who took up his seat and half of mine and would not stop moving around. They also were late in almost every way. The check in counter in Punta Cana was empty and travelers were frantic. They arrived late to each location and took in excess of one hour unloading baggage on each stop. We only made our connecting flights because we boarded the exact same plane we came in on. If you’re using them for a connection with a short layover you’re likely to miss your flight. Upon arrival in San Francisco my bag was missing and the staff was incredibly dismissive. When I described the items in my bag she wrote out a ticket for 3 items inside the bag that can identify it as mine. She wrote out “fire stars” instead of “cigars”. How does the former of those things make sense? They can also wait up to 90 days before counting your luggage as lost and reimbursing you.

### "this was horrible customer service"
I made my reservation ahead of time for my birthday trip and they canceled my flight without any form of communication! I didn’t get an email, a call or a text message! When i contacted customer service all the agent could tell me was that my flight reservation was cancelled and I don’t have tickets. he couldn’t tell me when it was canceled. but he tells me “it was cancelled to protect our customers”. It’s a great thing i checked before we actually left because we would have been so embarrassed at the airport thinking we have a paid ticket reservations but clearly it was imaginary. I didn’t get a chance to fly with them but i am so glad because this was horrible customer service to a first time flyer.

### "very frustrated with this company"
Not Verified |  I am very frustrated with this company. I was about to go home to Brazil after two years without seeing my family and friends in December when I tested positive two days before my trip. I'm vaccinated and with the booster, but still got COVID. They gave me tickets I can use until November, but I need to book until June. The bad part is: I can only use it here in America or in South American countries, otherwise I lose my money. I called them, explained I can't use it in America because COPA does not do domestic flights, and I can't go to any South American country because I'm right at the moment of transferring universities and as an international student holding a visa I don't know how my situation will be next semester to go during summer break! And since I study full time, summer break is the only time I would be able to go. If they know all of that and don't do anything, I feel very disrespected. I couldn't choose to not get covid and not see my family for longer than 2 years. And I can't just choose to go to Brazil to spend their tickets. I feel like they did everything they can so I don't use my ticket even though I paid for it, and that makes me very upset.

### "The aircraft and comfort were impeccable"
New Aircraft. Excellent Service. Comfortable Lie-Flat Seats. Spacious. Highly Recommended. Service was fine, nothing to write home about. Lounge was also fine, nothing exceptional. The aircraft and comfort were impeccable.

### "Cabin Crew were always available"
It is a bit disappointing that COPA doesn’t have an agreement with MVD airport for Business Class passengers to access the VIP lounge. However, upon boarding, Cabin Crew were generous with their offerings of pre-flight drinks. Throughout the flight, Cabin Crew were always available. Business Class seats are fully lie-flat, and with the blanket/comforter and pillow they provide, it was very easy to go to sleep after eating the (rather small) dinner. I suggest having a substantial meal prior to boarding this 7+ hour flight. Before landing, breakfast consisted of pancakes, apple and orange slices, yogurt, cereal, and coffee. For the price, I believe COPA’s Business Class provides great value. Also, access to COPA’s VIP lounge at PTY airport is a nice amenity with WiFi/internet access, even though the food offerings are very minimal (I left the lounge and had a real meal at the main terminal). Overall, for me the comfort factor of sleeping on a flat bed during flight was well worth the price of the ticket, and all other "shortcomings" are secondary.

### "Will not use them again"
They are overselling all flights by 10% which means that the likelihood for economy class passengers to be put on standby and not being able to board is very high in comparison to other airlines. Compensation for not letting you boardi: 200 usd copa voucher and a night in a hotel that has stains in bedsheets and walls, and a really unpleasant bathroom. Will not use them again.

### "Economy Extra seats are worth the extra cost"
Airport Counter staff and Cabin Crew were polite and helpful. The SFO to PTY flight was delayed by less than 1 hour and upon arrival at PTY passengers with connections received a US$10 meal voucher, which was nice. The PTY to MVD flight was on time. The Economy Extra seats are worth the extra cost; they have a comfortable recline and provide seat-back screens with recent movies, t.v. shows, and the always-entertaining Flight Map feature. For a 7+ hour flight, the meal service is rather minimal (for dinner at departure: a small ham-and-cheese sandwich, yogurt, granola bar, and a soda drink; for arrival: 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of water), so I suggest having a good meal at the airport before boarding AND bringing some snacks with you, as this is encouraged by COPA’s website. I intend to keep using COPA as the Star Alliance partner for trips to South America.

### "cancelled my flight and no replacement option"
They cancelled my flight and had no replacement option. 4 months later - no refund. Copa airlines cancelled my flight about two months before the scheduled departure. They offered no options to replace the flight with an alternate flight. I was told to fill out a refund request on their web site which I did. After two months passed, I called again - still nothing. After three months I sent a registered priority letter to the headquarters in Panama. A little over a week later I received an email (falsely) claiming they had already refunded me. I called again and received busy signal after busy signal. Finally, I got through days later. Then, after a 42-minute call, the agent said he would process two of the three tickets and that I should expect another email within a week (not a refund – just another email), but on the third ticket it had to be handled by a different department and gave another email address for me to contact that department.

### "stuck in an airport for 32 hours"
Never I’ve been mistreated like this before by an airline like this. You don’t need to take my word for it. Just try and reach their customer service. We’ve been stuck in an airport for 32 hours due to their lack of competence and unwillingness to help. They have no knowledge of international traveling rules and will not accept your proof when you try and show them documents. Plus, the moody attendant with her “supervisor” are the cherry on the cake when they deny you boarding and leave you talking by yourself.

### "Their service is terrible"
Not Verified | The flight leaving Atlanta to Panama, the Atlanta check in line wait was two and a half hours. They only had 2 workers working. They lost my bag by forgetting to put a tag on my bag and then blamed me. Their service is terrible and they never called or did anything to help me. Customer service phone lines we called for 7 hours nobody answered. The claim I filed was 17 days ago, they have done nothing.

### "This airline has really gone downhill fast"
Not Verified | This airline has really gone downhill fast. The staff is using the Covid excuse to be rude and inattentive to customers. They sit and offer little to no customer service. I am specifically referring to business class. They do not even serve drinks in business class. Supposedly COVID is the big excuse. I am not convinced as other airlines like United have returned to normal and offer full service in business class. This airline has become one of the most pathetic on most routes. Avoid if possible and don't waste your money on business class.

### "I’ve been requesting a refund for the last 5 months"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Copa to Aruba from Los Angeles. Due to covid, the flight was cancelled. Totally understandable. I was given a travel credit good through the end of 2021. When looking at available flights options, there were none for my original destination. I requested a refund of my original fare. By law, if the airline cancels the flight for any reason you’re entitled to a refund. It’s now been almost 2 years since I originally purchase my tickets. I’ve been requesting a refund for the last 5 months. I can’t even get a response. I’d highly suggest anyone looking to book a time keg and hoping for a shred of customer service avoid this airline at all cost! It’s one thing to have a delayed refund given the circumstances, quite another thing to be ignored and disregarded for 5+ months.

### "never fly with Copa again"
Not Verified | At the airport in São Paulo the Copa attendant who did our check in was extremely rude and uncooperative. First, he gave us a hard time because of the doctors signature on the Covid test. Copa changed our flight leaving us with a 22 hour layover in Panama. When I contacted Copa requesting a change in my flight, I was told that I had to pay an extra US $5,000 to change it. At the check in in São Paulo, we were told that we needed an International yellow fever certificate to enter Panama. The attendant said that we didn’t do our job gathering the travel requirements necessary for our flights, which is a lie! I got into Copa’s website right away, typed in our flight itinerary and the information about the yellow fever certificate was not there. Well, needless to say that we almost missed our flight trying to resolve the issue. The Copa attendant told us that if we had booked our flight directly through Copa, that we would have received all the necessary travel requirements, but that was too bad that we booked our tickets through a third party. Well, now we are being punished for not buying directly from Copa. If you are going to give your customers a very hard time because they book their flight with a third party vendor, you might as well stop vendors from selling your flight tickets. I will never fly with Copa again.

### "Pathetic service Copa Airlines"
Not Verified |  We caught a flight from Panama to Mexico with Copa Airlines, and the woman at the counter assured us the bag would fly straight to Leon and the bag tag she gave us showed the bags were booked all the way to Leon. However when we got to Leon guess what no bags, so we thought its ok they will send the bag on the next flight. Since the bags did not arrive on the next flight we then contacted the connecting flight airline which was Aeromexico, they were quick to assist and track down that the bag never got on to their plane in Mexico, the system still showed that Copa Airlines still have the bag in their possession. We phone the Copa customer service and what a waste of time, you spend 20 min before they answer the phone then you give them all the bag tag and flight numbers only for them to tell you that the provided numbers that they issued you with, are not working on their system. Copa customer services then tell you to fill in an online form for them to search for the bag? Why could that form not be filled by the customer services agent while he was on the phone and already had all the details? Guess what, all that for nothing! Bag still not found - Pathetic service Copa Airlines.

### "I will not use Copa Airlines again"
Not Verified | I will not use Copa Airlines again even before I have flown it tomorrow. The are unreachable by phone until I used the contact number for Canada from the US and waited about 45 minutes. Their app is horrible. When I tried to enter my credit card, it required that I select a country. However, the United States of America or USA were not on the list. I checked it 6 times to make sure. The website is just as bad. I tried to upgrade seats and pay. Each time it rejected my credit card. Tried this an unbelievable 9 times before I accepted their stupidity. Quite honestly, after this experience, I am afraid of what actually checking in and flying is going to look like. My first experience with Copa and very well will be the last unless something miraculous happens tomorrow when I fly.

### "flights have been completely changed"
Not Verified | We purchased our tickets 6 months ago. 2 weeks prior we noticed the flights have been completely changed to a different schedule. Called to fix it and found out two legs were completely cancelled without notifying us while the flight status online still showed on time. We were given only one 35h option for a previously 12h route including sleeping on another city. We had to take it. We were told that we would still have the upgraded seats we purchased (50 dollars each leg for me and wife= US$400 total). Got to the terminal and were told we would just get whatever was left by a very rude attendant. Tried to call customer service about seats and hung up on us. It's incredible that a corporation can get away with treating people like this.

### "My recommendation is to use another airline"
Not Verified |  I am gold member for more almost 10 years with Copa. There is absolutely no difference between elite status and economy in this airline. There is not even a preferential line for boarding. The VIP lounge has only coke and chips, and unfortunately the service of the staff is bad all around. My recommendation if the choice is available is to use another airline. American Airlines for the same route for instance is excellent and cheaper.

### "commend the service I received"
I travel often and I have to commend the service I received from Pedro. (As we checked in) I don't know his last name but he's from Peru and works out of the Miami Airport. He went above and beyond his duties helping us and answering every question we had. His knowledge and professionalism helped us answer all of our questions

### "Stunningly bad service at every opportunity!"
Stunningly bad service at every opportunity! Called COPA customer service the night before my trip to try to change my ticket. After being kept on hold for more than an hour, an agent was not able to change my ticket as I had hoped, but did me the disservice of erasing all my seat assignments on my original flights without telling me. So, the next day I flew in horrible seats instead of the exit row seats I had selected. Next interaction: I tried to use COPA's website to buy my partner a seat next to mine. I tried three times, and the website produced an error message each time. Then I tried to call COPA's customer service line three times to buy the seat; each time I gave up after being on hold more than one hour. Today I finally got through to an agent to buy the seats after only 10 minutes (yippee! ), but he inadvertently hung up on me while processing the transaction. Bottom line, if you want to fly an airline with horrible customer service, COPA is the airline for you. Otherwise, you might try another airline.

### "I would 100% use them again"
Wanted to start off this review by saying: Remember most people only leave reviews when they have a bad experience. So having said that, our experience was great with Copa Airlines! We booked in August $500 to Costa Rica and back. Which was a great deal and when I later checked the prices in October it was up to $1500! Obviously reading the reviews I got so scared our tickets would be cancelled or something so I legit didn’t start booking things for our trip until a week or two before. The day of our flight came and everything checked out, we checked in online easily, I love that we got to pick our seats without paying (not many airlines do that nowadays), and when we got to the airport - because we only had carry-ons and already checked in - we were able to go right through security. The two flights we took there left on time, we were served a sandwich on the 5 hour one, and were perfectly good flights! Crew was nice, COVID protocols were followed and we got to our destination on time! I was also shocked we got our own entertainment service in economy class (private TV with movies and games and a USB charger). They also handed out headphones for free (even thou I had some they are the iPhone ones and don’t fit for the TV so they gave me a pair - I’ve been on other airlines where they wanted to charge me $16). We fly back in a few days and I have no worries at all. I would 100% use them again and probably will if I can get good priced flights!

### "Thank you United, we will stay away from Copa"
Not Verified |  Stay far far far away from Copa Airlines. Joke of an airline service. Unable to assist customers whatsoever. Phones are disconnected. Website is down. They changed our flights and there was no alternative way to reach them. Our last resort was to drive to the airport two weeks before our departure to speak to a Copa representative but even so, no one would be present at the airport until a few days before our departure so too risky to wait that long. We miraculously were helped by United Airlines because they partner with Copa in some of their flights. Thank you United, we will stay away from Copa and share this horrible experience with everyone that we know.

### "Awful customer service"
The morning flight I was supposed to take was delayed 10 hours because of "bad weather" at Aurora airport (curiously other airlines departed at that time without any delays). The real problem was that Copa overbooked the mid day flight and delayed the morning flight to transfer those overbooked tickets to the the flight I was taking. Very dishonest. The delayed flight made me lose my connection to JFK and forced me to sleep at Tocumen airport to take the next flight. Staff was clueless, unhelpful and rude. Awful customer service

### "total lack of respect for customers"
I am writing to express my disgust with the total lack of respect that COPA airlines and its employees have for their customers. My wife and I flew on Flight CM760 from Lima on Saturday, October 30, connecting with Flight CM422 to Montreal in Panama. None of our luggage was transferred to the connecting flight. The rest of the group that boarded in Lima were also affected. From what I could see, it was at least a dozen passengers. We were not informed at any point that this had occurred. Neither the pilots nor the cabin staff told us anything at any point. Instead, we all wasted time waiting in the baggage pick-up area until the wee hours of the morning to find out for ourselves. At no time did any COPA representative explain to us what had happened. And they still haven’t. It would not have been difficult to inform us during the flight that this had occurred and that our luggage would arrive two days later on the next flight. They had over five hours to say something! But no, they decided to say and do nothing and let us find out for ourselves. It’s not the fact that our luggage was not transferred; it’s the fact that we were not informed by anybody. After several emails, I was informed by the lead baggage department agent in Montreal, “Regarding the situation because the suitcases did not connect on time, the only thing I can tell you is that by Montreal airport laws the flight cannot land after 1 a.m., perhaps that is why they did not have time to place the baggage on the flight.” It's a sad state of affairs if the lead baggage agent doesn’t even know what happened! Something is wrong somewhere in the company policy and/or communications. I will never fly COPA again!

### "Stay away from Copa"
Actually I flew in April 2020. Because of the pandemic Copa cancelled my return flight and left me stranded . I had to buy a return via NYC with Delta which cost me more than my round trip with Copa. Copa through Expedia gave me credit. However I just found out that that credit could only be used for a return only from Santo Domingo , which cost as much as a round trip , and of course I'd have to buy a one way ticket to get there to use it. In other words a scam . Shameless proactive from Copa. Stay away from Copa.

### "IFE was nice and service was standard"
Both flights were on B737-800 and on nice and clean aircraft, and the flights were on time. IFE was nice and service was standard packed chips & cookies with coffe or beverages and water. Very difficult to get business upgrade challenge unless to bet good money. Due to covid we had to get voicher and reschedule our trip, always had to call their customer center and spend extra money. Also had to pay extra U$244 for 2 tickets of the new flights

### "Avoid them or get ready for a long ordeal"
Not Verified |  I already had one awful experience with Copa and now 4 months later, it's the gift that keeps on giving. They agreed to refund me since everything was their fault (isn't that nice) but it's been 4 months and no refund. I reached out twice to ask what was going on, and was told each time that they didn't have what they needed to process my refund. If I hadn't reached out, they never would have told me anything. However, the last exchange was over a routing number that I gave them 2 months ago. You ever get the feeling that you're just being messed around? Copa Airlines is as trust worthy as a coyote with a mouthful of feathers. Avoid them or get ready for a long ordeal.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. The lady at the counter was very rude to where she belittled you out loud where others could hear. Then weighed my carry on which I’ve never had experienced with any airline and had to pay $45 to check my carry on due to 2 lbs over. At that they had canceled our original flight back home and pushed it out one more day where we had to pay for an additional day of hotel and car rental. Costing us additional expenses which we did not plan for. This is the first and last time I travel with this airline.

### "Staff super inefficient"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline I've ever experienced. They cancelled my flight without saying anything to me about it. Had to spend an extra day in Panama. Staff super inefficient. I have a lot of patience but the airline in it's entirety is very subpar. This is the first and only time I'll ever use them again. Disappointing.

### "never again will make business with them"
I have to delay my flight for COVID reason and the first two representative say to me its a penalty fee of 100 to 150 dollar each ticket. 1 day after when i call because i don't have received my credit voucher it say now its 300 us dollars of penalty (for a ticket price of 400 dollars). First time i use this company and never again will make business with them.

### "fly direct with another airline"
Not Verified |  Copa Airlines, another failure in terms of customer service and attention. From check-in at the airport in Punta Cana until your arrival in Miami. The desk worker in Punta Cana only knows how to mistreat and say answers such as: "I don't know" or "If you don't want to or you can't, then don't travel with us. Luggage prices that did not appear anywhere from the moment it was reserved and surprisingly they try to load you from a country in which you do not live, whose payment can only be Card, and the cash is not accepted under any term, but has to stay in that country or travel with another airline (according to the checkin desk worker). This same worker is able to mark you in such a way that you are inspected by the Panama Police and they record everything as if you were a criminal looking for possible drugs or other suspicious things, since from the moment I checked in in Punta Cana the supposed agent at the desk seemed suspicious. The food offered on those flights where you have to make a stopover, and it takes almost 12 hours to get home, they only offer you a simple snack of 2 cookies and a 4 oz glass of soda. This helps them so when you get to the Panama airport you find yourself forced to buy food. This airport in Panama has prices 3 times more expensive than the same airport in Miami, so if you fly with Copa Airlines making a stopover in Panama, you'd better fly direct with another airline. The most unpleasant thing was the heat due to the high temperatures on the flights (Punta Cana-Panama, Panama-Miami). You are able to sweat so much that you can feel the seat sweat completely. And the only answer to the service is again: "I don't know" or "Fly with another airline". Copa Airlines, otro fracaso en cuanto a servicio y atencion al cliente. Desde el checkin en el aeropuerto en Punta Cana hasta su llegada a Miami. El trabajador del desk en Punta Cana solo sabe maltratar y decir respuestas como: "No se" o "Sino quiere o no puede, pues no viaje con nosotros". Precios de equipaje que no aparecian por ningun lugar desde el momento se la reserva y sopresivamente te intentan cargar desde un pais en el que no vives, cuyo pago solo puede ser Tarjeta, y no es aceptado el effectivo bajo ningun termino, sino tiene que quedarse en ese pais o viajar con otro aereolinea (segun el trabajador del checkin desk). Este mismo trabajador es capaz de marcarte de tal manera que seas inspeccionado por la Policia de Panama,  y te registren todo como si fueras un criminal en busca de posibles drogas u otras cosas sospechosas, ya que desde el momento que hice checkin en Punta Cana al supuesto agente del desk le pareci sospechoso. La comida ofrecida en esos vuelos en los que tienes que hacer escala, y demoras casi 12 horas para llegar a tu casa, solo te ofrecen una simple merienda de 2 galletitas y un vaso de refresco de 4 oz. Esto les sirve para cuando llegues al aeropuerto de Panama te veas en la obligacion de comprar comida. Este aeropuerto en Panama tiene los precios 3 veces mas caros que el mismo aereopuerto de Miami, asi que si volara con Copa Airlines haciendo escala en Panama, mejor vuele directo con otra aerolinea. Lo mas desagradable fue el calor debido a la elevada temperaturas en los vuelos (Punta Cana- Panama, Panama-Miami) Usted es capaz de sudar tanto que puede sentir el asiento sudarse por completo. Y la unica respuesta al servicio es nuevamente: "No se" o "Vuele con otra aerolinea

### "The worst check in"
The worst check in, I know It was my fault the first day they canceled my flight because I spent a few hours with the covid test, but they made me wait until they finished with all the people who were there to take their flight. I was with a child and a baby of months, we waited until 2:30 in the morning for them to give us another flight, the next day they took me out that the baby needs a certificate of good health, the day before they didn't tell me that. I missed the flight once more and I had to I'll wait with my baby again until 2 in the morning so they can change my ticket again, and it was my third time and they told me again that I needed to include the vaccines on the certificate. I told them that it was the last straw, that once again they did not tell us, I think I already see my frustration and my bad mood of two previous days of not sleeping at all, that they let me board the plane, they have no consideration for a person who make the line like the others and had a 6-year-old boy and a 5-month-old baby.the worst that can be. It was not only me, there were many people who had to wait until that time to get a new ticket, a shame that airline was one of my favorites but with this it's over.

### "Worse airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worse airline ever. First and last time I flight by Copa. The airplane is small, seats are hard, tight and very uncomfortable. For meal they give the passengers a horrible dry bread with a thin slice of ham and cheese, and drinks. That's it. Copa airlines never again. Not for the price I paid over 4,400 dollars.

### "the worst check-in process"
Not Verified |  Between my family and I we have flown Copa from Dulles 5 times in the last three months. All I can say is that this airline has the worst check-in process of any airline. I guess they are trying to save money and only staff three check-in counter agents (at Dulles) for an aircraft that can carry at least 150 passengers; it takes, literally, hours to do the check-in. In one my flights I arrived 3 hours and ten minutes before my flight and upon arriving at my destination (GYE) my bags had a late check-in tag!

### "I'm done with this airline"
I purchased tickets back in February of 2020 to fly on May of 2020 due to the pandemic the flight was canceled I received a flight voucher which they said that I could use before December of 2021. I have attempted to redeem on multiple occasions but they said that they are not flying to Guatemala right know but that on September 1st they were going to start to fly so I booked a flight for October 13th, 2021 on June 26th on July 7th I received an email stating that the flight had changed and to contact customer service which I did they said that Copa is not flying to Guatemala but that they could change my flight to United Airlines, that the days would stay the same, so I agree. I purchased the upgrade by Copa to select seats and for the first baggage to be included, they did not change that to the flight on United I have to pay again for baggage and seat selection I contacted them and they said that I paid Baggage with Copa not with United. I'm done with this airline I would not recommend this airline it's not worth the headaches.

### "wouldn’t travel through them again"
Not Verified |  First time traveling through Copa Airlines and it was the worst. Got there at 3:00am, my flight was leaving at 6am. Check point took forever, everyone was slow doing their job, and we had to be taken to our gate by a worker there. By layover stop we didn’t have a seat, had to speak to someone for them to give our seats, and we couldn’t even sit together - when I bought all the flights a month and half before the trip. Honestly is overwhelming and I wouldn’t travel through them again.

### "I don’t recommend this airline"
Do not buy any tickets from company. I didn’t even fly with them because My tickets got canceled By the airline. I applied for a refund 4 months ago. They said I have to wait 8 weeks But I didn’t received anything. After 8 weeks I applied for it update on my refund status and I received the email that say I will have an answer not longer than 15 days and I haven’t received anything - no updates, no money back to my account. I don’t recommend this airline.

### "Please hire more people and try to be more efficient"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline, got there 2.5 hours early to be on time for everything, and have extra time. I had to wait more than an hour and a half to check-in my big luggage, I did my web check-in online to avoid big lines and still nothing. They need to hire more people to be honest or open more luggage check-in stations, because for people that do the right thing and are always early to be secure that everything can go the way it should be this is disgusting. Please hire more people and try to be more efficient.

### "lack of response is extremely disappointing"
I made a reservation for my wife and I to fly out of Panana City April 7 via Copa Airlines. Due to circumstances, we had to cancel the tickets just several hours later. We were told that the amount would be refunded. We are at week 10 and despite numerous phone calls, the lack of response is extremely disappointing. We have just initiated the dispute with our credit card company.

### "the lady at the call center just hung up on me"
I had to reschedule a flight due to the covid test not arriving on time. First, the call center is not 24 hours so I had to go to the airport to talk to someone from this airline only to be told that they couldn't help us, to wait for the call center to open, great. Once we were able to reschedule the flight and pay for the difference because the original flight was less than 6 hours away from departure (remember, the call center is not 24 hours), I tried to pay for a checked bag on the app, I couldn't find the option so I called the call center again, only to be informed that they only accept payment in person at the counter in the airport. Welcome to 2005 I guess. The problem? I don't have a credit card and Copa doesn't accept cash. I asked to talk to someone else who could solve this issue and the lady at the call center just hung up on me. My friend who lives in the US tried to come with me to the counter to pay for my checked bag but JFK doesn't let you in unless you are flying, my friend ended up waiting outside of JFK while I paid for my bag with his credit card. All because Copa lives in 2005 and doesn't accept pre-paying through the app or their website.

### "their customer service is non-existent"
This is perhaps the worst airline in the entire world. They have changed my itinerary or canceled flight(s) that I have made with them 6 times in the last 3 years. You cannot get an agent on the telephone. Their website is a joke trying to get help. When I do finally get an agent they just say, "I'm sorry", but provide no solution that fixes the problem. Then they tell you if you want to cancel the flight(s) because of their mistake, you will have to call another department to get credit for the flight that they canceled or changed without your consent. I am slow to anger, but their customer service is non-existent. I will never make another reservation with this airline again. How they stay in business is a mystery to me.

### "nobody ever picked up the phone"
I wasted hours trying to reach this airline, both at their main contact phone, and through their Costa Rican branch. I wonder what they were those guys doing there, since nobody ever picked up the phone.

### "never fly Copa Airlines again"
I will never fly Copa Airlines again. After they changed the return flight of our ticket then a few weeks later canceled our flight altogether and pushed it one day, my friend and I were about ready to cancel the flight and get a refund. But after being told that we would have to request a refund and wouldn’t just receive one, we didn’t want to run the risk of them denying our refund and keeping our $700 tickets. AND apparently it would take 6 months for us to even receive an answer regarding our refund. So we decided to go. When we got to the airport, all of the announcements were in Spanish first, check-in was slow, and the employees didn’t seem to know what they were talking about any time you asked a question. After we checked our bags and finally got on the flight, 20 mins into the flight, they announced that we were having technical difficulties with the plane and that they were turning back to JFK. When we got off and I asked what the problem was, they said that they were having engine malfunctions. So we get off and while we’re walking to the boarding area, we were told that the next plane was “ready to go!” It wasn’t and we waited another 30 mins to board. Meanwhile, my friend and I are worried about missing the connecting flight in Panama to Belize City AND the other flight we have scheduled with another airline from Belize City to San Pedro where our hotel is. But they assure us that it will be fine and we receive an email about how our flight in Panama is delayed, so we are temporarily relieved. But then 10 mins after getting on the plane, an employee comes to us and says “you two are going to Belize? Yea, you’re not going to make it there. The plane in Panama is not waiting for any more passengers, they are leaving.” So we ask if they can just put us on another flight in Panama to Belize and they say “Oh Copa only flies to Belize every 4 days.” So we would be stuck in Panama for 4 days! My friend and I are livid, we get off the plane and demand a refund and our checked bags. After another 10 mins of the employees trying to find us and the other 5 passengers that were also going to Belize another flight (although we’ve made it clear that we want a refund and our checked luggage so we can go home NOW), they tell us and the 5 other passengers that our luggage is on the plane .. that just left to Panama. So we got off the plane but our bags were left on the plane! How did they not take our bags off the plane although 7 passengers in total had to get off because of their mistake! The incompetency was out of this world! I asked about my refund because at this point, we lost our money with the hotel reservation, we lost our money with the next flight from Belize City to San Pedro since we can’t even get to Belize at all now, and we lost the money we spent for Ubers to the airport and the ridiculous amount spent on nasty airport food. But apparently we have to speak to someone on the website to get a refund, there’s no phone number or department in the airport to speak to. I’m writing this review one day after the incident and I still have yet to receive my bag.

### "Customer service is useless"
I got turned away one hour before my flight for reasons that are still unclear. They said I had an onward flight to Colombia (I did not) and I needed to show them some paperwork (which I obviously didn't have). And now? Customer service is useless. No information to share. Might as well have been talking with a picnic table. Avoid this airline!

### "compliment the Buenos Aires office staff"
Not Verified |  I want to compliment the Buenos Aires office staff for their speed and efficiency in handling my inquiries. Valeria being one of them. Plane was on schedule and connecting gate very near by and well marked. Baggage arrived to destination despite the short connecting time. The plane was in perfect condition. Breakfast in business class was very disappointing in a box. There were no pillows. Whether that is routine or exceptional to my flight, I cannot tell.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible. My flight was changed due to COVID and I ended up cancelling. Was told I would be refunded. After month and months of back and forth and them telling me over the phone that my refund was sent I have nothing for it. Complete liars, and I am sure they are doing this to everyone. Will absolutely never use them again and will tell everyone I know not to.

### "Absolute nightmare airline"
Absolute nightmare airline. They told my wife and 6 other passengers to go to the wrong gate in Panama. The passengers finally found out which gate they were supposed to go to, by the time they made it there it was too late. The passengers were told they would have to get the next flight at 10:30AM the next day! My wife had an emergency passport from the Ecuadorian consulate so Panama immigration didn't allow her to stay at a hotel. What did Copa do? Nothing, they gather no cover, no food and weren't even kind to her for all of this. So my wife lost an entire day of her vacation and was treated like garbage by Copa employees. I called the only number available and they said they only deal with reservations and "can't help" with customer service issues. On top of that they had no customer service number! An international airline with no customer service line? Pathetic. So I emailed them and waited over 96 hours for a response, they gave no explanation as to how they screwed up and offered $50 credit. I said that is unacceptable and demanded to speak with management. They have yet to return my email since telling them that their "solution" in inadequate.

### "have been very disappointing"
Copa Airlines have been very disappointing. Their staff isn’t accommodating if you are only English speaking. I was so uncomfortable on my way to Panama that I decided to upgrade my seat paying an extra $60 US. While waiting my turn to board my flight by the time they called my seat number, they claimed I had to check my carry on because there was no more room. I think it’s absolutely appalling that they advertise when you purchase your upgrade that it also guarantees extra space for your carry on. When I asked the gentleman flight attendant he completely ignored me. The lady working the gate who brought me my bag sticker reassured me that I was right and I shouldn’t have to check my bag. When I asked her why she was still taking my bag instead of someone else’s who didn’t pay extra for services. She grabbed my bag shrugged, walked away and pretended like she no longer spoke english. Don’t waste your time or money. I would pay more to fly Air Canada. Last time I give another air line a change. Yours truly.

### "avoid Copa Airlines at all cost"
Not Verified |  The customer service is terrible! Staff at LAX are extremely rude! They caused us to miss our flights after multiple cancellations. They don’t give refunds. My entire experience was horrific! Please save your time, money, and frustration and avoid Copa Airlines at all cost!

### "No refund offered only voucher"
Our booking was moved forward by 48 hours without Copa even bothering to inform us. Only found out because we booked through Budget bookings and they let us know. Apparently Copa’s policy is that you are expected to constantly check your booking to see if they’ve changed it. No refund offered only voucher for flights on Copa but when we tried to actually receive that the website would say a voucher was emailed but despite repeated attempts none was ever received. And spent hours trying to get through to someone on the phone with no success.

### "They changed my flights twice"
They changed my flights twice (EZE-MIA), and made me pay for the extra stay and several COVID tests, and obligated me to pay extra fees for my carry-on bag for being "too big" when I already traveled before with no issues. You just lose a client!

### "Copa Airlines is a sketchy company"
My wife and I had a flight booked to visit Costa Rica on vacation. A couple days before our flight out, I happened to check the website to discover that the flight week booked was quietly cancelled and they re booked us for a 1am flight. No call, no text not even an email from Copa. Needless to sat we couldn’t make this trip and immediately requested a refund on the website. Now, 2 months later we still have not received a refund and haven’t even received an email confirmation from Copa that we will be getting one. I’ve tried calling the airline several times now and usually after an hour+ wait on hold they connect you with a reservations department that can’t do a thing about it. Conveniently the refund department doesn’t have a phone. I now know that Copa Airlines is a sketchy company and I’d book with caution.

### "they just completely ignored my request"
Worst airline I have ever interacted with. I am a seasoned traveler and have used many different airlines over the years. We had a reservation with Copa that had to be cancelled due to Covid, and when I tried to change the reservation, and followed their instructions, the reservation was cancelled and they would not help at all. Despite clear evidence that the problem was on their side and that I followed the suggestions by their agent, they just completely ignored my request and now I am left with useless credits that I have to use within a year on an airline that I would not suggest anyone uses. It would have been very simple for them to just change my reservation but they completely refused. Do not use Copa ever.

### "nothing but misinformation, lies"
Not Verified |  Copa Airlines sent a cancellation advisement email in April. I have been trying to get my refund through Expedia for 4 months and then through Copa Airlines for 4 months and have gotten no response to any of my 20+ emails to Copa Airlines. Expedia Supervisor committed to a full refund via email within 30 days of the which would have been May 11th. On May 12th I call Expedia and complain that the refund wasn't received or credited in my bank account. Expedia said they made a mistake and had to start the process all over again and asked for an additional 8 weeks. 8 weeks later they said they ran into a glitch with the Copa Airlines refund tool and needed between 8 to 10 weeks additional time. Copa has been no better. You call their customer service line and they give you email addresses to contact for refund help but they never respond. Their website has a refund tool but you never receive any confirmation as to whether you've actually achieved anything in the way of requesting your refund. No follow-up email. No auto-generated courtesy email.. Nothing! I paid through Expedia so I asked Chase (my bank) to chargeback Expedia but they did a chargeback on Copa Airlines instead. That effort resulted in more frustration as the chargeback was denied. I have tried everything to get help from an ethical, decent, professional at Expedia and at Copa and received nothing but misinformation, lies, and have nothing to show for all my effort after 8 months.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. This is an update of the review I posted yesterday. I missed two consecutive days of flights because of Copa Airline's lack of communication, systems malfunction, and also the incompetency of the Copa Airline's rude staff at LAX airport. I now found out that my return flight for this trip that didn't happen has been mysteriously changed to a day earlier. I didn't make a request to change the return date because I never make it to the destination. I'm waiting until later today to get to Copa's counter at SFO to talk to someone there and make my request, so I do not understand how this happened. I will update.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. I missed two consecutive days of flights because of miss information. Copa airline has the worst customer service I ever encountered, they do not have a working phone number to call then and no way to get an answer by email. However, I did also noticed that there are some agents willing to help but they are very busy and the only way you can talk to someone is by getting to the airport while they are processing check-ins and wait a few hours until they are done, if they have time and someone is willing to help you could get help. On 12/8 I went to take my fly from SFO (with a layover in Costa Rica) with the info I could gather on my own and my negative C19 test but it’s was impossible, so they booked a flight for us to Costa Rica for the next day through LAX, and even though I was on time to board Copa an hour before departing they made it impossible for us to take the flight because of malfunctioning of their systems and miscommunication, so last night while I got stuck in LAX from 8 pm to 7 am 12/8-12/9 and after waiting until 3 am to talk to someone, I asked for credit and cancel and credit the return flights and this person  told me that I didn’t need to cancel the flights ether the return flight just not to show and I would get a credit, but I didn’t believe her and I realized I was wasting my time talking to her so I’ll have to go to SFO airport and talk to someone else there. Reading the reviews and experiencing all this plus the unfair treatment that I saw at the LAX airport not only to me it totally makes me regret having to book with them and even wanting to travel. I'm looking forward to talking to someone tomorrow when I go to SFO and see what can be done. I'll do my best to update.

### "The requirements are just impossible to get a refund"
Not Verified |  Their return policy is the worst I ever seen. Seems impossible to get a refund. I tried to cancel 5 hrs after I booked and waited 40 minutes on the phone to get a rep. He told me I had to submit a refund request on there website. The requirements are just impossible to get a refund. They don’t deserve business just out of principle because they are unethical.

### "Worst airline ever"
Been stuck in Nicaragua for 7 months waiting for a refund or a flight back home. Copa is not answering the phone anymore and when I try to access website to get infos on what's going on with my money I get this message : "We are sorry, but the server is unavailable. Please try again.". Filed a complaint to BBB, hope I get my 640$ back, but I'm not holding my breath. Worst airline ever.

### "This is an awful airline"
Not Verified |  Flew from Montego Bay to Trinidad via Panama City. The flight was over 4 hours late, which made me miss the connecting flight to Port of Spain. We were misinformed which kiosk to go to, which then they insisted I needed a visa to leave the airport which I didn't. By the time I clarified this it was 11 o'clock. Some issues emerged from immigration, which made me stuck in the airport for an entire day. Flight had no halal options. I was given a measly USD150 voucher for future flights. Due to Covid, I asked for a extension of the voucher which they declined. This is an awful airline. I will never fly with them again.

### "no refund would be given by Copa"
Nassau to Houston via Panama City. The wedding / trip was canceled due to covid and no refund would be given by Copa or through the insurance I also purchased. Horrible! Out 300.00. Purchasing through Priceline. A third party also made things a challenge still with no refund.

### "doesn't give any refund"
Not Verified |  True to Covid we are unable to travel and Copa Airlines doesn't give any refund. Never ever more. We travelled since many years with them but its the last time!

### "worst of the worst airlines"
Fortaleza to San Juan via Panama City. This is definitely the worst of the worst airlines ever. I came to check in at Fortaleza airport in Brazil like 3 hours earlier. The manager wouldn't let me checked in because apparently there was a problem with my ESTA to enter America. Then he took 4 hours to check that everything was ok, to then said everything is fine now. By that time my flight had already left and he would't give me a new flight or give me a refund although it was all his fault for taking so long to check on something. I ended up losing $1400, how horrible. I would definitely never book a flight with this airline and i wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with them. They have the worst policies and don't they even care about there customers.

### "Very poor info"
Booked a flight for June 5th Medellin to Kelowna with Cheapoair. April 26 the flight has changed or cancelled with info as to which. Very poor info with no explanation. Tried to call reservations which is not working. Can't change the flight info online. It would appear that Copa has withdrawn the flight but is not providing credits. Cheapoair is Cheap o service.

### "stranded in Ecuador by them"
Guayaquil to New York via Panama City. Extremely disappointed with service from Copa. We were stranded in Ecuador by them. By 14th of March Ecuadorian government had imposed restrictions entering the country starting on 16th of March. These restrictions did not affect departing flights. on 16th of March we purchased tickest from Guayaquil to JFK via Panama City on the 18th of March so only 2 days later. By that time Copa had to be aware of the restrictions already. On 17th our flight was canceled by Copa and the customer rep on the phone insisted that there's nothing they can do as the government forbid them to fly. Which is simply not true. I made an request for refund on their website and they denied it stating that they can only offer me chance to change the ticket until end of 2021. Which is a very crappy deal as I have no intention flying with them again. I feel they scammed me out of the money as they had to already know they will cancel the flight when I purchased the tickets. This is not okay in any way. Luckily Interjet didn't cancel their flights and we could fly to New York via Cancun instead (off-course cost quite a lot).

### "cancelled via Expedia"
I did not get to fly with Copa Airlines because due to COVID19 my flight was cancelled via Expedia. I try to call in for a refund from Expedia the robot said unless your flight is 72 hrs before your date they can't get me to a customer representative. So I thought I'll try Copa, but they said since it's 3rd party they can't help me.

### "we could not board the plane"
Not Verified |  We had a flight from Panama city to Buenos Aires, Argentina on March 21st at 6pm. Among the passengers, we have two people with cardiac issues that were surprised by the pandemic away from their house. Upon arrival to the airport, they told us that we bought a "ticket" but not a "seat" so we could not board the plane. Then, the airline lied to us saying that the airport in Buenos Aires closed! The consulate had to intervene! You have absolutely no respect for people, who already have a ticket! Never flying with you again!

### "menu selection is poor,"
San Francisco to Panama City. Old plane. The seats are very wide, the reclining angle is average. It was not convenient to escape, and the flight was almost 8 hours! The menu selection is poor, average food quality

### "good employee and helpful"
Not Verified |  Curacao to Panama. The check in department from Copa airlines at Curaçao, the manager is a good employee and helpful. I had a problem with my ticket (KLM). She helped me with a ticket I had bought from KLM and I had Curacao to Panama and Panama to Amsterdam, the customer service of KLM didnt give me the ticket and no changes passed to Copa. I could not check in and it was a Sunday all closed. When Maggy (manager) at checkin counter from Copa Airlines helped me a new ticket that I could follow mn trip. I want to thank  for her help again!

### "Never flying with Copa again!"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Panama City. Book this airline all the time for my international trips and as a regular customer, I am highly disappointed that they were not able to accommodate my request. I booked a flight for $720 two weeks ago and because of this Corona Virus outbreak, price drops to $590 and Copa aren’t willing to refund the pricing difference due to an event that is out of my control. Never flying with Copa again!

### "Do not use this airline"
Miami to Panama. I had a reservation for my girlfriend and me for February 15th 2020. We had to cancel due to family problems. No refund but I was told that I could use our tickets before December 2020. When I tried to reschedule flight I was charged close to $700 dollars for the two tickets for the penalty. This is simply daylight highway robbery. Do not use this airline.

### "bad customer service"
I purchased a RT ticket from Panama City (PTY) to Santiago, Chile with a return back to PTY and then proceed to Medellin, Colombia; total ticket value was $789.60. I cancelled the trip and kept the value of ticket. I wanted to use the $789.60 value of the ticket to book a flight from PTY to Pereira, Colombia (PEI-Matecana Intl.) one way which has a cost of $191.00. The airline was going to charge me the following fees to reusing the ticket: 1. $150 penalty 2. $ 75 agency fee Total $225.00 I was asked to pay an extra $45.74 on top of the $789.60 original ticket to purchase a $191.00 one way ticket and use to use the value of the ticket to pay for the $225 feed; which would amount to $416.00 ($191 + $225). COPA would keep the $373.76 remaining balance and sell me a new ticket for an additional $45.74. Therefore, the new one way ticket to PEI would have cost me $835.34. This airline is about taking your money; horrible food, old airplanes, uncomfortable seats, and bad customer service.

### "Food is much better"
Cali to Mexico City via Panama. I used to fly with Avianca, with which I had elite status and a chance of an almost certain upgrade. However, I switched to Copa because of four reasons. Firstly, Avianca became very unreliable; the flights are usually delayed. Second, the immigration in Bogota El Dorado airport - usually, a transit airport for me flying out of Cali - takes ages. Third, the El Dorado Bogota airport often presents heavy delays because of the weather and excessive air traffic (it is a high altitude airport located in the mountains). Fourth, the food became horrible on Avianca. In the case of Copa, none of the above is relevant. All of my flights were on time or arrived earlier. Less than an hour transit in Panama is more than enough: no need to pass through security/immigration check again. I never heard that Panama airport was closed because of the weather. Food is much better in Copa then on Avianca. Seats: you can even choose preferred seats like the emergency exit of first rOw free of charge. The only improvement, which may be necessary: WiFi (none as for now). I would definitely continue using Copa instead of Avianca whenever is possible.

### "the worst experience"
Montevideo to New York via Panama City. Copa Airlines was the worst experience, I arrived at the airport an hour before my flight and they told me that my flight was about to leave and that I would have to change my flight, after we asked them please that our flight was in one hour. they attended reluctantly and wanting to charge us $ 200 dollars for our luggage because they were only over 5 pounds, the truth is a horror and customer service in Montevideo are the worst do not have any experience to lead with customers, apart from The person who attended us was upset because we did not want to pay the $ 200 dollars of overweight and only paid $ 40 which is what they charge for extra luggage, we changed the seat without letting us know and placed us in the emergency doors donate the seats They are not declining, very disappointed I do not recommend it and I will never travel with you again.. Copa Airline, fue la peor experiencia, llegue al aeropuerto una hora antes de mi vuelo y me dijeron que mi vuelo ya estaba por partir y que tendria que cambiar mi vuelo, despues de que les pedimos por favor que nuestro vuela era en una hora nos atendieron de mala gana y queriendonos cobrar $200 dolares por nuestro equipaje porque solo estaban pasadas de peso 5 libras, la verdad un horror y el servicio al cliente en Montevideo Uruguay son los peores no tienen ninguna clase de experiencia para lidear con los clientes, aparte como a la pesona que nos atendio se molesto porque no quicimos pagar los $200 dolares de sobre peso y solo pagamos $40 que es lo que cobran por un extra equipaje, nos cambio el asiento sin dejarnos saber y nos coloco en las puertas de emergencia done los asientos no son declinables,muy desepcionada no la recomiendo y nunca mas viajare con ustedes otra vez.

### "really average airline"
Not Verified | Sao Paulo to Panama City. This airline is a really average airline. The 3 other flights I had on this airline were actually ok. But this flight was terrible. São Paulo to Panama City in a Boeing 737! The flight was delayed, the food was awful, the seats were uncomfortable, even though there were some bright sides. The IFE was ok, the staff was always nice and kind, but there was no wi-fi, which was a blow.

### "Save yourself the problems"
San Francisco to Quito via Panama. After flying with Copa a few times I experienced something that is the reason for me to never fly with them again. Four of us boarded in SFO with the weighed, sized and approved carry-on items but when transferring in PTY to Quito, we were refused boarding. Because our carry-ons were either fragile or expensive items, gate-check was not an option. Sorry, Christmas gifts for airport workers in Panama City is not something I'm ready to do. We were allowed to board SFO to PTY and a later flight from PTY to UIO but in the meanwhile, we were refused boarding and had to wait almost 5 more hours to get to Quito. At one point a manager told us that if we didn't like the carry-on rules on the Copa website, we should contact them about changing them. Seriously? Never again. For all the goofy stuff that goes on with air travel, this is the first time that our contract was changed on the whim of a gate agent. Save yourself the problems and stick with American flagged airlines to Latin America.

### "stuck at airport for 11.5 hours"
Toronto to Caracas via Panama with Copa Airlines. I have been stuck at the airport for 11.5 hours. Been lied to repeatedly. At their mercy, they haven't handed out blankets or water. I thought that this was a good airline, boy was I wrong.

### "customer service is not helpful"
New Orleans to Panama City. Worst airline ever. They never have anyone available to help you with issues with your flight. The customer service line/center is also not helpful. They are seriously the worst ever and I will never book a other flight with this airline again.

### "I’ll never fly Copa again"
Belo Horizonte to Denver via Panamá. Terrible experience! During the recovering process of surgery, I had to travel from Brazil To United States for my father in law’s funeral. I thought I could trust Copa Airlines to do the basic task of safely transport my son and I, with our luggage. I was wrong. Not enough having rude flight attendants on both legs, when I landed in Denver, I was informed that 2 of my 3 checked luggage, were delayed and probably lost! Nobody has a clue about where they are. In addition to my physical and emotional pain, now I have to deal with the lack of consideration from Copa Airlines. I thought airlines were in this world to transport people from point A to B, but Copa is proving to be nothing else but a big headache, disappointment and a waste of money and time. I should be going to support my family at this sad moment, but thanks to this airline, I’ll be shopping for clothes so I can have something to dress during the memorial and funeral. I called the airlines a couple of times and each call took me one-hour waiting; just to say that they don’t even know where my baggage is! I’ll never fly Copa Airlines again.

### "It was the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Miami to Rio de Janeiro  via Panama. It was the worst experience. My first experience was in August and my route was MIA - PYT - GIG. But, unfortunately, instead of going to Rio de Janeiro I ended up at an airport in a small town called Cabo Frio for lack of fuel on the airplane. I stayed there for more than one hour inside of the plane. After they had filled the tank, we were able to return to Rio de Janeiro's airport and finally land. The second time wasn’t different, actually it was worse! It was 3 days ago, I did the same route MIA - PYT - GIG. My flight was scheduled to 10pm and land at Panama at 3pm and then RJ at 12am but my flight from Miami to Panama had a delay of 5 hours and I lost my connection to Rio de Janeiro. I waited 1hr ish just for one Copa Airline’s employee arrived, then I waited at least 3h more because was only one employee to assist the whole travelers from that flight. Finally, after some hours they assisted and told me that the next flight to my final destination was just 2 days after because all others flights was full, I complained because I had to work, and they told me that was nothing they could to about it. After, they sent me to a Hotel with a transportation, and they told that in 2 days the same transportation is going to pick me up at 11am and bring me back to the airport. That was nothing I could do, just wait two days. So, before I leave I asked for my luggage, of course, and the Copa Airline’s employee told me that was gone to Rio de Janeiro. Two days after, I was in the hotel lobby at 10:45am waiting for the scheduled transportation, after 1h and nothing, I started ask on the from desk of the hotel and nobody had anything information about it, so I called the Copa Airlines Central and they didn’t have any information about it as well. And on this call, I asked for my luggage again, and they told me the same thing, that was gone to Rio de Janeiro. So I insisted to get more information about the transportation because it was impossible nobody had any information about anything, but it was no good. In this situation I lost 2h more, at this time I just needed go home and I was afraid to lost my flight, so I called a taxi and it took me at least 1h to the airport. When I got there I did my check in and asked one more time about my luggage, and they told me that arrived in Rio de Janeiro 2 days ago. I finally arrived in Rio de Janeiro and went to get my luggage that everyone told that it was arrived, but of course it wasn’t! When I arrived in Rio de Janeiro a Copa Airlines employee told that my luggage wasn’t there and probably (he wasn’t sure) my luggage still in Panama. They asked me to fill out a form with all my information, including my address, so they can send me by mail. I have no idea how many days more it is going to take, but this is unbelievable and very unprofessional, the employee are not prepared for any situation, nobody knows anything.

### "Very bad services"
New York to Havana via Panama. Very bad services from this airline, no customer services in the airport or over the phones waste of time and money. I will not recommend this Airline at all. We purchase a ticket and confirmation was sent. We go to the airport and we are not in the Copa airlines system. I will never try to use this company again.

### "certainly fly them again"
Guatemala City to Panama City in business. Only drawback was ground services in Guatemala, it took 35 mins for a queue of 5 though staff not unfriendly - only reason for not giving a 10. Boarding was fine and on time. On-board was fantastic, FA called us by name and took our meal order before take-off. Business class has 10 seats in a 2-1 configuration on the plane, so wider and more recline then economy, so felt spacious from the start. For the 2 hour flight had our own FA attending to us and my salmon dish was really tasty, served with warm bread. A decent choice of drinks for a short flight. Never flown Copa before - I was impressed and would certainly fly them again.

### "Excellent airline"
Not Verified | San Jose to Guatemala City. Excellent airline. The flight was from Juan Santamaria Intl. to La Aurora Intl. operated by Copa Airlines Colombia, a flight of 1 hour and 25 minutes. The plane was so cold, also. Meal was a sandwich and a drink, I ordered a Coca-Cola.

### "Not baby friendly"
Not Verified |  Rio de Janeiro to Panama City. Not baby friendly at all. They have a priority lane that goes slower than the regular lane, because everyone goes there, no employee to check who goes where in the lanes, I have never seen that with any other airline. So we ended up waiting on line with a crying baby. We asked someone why it was taking so long, they said they would take us next but didn't! On the plane, an employee got mad because I was walking in the aisle to calm my baby. Worst airline company for babies! The food is not very good and we had a 6 hour flight with no entertainment.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  Washington to Santiago via Panama. Worst flight experience i have  had on both my flight to and from santiago. Never have i experienced such filthy planes and horrible service. The employees on the ground are incredibly rude and unhelpful, one even told me the wrong gate during my connection despite me asking 3 times to make sure and i almost missed my connection. Paid to reserve a seat and received a confirmation email stating my seat was reserved, when arrived at the airport was informed they were overbooked and i was downgraded to a middle seat that was broken and couldn't even recline. Was told that they would do nothing to help the situation.

### "no idea how to handle visa matter"
Bogota to Vancouver via Denver. They lost our baggage during our stopover maybe San Francisco or Panama and we didn't get our luggage until three days. Plus when we got to the check-in counter at Bogota airport, we had to wait for almost one hour just because all the staff at the counter had no idea how to handle our visa matter. They didn't seem to issue flight tickets flying to Canada from Colombia via USA. A young female staff who couldn't even speak English kept us waiting making an excuses like our computer system wasn't working. But we had our Esta for the US, Eta & three-year working visas in Canada. And besides, Carrying our passport, we can travel to 198 countries in the world without any problems. Even if we don't have our visa in Canada, we can still stay there for three months legally. We felt frustrated waiting at Copa airlines check-in counter. Because it wasn't that we had to wait so long standing there but because all the three staff at the counter had no professional knowledge at the airport.

### "the service was outstanding and friendly"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Lima to Havana. I was pleasantly surprised after reading all the negative ratings and comments about Copa. I enjoyed this airline far more than for example Air Canada, which gives you neither food nor alcoholic drinks and was late for all my flights. Copa was spot on time, my vegetarian meal was great, the seas were wide and the was enough leg room, and the service was outstanding and friendly. I will use this airline again. Thanks, to the flight attendants.

### "the worst customer services"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew from Vancouver to Rio de Janeiro to visit relatives and a much needed vacation. On our flight back to Vancouver we experienced the worst customer services to date. The aircraft for our flight from Panama City to Denver came to the gate with a slight delay (no problem, that happens), we boarded and in a few minutes the crew informed that the aircraft had a mechanical issue that would take 30-60minutes to be fixed. Then, 10 minutes later we were informed that the doors would be opened so we could leave the plane and board the plane again once the issue was fixed. However that was said only in Spanish, which I understand, but a good part of the passengers didn’t. One of the flight attendants walked by and I verified if the information was correct, she confirmed and I told the passengers around me that we were supposed to leave the aircraft. We left and were told to be back in an hour to board the plane. When we got back the boarding gate had changed in the departures screen, but the gate where we boarded first affirmed that nothing had changed. Since it seemed confusing, I went to the customer service to make sure what we were supposed to do. The customer service confirmed the gate change, but all the passengers were still at the former gate going through security and getting ready to board the plane (which would no longer be taking off). Then we proceeded to the customer service help desk to look for a solution. After almost TWO hours of waiting (I was the 3rd person on the line) for answers or a position from the airline, which remained in total silence for most of that time, some of the customer service members for the airline were literally laughing at the passengers looking for assistance, of which was a lady with a two month old baby. Total disrespect. The customer centre was basically empty, only one young lady trying her best, but completely unable to assist, since she didn’t know what to do. The supervisor literally took of saying he would print boarding passes and didn’t show up for 45 minutes. After multiple attempts asking at the gate for more team members to come to customer centre to assist the passengers, two Copa agents showed up to assist. I was the 3rd on the line and it took almost 2 hours to get to the counter and be assisted... after a long wait Copa printed a few vouchers, which were not enough for all the passengers (they ended up printing more). A route that was supposed to take 23 hours, ended up taking 39hours. Then after all our check bags were missing. I called the company and I was told to send an email, which will take 7 to 15 days to be answered, and again, the lady over the phone, made little of the situation and said that eventually it will be taken care of. I wonder how this airline can be so disrespectful to customers... The level of disrespect at their customer centre at the airport in Panama City was just disgusting. It came to a point that the lady with a two month old baby said they should stop laughing because nobody was joking around. Simply sad and disgusting!

### "customer service is the worst"
Not Verified |  The mint, but the customer service when it comes to helping the passenger is the worst that my family and I have experienced! To make use of the voucher that Copa provides passengers with compensation for their bad service, to use that voucher is even worse! 5 failed attempts to use it. The staff they have cannot read or pay attention to the passenger! I do not recommend them. Before receiving or doing something with copa airlines, inform yourself well. La mentable, pero el servicio al cliente cuando se trata de ayudar al pasajero es el peor que mi familia y yo hemos experimentado! Para hacer uso de los voucher que Copa le proporciona a los pasajeros con indemnizacion a su mal servicio, para usar ese voucher es aún peor! 5 intentos fallidos para usarlo. El personal que tienen no saben leer ni dar atención al pasajero! No los recomiendo. Antes de recibir o hacer algo con copa airlines, infórmese bien

### "I really recommend it"
Not Verified |  Asunción to Boston via Panama City. Very good airline, I really recommend it. Crew is friendly, and food is kind of good. The IFE is really poor though. The seat is much better than what I thought because of the price. It’s the fastest way to travel from the South America to North America/ Caribbean

### "customer service is the worst"
Copa Airlines customer service is the worst. I bought 5 tickets for my family members and I chose Bank Transfer. The same day I went to my Bank and made the transfer. All of this was done On July 12th, today July 25th, after 15 calls and spoken to even the same representative twice, Copa airlines says that even though I provided proof of the transfer they still don't have the money but the money left my account 13 days ago. I asked them who is the bank involved on these types of transfer and they told me different countries but none is the one they sent me on the instructions on the confirmation email. All they do is give me the run around and nobody knows what is happening. On 5 of those 15 calls I was placed on hold and cut-off after 2 minutes, making me have to call again and explain everything all over again to a new representative. This Airline has no respect for people's hard worked money. First on the confirmation email I was never told to email them with the receipt of the transfer. Second, after that was done and they sent me an auto-reply saying in less than 24 hours we are gonna contact you, nobody did. Third, now that same department is telling the representative to tell me about the money not being on their account. What is this? Couldn't they have emailed me and told me that instead of keep me waiting? Bottom line, I do think that they got the money but they are trying to rip me off.

### "We are very disappointed"
San Francisco to Aruba via Panama City. Worst and horrible customer service ever from the check in counter desk representatives in San Francisco Airport who work for Copa Air! We arrived airport 5 minute late before their 1 hour departure window and missed the flights. It’s not the fact that we missed the flight that upset me but what happened afterward- the fact that they were absolutely unwilling to assist/advise what the next course of action would be for their customer that drove me to write this review. Because they were unwilling to do anything, we ended up calling COPA customer service rep who said the only person who can change the flight was at the airport counter. After a few minutes of unpleasant conversation with the airport reps at the COPA counter, the counter representative finally said she needed to talk to a manager. The manager would not come to assist us neither. We didn’t want to wait there forever so we ended up booking a new flight with United instead to be able to take a later flight. It’s an example of poor customer service and staff training of COPA Air! We are very disappointed with COPA Airlines.

### "Awful customer experience"
Panama City to Quito. Horrible business class seats, barely reclining. No feet rest. No plugs for electronic devices. Food is despicable. Friendly staff doing their best. Customer center at Panama Tocumen overwhelmed. One agent and 40 people waiting for service. Other desks at different locations have broken down monitors. Requested an earlier flight change, with downgrade from business class to Economy if no seats were available. Was told that the downgrade would cost me over US$ 500.00 for a 80 minutes flight. Awful customer experience and no respect for premium passengers. If you can, stay away from this mediocre airline.

### "got tickets American Airlines"
Los Angeles to Medellin via Panama City. As a first time visitor to the United States, we had traveled all the way from Malaysia, after almost 16 to 20 hours flight, we were preparing for our next flight. It was at LAX when we were told we couldn't board the flight to Colombia because we did not have a visa. No one had told us or updated us that a Visa was now required as when we bought the flight tickets in March, it wasnt required. Somewhere in April the regulation changed and we weren't informed on this matter in any way whatsoever. In LAX, Copa Airlines only had the check in counter and the small hidden office which can be easily missed by the oversized baggage section. Note that you won't get to talk to anyone besides the manager, who's too busy helping everyone check in even though there's 5 to 6 reps at any given time. So we arrived at LAX at 6pm on 28 May 2019, and was lining up to check in for the 11pm flight to Colombia. When we reached our turn, all they could say was that we didn't have our visa and please step aside, the manager will attend to us in a bit. Knowing that we had to wait, we tried to work out the visa issue via online application. All this while, the manager was busy with checking in passengers. And after a few hours of not being able to do much, I went to approach the manager, and all they had to say was please don't step behind the counter area where only their staffs were allowed, and the manager will be with us shortly. And still waiting, not having had any dinner yet, and no place to stay for the night since we had not booked anything while still waiting for this manager, by then it was already 11:30pm. And we still had to wait for the last few people who missed their flight. By the time we managed to speak to the manager, she said to us, "what was your problem again? All this time all I wanted to know was (1) can our flights be refunded, (2) if not, can we postpone the flights? That was it. And as simple as our questions were, she gave an even simpler answer, "oh in that case, please call the customer service number, we can't do anything here". Then we're like in our minds, you couldn't tell us this on the spot when we were waiting for the past 6 hours? The next day we managed to get the visa thing sorted out thankfully by pulling some strings with our Colombian friends on 29 May, we called the customer service number, and asked them to reschedule our flight as we managed to get the visa done. The price to reschedule? Guess what, its the same price as getting a new airline ticket. For 2 person, we had to pay USD1,800. Wow. We returned to Copa Airline counter on 30 May night. This is the best part, when we arrived at the counter, there was a white American and a hispanic lady. The American missed his 2nd flight because his 1st flight was delayed like 6 hours. Thats why he was there, and the manager offered him a complimentary place to stay, and a flight back first thing in the morning with any of the Star Alliance partners. However he kept insisting on getting on an immediate flight back regardless of the service provider, and this manager eventually let up and walked him all the way to American Airlines. Anyways this was like at 12 30am. We are extremely tired already. Eventually the lady manager was seen walking back, but she never came our way but continued walking away elsewhere alone. Eventually I got fed up and just got tickets American Airlines for USD 2500 for 2 person.

### "Last time on Copa"
❎ Not Verified | Rio de Janeiro to Boston via Panama. Poor communication-terrible troubleshooting! This airline is horrible. They don’t provide enough information to be useful to their passengers. Booked a business class trip to Brazil via Panama with an agent. Four flights later arrive in Rio 24hrs later even though there were shorter flights. On the return, knowing I have a 15hr layover in Panama, I book a nice hotel and decide to make the best of my night layover in Panama. Only to find out during check-in that I’m required to have a yellow fever certificate since I travelled to Brazil. No one informed me at the time of booking 3 months ago!! (It would have been easy to get a vaccine and certificate from my doctor). So I couldn’t leave the airport and my bag had to be checked straight to Boston. Last time on Copa. I’m done!

### "I saw many improvements"
Cali to Buenos Aires via Panama City. This was my first travel with Copa after a few years. I saw many improvements: newer planes, comfortable seats, smiling flight attendants, good catering and inflight entertainment on longer flights. All fights were on time. I think Copa will become my new choice for flights within the Americas, since my traditional hub, Avianca’s Bogota El Dorado airport, became very unreliable: frequent delays because of weather or air traffic mean that, in order to catch my connecting flight, I have to schedule at least 3 to 4 hours layover in Bogota. However, via Panama, 1 hour is enough. With Copa, the only issue to comment is Panama Tocumen airport, which needs an urgent improvement. Otherwise, Copa is capable to deliver an excellent product.

### "Never told us anything"
Not Verified |  First and last time I fly Copa Airlines. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours prior to boarding time and we had to run to our gate. I don't know what takes this company so long to check people in. Copa check in was the only check in area that had a completely full line because they spend like 10 minutes per passenger checking them in. We thought it may be only LAX that had this issue but nope, same thing happened on the way back. Another issue, we had a layover in Panama City. We bought our original ticket for 12:26pm, which would be a 1.5 hr layover. We get our tickets from Costa Rica, get on the plane to Panama only to find out that they moved it to a 4pm departure. Never told us anything. It was then that we made sense of a comment the check in agent told us. When she was taking her time getting us checked in, she said "oh, you changed your reservation", my boyfriend and I looked at each other and said "no we didn't". Then she looked at us and didn't even explain her comment, she proceeded with what she was doing. I do take blame that we didn't ask what she meant but if your guests don't know about a change, the reasonable thing to do was explain that it did change by 4 hours. Once we discovered the change, we talked to an agent in Panama and he said they had "told us" that they delayed the flight 2 months ago. My boyfriend nor I ever received such communication. We told the agent this and he claimed that the airline emailed and called every passenger to notify them of the change.

### "Worst experience to date"
Not Verified |  Quito to Panama via Orlando. Worst experience to date. I have been flying on Copa Airlines for the last 5 years or so, traveling at least once a year. The food used to be good quality, like real food, cooked to perfection, and they offered pretty much every drink you could want. Now I see the steady decline on these last two or three recent trips. The last flight's meal was incredibly salty, the  vegetables were cold, and  potatoes tasted bad. I'm not super picky, but it was a new low that I never thought I'd see on what was my favorite go-to airlines. So no meal on the morning flight, inedible meal on the afternoon flight, and one drink of water in the afternoon because they didn't make coffee. I expect this with some other airlines, so cheap you have to suffer through your trip, but now with Copa doing the same thing, I feel it's time to shop around with different airlines, and plan ahead somehow with meals and drinks that I can bring on the plane.

### "customer service is the worst"
Los Angeles to Sao Paulo via Panama City. The aircraft is rather dated, but the flight crew does their best. The problems are divided between quality and service Quality. The food is fair at best, There is no WiFi. Some planes have no power supply or private video. Seat are just ok. Service - the flight crew are great, but customer service is the worst when you call into Copa. Expect them to do little of nothing for you. They is a never ending series of hoops you need to jump thru to get any help .. and even then they shift it to you. With the exception of RyanAir the is no other airline that offers less accomodative Customer Service.

### "not big on customer service"
Not Verified |  Two days before my flight was scheduled to leave from Orlando to Panama City then to Costa Rica on May 14, 2019, my 17-year old daughter went to ER and was admitted to the hospital for emergency surgery the same day. I communicated with Expedia (purchased tickets through them). Expedia had me to send info from hospital detailing the events. Expedia has gone back and forth with Copa for two weeks with no end in mind to issue my refund for the flight. Finally, Expedia asked me to get involved with Copa directly. I have sent emails to Copa because no one will talk to you over the phone dealing with refunds. Every time I call, I am receiving the run-around and no one seems to know what I am speaking of. This is ridiculous. I have never experienced this issue with other airlines. I had an issue with American and within days my refund was in my account. Copa is not big on customer service. They are big on giving you a hassle. Several Expedia reps I've spoken with stated the same.

### "still trying to get a refund"
Not Verified |  Panama City to Toronto. The flight itself was fine. The plane was completely full, however the crew did a good job of getting out the snacks and drinks early on and then it was uneventful. My complaint is with customer service, and the seat upgrade program, that they seem to push really hard at trying to sell upgrades to business class. Since this flight was over 5 hours, I thought I would bid for 2 business seats. I was informed the day of the flight that my bid was unsuccessful, however they had debited my card for the bid. Long story short, 2 months later I am still trying to get a refund for the failed upgrade. This should be an auto refund, why should I have to repeatedly try to retrieve these funds? Very poor in this department. I feel like they are trying to steal my money.

### "practice of overbooking"
Panama to San Francisco. Somebody wrote about practice of overbooking. We were told that they can’t assign seats on this flight (booked months ago) due to overload. For a 7 hour flight like Panama City- San Francisco B737 800 is not capable to get enough fuel for this flight if most passengers take allowed luggage.

### "This flight surprised me"
Panama City to Mexico. This flight surprised me. Great crew onboard both flights. Good food. On time departures and arrivals. Copa should pick up its game and offer new services as wifi.

### "no record of veggie meal"
Santiago to Toronto via Panama City. 1) When I checked in at SCL, I was told that the business lounge Copa used was at gate 12. After going through immigration and security formalities, I went to gate 12 but found no lounge. I tried to use the airport map touchscreen nearby but it was out of service. I finally went to another lounge and they also told me that it was at gate 12. I walked around the terminal for 45 minutes and then back to gate 12. I noticed then that there were stairs to the basement, though there were no signs anywhere indicating what was down there. The Star Alliance Lounge was there. I walked in and I was one of only 5 people, which indicates to me that others also had trouble finding the lounge. The receptionist told me that they were going to move soon so they had taken down all the signs a long time ago. It would have been proper for Copa to have informed me at check-in of this issue. 2) Boarding flight 118 was also a problem. After the boarding pass check at the gate, there was a huge crowd of passengers that was not moving at all. It took a long time for this to clear and me being in business class made no difference. 3) On board, I checked the entertainment system and its offerings were very poor - worse than in any economy section even that I have flown in the last five years. 4) The seat was uncomfortable. 5) It took almost an hour after take-off for us to be offered any kind of food/snack. We were simply given bottles of water before take-off. Later in the flight, about an hour after the small lunch was served, I asked a flight attendant for a snack. She challenged me on this and said something would be offered in another hour. I have never encountered this attitude on any other airline ever. She finally gave me something but was clearly not happy about it. 6) At the Copa Air lounge in Panama City, there was little food and no vegetarian meals were offered at all - no sandwiches, no salads - nothing other than fruit and oatmeal cookies. Again, I have never experienced this issue in any other airline lounge in the world. 7) Shortly after I boarded flight 470 to Toronto, we were given menus and then asked for our choice for supper. I mentioned that I had ordered a vegetarian meal (I had in fact been given one on the flight from Santiago) and the flight attendant said he had no record of it. I said that I had booked the ticket about two and a half months ago and received veggie meals on every other flight. He said he would go "confirm. He came back and said no vegetarian meal was available. I asked what I would be fed instead and he said he didn't know. I asked him again - are you saying you're not going to feed me for 5.5 hours? He didn't answer. I told him that this was unacceptable. Then a second flight attendant came and told me the same thing, and asked if maybe I had ordered a veggie meal for 118 and but not for 470. I asked her, "why would anyone do that? A special meal request is made for the whole flight, not for a single leg. Then a third flight attendant came to me and told me the same things. She finally said they would be able to give me soup and salad if I liked. I said that it wasn't a meal and she said there was nothing she could do. 8) I should note that between the time the first flight attendant told me I would receive no meal and the time we actually left the gate was over 20 minutes. Another Copa employee could have been sent to get me something from one of the airport restaurants. However, no one offered to.

### "best airline I have flown"
Panama City to Boston. This has to be the best airline I have flown. From the crew to the food to the comfort, it was all 5 Star.

### "shameful practice of overbooking"
Panama to Managua. Arrived for the 3rd time in 2 months to check in at Copa at Panama airport to discover they had overbooked and bumped me off the flight. I had to wait 7 hours for the next flight. This was with a full price ticket. I fed up with Copa service (terrible), counter staff (rude and unhelpful) and their shameful practice of overbooking every flight to Managua recently.

### "Unbelievably horrible experience"
Buenos Aires to San Francisco via Panama City. Garbage customer service. I am a gold Star Alliance member. Copa doesn't deserve to be in Star Alliance. The first leg of our return trip was delayed due to Copa's fault and we missed our connecting flight. Copa customer service didn't help in any way and offered no compensation. How Copa handled this situation was not professional or correct due to following multiple reasons: In Buenos Aires, Copa representatives assured us that despite the delayed flight, we could still catch our connecting flight in Panama and Copa reps would greet us as soon as we land in Panama in order to direct us to the connecting flight. No such thing happened. We saw no help from Copa in Panama to help us catch our flight. So the representatives in Buenos Aires wrongly informed us. We were again misinformed by Copa representatives this time in Panama while rebooking our missed flight. We were told there was no flight to San Francisco the next day (Monday) so we must wait and leave two days later (Tuesday). But as we learnt 10 minutes after receiving this information, another passenger traveling to San Francisco was rebooked on a flight on Monday because Copa accepted to fly her to Los Angeles first and got a United Airlines ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco. This passenger wasn't in business class. She told us she could get the flight the next day because she argued more and could speak Spanish. So we were lied and put in a disadvantaged position just because we didn't argue and politely accepted what Copa offered us. At the end we could get to San Francisco after a 40 hour delay. We both missed 2 days of work. Now I can't reach customer service via email or phone. The customer service email given to us is a black hole. My emails are only returned with an auto response. Phone customer service said they can't offer any help. Unbelievably horrible experience with Copa.

### "Very disappointed"
Washington to Panama City. Departed out of IAD - At Counter - Could not Check-in bags directly to my destination DAV, In-flight the airplane is dated and need upgrades to be consider Business class. The attendant did no mentioned where to plug electronics and there were no entertainment at all on the plane. I follow the United Airlines instructions to login with no luck. Copa should not assume that travelers know all these things especially on this old type of airplanes. Arrived to PTY - Picked my baggage and pay for a luggage cart to go through customs after that I could not take the cart to go upstairs to drop off my bags to the COPA domestic counter I have to actually find a gentleman that carried my bags by hand . No signs, no directions, no one from COPA to ask what was next. Waited in line for about one hour, very hot and crowded counter with only one staff assisting in the web checked in counter. I had to asked twice to the staff at the counter where to go next, he seem not very knowledgeable. Return Flight from DAV - I was charged for my baggage and they could not send my bags directly to IAD. I was very frustrated because I did not want to go through what I experienced on my arrival to Panama.The lady at the counter said because my tickets were not purchased together, but I explained that I purchased the tickets at the same day and time. I found with today's electronic age that this simple change could not be made possible, I asked the staff to please call the manager. The "not too friendly manager" seems bother by my request and said that I have purchased my tickets separately and this was the policy and since I was flying domestic I needed to pay for my luggage, At this time I told the manager okay even though I think that the entire situation was absurd I will pay but please check my baggage directly to IAD - The manager literally looked at me, say nothing and then she tell the staff to check my baggage through and say nothing to me and walked away as if she was doing me a non desire service, it was very humiliating to beg for an hour. I was the last one entering the plane. Departure from PTY to IAD - the complete COPA terminal gates 1 through  was extremely hot - about 90+ degrees no place to purchase water or cool off and all the belts for fast walking were not working. Even though I did stay in the COPA lounge I walked to the gate one+ hour earlier, but still very uncomfortable unhealthy environment at the gates. Again on this leg the aircraft was dated and no entertainment. The young man that attended was extremely polite and very nice, he really made the difference on my frustration of the whole trip. I purchased upgrades for the complete flight and felt as if I was flying economy (For an international Flight) The business class did not feel as such. I used to fly on COPA all the time until three years ago. I started using Delta or United planes and then go to DAV on AirPanama. After three years I decided to come back to COPA to be even more disappointed. I am not a complainer and I think this is my first review to an Airline ever, yes Copa seems convenient with the direct flight to PTY and DAV but living in the DC area, I have many choices on airlines, quality service and amenities. Very disappointed that I traveled with COPA.

### "Friendly staff"
Panama City to Salvador. Excellent on time performance. Friendly staff. Over-aged seats, with limited recline. No foot rests. No plugs either, a 6 hours flight might be too much for your laptop. IFE about nonexistent. Food might as well come from a local hospital. Tasteless.

### "on the tarmac for 1.5 hours"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Panama City. Writing this review after sitting on the tarmac for 1.5 hours. Pay the premium price for an airline that can afford timeliness and WiFi infrastructure. I know I will next time. I have them a 5 for actually having planes. They met the basic requirements for a 5. Remove these airline from the Star Alliance, it’s giving you a bad name.

### "unpleasant experience"
Panama City to New York. After having gone thru 2 security screeners we where herded like cattle into a small waiting area where their where not enough seats for everyone and air conditioning was not working. Very hot and unpleasant experience. I will think twice before flying Copa again.

### "very pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Curacao to Panama. A very pleasant experience. We had a smooth flight going from Curacao to Panama. The flight was on time, more comfortable legroom than some airlines, the cabin temperature was fine and the plane did not smell funky. The flight attendants were pleasant and the restrooms were clean. We had a ham & cheese sandwich which was hot and very nice- the best short flight snack ever! The only downside was we couldn't access the website to check in and get seats assigned from our hotel which was not a big deal. When their ticket counter at the airport opened, check-in was quick and efficient. We would definitely fly COPA again.

### "practices systematic overbooking"
David to Panama city via San José. Copa airlines practices systematic overbooking. We were many passengers to be denied boarding, while we all had our boarding passes in hand and the baggage was already registered. This occurred during two connecting flights. The company took care of the accommodation costs; On the other hand, they refused any financial compensation, whereas we had to pay the night for the hotel reserved for the final destination, where we arrived one day late. The only compensation proposed by Copa airlines is a voucher that can not be transferred and valid only with their company. Miserable! Copa airlines is the shame of Star Alliance and deserves no star. FR: Copa airlines pratique le surbooking systématique. Nous étions de nombreux passagers à être refusés à l'embarquement, alors que nous avions tous nos cartes d'embarquement en main et que les bagages étaient déjà enregistrés. Ceci s'est produit lors de deux vols en correspondance. La compagnie a pris en charge les frais d'hébergement ; elle a par contre refusé tout dédommagement financier, alors que nous avons dû payer la nuit pour l'hôtel réservé à la destination finale, où nous sommes arrivés avec un jour de retard. La seule compensation proposée par copa airlines est un bon (voucher) intransmissible et valable uniquement auprès de leur compagnie... Misérable ! Copa airlines est la honte de Star Alliance et ne mérite aucune étoile.

### "they lost my checked bag"
Quito to San Francisco via Panama City. To start the holiday, they informed my boyfriend and I that they overbooked the flight. Great no worries, we still managed to make it to our destination. To improve their case, they lost my checked bag upon my arrival home. I have been calling the SFO baggage claim every day for twelve days trying to track my bag. I spoke with the supervisor two days after returning home and I confirmed three items in my bag. I made a second phone call to confirm which address they needed to forward my bag to. The new representative had no record of finding my bag. You can’t do this to customers that have spend hundreds of dollars on airfare through your company. I have been calling relentlessly without a single return phone call.

### "wasting time looking for bag"
Bogota to Orlando via Panama City. Inefficient, I checked my bag, which should have had priority labeled and it did not arrive in Orlando. I had to wait in Customs for more than 20 minutes for COPA Airlines personnel, there were supposed to be 3 agents taking care of 2 flights, but they appeared 20 minutes later, after wasting my time looking for my bag, then I had to go to another place in the airport where there was supposed to be a baggage agent to do report, to my surprise agent was not in her place and I had to go out looking for her. In addition of been inconvenience with luggage that did not arrive I had to wait for COPA staff to come to their places.

### "couldn’t care less about you"
I took a flight from Managua to Panama  with Copa Airlines (CM) on 21/02/18 returning on 23/02/18. On the return i arrived at the airport nearly 3 hours before scheduled take off, but had to queue for 2 hours to get to the check in desk. At the desk the Copa operative told me i couldn't fly to Managua because i didn't have a yellow fever inoculation card. I wasn't warned about this when i booked the ticket on the website, and i wasn't warned about this when i checked in at Managua 2 days earlier. The first time that Copa decides to tell me i need a yellow fever inoculation card is when my flight is due to take off in 1 hour's time. The operative told me that it's my responsibility to ensure that i have the necessary documentation to travel. Later the same day i had a flight scheduled from Managua at 1.30pm to Houston USA and then a connecting flight to London UK. After much arguing i was issued a boarding pass as I “could be” in transit at Managua. In September the same year I had to make another journey to Panama, Tuesday 04/09/18 to Thursday 06/09/18. Aware that I needed a yellow fever inoculation card, I asked the CM check in staff at Managua Airport if this was still necessary for us to return to Managua in two days time. They said yes although for my wife, who is currently breast feeding, she is exempt from this. In Panama I paid 100 USD for a yellow fever inoculation. The following day I return to Panama airport to catch my plane to Managua and I’m told I can’t have a boarding pass because my yellow fever card isn’t 10 days old yet!! Again, no mention of this when I checked in at Managua Airport even when I specifically asked about the need for a yellow fever card. My wife and daughter flew to Managua without me and I spent a further 2 days in Panama before acquiring a letter from a doctor about my allergy to eggs thus making me exempt from the yellow fever card requirement. After returning to Managua I wrote a letter of complaint to CM demanding compensation as I believe CM are plainly negligent in this case. The reasonable person would say that the information that CMs employees used to deny me a boarding pass at Panama should have been provided to me by their employees at Managua two days earlier to prevent me from my financial loss. Especially given that I asked their employees at Managua if I would need a yellow fever inoculation card to return two days later. CM eventually acknowledged they are at fault. My claim was for 2 additional nights in a hotel and a partial loss of earnings on one day making a total of 394 USD. I believe my claim was entirely reasonable given the circumstances. However, CMs offer of compensation was for a travel certificate valid for 12 months worth 204USD. Given that I don’t intend to fly with CM any time soon this offer of compensation is virtually worthless. If you are considering flying with Copa Airlines then please read clause 9.1.2.1.1 and 9.1.2.1.2 from the contract of carriage, because it basically says that even if their employees misinform you about your travel requirements it’s your own responsibility anyway. In a recent email to me from Copa Airlines it starts:- “Thank you for choosing Copa Airlines Your opinion is very important to us and helps us provide you with world class services.” I think more appropriate and honest would be:- “Thank you for choosing Copa Airlines Your opinion is of no importance to us and we really couldn’t care less about you.

### "service was very good"
Not Verified |  Montevideo to La Habana via Panama. The service was very good, the crew was very kind and the plane was clean. the food service could be improved but is not bad. In general all the flights that I flew with Copa Airlines was good.

### "treat people like they are dumb"
Washington to Cali via Bogota. I was looking for a ticket so my son who is 14 years old. Copa classify the adults category as 12 years or more, so minors older than 12 years can fly by themselves. My son is 14 years old, so their system allowed me to purchase a ticket for him. The flight from Raleigh to DC (one of the connexions) was Copa operated by United airlines, but Copa Airlines in any step of the transaction mentioned any restrictions and they actually just allowed me to buy the ticket knowing it was for a 14 year old boy. After 3 days I received a call from United saying that my son was not going to be allowed to fly by himself if he was not 15 years old or older according to their policies, and that they didn't understand why Copa Airlines allowed me to get this ticket knowing his age and their policies. so they suggested I called Copa Airlines, ask them to cancel the United flight and give me another option for Caleb to go to DC for the connection to Colombia. So I called Copa airlines asking for help on this matter, and I spoke with 3 different representatives plus what they call a "supervisor" and heir response was: "you should have read the "migratory requirements" that says that minors of more than 12 years old can flight ONLY in flights operated by Copa, so to cancel the flight with United that you purchased trough our website, you are not only NOT going to receive the refund but you are actually going to have to PAY 360 dollars for the penalties that will be caused by the changes you want to make"" I was like wow! not only I'm going to have to drive my son to VA, not get a refund for a ticket he is not going to use because Copa Airlines wasn't clear or said anything about this restrictions, but I'm going to have to pay them for the changes? wow! this is serious!! so I read the migratory requirements, because how dare I didn't read the little letters right? Nothing. there was nothing on those requirements that even mention anything about a minor. Then they told me.. oh, what you didn't read were the "terms and conditions". So I went and read the Terms and conditions, every single little letter in there and... nothing. So they replied: Oh no! is not the terms and conditions is the "Transportation contract" what you didn't read, so I went to find the little link, and saw a 60 pages contract, and on 1 of the clauses, on page 15, they mention this weird clause that if any of you read you will not even understand that what they are saying is that minors older than 12 years old can only flight in airplanes operated by Copa. Seriously? Copa Airlines? you guys are telling me that because I didn't read a 60 pages contract, and a clause that nobody can even understand I'm going to have to pay penalties for a ticket I bought from you guys? when YOUR system allowed me to buy this ticket, when you don't even mention in any step that if the flight wasn't operated by Copa, minors cannot fly without an adult? What really worries me, is how they treat people, and how it seems like they just train people to act like robots that are only repeating a script over and over again instead of really helping the person. They treat people like they are dumb, like "How could you not read a 60 pages contract" right? and they give you the same answer over and over again, and there's no way you can talk with a manager or someone who can actually look at the case and be flexible and care about their clients not a stupid protocol.

### "unaccompanied minor policies"
c✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Panama City. We made 3 different phone calls and spoke to 3 different staff members to get clarification on their unaccompanied minor policies and the staff seemed very unfamiliar and we got the impression their main concern was to force us to change our $300 tickets for new $2000 tickets. They gave us a hard time regarding the departure flight and when that didn't work they gave us a hard time regarding the return flight. The two points of contention come from their own website: https://www.copaair.com/en/web/us/minors-travelling-alone "The payment of the unaccompanied minor service can be made 48 hours before the departure of the flight through our Sales Offices and Reservation Center. According to COPA, the above means we must call 48 hours before and submit the request for unaccompanied minor. We called 24 hrs in advance. The issue here is that the kids are flying in a direct flight. They do not have a companion service. We are dropping them off at the gate and they are being picked up at the gate in their destination, calling 24 hours in advance to provide names, phone numbers, etc. has always been sufficient in the past but now they said we missed our window, we were supposed to call 48 hrs in advance and we need to change our ticket. We called again and the two other staff members did not interpret the rule like that, and said 24 hrs was fine. For connecting flights, unaccompanied minor service is not offered if the minor's itinerary includes a flight that is the last flight of the day at the connection point, unless the flight is the only flight of the day. According to COPA if you are flying direct from Panama to Dulles, this rule applies. We pointed out that this is not a connecting flight, it is a direct flight and the rule should not apply. One of the staff members we spoke to agreed with us, the other 2 said the website was wrong. The point here is that if there is no connecting flight, there is no concern of missing a flight and the kids being stranded in a connecting city. For staff members not to know the difference between a connecting and a direct flight is appalling.

### "delayed almost 7 hours"
Not Verified |  Panama City to Los Angeles. I checked in using the mobile boarding pass. When I arrived at Tocumen they told me that their mobile system doesn't work very well and that they will print me the paper boarding pass. I was told the flight was delayed almost 7 hours but not given any reason. I spent the next 7 hours waiting in the airport which has only one filthy restaurant with terrible food on the outside of security. After being unable to eat and told once I go through security I cannot come out I went through security to find an in a massively overcrowded terminal with no air conditioning and people covered with sweat sitting all over floors waiting 7 hours with nowhere to set with no air conditioning was awful. There were long lines even for the filthy toilets. There was never an explanation or apology from Copa staff. The captain never said a word or even addressed the issue about why the plane was 7 hours late. Many passengers were connecting from other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to the United States and they were very frustrated having to wait an extra 7 hours for their connection to the US.

### "not a bad flight"
Guayaquil to Panama City. Overall not a bad flight however for a nearly 2 hour international flight, one would expect a meal instead of a small chicken and cheese pastry. Also they apparently had only one bottle of wine aboard for an entire almost full economy section! I realise that Latin America is not a wine culture but one bottle? On the plus side we took off and arrived on time which is a rarity these days.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Cancun to Sao Paulo via Panama City. I was pleasantly surprised. CUN-PTY is a short flight and lucky too. The plane was old, with no IFE, no power sockets, and little service. However the plane was punctual and the FAs attentive. I was really not looking forward to the 7 hour PTY - GRU leg on a 737. However this was a much newer plane, with a recently refurbished cabin. Again the FAs were attentive, the IFE was fine and the seats were comfortable reclining to around 150°. Not your flat bed but comfortable enough. The food was reasonable and the flight arrived early.

### "They have not been supportive"
Toronto to Cuzco via Panama / Lima. Copa airlines rebooked our tickets when their partner airline we were flying with was late (we were in the check in line more than an hour before our boarding time with our 2 hour layover - our priority marked luggage also came later than anyone else on our flight). They made us wait in an airport for 24 hours without any vouchers or support and did not tell us they were giving us standby tickets the next day. So we did not have a guaranteed way to get home though we were not informed of this and ended up spending a ton of money for the 24 hours stuck in an airport which could have gone toward us rebooking our flights with another airline. When we got to the next layover, we had standby tickets again (even though we booked this flight months in advance & had assigned seats), and one of us was not allowed on the plane and had to fly with a different airline. During this flight they did not give me a meal as I had booked a vegetarian meal months ahead of time and they didn't pass the information forward when they rebooked our tickets (even though I requested it again at the check in). The entire time they put us through this the COPA representatives did not clearly communicate what was happening and they treated us like it was our fault and we were an inconvenience. They also have not been supportive at all in reimbursing us for our costs or our missed services (ie. Food) and have continued to communicate poorly and treat us with disrespect. I will  recommend people against flying with this airline.

### "the FAs were excellent"
San Francisco to Montevideo return via Panama. Seat belt signs were left lit for the entirety of all 4 flights even though the rides were smooth. Announcements over the speakers are often unintelligible in English (they’re fine in Spanish, and Flight Attendants can communicate in English in a face-to-face conversation). I was unable to use the web check-in for the return flight at MVD (a Chat agent told me this happens at random), so I had to endure a slow check-in process at the counter; 40 minutes is a long time to wait when you are 15th in line and there are 6 agents behind the counter but only 2 of them are processing passengers. It gets cold in flight, and on some flights you get blankets, on others you get pillows, on others you get both, and sometimes you get neither (so: be prepared and bring your own). The aisle seats (C and D) have much smaller foot space than the other seats. For the PTY - SFO flight, there is a security check at the gate, and you cannot bring your bottled water on board (I like to sip water during the ascent and descent). Now, the good parts. The price was very competitive for a same-day flight I had to get for a family emergency. Check-in and boarding were very smooth at SFO and PTY. The Boeing 737-800 planes were modern, clean, with large overhead bins, and seat-back screens with a decent amount of movies and games. All flights departed and landed on time, and my suitcases arrived at the destination in good shape. The FAs were excellent, always readily available (the few times a call button was pushed, I observed that an FA responded within 1 minute --no kidding!). Seat comfort and meal size were OK for economy (meals were better quality than Avianca’s, which I also flew recently). For my return flights, I decided to pay the extra $50 per segment, to move to an emergency exit row, and it was worth it for each ~7-hour flight. Note, though, that there are 2 over-wing exit rows, and the forward one (row 17 on my plane) has seats that don’t recline, while the rear one (row 18) DOES recline and thus you get the benefit of great leg room and you can recline normally. I’d like to reiterate: the FA's seemed eager to provide professional service, and they are the most memorable face of the airline, so in recognition of their efforts I would recommend Copa to my family and friends.

### "everything about was fine"
Lima to New York JFK via Panama City. Almost everything about was fine. Check in went smoothly and both legs of my flight departed on time. The hot meals were ok and the inflight entertainment offered a reasonable selection.But there was a very serious and very design flaw on both the aircraft: the magazine rack on the back of the seat in front of you consists of fabric stretched over a metal frame. On one side the frame stuck right out- into my knee.The only way to avoid it is to spread one leg into your neighbour's space.

### "This a terrible airline"
Panama to Guatemala. This a terrible airline. On the way in to Panama the flight was over 1 hour late because one engine was “not working”, which then got miraculously fixed in 5 minutes making it impossible to enjoy the flight when thinking what could have been wrong. On the way back flight was delayed for more than 3 hours because the crew was not there. A 9pm flight became a midnight flight making a very late return to home. The people at the counter were also rude and lied about the reasons for delaying the flight at the beginning. Avoid Copa if you need to be on time or catch a connecting flight. They also sold more tickets and were then giving money away for those who would accept to fly the next day.

### "I was forced to delay my return"
My flight to Santiago was mediocre but uneventful apart from almost missing my connection in Panama because the flight was delayed. I was forced to delay my return to the US and went to the ticket office to change the flight date. I was told that I had to pay a $300 penalty, and lose the premium seats I had already paid for, another $160. When I tried to reserve my seats on-line, I was notified that I had also lost all customer services. I contacted the airline and basically was told that it was their airline, their rules, and I could pound sand. What type of airline punishes passengers in this way? I have flown all my life, all over the world in numerous airlines and have never encountered anything like this. Needless to say, I will never fly on or recommend this airline to anyone, unless he is willing to be ripped off.

### "my bag came out damaged"
Panama City to Miami and my bag came out damaged. I knew I had to claim the damage immediately upon arrival. In the arrival hall in Miami, there was no counter for Copa Airlines, and some staff told me Copa only had a desk in the departure hall. It was around 22.30 and the departure hall was almost empty. I didn't find any office, and some staff told me there was none. I went to the hotel,and got on a 8 day cruise the next morning. To travel back home again, I had to buy another suitcase. The next week back home again, I found on Copa website that I could claim the damage online. No reply came, and the only way I could find to get in contact with them, was via Twitter. They don't hand out numbers or mail addresses. In order to finally get the response from them, 2 months later, I had to provide them with another email. They then said that I should have made the claim either at the airport or claimed it online within 7 days after. If you enter www.copaair.com, then find Customer service, then Customer care, and then Baggage where you can click on "claim here", the form to fill out opens and there is no information about that it should be done within a certain time limit. I believe that Copa Airlines has a sneaky way of not taking responsibility for their failures.

### "toilet cleanliness is appalling"
Panama City to Los Angeles. I have flown Copa Airlines almost since it started decades ago. Now the flight attendants' English is quite acceptable, which was an area of complaint years ago. The plane had normal comfortable seats for a 6-7 hour flight. Previously this flight always had pillows and blankets for each seat. Not so now. I gave my blanket to a fellow who had requested one and always was told: "I will check",  which never happened. Cabin crew not overly attentive but not indifferent. The food has declined in quality, though the choice of spirits is better. My complaint is the toilet cleanliness that is appalling.

### "well-run, efficient airline"
Washington Dulles to Cartagena via Panama City. Surprisingly (to me) well-run, efficient airline. Ground and air staff very nice, very courteous. Four legs of trip, only one inconsequential delay. Of course, easier to have positive attitude when you're sitting in #2D (business class) rather than #31F (back of coach). Food decent, although ran out of our desired entree on two flights because we were seated in row 3 instead of rows 1 or 2. Apparently management had supplied exact number of meals and guessed wrong on passenger demand. Also, at least two of the four flights were older aircraft without some of the entertainment features touted in Copa's literature. And, on two of four flights, seats didn't recline. Baggage handled properly, came quickly on conveyor. Absolutely would fly with them again, esp if they were to upgrade the awful Copa lounge at their hub airport in Panama City.

### "They lost my luggage"
Panama City to Guatemala City. They lost my luggage and acted like it was my fault. Horrible customer service. IVery rarely do airlines lose luggage but when they do they never expect the customer to de-escalate the situation. They don’t even offer money back for the things I’ll have to buy for my trip now, which is standard. Hopefully the insurance I bought through my booking agency will cover it. Save yourself the headache and go through a reputable airline, or don’t check bags at all.

### "is more than expected"
Panama City to Mexico City. It was a great surprise fliying with Copa. Easy web check in at Copa website. At the airport fast lane dedicated to passengers who have already made check in. Friendly staff in ground and air. Nice breakfast for a medium haul flight, Easy connections and all flights on time. Copa Airlines is more than expected.

### "avoid at all cost"
Newark to Guayaquil via Panama City. Horrible airline, avoid at all cost. Managed to lose luggage during a 3 hour layover in Panama City, their primary hub. Both flights were arriving / departing on time so no excuse for misplacing the luggage. Called the customer center of Copa Airlines, was told “it’s not our fault that your luggage was lost. Here we are on 10 day vacation in rural area of Equador with literally not even a change of underwear or a toothbrush. Never again will I fly this airline.

### "Yet another miserable flight"
Yet another miserable flight with Copa from Mendoza to Panama. An almost 7h trip on a so called business class which does not even deserve the name on a plane that doesn’t even offer a screen for a movie (feels like the 80s). This time not even an amenity kit was available so it makes you wonder where the business class fare went to. The only thing complete is the price they charge! Even for economy this service would be in the lower tier.

### "fine, if nothing spectacular"
My flights to and from Guatemala City from Chicago O'Hare via Panama City, Panama, were fine, all in all, if nothing spectacular. The fare was cheap. Several decent meals were served, along with complimentary beverages (soft and adult). The old Continental planes they use are solid and fairly comfortable, except for there being only one pair of lavatories at the very back for the entire economy section. A steady stream of people went back and forth to visit them--no matter whether the "Fasten Seat Belt" signs were illuminated or not. They were on for the entire flight back from PTY to ORD, for example, and the flight attendants never stopped anyone from wandering around the cabin. In fact, a lot of the passengers exhibited a general lack of flying savvy. The flight from PTY to GUA was delayed for over an hour and a half, as one of the flight attendants swore she heard pounding (golpes) coming from the luggage hold. We never saw any stowaways and were only told that a "suspicious suitcase" had been found and removed. Very strange. I'm not a nervous flier, so it all struck me as kind of amusing.

### "worst in the continent
Panama to Buenos Aires. The business class offer is the worst in the continent. The cabin is not really adequate for an overnight flight if you expect to land and get to work. The seats do not allow a good sleep as the almost do not recline. The offer on amenities is poor and the company saves on every corner. Don’t expect wine or champagne at the start of the flight, don’t even look for earplugs inside your amenity bag, you’ll have to bring your own. They forgot it’s an overnight flight and seem to not understand the need of the customer to have a silent night while the alley is full with trolleys. Everything is cheap but the ticket price! The service is miserable, and comfort offered is not up to the level expected for a business product and for the price they charge. The food offer is poor, the quality of the wines also, the service in general simply sucks! The attitude is the typical found in all Copa flights,we don’t care, if you don’t like it don’t fly. Sad enough I knew it but had to take it as it was the only option for this tight itinerary. Last time I flew, which should’ve been the last, they still had earplugs! So God help me and make this one really the last one.

### "didn't show any attitude to help"
San Jose to Panama. The nghtmare started in the check in process, where there were 4 employees in 4 counters and they were all "busy" with 2 customers. They didn't show any attitude to help and they clearly weren't in a rush to help the other customers. Regarding the boarding process, the passengers were all boarded at once without any order. On the plane, the food was awful. When arrived, my suitcase arrived broken. I claimed and they mentioned that it was nothing. I insisted and finally I got the incidence file from them. I claimed to the customer service and basically they said that it wasn't their fault and that they weren't going to pay anything.

### "nightmare ordering the tickets"
Montevideo to Panama City. I had a complete nightmare ordering the tickets, spending several hours on the phone with unhelpful staff. I think at the end, I ended up having something like 8 calls to the customer support because Copa mishandled the payment several times, and at some point it looked like they were about to take the payment twice, then both requests disappeared from my bank statement and eventually they took the money the day before the flight. The whole process was extremely frustrating. I would never expect to spend several hours on the phone simply to pay for a ticket. When it then came to flying, I was not only improperly informed by the employee at the check-in desk who told me that I would miss the flight if I wasn't there an hour prior to the boarding time that was indicated on my electronic ticket. As I couldn't make sense of why I needed to be at the gate something that resembled 1½ hour in advance. Additionally, when I got on the flight I noticed I was moved to a middle seat instead of the window seat I had checked into online. Given that I checked in a long time in advance, I really find this is horrible service. When I contacted the support about it, I got delays in responses that surpassed the 15 day answering policy they have. Eventually I was offered a $200 gift card that I then need to physically send in to redeem when, or even if, I care to fly with Copa again. This took more than a month to arrive. I had bad experiences before, during and after the flight, and everything was handled so poorly. The whole correspondence took several months.

### "for me a good option"
Panama to San Josè. Caotic boarding in Panama due to not clear explanation by the people at the gate. Boeing 737-800 clean, with a very good legroom and Sky interior. Smooth flight and, despite one hour of flight time, cabin crew served free drinks and a cold meal. Departure and arrival on time, nothing to complain. SJO-PTY. Very fast check in San Josè with very kind and nice personnel. Departure with 30 min. delay due to traffic in SJO airport. Embraer 190 clean, medium legrom and same service of the previous flight. It was the first time I flew Copa, for me a good option for destinations in that area. Well done Copa.

### "my worst travel experience"
Panama City to Caracas. Little did I know that it was going to become my worst travel experience. I flew home for Christmas and Copa Airlines lost my luggage, they have me calling them non-stop for any update, they have blamed other airlines instead of taking the responsibility and they have even given me the instruction to do their job and get in touch with the other airlines involved in the issue. No essential expenses refund have been offered, even after I've requested them several times. In the event that you need any service from them, you will be left hanging.

### "Copa is a total rip-off"
Managua to Panama City. For what you pay, Copa is a total rip-off. The flight was on time and I had no problems with getting my baggage, but the experience of flying with them is akin to flying with a budget airline. The cabin interior is worn and tired. The staff are bored and not interested and the food is abominable. It is obvious that Copa is cutting corners wherever they can and they don't care because they know their customers have no choice. Their flights are extremely expensive for the region and they can get away with it because they have a monopoly on a number of routes. Examples are Panama-Managua and Panama-Lima. It is ridiculous that Copa is the only airline that flies between Panama and Lima, Peru but they can do this because the airport claims there is not enough space for other airlines to compete. Copa has stalled the expansion of the airport so that other airlines cannot compete on these routes, but hopefully this will no longer be the case from 2018. I cannot wait to be able to fly with other airlines and ditch this overpriced, sub-standard airline.

### "Terrible customer service"
Flew Copa Airlines from New Orleans to Quito via Panamá. Terrible customer service. Staff were unwilling to assist or even offer a stand by option when I missed my flight due to there not being any attendants at the counter. They just can't accept any responsibility and were going to charge me a full ticket price plus a penalty fee. As a frequent flier, I have simply never come across this sort of customer service. Copa is just a sad excuse of an airline.

### "they are irresponsible"
Panama to San Juan. I will lose a business meeting tomorrow because of this cheap airline. First, they said that they called me a week ago and when I said "when I did my check in in the previous report, why they did not tell me about flight changes? and obtained no responses. why don't you send me an email? No responses. Then, they said that my flight was cancelled because of the weather and I said "you did not cancel a flight from a week ago because of weather". Responsible airlines resolve their mess by buying you tickets with other airlines. This one even pay me the hotel. But this was even worse: I paid an insurance that Copa offered in their website, which is based in Panama City. That insurance also did not want to pay because of technicalities saying that "we covered you if the flight was delayed for more than 12 hours, not cancelled". When I asked "Does Copa ever delay any flight for more than 12 hours? , they replied: "No". Obviously, this is a way to cheat customers because no flight is delayed for more than 12 hours. Business people: don't fly with this airline, they are irresponsible and will make you pay for everything and be absent of your relatives and next meetings. A good airline is the one that resolve problems like this, not the one that thinks: "if things go well, we are good. If there is a problem, we don't care".

### "simply don't care"
I had 4 flights with this company: from Sao Paulo to Panama: airplane was late for 2 hours due to maintenance, made me lose the connection flight, Panama to Costa Rica no information on the boarding area, this was also late for 1 hour, plus we had to wait in air for +2 hours without too much information from the pilot about the weather condition in the airport. Crew simply don't care about your experience. Costa Rica to Panama. Initially informed to be a 20 minute delay, then 2 hours, then the flight was cancelled due to maintenance, I lost my connection from Panama to Brazil. Panama to Sao Paulo. Again late for 1 hour, no information on the boarding area. Food service was a joke (breakfast was a bag of chips). No upgrade if you ask for it. Before boarding, I asked for them to be sure my bag was in the flight, I didn't want them to lose it. Arrived in Sao Paulo, they lost my bag. Had to take additional 1 hour to fill a form and have a service request created so they can try (try because they didn't find what happened to it in their system) to find my stuff. Also, I had to book it some weeks before - the price was the same as if I were going to Japan or Australia (almost 2k USD). Two of the airplanes didn't have entertainment, a seat in front of me was broken and the person couldn't move it back.

### "Poor inflight service"
Panama City to Orlando. Poor inflight service, the flight was not full however the food selection I wanted was not available. They did not offer a blanket and pillow but they were in the overhead bin. It seems like there is no service culture, it is the basics to get from point A to B.

### "staff attitude terrible"
Sao Paulo to Panama City. Food terrible, entertainment system outdated and terrible. Service lacking and staff attitude terrible. The seats are not comfortable for a 7 hour flight. Plane was clean, as it should be. Boarding was later than announced, delaying departure and arrival.

### "No announcements, nothing"
Flew from San Jose to Panama City. Here we go again with the Copa Airlines merry go round of misery. In a circus, a clown is a man of merriment, at Copa Airlines HQ, the clown is in charge. Yesterday they delayed my flight by 6.5 hours with no apology or any reason why. Today, I checked the status of my flight before heading to the airport. Everything was fine, so with my flight departing at 5.45, I got to the airport at 3.30 feeling things were fine. Well they were not. Behind the scenes, Copa Airlines were brewing up another delay. It came at about 4.30 saying the departure time had moved forward to 6.30pm. 45 minutes I could live with. Then 6.30pm came and went and, as usual, nothing happened. No announcements, nothing. So I checked online and lo-and-behold, there was a further delay to 8.09pm. I have flown with over 70 different airlines but I will never fly with Copa again and I would advise anyone else to avoid them too. They are shameful.

### "extremely poor customer service"
Managua to San Jose. When things go well, everything is fine and everyone's happy. It's when things go wrong that airlines reveal their true colours. For a five-hour delay in Europe, you are entitled to compensation, meal and drink vouchers and constant updates. Not so in Central America. With Copa you get nothing apart from surly Copa Airlines employees who go out of their way to avoid dealing with queries and complaints. The lack of news or updates was a big problem. No one knew what was going on. But to let thier passengers down by not even offering a meal voucher or a drink is extremely poor customer service. Copa Airlines should be ashamed of themselves.

### "pinching one penny too many"
I frequently fly New York JFK to Medellin via Panama City on Copa and on this last flight much was as usual: Departures right on time, efficient connections, their relatively new C class seat on the JFK to PTY leg (it's like a first generation international business class seat, not ideal but better than what the competition offers into the region), barely edible food, decent wines (both served with a smile) and the overcrowded, undercatered lounge in PTY. What was different was the connecting service on their short haul Embraer: Where once was a comfortable (and industry standard) 2x1 configuration, there is now 2x2 coach seating with a few inches extra legroom (a recent change, the flight attendant said apologetically, and "many passengers complain"). Well, this passenger was really disappointed, inconvenienced (you can't work on coach trays) and quite angry: We are used to penny pinching in coach, but densifying premium cabins is pinching one penny too many. It's also misleading advertising: A C cabin with coach seating is not a C cabin and shouldn't be sold as such. I hope the airline will have a rethink before rolling this out across the fleet. I will still fly Copa on this route because they have the best schedule, but now I will keep my eyes open for an alternative.

### "a big jump in the past"
Lima to Montreal via Panama. I flew Copa Airlines on Boeing 737-800. First at check in I have been told that there is no Lounge access for Business Class Passenger on International flight from Lima. What? Then you seat on Copa Airlines B737-800 and you almost want to cry. Flying with Copa Airlines on Boeing 737-800 is like make a big jump in the past and flying in 90s. No entertainment, no leg rest on the seat. The lounge in Panama city is at the image of the business class cabin, no juice, no food except fruits and one type of wrapped cupcake. I will not use Copa for any business travel to South America, I will connect elsewhere.

### "Really bad experience"
San Jose to New York via Panama. I flew with my 6 months and I bought him a ticket to fly more comfortable and use his car seat, so he was able to sleep. Leaving Costa Rica I didn't have any problems, but on the fly from Panama to New York, 3 different flight attendants asked me why I was putting my baby's car seat on the airplane seat, I told them because I bought a seat for my baby, because we needed to both be comfortable on the flight. They saw me putting the baby on the seat and they make me take him out because they needed to check if the car seat was approved (note: it was our fourth flight and we were coming back home, and just leaving from NYC they check the seat, and of course it was approved). After that another flight attendant asked me again why I was putting the baby on that seat, I told him again because I bought it, I was not going to put a baby on a seat that I didn't buy, well he didn't believe me and ask me to give him the tickets to make sure I was not lying (the flight was full and probably overbooked). After that they stop asking me, but before taking off another woman asked me the same question again and to show her the tickets. We wait an extra hour because of connections. Also the flight attendants were rude, never offer any help to carry bags or car seat even when they saw me struggling with all the things I had with me. Really bad experience, never choosing Copa Airlines again.

### "last experience was horrible"
Guatemala to Panama City. I arrived early to be on time. I sat on the gate indicated and wait for the flight. First, the flight was delayed 30 min. Then, Copa airlines staff announced that the aircraft was not in good conditions and the delayed will be 8 hours. Copa Airlines offered lunch and dinner for the clients affected. However, I asked to leave the ariport because of the long layover. The first answer was that it was not possible because of inmigration issues, but later they let us leave the airport. As Copa Airlines request, I came back at 1 pm to take the flight at 3pm. Now, the worst nightmare began because they announced again that the airplane didn't work and they need to ask for a rescue airplane and maybe the airplane will arrive at 7pm. It is important to mention that Copa didn't announce on webpage or send us an email with the delayed information. Otherwise, we have to be in the counter and insist to the staff for information. The staff didn't provide a clear information and the supervisor was absent. I stayed at the airport waiting for the "rescue airplane". It was 7pm and the airplane haven't arrived. Copa Airlines staff brought some snacks and beverage to calm down the people. Then I decided to take the next day flight because there were many problems. Therefore, I asked for transportation, hotel and next day flight. The soonest available flight was next day at 2pm. I agree with that so I asked for my suitcase but my suitcase was sent to Panama! I stayed one more day and without my belongings. I have flown with Copa Airlines many times before but my last experience was horrible and disappointing. If you can avoid to use this airline, do it. The bad thing is that we don't have many option to choose in Latin america. Hope that the service can improve.

### "prices were far below the US carriers"
Rio de Janeiro to San Francisco via Panama City. Copa Airlines prices were far below the US carriers for getting back from the Olympics in Rio. I'd read horror stories about Copa's economy class; when I spotted a deal on Business Class, I grabbed it! I'm very glad I did! The seats were wide and comfortable, with footrests. Basically, it was the back of First class; seats were identical but possibly the meals were different. (I know we didn't get all the alcohol the people in first class got, though we were offered some.). IFE was great with at least 2 different movies that each member of my family enjoyed as we all have different tastes.

### "assigned seats but not together"
Panama City to San Francisco. Terribly upset with Copa Airlines. Bought our tickets at full price 6 months ago. Arrived at Panama City airport early but the lady at the counter put us on standby. When I asked why, she said we were not on standby and that the standby tag was normal procedure. We could not understand and when we asked again what was happening she would not talk to us. At the gate we were assigned seats but not together. When we arrived our bags were not on the plane. The staff is rude and inconsiderate.

### "entertainment system was broken"
Took the flight from Panama City to Buenos Aires which goes for a bit more than 7 hours. The ticket was booked on business class and it was a night flight arriving a 1:15 in the morning. Compared to the competition the tickets was about 1000US$ more expensive. I hoped this would relect in a better service and a nice product. Copa make this flights in Boeing 737-800 one aisle aircraft where the business class allocates about 16 seats. Those seat might be wider than the economy ones, and maybe only two per side instead of the usual 3, but thats all. They do not recline enough to allow you any sleep, and the added comfort expected at the price of a transatlantic flight lets you down. The entertainment system was broken again. The temperature was extremely low, so we asked for blankets. it turns out they did not have blankets on board, nor did they have pillows. 7 hrs flight, in the middle of the night, no entertainment, no pillows no blankets, no reclining seat, no sleep. Then the menu came with some options to be taken. All of them were rapidly reduced to only one because they did not load more - we asked for the wine, only one because the other was not loaded. The flight attendants were not friendly, not caring - if the entertainment is down, read a book I was told. I will only take this airline again when I am forced by my company.

### "almost always a good choice"
San Jose to Tampa via Panama City. Copa Airlines is almost always a good choice for flying to Central and South America. This flight was no exception. Check-in at the priority lane at SJO was immediate and efficient. Boarding was quick. I had the emergency exit row to myself on the SJO-PTY segment, so that was eminently comfortable. There was a sandwich snack but no alcohol on this short, early-morning flight. There was a more elaborate meal and a full free beverage service on the flight to TPA. The flight attendants were personable, outgoing, and willing to engage in conversation. As I have commented here before, I am particularly impressed with the detailed instructions that are given to all passengers in the exit rows. Both flights departed and arrived ahead of schedule, and the connection at PTY was quick and easy. As an added bonus, the mileage for this Star Alliance partner flight was properly credited to my United Mileage Plus account within two days.

### "seat pitch was excellent"
Flew Copa Airlines from Lima to Panama City. Flight was the first of a multi journey including flights with another company. Boarding was organised in groups. Plane was very clean with individual IFE with very good content for a 3h15min flight. Seat pitch was excellent as well. FAs very helping pax with cabin lugage, all well groomed and smiling. Light and tasteful lunch was served with one drink service. I watched a movie and listened some music and time passed quickly. I have to say I was impressed with service by FAs who carefully pushed trolley through the cabin, made eye contact with pax, smiled and promptly answered call buttons. I was left with the impression of well trained stuff who like their job. If there was inflight wifi it would be perfect 10. Definitely the best short haul flight in years.

### "there is not much to complain"
Lima to Havana via Panama. I flew this airline many times before in economy class but this time I decided to treat myself and upgrade to business. To my disappointment the aircraft I flew was old - there was no entertainment system, the seats were hard as rock. Cabin service was good, food was okay I guess, for the price paid there is not much to complain.

### "a superb airline"
All in all, a superb airline. Flew from Montreal to Havana via Panama. New aircraft, punctual, excellent crew and no drip-feed pricing (all meals and baggage included. United, I am looking at you). Seamless transit at Panama which is a great hub if one is travelling to Latin America or the Caribbean). Vegetarian meals catered for and not bad at all. Overnighted in Panama on way back and bid for an upgrade to business which was excellent value). Exemplary service on 5.5h sector to Montreal. Offered a 15 yr old anejo gran reserva rum after main meal service. Nice. Copa lounge a bit basic but brand new terminal under construction at PTY. Definitely recommend Copa Airlines.

### "a great plane for day flights"
San Francisco to Panama and my first time flying Copa Airlines and I was impressed. We flew on a new 737-800 with the Sky Interior which has bigger windows and a much lighter interior. The service was very friendly and the food quality and presentation quite good. The layout is a very comfortable 2-2 configuration with great pitch given that this is a 737. The seat had a decent recline. The IFE system is ok albeit had only 6 movies to choose from. The touch screen is not very responsive but easy to use. Here comes the problem. This is a great plane for day flights. However, our flight from San Francisco to Panama is a 6:30 hour overnight flight and sleeping on these seats is a bit of a nightmare. Reminds me of the old days, prior to flat beds. Overall very pleased with Copa, but will be looking forward to the return day flight more than this overnight one.

### "crews were great and entirely bilingual"
Los Angeles to Cartagena via Panama City with Copa. Good flights and service all around. The Panama City hub is pretty efficient although it has its shortcomings. It's too small for the traffic it has to handle due to the success of Copa and Panama as a transit point for Inter-Americas traffic. Los Angeles - Tocumen jets were new and the service in the front of the plane was attentive and the food service was adequate for the length of the flights. The seats may not be the latest and greatest lie flat seats but that's OK given the price paid. PTY-CTG jets were less well appointed but for under an hour it doesn't matter. The crews on all 4 legs of this trip were great and entirely bilingual. The only reason I don't give the airline a 10 is the seats in the Clase Ejecutiva are a bit, shall we say, firm.

### "staff kind, seats were fine"
Panama City to Cartagena with Copa Airlines. Flight departed on time and the same can be said of the arrival. I appreciate how even on a quick flight like this passengers were still offered complimentary sandwiches. Staff were kind, and the seats were fine.

### "always friendly and courteous"
Copa Airlines is a great airline which can serve as a model for how US airlines could improve their reputation. 1) Staff and flight attendants always friendly and courteous, 2) Free luggage on all flights, 3) Free drinks in coach - same as offered in first class, and 4) snack and full dinner for six hour flight. COPA and the other major Latin American airlines offer service amenities that US airlines claim they cannot afford. When flying to Latin America, skip the American carriers - they usually codeshare anyway with the Latin American airlines.

### "very unprofessional service"
We bought our tickets 6 months ago to Panama. Yesterday was our return flight from Panama to Medellin and we arrived at the airport at 3.30pm for check in (our flight departure time was 6.52pm). At the check-in counter we were told the flight was oversold and they couldn't assign seats to us because we didn't do "web check-in". We explained we had not had access to the internet and that's why we arrived at the airport early. She called another coworker who told us we had to wait until 6pm when the flight closed to see if there were seats available. They kept us waiting for 3 hours. It was not only our flight to Medellin, the one to JFK was oversold, a couple behind us in the check in line had the same problem. Very unprofessional service and very disappointing experience with Copa Airlines.

### "attendants friendly and helpful"
Comfortable uneventful Copa Airlines flight from Toronto to Panama City. A simple but tasty meal was served as well as drinks all free of charge. As the flights time is approximately 4.5 hours another one or two rounds of drinks would've been nice. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Each seat has an individual IFE. although the selection is rather limited it's still adequate for a mid-haul flight.

### "Inflight service is good"
Bogota to Quito with Copa Airlines. A short flight of a little bit more than one hour. Flight CM661 departures normally from gate 47 which is located at the end of a very long corridor. Boarding was on time and swift. The plane, an Embraer, has a configuration of 2x2 for the whole plane, the pitch between seats is not as tight as in other types of aircraft. Inflight service is good and it includes dinner plus limited selection of liquor and wines. No personal TV screen. Seats come without foot rest. Be aware that even the airline marks luggage for Business or top status Star Alliance members as Priority, it doesn't arrive faster than other passengers bags.

### "business class is pretty basic"
Panama to Bogota with Copa Airlines. A short 1 hour 10 minutes flight. Departures from Tocumen Airport at a very punctual schedule. Ground staff was kind. Staff at call center for Connect Miles program is helpful and knowledgeable. Business class is pretty basic. Seats are comfortable but they don't have foot rest and onboard entertainment system is very poor. Food was good and wine selection ok.

### "check the boarding gate"
Copa Airlines from Quito to Panama City, and the flight is short. Takes one hour and ten minutes. Flight was on time and boarding was quick. Just have to be careful and always check the boarding gate in Panama Airport. Sometimes it changes last minute. As the flight is short, no amentities or in flight entertainment for Business Class. Leg rest not available.

### "unresponsive, uncaring"
Quito to Toronto via Panama City. Tried to contact Copa in Ecuador (as advised by Copa customer service) before I even left Canada to make a reservation to bring home a rescue dog waiting for me in Banos since August. No response from their Copa Cargo Macotas department. Tried 13 different phone numbers once I was in Ecuador and 5 attempts to email. All their phone numbers listed on their website were incorrect. Even their own customer service department could not get a response or access any correct phone numbers. Finally an email quote was $790 US to bring a dog one way. Quote came after I returned to Canada. Took almost a month to get the quote. Ridiculous when compared to AA at $240 - a family at Quito airport flying at same time I was and to Detroit , less than 2 hrs from my city in Ontario Canada. What is Copa doing to get my dog to Canada - nothing. Recent response was a letter saying "sorry for your inconvenience - you'll be happy to know we've corrected our contact information " The Copa staff at their check in counter in Quito airport actually laughed at me when I told them my story. How unprofessional. My entire experience with Copa has shown this airline to be unresponsive, uncaring and with such poor business practices that I'm surprised they remain in business. My recommendation : Do not use Copa - Do not support them with your business. My beautiful rescue dog remains in Ecuador until I can sort something out to get him to Canada.

### "attendants are professional"
Lima to Panama return, and Copa Airlines is the airline to fly in the Americas. Connections via Panama are reliable and short. Flight attendants are professional and show that they are well trained. Unfortunately the ticket prices tend to be high.

### "very good airline"
Copa Airlines from San José to Santiago and Quito to San José via Panama. Good product. Friendly flight attendants. Free food and alcoholic beverages even on the 50 min flight SJO-PTY. A snack and full meal served on 6hrs flight PTY-SCL. On the newer 737-800 personal IFE. Movie, Music selection is limited compared to LAN or Avianca but it's still ok. There are older 737 with only over-head entertainment. I had one on the leg PTY-SJO but did not bother me as it was a 50min flight. There is no IFE in Business Class. Would that mean, on COPA you're better off in Economy? Maybe. Panama is easy for connections. No immigration, no security check. Just walk to your next plane so short lay-overs work. Downfall is that PTY is outdated and totally overcrowded. In some areas you sweat your butt off due to the poor air conditioning and the heat of thousands of pax on a small surface. If you are unlucky with your connection gate, you can walk a mile. On the other side of the tarmac they are building a new terminal which should make everything easier. My flights where on time. Last leg had a 15min delay, but that was due to a thunderstorm in PTY and that was rather good because it rained cats and dogs. Very good airline and on par with Lan and Avianca

### "service was friendly"
Santa Cruz to Panama City with Copa Airlines. It was my first time flying Copa Airlines and I have not been disappointed at all! Out of all the airlines I have been flying, it is the second one where I can get a whisky coca with my meal (others airlines usually don't have it or at a cost). The service was friendly and the pilot communicated very clearly and with many details about the flying conditions.

### "cabin attendants amazing"
I flew Copa Airlines from Toronto to Quito via Panama. The crew at the airport was exceptional, the cabin attendants were amazing and the service was excellent. The flights were right on time, food was reasonable, airplane was comfortable, in-seat PTV screen, many options to choose with lots of movies, games. I would recommend my family and friends, to use Copa Airlanes, I will be delighted to fly with your company again.

### "food quality is terrible"
Flew Buenos Aires - Panama - Dominican Republic with Copa Airlines. This was the first time I have travelled with this airline and I can not recommend it. They used a small aircraft for a long flight (7+ hours) and the seat was clearly narrower than with other airlines. The food quality is terrible. I had to take rice with beef twice. They use just one cart to distribute the food, so they will take 30-40 minutes to reach the last row of seats. Nobody takes care of what happens in the aircraft: an old lady was locked inside the bathroom and I had to let know the staff to help her because they were talking in the back. Also the entertainment (movies, TV shows) was very poor.

### "challenging at best"
Flew Orlando to Lima Peru via Bogata. Flying thru Bogata on Copa Airlines is challenging at best. You must depart the aircraft down a dangerous set of portable steps, in the rain, then are driven some distance in a very uncomfortable and crowded bus. Once at the terminal, you go upstairs and are put through a very rude group of security screeners, then walk the entire length of both an old and new terminal to again go downstairs to a filthy waiting area. Then it's back to the nasty bus again. Also, calling COPA Customer Service is a very frustrating waste of time. The first individual I spoke with, on the English line, I could not understand at all, I had to call back. The second individual, and their supervisor, simply did not care whatsoever about a concern I was addressing. Planes and flight crews were courteous and far above COPAs ground operations or customer service.

### "high price and no service"
Copa Airlines has high prices but low service. Copa is always on time. Even if they are not on time they claim they are on time. So I waited to board the aircraft, but the gate was not open. No information, nothing. If I asked the crew, they said that the gate will open soon and yes, we are on time (maybe in this part of the world one hour late is still on time. Finally around one hour later they opened the gate, but everything seemed to me to be unprofessional. The flight was nothing special and nothing to mention. There is nothing to say if Copa would ask for a fair price. But in my entire life I never paid more for an one hour flight, so I expect a minimum of service. But high price and no service, that's a no go.

### "switch and bait treatment"
Our flight to Costa Rica was uneventful and was impressed with the new air planes. On our return flight we were given the old switch and bait treatment. They told us they were overbooked and would we take the direct flight Costa Rica to LAX but it would leave at a later time and arrive the same time as our original flight at 10:30pm. That sounded great but after our original flight left they now gave us seats on a different airline Avianca and now told we would go to Guatamala first then take a connecting flight to LAX. Our plane now is arriving later than our original flight and at a different terminal- we now have to make our way to the international terminal to get our luggage from Copa!

### "attendants were friendly"
Copa Airlines flight was uneventful, flight attendants were friendly and they gave us lunch and a snack in the 5 hr trip. The entertainment is one TV per a couple of rows and you cannot choose the show of course. The plane in this route is not very full, so you can probably change around your seating, Besides that, it's a little pricey

### "total lack of regard"
Copa Airlines is not interested in developing and fostering good customer relations! They cancelled our return flight from Panama to Boston weeks, possibly months, before we left for our trip - but did not appraise us of this until we were to return home! We were stuck in Panama. There was no flight CM 311 leaving on September 20th, 2015 at 11:44 am back to Boston. All Sunday flights from Boston to Panama were taken off their schedule! Discontinued?! Who knows why Copa Airlines had decided LONG before our departure from BOS to Panama to totally stop this Sunday route. And - without letting us (or any of their customers?) know in advance!! Not by phone call or when we checked in. Online or in person. There was no way of knowing it was taken off the roster! We had purchased our tickets in March for full price and were fully able to check in online without a "message" or notification to let us know that we had no way of returning home on time! They rebooked us 1 day later than our original ticket, on Monday 9/21. After many unsuccessful phone calls, we documented this full scenario via email, which we sent to Copa Airlines customer service. On Oct 10th, we were finally contacted by email by their Customer Service who offered each of us a pittance $200 credit for future use on Copa Airlines. We lost much more than that missing work! She closed her email by writing "We take your comments very seriously ... and should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly". However, she left no direct contact information and did not reply when we hit "reply" to respond to her. Their phone number for Customer service is at the very least, VERY hidden. Total lack of regard for their customers.

### "not customer focused"
Copa Airlines flight from Cartagena to Mexico City with a layover in Panama. Flight was 15 mins late arriving to Panama. They did not allow us to board the plane because they said our checked luggage wouldn't make it on the plane. Needles to mention that on our flight to Cartagena our bags were delayed over a day! They finally informed us that we will be on a flight this evening and will have to sleep over in Mexico City. We informed them, which they were already aware, that we are traveling with a small pet, which we of course had to pay Copa to travel with us. They just informed us that the hotel accommodations they have for us will not allow the dog in the room but will have to be left in the "service (laundry)" room overnight. We informed the rep that this was unacceptable and we needed them to help us find alternate accommodations. I looked on hotels.com and found 24 hotels in Mexico City that are pet friendly. The rep informed me that my only other option was to sleep at the airport. Our flight doesn't leave until tomorrow at 9am. It was very clear to me at that moment that the rep has no intention of making things right and is not customer focused and has no idea the inconvenience that the airline has caused us. When I asked to speak to her supervisor she said that she was the highest rank at the airport and that no one else could help me. I really find this very hard to believe. Now I have no option but to pay for my own hotel in Mexico City even though all this was caused by them.

### "I am very disappointed"
This is my second time traveling with Copa Airlines. I had no complaints until we flew from Quito to Panama on route to Toronto. The take off was horrible, the plane dropped quite a bit on the take off. The pilots made no announcements as to what was wrong and the flight was unstable for 20 minutes. Everyone on the plane screamed when the plane dropped. Not one announcement to tell us anything. I am very disappointed at the airline.

### "has good service"
Copa Airlines has good service compared to some airlines I´ve taken. I got Copa Airlines at Caracas, the ground service was fast, then I arrived at Panama City, I had a very long connection (12 hours), which I didn´t like. Then I got the plane to New York City. The food on both flights were good, I am a vegetarian so I requested special meal, from Caracas to Panama was a light meal however the taste was good; from Panama to New York was a breakfast, and good as well. In the first flight was no Entertainment system, in the second one there was a very limited in flight entertainment, however it was enough to kill time. My luggage arrived on time with me. For the fare I paid I think it was very good choice.

### "totally unacceptable"
I flew with Copa Airlines from San Jose, Costa Rica to Lima, Peru, via Panama on November 27th, supposed to depart at 5:20 PM. Around 4:30 PM we boarded a bus taking us to the airplane. The bus, however, stopped on the tarmac for about 45 minutes. No one came to the bus to tell us why we waited there. Finally, the bus returned to the terminal. We all came in. We were still not told by anyone why we had to return. A few local people came to talk to the agent at the counter, apparently making a strong point about the delay. The gate agent made a phone call, then somehow the passengers got on the bus again. This time we got on the airplane and it took off eventually, delayed about one hour. The reason I am complaining here is that this whole process was not communicated to the non-Spanish speaking passengers at all. There was a number of tourists from Europe and America on this flight, but we were not told anything in English. We did not know why the flight was delayed, for how long. Even when the passengers got on the bus the second time, we were not told to do so. The non-Spanish speaking passengers just followed other passengers like sheep. No direction, no apology, no electronic information board whatsoever. For an international flight, I think this is totally unacceptable. I also has another bad experience on the flight returning from Lima to San Jose, which forced me to pay money to change my ticket. I am currently complaining about that and will see if Copa will respond.

### "coffee  .... we are out"
Los Angeles to Panama Tocumen with Copa Airlines. First off, they are impossible to get on the phone when calling or when your travel agency is trying to contact them, unless you have over 1 hour to wait on hold. However, after holding for almost 1 hour, they answer the phone and hang up on you!! My husband booked me First Class/Business Class so I would be able to get a restful sleep, due to the fact that my flight was overnight. Copa Airlines does not have terminal at LAX so we were all crammed in a bus for a 5 minute drive to the airplane. Never mind that we paid $$$$ to fly First/Business Class, we boarded pretty much last. When seated, the steward asked if we would like drinks and never brought them out! I was not the only one asking "What the heck is going on". In the morning I was asleep and got passed over for breakfast. When I woke, I was not offered anything to eat. When I asked or coffee was told we are out. It's an overnight flight, how can you be out of coffee? I asked for water and at least I got that!

### "terrible customer service"
Copa Airlines has terrible customer service. My wife had surgery and needed wheelchair assistance. The airline refused to provide her wheelchair assistance in Brazil and forced her to carry her own bag despite providing the ticket agent with written doctor's orders explaining the need for assistance. While my wife was in the air, I called Copa Customer Service and they promised they would provide her assistance in Panama City and in Los Angeles. Of course, they did not.

### "save yourself so much headache"
Nassau to Bogota via Panama with Copa Airlines. My mother was going to Bogota via Panama from the Bahamas but they gave her two different reservations, meaning she would have to pick up her bag at panama then do the whole checking process all over again. We spoke to them a million times to see if they could combine both reservations that way she wouldn't have to pick up her bag at Panama and the bag could be transferred automatically to the Bogota flight. After many fail attempts to have this arranged, my mother spoke to a flight attendant that told her they will "finally" help her out on transferring the bag. He took her bag slip and told her not to worry that her bag will reach the final destination. Well, when she arrived at Bogota there was no bag to be found. They never transferred the bag and they have no idea where it is. We called yet once more but they didn't have an answer on where the bag can be. If you are traveling, I would advise you to spend a little more money and do business with a serious airline. You will save yourself so much headache!

### "Copa were brilliant"
Lima to Los Angeles via Panama. This was our second flight with Copa Airlines, the first was in August, a flight from Guatemala to Ecuador. We nearly didn't book with Copa because of the awful reviews but they have either stepped their game up, or people are being fussy. Both flights we had with Copa were brilliant. The were friendly throughout both flights, the flights were either on time or slightly delayed but never stressful. We had a forty minute changeover in Panama for the final flight and that was absolutely fine. Copa is a budge airline but the service is about average, and the food actually pretty decent! We had no problems with luggage being lost or broken into. If you're on a budget and looking for value for money Copa has it all. Everything was cheerful, professional and glitch free.

### "was totally frustrated and upset"
I flew United to Panama City, Panama, and then United offered a direct return flight to my home airport - however, the flight was operated by Copa. I chose this flight not knowing what an awful time I would have. Got to the Panama airport and checked my luggage with no problem. Proceeded through security and went to my gate. That is where everything changed. If you fly an USA-based airline from USA to a Spanish speaking country, the airline always has staff who speak both English and Spanish. Not Copa. No Copa staff at the gate or on the airplane spoke English. I was required to show my passport three separate times from the time I arrived at the gate till I got on the plane. When I got to my seat, there was a strong smell of urine. All announcements were made in Spanish. No English. I was horrified. I had no clue what the pilots or airline attendants were announcing. When they handed out the US customs forms, they gave me one in Spanish. I handed it back indicating I needed an English form. The attendant could not understand. Between having to endure the strong odor of urine on a four hour flight, and not being able to understand any announcements or get any assistance, I was totally frustrated and upset. Arriving home in the USA, I swore never ever to fly Copa again.

### "highly recommend them"
Toronto to Quito via Panama with Copa Airlines. Best flight I've taken in a long time. The staff were all helpful friendly. I enjoyed the fact that everything extra is provided at no charge and the fares were good. Would highly recommend them.

### "upset and disappointed"
I am beyond disgusted, upset, and disappointed with COPA Airlines. In particular, the office in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. My brother, from Brazil, purchased tickets for me and my husband to fly from New Orleans to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The same day, I called Copa Airlines to add my infant son to our reservation. After choosing the option for English and not receiving anyone that spoke the language several times I finally got someone I could somewhat understand. I was told it would cost 10% of the regular ticket and I could pay at the airport. I asked several times if I could pay in advance and was told I could not, I had to pay at the airport. I tried calling back a few weeks later and got the same answer. 24 hours before my flight I checked in online and printed boarding passes for myself and my husband. The morning of 10/19/15, at 5:00am I arrived at the airport with my family for our flight at 7:05am. Because I checked in online we were moved through the "fast line". I asked to pay the fee for my son and was told it was no problem. The lady with COPA Airlines took all 3 of our passports and $142.00 in cash and walked away to the back office. In all we waited at the counter for over 2 hours! Most of that time we were completely alone. All other passengers had boarded the plane and all Copa Airline representatives were behind closed doors without telling us what was going on. When someone finally came out at almost 7:00 she took my husband with her through security leaving me and my 1 year old son behind with a very unpleasant and unhelpful man from Copa Airlines who claimed to be the manager. The only explanation we ever received was that their systems were frozen. About 20 minutes later the man made me run through the airport while holding my son to catch the flight. I never received a boarding pass for my son nor did I ever receive a receipt for the fee I paid. I was then yelled at by security because the "manager" at Copa Airlines was rushing me through the wrong security line while he still had my passport in his hand. Finally we board the plane and are on our way to Brazil. We land in Panama where no one speaks English and the food at the airport cost triple the average price and we wait for 5 hours with a restless 1 year old. When it is time to board the plane to Brazil the Copa Airlines representative tells us we will have to wait so they can check the system for a boarding pass for my son. Of course, there is no way to check it from the desk we are at so again we are left alone by Copa Airlines. The lady with Copa Airlines returns with a smile to say we can not board this plane without a visa. I ask her to explain and she proceeds to laugh and tell me that we do not have a visa so we can not board the plane to Brazil. We are stuck in Panama for now. I call my brother in Brazil and a manager and Copa Airlines said there is nothing they can do. I ask why Copa Airlines sent us out of the country without the proper documents and they said the Copa Airlines desk in New Orleans made a huge mistake. After another hour or so wait we are told they can send us back home to New Orleans. We wait another 2 hours and take the flight home. When we arrived in New Orleans we had to wait at the gate until the entire plane unloaded to get our stroller. This wait put us at the back of the line for customs, which took forever! We finally get to baggage claim only to find that they have lost my sons car seat!

### "every time is different"
I've flown several times with Copa and every time is different - from old airplanes and bad food to nice airplanes and good service. This last flight was from Guatemala to Sao Paulo via Panama, I flew on a Embraer 190 from Guatemala to Panama, it was a really comfortable and short flight (one and a half hour), but the flight from Panama to Brasil, the Boeing 737-800 is a nightmare, too tight, turbulence can get nasty, the plane had a somewhat nice entertainment system but not something that would keep you busy on the 7 hours flight. Food is bad on Copa Airlines, flight attendants not always polite, 50% of the time they will not provide a blanket, they do give headphones every time. Overall is a decent airline but I'd rather fly another airline the next time.

### "737 not appropriate for long trips"
Flew Copa Airlines from Miami to Rio de Janeiro via Panama City on October 6th, late afternoon departure from MIA via Panama City. The 2.5 hr flight from Miami to PTY was less than half full, which helps. We were offered a chicken empanada or a cheeseburger for dinner. Not bad. Early arrival in Panama. The flight from Panama to Rio de Janeiro (a 7-hour trip) departed Panama 40 minutes late but arrived in Brazil only 5 minutes late. For this long-haul, Copa uses a brand-new Boeing 737-800 with Sky Interior and AVOD with limited selection. Even though the Boeing 737 is a small aircraft, with this flight also being less than half full, it took the reasonably friendly cabin crew 90 minutes to finish dinner service. You did have complimentary full-bar service with dinner. For breakfast (3.5 hours later) I only got a Quaker bar with coffee. A light breakfast would be more appropriate, especially since dinner is so light. Boeing 737 is not appropriate for such long trips, since space is very limited and turbulence is strongly felt throught the flight. All is all, Panama City is a reasonably simple hub to connect and Copa offers acceptable service. Since I got my tickets for half the cost of what I normally pay it was good value for money. If the fare is similar however, I rather fly Delta on my next trip.

### "good service on board"
San Jose to Miami via Panama with Copa Airlines, and they are the best airline for connections in Central America. All these flights on time, the Panama transfer connection was just one hour, and did not have to rush. Panama Tocumen Airport was easy and convenient. FA's onboard flights were really nice, and good service on board, even for 1 hour flights.

### "comfortable seating on Boeing 737"
Copa Airlines is a nice airline. Fast and easy check in online, securty priority line, nice lounge at JFK, boarding on time, comfortable seating on Boeing 737, lots of legroom. On the way to Panama there was no IFE, on the way back a new aircraft with new seats, great. FA very attentive. Downside is that the food service not up to business class standards. More like economy meal. All flights on time.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flew SJO to PTY on CM 145 and PTY to TPA, both on 26 August. Both flights were punctual and pleasant. In fact, we pushed back 15 minutes early from San Jose and 10 minutes early from Panama. I had the emergency exit row to myself on both segments - even business class couldn't have been more comfortable. I was particularly impressed with the detailed instructions given to passengers seated in these rows. Service onboard was quick, efficient, and cheerful. The meals, while not exotic or gourmet, were more than adequate. In sum, an entirely positive experience.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Because of my job I'm a regular flyer on many airlines and I tend to prefer non-American airlines as, in my experience, they tend to provide better in-cabin service. However, on my recent flight from Panama to Washington DC on August 4th in the evening I had the most unpleasant experience with the business class flight attendant who was rude and condescending. If on top of offering older type of planes, with mediocre entertainment, COPA cannot offer top service as their competition such as Avianca or LAN Chile do. They should really pay more attention to their customer service and choose personnel who are inclined to provide proper services.

### Copa Airlines customer review
The baggage didn't come when I arrived in Medellin on July 30. It has been 4 days and the baggage is still not here. Called their lost baggage office at Medellin airport but they did not speak English. As an International air carrier, you would think Copa would hire employees who speak English. A very frustrating experience.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Besides the mistakes made at the counter in Costa Rica, which was where I was coming from, the fact that they wanted to bump off people from the flight because they were overbooked and that the stewards knew little English though they were flying to an English speaking country, I had to endure one of the stewards throwing paper at me while I was exiting the plane. This is what led to it. I requested a gluten free diet weeks before my flight and received one on the flight to Panama (which was really a fruit plate). However, I was trying to explain to the male steward on flight heading into Port of Spain on 18th July 2015 that I was going to take a regular meal since I had not eaten in a long time. He just grew frustrated, maybe because he did not speak or understand English well, became angry and kept pointing to a paper saying that he had no name. I calmly said ok and accepted whatever was given - which I could not eat. I fell asleep not even knowing when my tray was taken away. As the plane landed I gave my 'Thank you' to the stewards as I passed. I noticed the male steward stopped speaking to his female coworker and glared at me. As I walked ahead a rolled up piece of paper was thrown in my path. I don't know if it was just carelessly and mindlessly thrown and was disrespectful to me. Such a pity that this is the only airline that flies to Central America.

### Copa Airlines customer review
My second time on Copa, I knew what it was like so I had low expectations. As a Star Alliance Gold passenger I was able to use the business check-in which took less than 1 minute. The agent was not sure which lounge to send me to - I have a Turkish Gold Card. Eventually I chose the SAS Business Lounge, which is one of the better Star Alliance Gold lounges at O'hare T5. It has slightly better food with excellent views of the apron and runway. Don't use the Swissport Lounge. The fight departs on time. B737-800 has the interior almost identical to a United aircraft. It's an old plane - things are a little frayed and worn but not falling apart. Seat pitch is a little tight, comparable to US airlines. There was no IFE but drop down monitors every 3 rows and free headphones were handed out. On this 5 hour flight, dinner was served 1 hour after take off. There was no choice for entree, which was a layer of cheesy baked mashed potatoes on top of seasoned sauteeed ground beef with vegetables. It was quite good in fact but portion was small. Basic uninspiring salad, packaged dessert. As usual, alcohol is free (whisky, beer, red wine, white wine). Flight attendants served several rounds of water throughout the flight but there was no refreshment service before landing. No newspaper service, no hot towels. Flight attendants seem to be professional and pleasant. Overall it's slightly better than US airlines but far below Asian carriers in economy on comparable routes in both amenities and comfort. If you're able to get a good deal on Copa then I'd recommend flying it.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flew from Tampa to Panama in business class and Panama to San Jose in economy on 9 July. Paradoxically, the meal was better on the shorter flight in economy. On both flights, the adjoining seat was unoccupied, which makes all the difference regardless of which cabin you are in. Ground staff in Tampa were cheerful and helpful, and my luggage was waiting for me as soon as I cleared immigration in SJO. Inflight crew on the PTY-SJO segment were less personable, but they are to be commended for completing a full beverage and snack service on a 1 hour flight.

### Copa Airlines customer review
No blankets or pillows provided and I was freezing on the flight. The food wasn't good, I personally feel American Airlines is better than Copa but the flights were right on schedule and the staff were polite overall.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I had a connecting in Sao Paulo airport. The ground staff are very good - helpful and polite. Cabin staff are good. Not much entertainment option on these narrowbody aircraft. Overall good service, especially for timing.

### Copa Airlines customer review
The crew was warm and welcoming, the plane clean, and though the flight was just 1 hour and 10 minutes, they served a delicious lunch. Though the flight from Panama City to San Jose was on the expensive side for so short a hop, I may fly Copa next time from US to Panama instead of American!

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flew YUL-PTY-MGA on April 12 and MGA-PTY-YUL on April 25. The longhaul flight on the outbound was equipped with individual screen and personal entertainment system but the one on the inbound still had the overhead screens. I found that the aircraft's were new and clean the flight attendants were kind and attentive and all flights were right on time. I was able to book exit row seats on all my flights free of charge directly on their web site. And Tocumen airport is really convenient for connections as you do not have to go through customs or any other form of control when you are in transit (you simply go from one gate to the other in less than 10 minutes).

### Copa Airlines customer review
3/17/15 CM 760 from Lima to Panama. My first plane was late but I was assured over and over again that I would make my connecting flight - I literally ran from one end of Panama airport to the other to catch my connecting flight. Of course when I got to the gate a very unfriendly and cold man stated that the flight was closed (I could see that the plane was still there). I had to spend the night in Panama when my husband had already driven 125 miles to pick me up at Los Angeles airport. Food was served that tasted and looked like cardboard. My first and last trip with Copa Airlines. Never again!

### Copa Airlines customer review
COPA staff smiling cheerful and attentive to customers' needs. I flew MEX-PTY in Economy and PTY-MEX in Business Class and I was delighted. Great staff on both legs. Decent free food and free drinks in economy. Very good food and decent drinks in business class. Worth mentioning is that COPA even in economy class allow you to choose your seat before your flight and that they allow you to travel in the emergency row without extra cost (most of the airlines now charge you a fee for the emergency row: I find this practice miserable). Very efficient web check in and bag drop off. Will fly them again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Steep service and quality decline - Copa Airlines. Until two years ago it was a pleasure to fly Copa between Brazil and Panama - new aircraft good food attentive service and most important clean planes (especially restrooms). In my four recent trips in the past two months food quality and cleaning of all planes have fallen miserably. One week ago my seat was wet when I boarded the plane. I insisted that the seat had to be changed but I was offered a blanket to be placed on top of the wet spot. Copa is increasing its routes and maybe not giving proper attention to the basics: Restrooms are filthy - even in flights departing from their hub in PTY. Staff are friendly but they have no means to react to situations like a wet seat - what should they have done? Not to mention the quality of the food aboard. Last night on flight CM 701 (Feb 23 2015) our plane had to land in Campinas (VCP) instead of GRU at 8.45pm (time of our supposed arrival to GRU) because the plane was short on fuel (GRU airport had traffic above normal). Think twice before buying your ticket.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I flew from Las Vegas to Panama City in business class and I must say the seats are a joke. It was a night flight and the sears almost don't recline and there is no leg rest. I almost didn't sleep. Flight entertainment was a couple of small screens hanging on the ceiling where they showed a movie.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flex LAX-PTY-LIM and return with an infant on lap. Got a mix of older and newer planes for the different legs the newer planes were decent with individual entertainment system but when asking for the infant seat belt and life west we have on all other airlines we taken with our infant (KLM Norwegian SAS) we where told COPA does not supply these. Choose to purchase seat for the infant for the return trip using our FAA approved car seat. When installing the seat the seat belt was not long enough to buckle when asking for the extension seat belt the buckle of the extension seatbelt did not fit the one of the original seat belt had to fasten the carseat using the latch system of the car seat around the back of the seat luckily it was long enough to do this. Definitely not the safest airline to fly with infants or toddlers or for anyone else needing an extension seat belt. Service was frequent and staff was friendly both food quality was the poorest airplane food I have experienced. Would definitely not recommend this airline to anyone traveling with an infant or toddler.

### Copa Airlines customer review
The fleet is aged and well worn with perhaps only a dozen or so newer planes in service. Given the ratio of new vs. older equipment it is probable that you will be flying on one of their older planes. Such was the case on my recent journey to South America - LAX-GIG / GRU-LAX. The business class seats were old recliner types much like old first class seat of the 70's-80's. The IFE was past its prime with minimal choices and poor music options. Food service while good was not up to premium class standards. The inflight crew was top notch on all legs of my trip. In short the fare was cheapest business class for my itinerary and the minimal connection times in PTY did not require a sprint to the gate. All flights departed and arrived on time. Would I fly with them again? Possibly so but I might consider paying the extra bucks to fly a carrier that offers a more up-to-date comfortable business class.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Havana-Panama-Manaus. The check-in in Havana was friendly and easy. The flight in a newish B737 was comfortable (good seat pitch) and the service was efficient. A snack consisting of an empanada crisps and biscuits was served. The airport at Panama City is a pleasant place to transit though the signage to our remote gate lounge wasn't clear. Seating on the E190 is tighter than on the B737 and there is no in-flight entertainment. A pleasant meal service with drinks was provided but half-way through the flight the crew disappeared (even though the toilet could have done with a cleaning). Both flights operated on time and the luggage came quickly.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flying from Panama City to Lima Peru on board of an older B737. Departure and arrival on time. Plane a little bit older but comfortable. Staff did a great job very polite offered a chifa meal (combination of South American and Chinese food very popular in Peru) that I enjoyed so much! Inflight entertainment nothing special. All in all I have no huge complaints. I recommend it.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flew Business from Vegas to Panama Panama to Quito Quito to Panama and Panama to Toronto ( Business Class with Air Canada after that). Despite the COPA advertising that they have new planes in the fleet and a contemporary Business Class they were not part of our experience and when asked what route they might be flying we were told that they only have 10 in the total fleet! The planes we flew on were tired old planes which have been well used and show it with ill fitting lumpy seats and entertainment features that are 20 years out of date. My seat refused to stay upright and continuously slowly moved to the recline position. Meals were very bad and to top it off the menu choices on all our flights were the same! The staff were very friendly and affable and trying to do their best but the product let them down - but the flights were on time. Our conclusion is: that it is just not the quality of Business Class a customer is led to believe is available. For anyone used to flying on Air Canada for instance it is a considerable step down with the only recognizable Business Class feature being the size and colour of the seats. In the future if we have a choice COPA will not be our preference.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I flew from Boston to Panama and then from Panama to Iquitos - trip back was the same pattern in reverse. I had no problems with Copa even though I speak very little Spanish. They serve food on a 2 hour flight. Old school style! While the entertainment choices were lacking in terms of movies it wasn't so bad. The crew was really nice and accommodating. Everyone received pillows and blankets.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flew two early morning flights in September: MEX-PTY and on to MIA two days later. This was my second time with this airline and I have to say I really enjoyed travelling with them: modern planes with new interiors and comfy seats professional friendly and smiling crew check-in easy and quick and on time arrivals. I would have rated 9/10 but the food is still a letdown (as it was for my first trip with them back in 2013) the price of my ticket was rather high (actually more expensive then my transatlantic flight with LH) and their hub in Panama City does need some improvement in terms of decent food stores with acceptable pricing. For sure they will see me again on board.

### Copa Airlines customer review
If you pick up the inflight magazine you will see the modern fleet that they fly. The only problem is that you will be sitting on an older plane that has antiquated seats and entertainment. I was on 3 different planes last month flying in their business class from Mexico to Colombia and from Colombia to the US. The movie offering on the two longer flights were Godzilla and the other one's name I can't even remember. Service and food were good but the seats also were lacking. I will not fly COPA again unless there is no other flight available.

### Copa Airlines customer review
We flew business class on 4 flights to and from Brazil and it was well below Air Canada's economy class in all respects except the size of the seat. The one good thing was that the flights were on time. I am a frequent flyer I've flown with many airlines and this was the first time I found airline food (or any other food) utterly inedible. I shudder to think what was served in the economy cabin. There was virtually no entertainment on offer unless you count an overhead screen showing one boring movie. We flew on points so I cannot judge value for money.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Recently returned from 10-day business trip to Santiago CL. Flew LAX-PTY-SCL-PTY-LAX all in Clase Ejecutiva on 737-800s. Overall was very pleased with Copa their punctuality and their service. The PTY hub is easy to navigate and the Copa Club fine. While 6+ hours per segment in a 737 might seem tight the aircraft is comfortable and the lounger biz seats are not too bad for sleeping. The meals and snacks are ample. The drink runs are frequent. The cabin crew was attentive. The IFE was OK (only 4-5 recent movies). Overall a great experience and the UA MileagePlus bonus miles a huge benefit. Will make this my airline of choice for Central/South America.

### Copa Airlines customer review
We flew Copa round-trip business JFK-SCL with a change in Panama City both ways. Older 737 with no personal screen for JFK-PTY segment. Other 3 flights we newer 737-8 with ambient lighting and personal screens. Food was decent orders were taken by crew before take off. Crew friendly thanked us personally for flying Copa. Seats were comfy but not lie flats. Were given passes for VIP Lounge in JFK and SCL used Copa lounge in PTY. Flights left close to schedule made all connections. Early arrival in SCL and JFK!

### Copa Airlines customer review
Flew to see my sister in Bogota Colombia and my route was: LAX-PTY-BOG in Copa Airlines B738NG. BOG-CTG in Copa Airlines Colombia EMB-E190. BOG-PTY-LAX in Copa Airlines B738NG. MileagePlus Member. All flights were class B on seat 18A (except E190). Very clean livery inside and the new 738NG's are excellent with the Sky Interior that changes color according to outside and very hip with all the inflight entertainment there is not A/C outlet but you do have a USB so if you have the cable then you can charge your device. The staff were very friendly and always checking to see if the passengers were comfy enough or if they needed anything else. The food was not that good I know that airplane food is not supposed to be the most gourmet thing there is but this "sandwich" didn't have any sauce only a sausage on a hard hot piece of bread - not what I had in mind. Copa Club is really nice in PTY though it's full of people always. I found the cost of the total trip not that expensive actually kind of low with the whole round trip being $571. I would definitely fly again with them since they are part of Star Alliance and I am a MileagePlus member.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Business class JFK-PTY. Brand new plane. Comfortable. Friendly staff greeted us by name. Reasonable entertainment choices. On time. Their website worked well for seats and meal. No complaints.

### Copa Airlines customer review
My husband and I flew from the Dominican Republic to Panama and again from Panama to the US. We hadn't heard of Copa before and were both a little hesitant but we were pleasantly surprised! My husband was really sick and the flight attendants (all three) went out of their way to make sure he was as comfortable as possible. The food was good the ride (to include landing and take off) was smooth and we were only about ten minutes off schedule. I cannot exaggerate how good the customer service was. I would recommend this airline to anyone who asked.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Will never fly Copa again. Mechanical error with our departure plane which caused us to miss first day of our vacation. During delays the staff were very rude and not forthcoming with any information about the delays. We were stuck in an airport for 7+ hours and all they did was give us a $10 food/drink coupon! Once on our flight and in the air the staff didn't speak English and I was actually told that there was no bottled water hours later I saw this flight attendant carrying a whole case of Dasani water. There's no in flight wifi. Will not fly Copa again.

Pleasant staff decent food more space than US carriers but no advance online abilities for check-in menu was printed with duplications and reversals and the same one handed to almost everyone in business.

JFK-PTY-LIM and LIM-PTY-PUJ. First time used COPA airline in May 2014. Bad experience from the check in at JFK took a very long time to check in was bumped from exit row seats to the back rows because we don't speak Spanish. We missed a connection in LIM on a return from Cusco due to delay caused by Avianca airline. Got to check in line 30 minutes before departure time and agent refused to check us in he directed us to use public phone to change our flight. No help there! Very poor customer service.

Flight 142 PTY-SJU 4/13/2014. A partially owned subsidiary of United manages to charge high fares while providing substandard service. I've flown COPA on half a dozen South American itineraries out of San Juan and it is almost predictable that something untoward will happen. We are used to the indifferent personnel inedible meals second rate "business" lounge business-class seats that don't recline and baggage that "misses" perfectly legal connections. So we should not have been surprised about our experience on our scheduled flight from Panama City to San Juan yesterday. We were denied boarding due to "overbooking" - on a coach leg of an otherwise business class itinerary (there were no business seats available when we booked). The rationale offered by the gate agent (we made the reservation more than a month ago) - you should have known when you couldn't get your seat assignments on line that you were on an overbooked flight! After considerable discussions around the unacceptability of spending a 24 hour period in Panama City we were booked on a supposedly unavailable evening flight to San Juan. So after an additional seven hour layover at the mundane Panama airport cum duty free strip mall we were on our way. Oh and the gate agent upgraded a single seat for each of two bumped couples. The trip was otherwise uneventful. The meal was as expected poor both in business and economy. Bottom line COPA was a better airline before United bought Continental. Despite convenient schedules and relatively new equipment from a passenger experience point of view it does not deserve a three star rating.

My flight from LAX to Panama City went without problems. It was the experience with the return flight that was very unpleasant. I had purchased my ticket over a month ahead of my flights and had confirmed seat assignments as well as pre-ordered vegetarian meals. I checked in 2.5 hours ahead of my flight in Panama City only to be told that I had been moved to the Standby List. I was given some bizarre explanation that there was bad weather in LA and seats were restricted. After passing security I went to the counter at the gate to see what could be done only to find out that the flight had been grossly overbooked. The agent was not willing to put me on the next outgoing flight (as normally is done automatically when a flight is cancelled or missed). I went through security at the gate and then had to stand in line again to find out if I was going on the flight I had booked or not. Interestingly enough all the people in this line ahead of me and behind me that I talked to were tourists. I eventually made it on the flight but had to find out that my vegetarian meals had been cancelled. One of the flight attendants was nice enough to search around and did find some vegetarian food for me to eat. The staff on board were very helpful and pleasant unfortunately the one at the gate not so much. While things do happen (flights get cancelled re-routed are late) being put on the Standby list for no reason at all despite having a confirmed ticket and seat and being at the airport on time is new to me. Clearly I will not fly Copa again.

PTY-HAV-PTY a few days ago. Copa Airlines cabin staff were a little bored. The food is better than average. On the way back (with check-in) - the ground staff in Havana was welcoming. It was nice. My bag got a plastic coverage for better protection free of charge. The food was simple but tasty. More drinks would be welcomed. This airline was better than average.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I planned far in advance for my trip and I checked in online. When I arrived at the airport about 90 minutes before my flight simply to drop off my baggage I was told that the check-in counter was already closed. I then asked the associate at the Copa desk who was from another airline where I could find a Copa representative at which point I was told I would need to call the customer service line. So now I had about 65 minutes before my flight left and there was no representative at the airport. I called the customer service line was on hold for over 10 minutes and then was told that since I had missed my flight there was very little they could do for me aside from re-booking the flight for 48 hours later! They would also have to charge me the "no-show" fee because of missing my flight. Again the flight was still not gone I was checked in but could not board of some company policy for international check-in that was not advertised anywhere and is still unclear to me after spending over an hour talking to four different customer representatives on the phone. I cancelled my flight and am flying with someone else.

Flew from Las Vegas Nevada to Costa Rica with a layover in Panama City Panama both going and returning. I got to experience their best and their worst. Flying from the States to Central America Copa used their most modern aircraft. Seats were comfortable space was good and the stewards were friendly accommodating and provided excellent service. Individual entertainment screens were located at each seat. Each passenger selected their own mode of entertainment (movies music games or following the flight via a map). Both English and Spanish was offered. Earphones were provided when boarding the plane. Blankets and pillows were waiting on each seat. Very comfortable with a thumbs up for Copa for my 1st experience with them. Returning to the States was a nightmare. Copa used very old outdated aircraft. They needed extensive cosmetic repairs. The flight leaving Costa Rica at least had pleasant stewards. Stewards flying from Panama to the States were not. They did not assist to keep the plane clean on a 6.5 hour flight. If garbage found its way into the aisle they stepped over it each time it was encountered. By the end of the flight the floor was overcome by trash including the bathroom floors. They spoke and understood English when it behoved them to do so. One entertainment screen existed every 3-4 seats. Three movies were shown all in Spanish and all without English subtitles. Earphones were passed out after the first movie started. There was not enough blankets or pillows for the number of passengers. Very uncomfortable environment for a 6.5 hour flight. Thumbs down for Copa on my last experience with them.

### Copa Airlines customer review
PTY to CTG 2/17. Arrive at airport 2+ hours early. Unable to check-in online. Web check in had short line other was an hour plus line. Get to the counter left waiting 20 minutes. Finally the agent returns and tells us 1 of us can fly on the direct PTY-CTG flight but the other has to wait until the next morning or fly PTY-BOG-CTG arrive in CTG at 9pm 8 hours later than the direct flight we had booked. Offered us 150$ voucher and a meal which turned out was a lousy 10$ voucher which couldn't even buy a sandwich. Was given a complete run around. Requested lounge access since internet in PTY is basically non-functional. Denied. 3 hours after we arrived at the airport we gave up and went to get something to eat where we discovered the voucher for food was only for 10 dollars. Went to the Copa desk and got the run-around for another 20 minutes. Will never fly Copa again. When we got our seats on the connecting leg on Avianca to CTG we were seated on opposite sides of the plane directly in front of the exit row in non-reclinable seats. Most incompetent and infuriating customer service ever dealt with.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Traveled from Las Vegas to Guatemala this past December. For the most part the flights were right on schedule though from Panama City to Guatemala there was a slight delay but I suppose it was because of storms in the area. Return flights were on time. Overall we had a good experience we were fed rather well on all flights and the crew were very attentive they also allow you plenty of luggage on flights to and from the US (two 50lb check-ins plus a 25lb carry on). They even offer free alcoholic drinks! My only complaint is with the entertainment system. They played the same movie and same shows on all the long flights (Vegas to Panama Panama to Vegas) and their in-plane music is very limited (about 9 channels with a rather small playlists).

### Copa Airlines customer review
Copa flight from Managua to San Jose was suddenly cancelled on Jan 1. No notification was given to any passengers. I managed to discover this when I went to check in online and discovered it accidentally and made other arrangements (took a flight to San Salvador at the same time instead). Unfortunately many other people did not know this and there was a huge line at the airport - and absolutely no one at the Copa counter to help them. They are not worthy of being a Star Alliance member.

GIG-PTY CM0872 13 December 2013. My flight was cancelled (which as a traveler I can accept) however after three hours waiting on the airplane they kicked us off only to be met with chaos and disorganization in the terminal. No one knew what was going on. There were only three staff members working and it took five and a half hours to sort out hotel vouchers and possible re-booking for all the customers. No information flowed from the staff. No announcements were made. It was horrific.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Copa's planes are clean seats are comfortable enough staff are friendly and food/drinks are good and free but our return trip from Costa Rica was a disaster. The first leg was 1 hour late causing us to miss our connection in Panama City to Toronto. Copa then sent 9 of us to Miami that night and booked us on American Airlines the next morning. The flight to Miami was also an hour late leaving. They arranged for hotels but when we got to the hotel it was very low quality and the hotel agent refused to accept Copa's vouchers and asked us to pay $160 per room. We refused and returned to the airport where we spent the night freezing because the air conditioning was so high (the cold is not Copa's fault). The American Airlines flight was good but no free meal.

### Copa Airlines customer review
We flew Lima to Havana via Panama and do not have any complaints. Being a nervous flier issues about punctuality and being a new airline made me nervous. However all four flights left on time the flight attendants were good and the food was surprisingly decent. There was minimal in flight entertainment but this was no issue for me as I'm used to long haul flights so a short haul flight with Copa was good. I'd be happy to fly with them again.

LIM-PTY-SJO 737-800 J-Class. Quick check-in boarded promptly at 4.20am for a punctual 5am departure. Flight attendants were nice although not much of a product offering. Seats were wide but no foot rest. Breakfast was mediocre and no amenity kit.

Flew GRU-PTY-LAS and back in the same way. Good experience. Food seat comfort time food - all was very good. No complaints. I will fly again with COPA.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Very mean airline and indifferent service. My luggage was 1 kg overweight on two flights with them and was charged for the 1 kg (around 2-3 dollars). I find this incredible. In my 30 years of regular flying I have never seem such mean attitude. Their allowance is a meagre 20 kg while most airlines anywhere is 23 kg. As for onboard service forget about it. I took a flight from California to San Andres Island at lunchtime and we were offered a soft drink only on this almost two hour flight. Flight attendants never smiled. I now understand why both flights were less than 80% empty. Terrible!

### Copa Airlines customer review
We travelled in a group of 20 from Panama City to San Jose Costa Rica. For the first flight 11 of us were bumped along with approx. 5 other people that we didn't know. Arranging a hotel and tickets for the flight the following day took them 6 hours. Communication was not easy as Copa employees lacked the ability of speaking proper English. The next day I noticed that lots of other people were overbooked again. On the way back home one of our group members got a standby ticket again. Fortunately this was later changed to a regular ticket. 3 of our group travelled one hour ahead of the rest of us but their flight was delayed with almost 3 hours. For this reason they nearly missed their flight to Amsterdam. Luggage wasn't transferred on time. Communication again was amateuristic.

Flew BOG-PTY-BOS yesterday in Economy Class and I can tell you if they weren't the only airline from South America to fly non-stop to Boston I would have never taken them. Old and small aircraft for a 6-hour flight bad service no PTV or IFE bad food expensive rude and unhelpful male flight attendants who barely speak English 20 min wait at the Business Class check-in line cramped space in aircraft's. I'm only glad for the Star Alliance miles I hope I earned. I wouldn't recommend them to anybody who has flown European and Asian airlines. Maybe good for Americans who are used to this kind of bad service.

Copa offered excellent service in Business Class - LAX to GIG through Panama. No upgrade on return to LAX however coach service was good or better than US airlines.

Used for the first time in April and May of 2013. We flew to Panama then over to Aruba the plane was small and a little cramped. We enjoyed the food as most airlines only give meals that are purchased. Meals were free and you got real silverware. The attendants did their job but could have smiled more and could have made us feel a little more welcome. Overall we would rate at a 7.

Several flights in Central America. Flights always on time early arrival. Good connections and very easy airport to use at Panama City. At Panama Airport usually long line for Check in but goes very fast never waited more than 10 min. Staff very polite and helpful. Boarding by rows nice and comfortable aircraft. Always serve snack and drinks. IFE ok.

### Copa Airlines customer review
LIM-PTY on a tired 737-700. Flight was expensive. I managed to get the emergency exit which made the flight quite comfortable. Happy to get a warm meal not used to that for a similar flight in Europe anymore. Cabin crew just did their job no smiles. I was shocked at the lack of safety checks both at takeoff and landing. The gentleman next to me had a large bag blocking the emergency exit. None of the crew members noticed despite one FA reminding us to read the evacuation instructions they just didn't even look. The same for seatbelts before landing. They did walk down the aisle but didn't bother to look. I've never seen this before. Finally by the end of the flight I went to the rear toilet and took my rubbish to the galley. When I handed it to the FA he gave me a nasty look I should have left it on my tray and have him come pick it up. Disappointed.

### Copa Airlines customer review
JFK-PTY-REC and REC-PTY. Return segment from PTY-EWR was with United. The most direct route to Recife from NYC with a Star Alliance Carrier that I could find. For business class the tickets were comparatively cheap. All flights were on 737s which were refurbished. Continental equipment. Business cabin was the same as you would get on a domestic US flight. Seats didn't recline much no foot rests no in seat power and overhead monitors. Vegetarian food options were bad mostly soggy grilled vegetables and tiny portions. They also seem to have barely enough for the people onboard. They also seem to ration the alcohol and don't serve it very willingly. On the PTY-REC flights they serve a snack first instead of a meal. They serve the meal 2 hrs before you land at 11 pm at night. On the flight from REC-PTY they didn't turn on the entertainment system. Overall the airline served a purpose it got me to Recife from NYC in the least amount of time and with Star Alliance but I wouldn't fly them again if I had a choice.

### Copa Airlines customer review
COPA Airlines bumped us (my wife and myself) off their 11.50 morning flight 472 from Panama City's Tocumen International Airport to LAX on January 6. Re-scheduled us to fly on their 6.40pm evening flight instead. Spent 11 hours at the airport. Given a lunch certificate and a $300 future travel certificate. Arrived at Panama City Airport 4.5 hours early for our flight. We were told at check-in that we were bumped. Copa routinely overbooks their flights. Apparently passengers who boarded our flight confirmed the flight days earlier. COPA never told us to do that. The gate crew gave us no information. Service desk staff gave us misinformation: they assured us that our luggage would be transferred to the 302 flight and they assured us that we would get our special vegan meals. None of these things happened. COPA not being able to transfer our luggage from the earlier to the later flight meant that we had to wait for our luggage for 3 days after we got home. Our wonderful trip to Panama had this unfortunate ending.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Aside from a small issue with the person doing check-in in Chicago all went perfectly. This airline was without a doubt superior to almost any US Carrier. Will use them from this point on for all Latin American and Caribbean travel. Great crews lose the chicken sandwiches. Aside from that on time friendly and flawless service.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I flew round trip from Las Vegas to Panama and back business class. Business class was the same as most airlines economy class. The stewards and stewardess never smiled and was nowhere to be found for most of the flight. They served snacks to some people and forgot the rest. Very strange set up I must say. If they train their personal in customer service perhaps it would make for a better trip.

### Copa Airlines customer review
First time flying with them going from BOG to PTY on April 8th and on to MEX two days later. They have a fleet of modern B737NG with new and comfortable interiors. Nothing to complain about the only minus was the food (ravioli) served on the 3.5 hrs flight to Mexico which was really inedible. Their hub in Panama City is a good and quite modern airport from where you can reach many destinations in Central and South America even if they should improve the immigration process which took almost an hour (about 150 persons to be checked and just 6 counters on duty).

### Copa Airlines customer review
We flew on 4 flights with COPA business class. I would only classify our flight from Rio to Panama City as true business class with leg rest and plenty of room. The other 3 flights were not even as good as most other airlines' premium economy - no leg rest and very little room to recline. The food and service were good for the most part. I would not take COPA again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
San Jose to JFK via Panama and we were seated separately on both flights even though our reservation was made together. The customer service personnel were unable to straighten the situation out. As business class travelers who paid for excellent service we were severely short changed in the customer service provided. As a traveler I do have a choice in my airline and I will not be choosing COPA.

### Copa Airlines customer review
BOG to MCO with stop in PTY. Upgraded to Business for PTY-MCO. Had applied for the upgrade via Internet but didn't receive notice on time (24 hours before the flight) - so I had to stay with the Economy line and my boarding pass was changed at the gate. Because of that I had no chance to try their Copa Club. Crew was attentive and spoke English very well. Food and drink (red wine) were good. Entertainment was poor on that old 737 800 - no individual screens/choices. For the flight back (MCO-PTY) I got the upgrade on time but the United Club is located at Terminal B-Airside 3 whereas our flight departed from Terminal A-Airside 1. Amenities were worth the money and I felt well treated during the flight.

### Copa Airlines customer review
MIA-PTY PTY-MCO. Both flights arrived early. Seats very comfortable. Service was OK - not great but not poor. Food was OK to good. Inflight entertainment was minimal - the same movie was shown on both flights. Upon arrival at MCO we were prevented from deplaning by MCO airport officials due to backlog of people in the immigration lines. I had a fairly tight connection and the Copa pilot was extremely helpful in persuading MCO officials to allow me to deplane. Overall very satisfied. I would fly Copa again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Our fight from GRU to PTY was 3 hours late. The problem as Copa correctly told us at least half a dozen times was not their fault. The underlying problem was due to an airport power outage. But Copa did not deal with it well. When we landed at PTY we could not find anyone to help us with information on our connecting flight. The business class seat on the second flight - PTY to JFK had no leg rest and barely reclined. Then they lost our luggage on the connecting flight from PTY to JFK. No Copa employee could be found in the JFK baggage arrivals area.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I had never heard of Copa until I purchased tickets to Costa Rica. With one exception all went well. Generally on time friendly efficient service. We had a rather short connection in Panama City the plane was a little late arriving so we had to run to make the plane not easy to find the gate as the airport was in the process of changing the signs. The luggage did not make the connection but it was delivered to our hotel by mid morning the following day. The vegetarian request was delivered - very good food. One nice little surprise - you could get a glass of wine or a Coke!

### Copa Airlines customer review
Copa is not my first choice of carriers for flights to Central and South America for several good reasons. Ground personnel are most often rude indifferent and intolerant of individual needs. Many choose not to understand passengers who need assistance in English. I do speak Spanish which is a good thing when checking in because the agents will invariably try to charge you extra baggage fees for oversized or overweight baggage and seldom back down. The airline has a horrible record for on time departures. Onboard don't expect much in the way of amenities the cabin is more akin to a domestic first class cabin. Seats on the 738 fleet are all leather with a comfortable seat pitch and a comfortably wide width. However they are old recliner type seats with only a slight recline - but even that feature is commonly in a state of disrepair. AV equipment on board is very old with some aircraft's still featuring the overhead small TV screens every few rows. Audio choices are very limited when they function. The upside are the inflight crews who are friendly professional and very apologetic about the state of the cabin equipment. Food and drinks are reliably good and the flight deck crews are just as good as the inflight crews. Business class fares are usually a fraction of what the other carriers charge so book it only for the added bonus of extra seat space and check your high expectations at the counter along with your bags - which may or may not arrive with you at your final destination.

Few days ago I traveled Copa from BOG to PTY and SCL. I was told to depart on time on this airline is like winning a lottery ticket and indeed we were almost an hour delayed in BOG. The flight from PTY to SCL was delayed but by a few minutes. The crew are excellent they gave all they have to serve their passengers (maybe because I was flying in Business Class). In flight entertainment is awful. Overall I will give it 6/10.

MAO-PTY-SAL-PTY-ADZ-CTG-CLO-BOG January flying Embraer 190 Ejets. I notice that Copa is now a sort of low cost carrier charging legacy carrier prices! Front desk staff rude at best not welcoming customers chatting with each other having you to wait until they feel like calling you. The onboard service is now almost non-existent even on long flights you will get at most a tiny cold snack with a glass of beverage! The crew struggle to deal with non Spanish Portuguese speakers the seats are comfy though. I will start to look for alternatives.

Dulles Airport to Panama City then Panama City to Quito Ecuador. On the flight from Dulles Airport no flight attendants came out for the first 2 hours to offer drinks. I got up to use the bathroom and noticed 2 flight attendants wrapped in grey blankets sitting at the back of the airplane. No volume on the TV so we could only watch the movie no volume no explanation no apology. The pilot never introduced himself or his flight crew and never gave any updates on the weather. On the leg from Panama City to Ecuador the flight crew was fine. Return flight from Panama City to Dulles was a different experience. The service was above and beyond excellent. The plane was clean the movie was audible and the flight crew was terrific. I would fly COPA again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
SJU-PTY-RIO 12-20-2012. We have grown to expect the barely adequate Business seating as a price for the geographically convenient Panama City connection. On the flight to Rio my seat did not recline and our luggage did not arrive. It is worthy of note that our flight attendant acknowledged that the seat mechanism tended to failed frequently and promised to write up the difficulties but noted the airline tended to ignore them. At the end of the day COPA does not offer anything near a quality Business experience. If you have to fly them fly Economy.

### Copa Airlines customer review
SCL-PTY in J Class on a 737. Check-in at SCL was slow due to having to argue about having overweight bag fees waived for a medical device - this was sorted without too much trouble. One issue at SCL both with Copa and in general is the difficulty in finding English-speaking employees and the resulting miscommunications likely contributed to the problem. Boarding was quick aircraft clean and our drink and meal orders were promptly taken. Flight departed SCL and arrived PTY 10 minutes early. Service efficient and friendly. Breakfast offered before arrival at PTY wasn't great. The seating for an international business class product is somewhat lacking more like US domestic first class seat pitch and width was good and certainly better than coach. Simply not what you expect in business class on a 6 hr 40 mins flight. Ground service in PTY is where Copa shined on this trip. One member of our party has trouble walking long distances and I was concerned at the walk between our arriving gate and our onward gate for a UA flight to IAH. An employee at the Copa lounge went out of her way to make things as easy as possible for him promptly dispatching a wheelchair to our arrival gate taking him to a competitor airline's lounge because the elevator at Copa's lounge was broken and then getting him to our onward gate in time for our flight. Overall good value for the price paid.

Plane full as always and on time as always on both legs. Emergency seats definitely have more space for a 6 ft 1 passenger like me. Decent and heated economy class food and wide availability of beverages. Nice smiley flight crew. Plane clean and new. Full lunch plus sandwich prior landing. Overall a good experience.

I traveled from Chicago to Recife-Brazil on Copa Airlines on 12-17-2012. They state on their website that passengers in economy class originating in the US can take two extra checked-in suitcases under 32 Kg for $175 each. She had one extra suitcase and Copa Airlines refused to check it in because there were not allowing this for the month of December. They never updated the on-line information about luggage limitations for the month of December.

Flew Mexico - Panama and back in Economy Class. Travelled with an infant and requested a front row seat. Request was denied. Online check-in was not permitted for passengers travelling with infants. At Airport check-in staff were slow and after several minutes they suggested my wife and I sit on different seats. When I strongly protested with the suggestion they reassigned us so we were seated together. In flight service was poor and comparable to budget airline standards. Food was cold and not fit for consumption the only thing was the metal cutlery which is rare these days. Flight attendants were cold and not open to requests. On the return flight I called Copa Panama to request a front row seat I was told it was assigned when I got to the airport I was told there was no request made and no seat assigned. Inflight entertainment on the way into Panama was not functioning. Overall a bad experience.

Flew Toronto to Panama City Direct got a great seat-sale. Did the web check-in for way down got row 11 and when you do the web check-in for the first leg it automatically did the web-check in for our return flight but somehow we got row 30 not sure how that happens? We checked in at Panama City and were able to get row 32 (only row where a seat hadn't been booked). Agent gave us aisle and window and nobody booked middle seat so we got lucky and had all 3 seats to ourselves. Service on way down was outstanding but I think they were short-staffed on way back because service was slow and they ran out of chicken meals (to be expected I guess when you're at the back of the bus). Blankets pillows drinks meals and headphones were all provided without extra cost. Would definitely fly Copa again.

October 14 2012. The first leg of my trip was a 1.5 hr flight from Aruba to Panama City and to my surprise we had a choice of warm sandwiches chips cookies and beverage. The chicken sandwich was pretty good for airline food but I can't complain because my flights from LAX to Las Vegas was a beverage and peanuts or pretzels. The second leg back home to Los Angeles was over a 5 hr flight leaving Panama City about 6:40 pm. After a couple of hours flying the beverage carts started serving drinks followed by a hot meal real silverware roll and salad. Before the flight ended there were two more rounds of beverages. The seats are roomy and the planes are fairly new and clean.

Panama to Orlando. Service was hopeless not up to most Economy standards. Flight Attendants were very lazy and serving the very basic food and drinks took an eternity. Flight got rerouted to Miami due to weather. I had a connecting flight in Orlando with Lufthansa and tried several times to get their help to ensure communication with LH but they refused to say or do anything. While on ground in Miami the Copa official was very unhelpful and clearly didnt care about a connecting flight. Finally arriving in Orlando I just missed the connection by about 1 minute and LH was furious at Copa and had tried to get info from them without luck. Copa refused to rebook me to another flight pay for hotel or in any way be helpful. Eventually the LH manager stepped up to the plate and said "never mind them we will take care of you". LH booked a hotel and new flights home. COPA used to be a very customer focused airline but after this I will go out of my way to not fly with them again!

In April I took flight from New York (JFK) to Port of Spain with a layover in Panama. Employees are more concerned with conversing with each other than they are helping passengers. They mostly stay hidden during the flight and they don't make many announcements. The food wasn't that great either. Tocumen International Airport is dirty. The furniture has stains and rips. I will not fly Copa again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
ORD-PTY-GIG-PTY-ORD. Overall I think their service is consistent with 3 stars; they're the United of Panama. I'll fly them again if I have to and only when they offer the lowest fare. One thing that really turned me off was that they didn't hold the connecting flight for late arriving passengers delayed due to bad weather in Chicago. We took off 1.5 hours late from Chicago. When I arrived I was greeted at the end of the jet bridge by a staff member already holding a new boarding pass for me. They put me on the next flight 6 hours later. They could have and should have held that flight for 10 minutes for me and other passengers connecting to Brazil. Seat pitch is very tight but that's expected for a 3-star airlines and on a B737. Their turnaround time on the ground was so short that I don't think their cleaning staff had enough time to clean thoroughly. As a result seat pockets still have trash in them. Equipment shows sign of ageing even though they claim to have one of the youngest fleets; I flew on a B737-800. Hot meals were served (all of my flights were over 5 hours) but portion was tiny. Typically airlines food. Dessert was a cookie. On the way back the meal choices were exactly the same no variation between routes. It looks like either chicken with rice or spaghetti with beef whenever you get on a COPA flight. I did notice that their alcoholic choices were better than on United. One thing they were free. Another thing is you could get more variety: red white whiskey vodka and rum. FAs were very average in their service. I asked for tea but the FA completely forgot. Another time I asked for water but my request was also forgotten. They were clearly overworked. Only 3 FAs serving a full economy section with meal and drink service. If you're in the back you can expect to wait for 1 hour before you can get a meal or a drink.

POS-PTY-LIM. Overall fairly positive experience but very expensive at $800. Aircraft in Trinidad was a new Embraer and while roomy and comfortable - we had exit row seats - the most noticeable feature was how cold the plane was. Given that it was 30+ degrees outside this seemed a bit ridiculous. I mentioned it to one of the crew and was given a blanket promptly. One of our party was told in Port of Spain that 'due to a computer issue in Panama' one of our travel party - who had been unable to check in online - would have to have a standby boarding pass for the connection to Lima but that she would definitely be able to travel on the flight. This was not true. In actual fact the flight was massively oversold and the airline had suspended check in that morning. If we had done as we were told and wait there is no way she would have boarded and she would have been stranded for 2 days like many other passengers were. We were lucky. The second flight was of course full but the crew worked hard and food/drinks were fine as was the IFE on overhead screens. Crew were slightly less friendly on this second flight but they were much busier. Overall a good onboard experience only marred by a degree of ineptitude by some of the ground staff.

MAO-PTY-MAO in Business class. I can say that Copa has a very consistent product but their business class model is ageing and not worth the price paid no PTVs seats are 80s model does not recline properly. On embraer aircraft you feel cramped even in business FAs provide blankets and pillows for everyone take your orders on arrival with welcome drinks. Food is good you get entree main dish and deserts the service is friendly but will avoid spending my money on Copa business class they say they are fitting their newer planes with ptv and skyinterior I hope they are.

PTY-CUN. Good experience on all counts. The crew was very warm and accommodating the seat was comfortable but standard for premium class. The food was well prepared and presented. Overall a god solid performance.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I few to Panama from LAX in business class and it was the best flight I've taken. As a Continental mileage plan member I was able to wait in the Admiral lounges in both airports. The food beverages and service exceeded my expectations. We had so many food courses on the flight back to LA that I could not eat it all. Very comfortable seats and fabulous flight attendants.

### Copa Airlines customer review
They offer good service and good prices. I travelled last year from Panama City to Los Angeles in business cabin and everything was perfect. Flight attendants are very helpful and friendly. Catering is very good they offer you a wide selection of food and they have a good selection of drinks.

### Copa Airlines customer review
San Jose Costa Rica to Panama and Panama to Orlando. Both flights very enjoyable. Friendly crew spoke English very well complimentary beverage and hot meal service even on the short segment to Panama. Spotless Embraer 190 and 737-800 aircraft's with decent legroom. Both flights on time. Baggage loading took over 30 minutes but would definitely travel Copa again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
ORD-PTY-SJO: ORD-PTY: older 737-700. Interior was very dated and the seating cramped with a very tight pitch. Old tired seating. Crew polite and efficient though their English (inc'l captain) was weak. IFE was a joke you could barely see the LCD screens. PTY-SJO on an E-190 which was a nice aircraft. More generous space and a more professional crew. SJO-PTY-ORD: Check-in at SJO is an ordeal. SJO-PTY segment was a late flight and was delayed as a result. Equipment was a newer E-190 very nice a/c. Excellent crew very polite and helpful. PTY-ORD segment delayed one hour with no announcement. Ground crew rough and unfriendly. 737-700 in a little better shape than outbound; but still worn seats and very cramped. Captain and crew spoke good to excellent English. Food was okay - typical airline fare. Not sure if I'll go with them again: dislike the flight schedule and so many hours in old cramped plane.

Trinidad to Rio return. Food was typical airline fare and service was excellent. I ordered vegetarian food it was not on board but the crew made something up for me that was excellent. Cabin crew were polite. Seating was ok and I will definitely use them again.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Los Angles to Tocumen and back and was completely satisfied. The 737's were in top shape inside and out. Food was typical airline fare but the service was excellent. Cabin crew were polite but they need more English speaking personnel. Seating was tight so placement at the central Exit door was appreciated on the return flight. I will definitely use them again.

IAD-Bucaramanga Colombia. Every flight was on time or early. Service was excellent with an airline rep being designated to lead us from point to point in Bogota on our way home for a short connection time. While the planes were not the most modern food quality was so-so but all 5 of our fights were like clockwork hampered only by the (USA required) secondary screening required prior to boarding our final flight to IAD which certainly mucked things up a bit but didn't delay our arrival time.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Orlando to Buenos Aires return with layover in Panama City. Business Class. Flights were on time. Cabin crew young and friendly. Business class seats not up to international standards for long flights. No foot rest limited incline. Not comfortable for 7 hr overnight flight. Food and entertainment just ok.

### Copa Airlines customer review
YYZ-PTY-SCL. Smaller and older 737 from YYZ to PTY. Bigger and newer to SCL. But it changes depending on the season. Surprisingly everything ok. All flights on time. The newer planes very comfortable. Inflight services good. Food not great but ok. Connection in PTY pretty smooth. Very good value for money.

### Copa Airlines customer review
MAO-MGA-SJO-SDQ-PTY-MAO. Still find their fares very affordable and fair service is good mix of nice cabin crew and boring ones but that you find on every single airlines! the inflight service is a little bit poorer. And such a great plane the Embraer!

### Copa Airlines customer review
MGA-IAD return via PTY. All flights on time and friendly crew onboard. Flights to and from DC were operated with the new 737-800 Sky Interior which was nice and made you forget that you were on a plane. Surprisingly good food and no problems with baggage.

### Copa Airlines customer review
BOG to MGA through PTY. Due to bad weather flight departed late from BOG. Only 5-10 min transfer time in Panama before the connecting flight to MGA. Immediately after landing my name was called picked up at the gate and informed by ground staff at which gate my connecting flight would depart. Connecting flight waited for me and departed immediately. Most surprising Copa and PTY managed to get my luggage on the plane to MGA (in less than 10 minutes!). Never seen anything like that.

### Copa Airlines customer review
CLO-PTY. Short 1 hr flight. Comfortable Embraer jet with very good leg room. Flight departed on time and during the one hour flight breakfast was offered along with a drink service. Professional crew flight attendants spoke English will definitely try to fly them again. PTY is a decent airport. Immigration took less than 2 mins.

### Copa Airlines customer review
LAX-PTY. The crew were kind and smiling everything is free including liquors. The breakfast is very good and punctuality excellent. Very good attention to detail.

### Copa Airlines customer review
LAX-GUA. The flight experience from check-in at LAX to arrival in GUA went smoothly. Flight attendants were good along with the food. On time and overall a great flight.

### Copa Airlines customer review
GUA-SJO. I was very dissatisfied when COPA changed the time of the flight and I was not notified. That being said the service was good. I had two breakfasts (one between GUA-PTY and one between PTY-SJO). Loved the ERJ 190 very comfortable and the service was good for two short flights.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Washington-Cali-Washington. Very good for the price I paid. The flight was punctual and the food was actually good.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Rio to Toronto. It was very good value for money. Planes are clean and brand new cabin crew impressively attentive the food was ok. I chose Copa because of the low price compared to Air Canada. But now I know I can choose again for the quality and punctuality too.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Copa changed my flights several times. My original reservation was to depart IAD at 6:28 a.m. and arrive Lima at 3:06 p.m. No reason was given for the multiple changes. I thought the original flights were cancelled. It turned out not to be the case. Apparently Copa overbooked and simply bumped me to later flights with no explanation and no compensation. As a result I had no time to sight see in Lima at all. I will not fly Copa again even though it is joining the Star Alliance program.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Orlando-Quito-Orlando via Panama on an award ticket using my OnePass miles. I make frequent trips to South America and after flying US carriers many times I was shocked by how different the experience was. All flights left on time aircraft were quite new and well-maintained onboard service was warm and professional (they actually thank you with a smile when picking up garbage and service items and treat you as if they value your business) they permit non-elite customers to book exit row seats the food was edible liquor was available free of charge and the transfer in Panama was absolutely painless and stress-free. Given the efficiency of the ground crew in Panama and the airline in general short connection times in Panama should not be a problem. I also had an issue with my reservation that needed to be worked out prior to my departure and instead of being placed on hold for an unreasonable amount of time or waiting in line for an hour at the airport check-in counter only to be greeted by someone who treats you like the enemy a Copa representative assisted me through their 24-hour live chat service after only having to wait 30 seconds and spared me a lot of time and headache.

LIM-PTY. Nice flight helpful FAs and a nice breakfast. Got into Panama a few minutes early and had plenty of time to make my connection with Continental Airlines.

Copa changed my flight time Cartagena-Bogotá from 1250 to 2009 and did not tell me. I noticed this by chance and spent over one hour trying to get through to someone to put me on an earlier flight. No explanation no apologies.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Bogota to Cartagena and back. The flight was just over an hour but plane was clean and seemed modern and well maintained. The flight attendants and ground staff pleasant and friendly flights good value for money.

### Copa Airlines customer review
SJO-EZE via PTY. The first flight in a clean Embraer 190 crew friendly and attentive service was ok. In PTY we de-boarded the plane on stairs but took hours for the bus to leave to the terminal even though everyone was on it. Boarding in PTY was quick and we were greeted by attentive flight attendants who were not that friendly. Inflight a nice meal and checked the cabin every now and again. I have to say however that the entertainment system in this B737-800 was very poor limited to overhead video screens. Also the seats on the plane are comfortable but could recline a little more.

### Copa Airlines customer review
JFK-PMA-CTGA-JFK. I have flown Copa for a number of years and this is the first time I faced disappointment on both flights. Attendants indifferent and inattentive. After serving the meal they disappeared for the rest of the flight. Copa used to give a beverage first and then another with your meal. Now it's just the beverage with your meal. My gluten-free meal never appeared. On the flight down to Panama one toilet was out of working order. They did leave and arrive on time however.

### Copa Airlines customer review
MAO-PTY-AUA-POS-PTY-MAO I am a Copa frequent flyer I should say their ground service is still good but onboard is going downhill. Only snacks offered even on long flights crew indifferent and pretend to be doing a favour for you. Airport agents always desperate to solve overbooking problems but in general they are value for money and they are still better than some US legacy carriers.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Copa Airlines MVD to JFK through PTY and back. At check-in in in Uruguay I was upgraded to Clase Ejecutiva on both segments of the flight which was a surprise. First leg of the flight over 7 hours long so after a good meal and some drinks decided to go to sleep. The seats were hard and not comfy for sleeping. Inflight entertainment so-so. Had the chance to experience the Copa Airlines lounge at PTY no great surprise either. Second leg of the journey as good as the first part only a bit shorter. Return trip nearly the same except that there was no Inflight Entertainment on first leg and the second leg went without wine. All in all a good experience but for long trips especially with children prepare one or two movies and some reading because you can suffer quickly in B737'S.

### Copa Airlines customer review
I'm having the worst experience with Copa Airlines as I'm sitting at the airport. They don't know how to handle their business I will never use them again. First they mess up my flight back home and was told to standby - I'm now on waiting list for 12 hrs and still no seats assigned. My boyfriend and I had to take different flights in order to get home.

### Copa Airlines customer review
MEX-SJO-MGA-MEX. First time traveling with Copa and I was pleased with their product. All flights on time nice hub in PTY very nice catering good selection of beverages and friendly FAs. The planes (B737NG) have a good entertainment system on flights longer than 3 hours with overhead TV screens. They play a selection from four featured films and one sitcom which are updated monthly.

### Copa Airlines customer review
PTY-Santiago DR-PTY. Aero Republica recently changed it's brand to Copa Airlines Colombia. Professional flight attendants however very broken English efficient service. On return to Panama crew very patiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult business class customer. Pilots English very good and informative announcements. Both ways on newer Embraer 190 with 2x2 seating. Return plane had business class seating but coach service.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Had a straight through flight from LAX to Tocumen Airport in Panama. The seats were extremely tight and not comfortable for the length of flight. LAX to Panama one of the flight attendants was extremely rude and aggressive in her interaction with me and some other passengers. However the flight coming back the attendants were a little bit nicer.

### Copa Airlines customer review
LAX to Panama City return. I had purchased my airfare 3 months prior and when I checked in 3 hours early for the return they said they were bumping 25 people due to overselling and weight restrictions. They stated they were going to ask for people to give up seats for those who truly needed to fly. They only called for volunteers once and in Spanish so 2/3 of the flight didn't understand. They were rude and had no compassion. A few of the others that were supposed to have got bumped got on the plane. I had priority on the list and yet other people got on that were far down the list. Copa Airlines said they had the right to determine who got on the plane by their own guidelines - who they wanted to bump they bumped. They bumped me for a full 24 hours and the whole situation was unacceptable and appalling. Now I have a $400 voucher on Copa and I don't even want to set foot on the airline.

### Copa Airlines customer review
The staff at the check in at Santiago were the worst I have ever experienced at any airline. We had advised our connection would be close and arrived 80 minutes before the plane left and they had sold our seats! We had paid 5 weeks in advance and as a result were left for another 12 hours at the airport till the next connection had to pay penalty on change and airport tax and we were supposed to be in transit to Havana. As we are both in our late 60s and speak limited Spanish this was disgusting. The staff on the plane were great - disappointing that check in staff let them down.

### Copa Airlines customer review
IAD-PTY-SJO Canceled Due to Weather. We recently spent two miserable days at the Dulles (IAD) airport due to Copa's refusal to cancel their flights until the last minute. We even called and told them at the Dulles Airport was closed yet they refused to cancel their flight! During those two days we waited in long lines for hours with other confused passengers and were given the run around by both the Airport and Call Center agents regarding our flight status. End Result - given option to fly out 4 days later with no change fee. We gave up and went home. We have not received any compensation from the airline for meals we ate during the two days or for our flight which was canceled. Not to mention the fact that we lost our vacation package we had booked in Costa Rica.

### Copa Airlines customer review
MIA-PTY-LIM return. As a Onepass Gold Elite I was upgraded on all 4 segments - Check in and cabin crew friendly. Meals in business class are not impressive. All four flights on time or early. Seats in business class on a 737 are standard USA domestic first class seats. Miles posted quickly to my Onepass account. Price for the trip was very good.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Panama to Washington DC cancelled due to weather in DC. Copa arranged for a hotel complete with meal vouchers and then paid for dinner the night of the rebooked flight due to a very late departure time. Overall I was pleased with the manner in which Copa handled the already stressful situation.

Panama back to Los Angeles. The airline was supposedly rerouted via El Salvador for refueling reasons. The other passengers and myself did not know about this till on board. Also no blankets or pillows given out. Flight arrive 1.5 hours late. Not good at all.

### Copa Airlines customer review
Nine people in my group. Flight from Dulles to Panama to Santiago Chile. Flight cancelled due to maintenance. Sat in airport for 10 hours before assignment to an alternate flight. Arrived Santiago 12 hours late. Our group lost over a 1000 US dollars in hotel and tours. We asked for compensation. COPA Airlines refused to take responsibility blaming Dulles International Airport for the cancellation. Not even a free drink on the return flight. Next trip to Chile will travel on an alternate airline.

August 8 due to a mechanical failure arrived 5 hours late at Lima and had to show up for a business meeting same morning without any sleeping. September 18. Due to mechanical failure my flight from Buenos Aires to Panama was cancelled. Missed my connexion and arrived about 8 hours late to my final destination. November 13th was coming from Santiago Chile. Due to mechanical failure we went back to Santiago after two hours in the air. Missed my connexion again and arrived 8 hours or so later. November 20th was coming from Guayaquil Ecuador. Flight was OK but then my next flight to Costa Rica got 9 hours delayed guess why mechanical failure. November 23th. Flew to Bogota my luggage did not made it until next day. December 4th flight 491 delayed (two hours they say) due to yes mechanical failure. I already missed my connexion another 8 or so hour late in the best of the cases. This is the worst airline I've ever flown.

MEX-PTY-HAV return. Had to use them as due to the swine flu couldn't fly direct from Mexico. They were 737s so not too bad. The flights were full in both directions. Cabin crew were ok and food ok.
