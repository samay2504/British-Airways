### "impressed with the service"
Atyrau to Uralsk. I had a few meetings to attend in Uralsk and Aksai and was not looking forward to the 6 hour (or more) arduous taxi journey from Atyrau to Uralsk in +32C heat. I was recommend to use Qazaq Air as they now have a direct flight from Atyrau to Uralsk. I booked a return flight online, selected a seat, paid via card and my e-ticket was immediately emailed. On arrival to the airport check-in is simple and efficient. The flight was serviced by a Bombardier Dash 8 400 Next Gen aircraft which was very clean and the aircrew well dressed and welcoming. The flight (1h 10m) was very good with a surprisingly powerful take-off and flight landing 15mins earlier than scheduled. I certainly was impressed with the overall service and the value for money, I will be using Qazaq air again for direct flights around west Kazakhstan.

### "excellent and amazing value"
Qazaq Air from Almaty to Shymkent returning a few days later. Very good value considering tickets were booked less than 48 hours before departure. Nice new aircraft and smartly attired crew who were all tri-lingual. Baggage is included in the ticket price, and hand luggage was not strictly monitored, but since both flights were not full there was plenty of space in the overhead lockers. Check in at both ends was perfunctory and more or less wordless, but the flights were punctual, the return flight leaving 25 minutes before the scheduled time of 01:10, which was greatly appreciated by all on board. There was even a snack service with a good choice of drinks, all included in the ticket price. Another retro touch was the basket of sweets offered round before take off! I would definitely fly this airline again, and hope they expand their destinations. The only thing I would say against them is that at present their small fleet seems to mean that certain routes are served with en route stops - that added to the slower speed of the Q400 aircraft could make some trips around Kazakhstan quite arduous. Overall though, excellent and amazing value.
