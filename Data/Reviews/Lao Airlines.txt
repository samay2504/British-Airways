### "I haven't received a refund"
Booked the flight to fly on 16/8/19 but never managed to get on as it was cancelled due to bad weather. At first they announced it will be delayed until almost 2 hours later another passenger was nice enough to inform us privately that it's already cancelled and asked us to go to the airline office in the airport to collect our luggage. Not much to complain here as it wasn't their fault it was cancelled. But up till now I haven't received a refund after waiting for more than 4 months despite repeated follow up emails sent. Never book a flight with them unless it's dry season or you have no other transportation choice.

### "airline was above expectations"
Luangpraban to Vientiane. This airline was above expectations. The check-in opened on time. The staff where very helpful and gave me a seat with extra leg room. The flight left on time and arrived early. Will use again for sure

### "Would recommend and will fly again"
Pakse to Bangkok. Great legspace even for longer people (I'm 191cm tall). Friendly staff and snacks were served with drinks. Ride was smooth, plane clean and we were almost on time. Would recommend and will fly again with Lao Airlines!

### "Will definitely use again"
Vientiane to Bangkok. UPlane was clean; food was excellent (3 tuna sandwiches plus water and a second drink of either Pepsi, Coffee, Tea, Miranda Orange or more water). The crew made this flight excellent; for a start, there are 5 cabin crew in total which made a difference to the service time delivery. Every member of the crew smiled; were courteous; served ladies first to emulate their countries values and did a great service. One small minor point was that my seat back pocket was broken slightly in 11A. Will definitely use again.

### "plenty of leg room"
Luang Prabang to Vientiane with Lao Airlines. Surprisingly this aircraft for such a short flight was a jet. 20 minutes late to depart. There was plenty of leg room although of course no entertainment. It was surprising that before take off we were not instructed to put bags under seats and a lot of passengers had theirs in their laps. We were given a bottle of water and as we very quickly reached Vientiane with no problems.

### "no space at all"
Not Verified |  Savannakhet to Bangkok via Pakse. Lao Airlines is lovely. Unfortunately the seat pitch leave you with no space at all. If I ever have to sit next to someone on a flight, I will simply not fit into my designated space. If the seat in front of me decline their seat I'm in real trouble. They should really fix the seat pitch. Aside from that, Lao Airlines is great.

### "had to cancel my entire trip"
Bangkok to Siem Reap via Pakse. Cancelled a regular service flight with less than a week to go, and left me scrambling to find an alternative. Orbitz was no help, and Lao wouldn't even to respond to their requests. Had to cancel my entire trip, thanks to Lao Airlines.

### "smiles, professionalism and efficiency"
We took a short flight from Vientiane to Luang Prabang and service, at every touch-point, from check-in to arrival was delivered with smiles, professionalism and efficiency. A clean aircraft with ample leg room was another example of their 5-star service. If my experience was the standard that Lao Airlines delivers, then this airline will surely go places. Highly recommended.

### "that is cancelled too"
Luang Prabang to Siem Reap via Pakse. This airline has to get the award for the Best Unreliability. We had two flights booked with them - and obviously, part of a bigger travel plan in South East Asia. 10 days before our flight date, they inform us that flight number 1 is cancelled. But you can re-book. No kidding - but book where? Which date? Called them and in conversation asked what about flight 2? Oh yes, that is cancelled too! So when were you going to tell us? Oh sorry - will just send you email. They actually have turned our trip upside down! Best of all - wait 3 months to get your refund.

### "everything you could expect"
I flew Lao Airlines from Luang Prabang to Hanoi. It was a short one hour flight and the service revised by Lao Airlines was everything you could expect for a flight like this. They served drinks and a snack which was a tasty sandwich (although there was no vegetarian option). The staff were friendly. There was no in-flight entertainment, but that didn't bother me as the flight was so quick.

### "staff friendly and courteous"
Luang Prabang to Chiang Mai. First flew with them as Lao Aviation many years ago, that was a risky business but today, Lao Airlines is as different as chalk and cheese! Everything about them is different, the aircraft are modern and well maintained, with clean interiors, staff are friendly and courteous, on-time performance is goo, all in all a great little airline. Flew e sectors, an Airbus LPQ-VTE-LPQ and an ATR-72 to Chiangmai, as good as any other international airline. The catering is not as good as it could be but as most sectors are less than an hour, it is understandable.

### "cabin was very clean"
Luang Prabang to Vientiane. The flight took off 15 minutes ahead of time and arrived at Vientiane half an hour early. The cabin was very clean. The airlines only provided a bottle of mineral water. The crew were kindly. They smiled to every passengers.

### "The crew were kindly"
Vientiane to Luang Prabang. This was my first time to fly with Lao Airlines. The plane was ATR 72-500 which is a propeller driven airplane. It was quieter than other propeller driven airplane. The flight time was only 50 minutes, so the airlines only provided only a bottle of mineral water. The crew were kindly.

### "Very nice little airline"
Bangkok to Pakse return via Savannakhet. Very nice little airline, friendly crew, standard seats, decent snack for such short flights. All flights were on time, boarding was fast and efficient. Particularly good magazine with up-to-date and relevant information for such a small airline. Good prices as well.

### "service onboard friendly"
Flew Lao Airlines from Bangkok to Savannakhet. Prompt check in with friendly staff. ATR72 was clean but possibly a little old. A snack of chicken sandwich and cake was served. A cold drink or the great Beerlaos also offered and accepted. The flight is 1.5hrs and on landing great views of the Mekong as you cross over from Thailand to Laos. Service onboard friendly even with the cabin staff having to deal with Mr Bean. He managed to spill his drink over himself and 2 seats. Taken care of politely by staff. I would use Lao Airlines again as long as the price is right.

### "friendly and efficient"
Short 50-minute domestic flight from Vientiane Wattay to Oudomxay Airport and return with Lao Airlines. The flights were about 45 minutes late on both legs. There were only two flight attendants on this flights. They were friendly and efficient. The snacks and drinks were sufficient on this short flight.

### "service is pleasant and professional"
Check in at the Vientiane domestic terminal is quite chaotic. However, the on-board experience with Lao Airlines is generally very good. This is a very short flight but Lao Airlines serves water and a snack. Aircraft are quite new and service is pleasant and professional. Overall, it was a very good experience and I would happily recommend the airline.

### "good experience with Lao Airlines"
Domestic flight from Vientiane to Savannakhet via Pakse with Lao Airlines on the ATR72-500. Flight was on time and the aircraft was clean. Flight attendant was really friendly and helpful. Hot beverage was served on the Vientiane to Savannakhet leg. Locally produced fruit chips was served as well. Overall, a good experience with Lao Airlines.

### "I won't recommend at all"
Singapore to Luang Prabang via Vientiane. Nice aircraft and nice meal. However, during my holidays, I received a message that my return flight was cancelled due to no shown (which was totally wrong). I had to call my travel agent to understand that the issue was from Lao Airlines. Customer service from Lao Airlines didn't help me at all. Moreover, during the way back, a technical issue happened on the aircraft during the flight so we had to come back to the airport. Huge delay and not much apologies or explanation. Then, I contacted Lao Airline customer service to share my feedback, I couldn't get any reply and after investigation (and 5 mails), they confirmed that the issue was from the airline end due to technical glitch. If you want to travel without any worry, I won't recommend at all this company.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang with Lao Airlines. Wasn't expecting much from this short flight and was very pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and efficient. Drinks were provided as soon as possible. I even got my first Beerlao. The food was a snack of 2 apple slices, 2 grapes, and a bun filled with a piece of ham. The ham didn't look too appetizing to me so I ate the bread. Considering the flight was so short, getting anything more than pretzels was a surprise. The flight itself was on time and smooth. The only drawback was that the propellors are loud when you're seated near them.

### "very nice little airline"
Siem Reap to Vientiane via Pakse, Luang Prabang. Lao Airlines is a very nice little airline. Check in was friendly and quick for both flights, and boarding was efficient. The crew were gracious and served a snack and drink on each leg (two of the three legs were less than an hour). The seats were comfortable for a regional hop. The planes operated on time. Note, if you are travelling on the Lao Airlines flight from Siem Reap to Luang Prabang you will go through Lao immigration at Pakse -- so make sure you fill out your landing form on the short hop from Siem Reap. Also, at Vientiane the domestic terminal is very run down and does not have a proper luggage carousel. There is a rugby scrum to get luggage off the flight.

### "cabin crews were cheerful"
Flew Lao Airlines QV535 from Luang Prabang to Singapore on an A320. Legroom was decent, there was an PTV at each seats but somehow cannot be turned on. The seat was quite comfortable and cabin crews were cheerful serving the passengers. We were served a pack of fruit chip on LPQ-VTE sector and a full meal on VTE SIN sector.

### "seat was comfortable"
Flew on Lao Airlines flight QV536 from Singapore to Luang Prabang on an A320. The seat was comfortable and the legroom was adequate. Quite comfortable for a 2.5hours flight to Vientiane and followed by 40mins connecting flight to Luang Prabang. However, the meal still needs to be improved. Fruit chips were served on Vientiane to Luang Prabang sector which were delicious.

### "very friendly and efficient"
Flew with Lao Airlines from Hanoi to Vientiane in their A320. The aircraft is starting to show its age. They have a PTV installed at each seat but it was not working. No sign of the PTV controller to be seen too. Service-wise, the whole crew was very young and all of them were very friendly and efficient. A simple snack box consisting of a sandwich and water was distributed followed by a drink round. The seat was okay and everything was good for this short flight of 50 minutes.

### "seats were comfortable"
Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang using Lao Airlines, we had a nice experience. They used an ATR 72, with seat configuration 2-2. The flight was on-time. The cabin was clean and the seats were comfortable. As a full service airline, passengers were given a lot of choices of foods and beverages (beer, alcohol drinks etc). Before the flight, we had requested a special meal and they answered our request within next two hours. The ground staff and cabin crew were polite and friendly.

### "try not to take this airline"
Traveled Lao Airlines from Bangkok to Vientiane on Oct 18, 2015. Disappointed that the aircraft was ATR instead of Boeing. The seat belt lights came on and we were about to land, the cabin crew were seated as announced by the Captain but they did not stop two passengers from using the toilets. I will probably try not to take this airline if I have another choice.

### "plane was quite new, comfortable seat"
First time flying with Lao Airlines, and very impressed. Staff was friendly both at check-in as the cabin crew. The plane was just half full. Very smooth boarding. The flight departed before schedule time and arrived 25 min in advance. The plane was quite new, comfortable seat with a lot of space for the legs. We got served a little box with a sandwich, a piece of cake and an orange juice. Apart of that we got offered complimentary drinks. It's true that the flight was pricy, but it's normal considering that is the only airline covering the route, and only 4 times a week. I definitely recommend this airline.

### "I definitely recommend them"
First time on a flight to Laos. Impressed with the staff at Bangkok BKK airport. I flew to Vientiane on Lao Airlines on September 3, 2015. Not a full flight, plenty of staff at every point. At check in they were very nice. I had to come back and check in a small package because security wouldn't let me through with a tube of sunscreen. Very helpful in directing me to the post office where I could buy a small box, and let me check it in. After I got through security and immigration, at the gate there was a nice clean, quiet waiting area with a bathroom close by. No shortage of airline staff, all of whom were polite and nice. The aircraft is fairly new, ATR 72 prop plane, which seats 48 passengers. The plane was about 50% full. The seats are leather-like and as comfortable as you can expect. Seats recline some. Very clean plane. I did not use the lavatory. They board and disembark from the rear of the plane, so if you are in row 1, you are the last to disembark. The overhead compartments are very small, if you have a large backpack, they won't fit. The seats are a 2-2 configuration. I was in row 5 which was right opposite the propeller. After airborne, I moved to row 3 so I had a better view. Short flight, 1 hr 15 minutes, very smooth, all instructions were given in two languages - English being one of them. Could easily understand them. At a cruising altitude of 25,000 feet, my ears felt a whole lot better than on Airasia! Good landing, good service, good clean equipment, I would definitely recommend them. They did provide a snack, which surprised me. It consisted of a sandwich and water. My flight cost was $100, plus a $50 surcharge for fuel! then taxes, it came to $175.00 for a return ticket. For such a short flight it was a little expensive, and considering they are flying with such low passenger capacity, I am surprised the fares aren't more competitive.

### "lovely cabin crew"
Initially a bit skeptical as we had never flown with Lao Airlines before. Turbo prop aeroplane, with very comfortable seats and lovely cabin crew. It was a clean and modern plane. Much more economical than the other choice of airlines to Luang. Would recommend Lao Airlines.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Flew many times with Lao Airlines, mostly on time. The seats are comfortable and onboard service good. Just the tickets sometimes are expensive for very short routes, but competitors are missing.

### Lao Skyway customer review
SGN to Pakse and return. Will someone please give this airline the four star rating they deserve? Cheerful FAs on time departure and arrivals clean ATR 72s and Airbus 320s and free Beer Lao. Even the coffee was good on my flight into SGN this morning. I cannot recommend Lao Air highly enough.

### Lao Skyway customer review
VTE-LPQ in business. Check-in was slow as economy passengers used the business line. There was also no priority boarding for business passengers. On this very short flight we were given a cold towel served juice and a pack of chips. I didn't pay much more for a business seat as compared to an economy ticket so it was still worth it.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Flew Bangkok to Luang Prabang on 17th March. Flight on time clean new plane charming crew and decent snack on what was a short journey. All in all a very good experience.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang and a later flight on to Siem Reap. Both flights with great check in and on time. Tidy ATR planes with competent staff. Snacks on both flights and beer on one leg very adequate for a short flight. Great little airline.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang to Bangkok on board ATR72. After swift and efficient check-in the flight took off a couple of minutes early. Seat comfort was ok for so short a flight. FA were attentive and polite. A small breakfast in a cardboard box was offered consisting of a small sandwich fruit salad and drinks. All in all a decent flight experience.

### Lao Skyway customer review
From Vientiane to Bangkok. Aircraft was a new Airbus A320. The fare was good the check in smooth the service was excellent and a tasty fresh snack was served. The flight departed on time. Overall an excellent experience with a small but good quality airline.

### Lao Skyway customer review
VTE-LPQ-VTE on 9/7/13 and 10/7/13. Booked inbound flight was cancelled due to few passengers immediately got an e-mail notification and rebooking was easily done by phone staff was very helpful. A320 seemed well maintained clean cabin safety procedures were done correctly. On time flights even a little bit earlier. Easy internet booking e-ticketing.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang - Hanoi May 4th and very pleased with their service. The planes are clean flight attendants pleasant and provide a nice service. Their fares are cheaper than those of Vietnam Airlines or Bangkok Airways but their product is the same or even better.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Flew on several Lao Airlines flights recently and have nothing but praise for them. Clean new aircraft on time departures and arrivals and friendly cabin crew. Even got food and drinks!

### Lao Skyway customer review
Flew from Pakse to Luang Prabang in February 2013. Flight was on time with a snack provided. Friendly FAs and spotless cabin on an ATR72. Interesting mountain views as we approached L.P. Small but service superior to that of major airlines. Flying used to be like this.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang to Vientiane in a brand new Airbus with a spotlessly clean and bright cabin! Typically friendly Lao cabin crew were always attentive. Spot on punctual.

### Lao Skyway customer review
HAN-LPQ and return. Punctual departure arrival and efficiency on the ground. One of the world's best beers and a snack for free on a one hour flight. Spotless ATR 72 both ways and friendly staff. The background music during flight was however a wretched and annoying intrusion. 8 instead of 10 specifically because of the music.

### Lao Skyway customer review
VTE-LPG and LPG-HAN. First flight delayed 40 minutes due weather but second left and arrived early. A320 was immaculate inside and still felt new. Seats have video screens and phone connections. The ATR72 was comfy enough for a flight of just over an hour. During the short domestic flight a bottle of water and a small bun were served - adequate for such a short trip. On the flight to Hanoi the cabin staff handed out small boxes contain a filled roll slice of cake and a container of orange juice. Two rounds of drinks from the bar trolley were also offered. Given this is such a small airline with a limited network they did appear to try hard and I was favourably impressed.

### Lao Skyway customer review
I have flown Lao Airlines dozens of times over the past 5 years and have seen a real effort to modernize the fleet and provide quality service. There are many new ATR-72's as well as a couple of new A320's. A snack and a cold drink are offered on all flights and I've never had a problem. My only negative feeling is that they are now flying the A320's on the VTE-HAN route and it takes away many good memories and nostalgia of making the route some many times in the ATR.

### Lao Skyway customer review
We flew from Vientiane to Pakse. The flight left and arrived on time. The plane was cramped beyond belief. Only one carry-on bag fitted overhead. The other sat between us because it would not fit under the seat either. First time that has ever happened. Service was ok but the whole cabin was incredibly small - and on a full flight which ours was - that meant uncomfortable. If I ever fly this airline again I'll check that I am not flying on an MA60.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Pakse-Luang Prabang. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before the flight. As we were travelling in a small group (8) it took 30 minutes to get everyone checked in. As I was just about to do some last minute airport shopping we were called to go through security then immediately onto plane! The plane departed 1 hour early and had a total of 14 passengers all tourists by the look of them. If only all flights could be this easy it would be brilliant! Flight was smooth and inflight meal edible.

### Lao Skyway customer review
PKZ-VTE on the ATR72 aircraft was in good condition. Seats may get cramped for taller people. Food and drink were served including a chicken loaf sandwich a piece of cake and three pieces of fruit. The whole experience was pretty smooth check in was easy bags were quickly transported to the terminal. Only bad spot as the steep airfares but that's the case in general with the airline.

### Lao Skyway customer review
SIN-VTE return. Brand new plane (same plane both ways). Adequate legroom. Decent meal served. Flight attendants have a tendency to chat to each other while serving. In-seat PTVs but no headphones were given out so bring your own (2-pin) earphones. Both flights were on time.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Xieng Khuan/Phonsavan to VTE and VTE-BKK. Both flights on ATR 72. Typical ATR72 seating but plane has a few "Business class" seats in the back. Although not much difference we were happy to be given those seats on the VTE-BKK leg without asking due to short connecting time in BKK. FA's on both sectors very friendly. They assist by offering to take bigger hand luggage and store it at the back and this was available right after disembarkation. Snacks served very nice and drinks offered as well. Was surprised to have someone waiting in BKK with our names that escorted us to the Thai transfer desk.

### Lao Skyway customer review
SIN-VTE return. Lucky to have taken brand new aircraft on both flights. Sat at Rows 5 and 6 (the first 2 rows) of economy class and it was very spacious and comfortable with adjustable head rests and IVOD. The emergency exit rows were more spacious (rows 9 and 10). During take off and landing the cabin lights dimmed and turned blue. Easily the best A320 I have taken out of and into SIN. Food was normal and cabin crew service was good. Toilets were well maintained.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Chiang Mai-Luang Prabang. Flight departed on time. Smooth ride for a prop-jet. Served an odd but somewhat tasty snack on the short flight. Back of plane appears to be Economy as there was an undrawn curtain between areas and the seats in the back are cloth instead of leather. Otherwise the seat size and pitch are exactly the same in both areas. Economy seats exit the plane first so it's difficult to see the advantage of business seating (if that's what it was.) Friendly efficient flight attendants able to whip out meal and beverage service on a 30 mins flight.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang-Vientiane. Lot's of problems trying to use my foreign cards on their website. Super little airline with a modern fleet. Because it's Laos don't expect them to run to a strict timetable. They'll quite happily hold a flight (in my case for nearly 2 hours) waiting for late connecting flights to arrive and allowing those passengers to make their connections. It's a good consideration for the 5 or 10 passengers connecting and a minor inconvenience for the 40 waiting in the lounge.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang to Hanoi. I was impressed. The plane was modern seemingly brand new ATR. Food onboard was odd but nice and the crew efficient.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Always a pleasure to fly in the turbo-prop ATR's. Cabin crew always polite interesting snacks on the Vientiane- Hanoi run and the particularly delightful and free Lao Beer. Sometimes a bit difficult to understand the accent of the flight crew. Great at check-in and immigration due to the small number of passengers carried on the aircraft certainly avoids the long waits experienced on the jets. It's an interesting and most pleasant experience and I do not hesitate to recommend Laos Airlines to travellers on the short haul flights. Definitely my favourite way to go between Laos and Vietnam and for domestic flights within Laos.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang-Chiang Mai. Brand new ATR very clean and comfortable. Served strange chicken roll cake and soft drink or beer. Quite hard to understand the cabin and flight crew sometimes but felt very safe and departed/arrived early. Flights pretty expensive considering length of flight and general Lao prices.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Clean bright cabin Ho Chi Minh-Pakse. Going out we were served a box lunch coming back adequate snack box for early morning. Excellent service smooth check in and on schedule! I certainly would choose them over Vietnam Airlines.

### Lao Skyway customer review
LPQ-BKK economy. Modern aircraft but beware be early on the morning-flight to BKK. We left half an hour early! They told us to be there two hours before the flight and they were right! Complementary meal on the flight is somewhat funny - not sure if it was made of real stuff. Flight attendant was beautifully dressed.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Vientiane - Bangkok. The service was great modern ATR aircraft seats comfortable and flight was smooth. I received a complimentary meal and drink. Arrived little late. Would definitely fly again. Don't book on airline website very expensive compared to using ticket sellers in Thailand and Laos. Always compare first.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Vientiane to Pakse and Pakse to Vientiane and onto Bangkok. Flights were on time clean friendly my luggage arrived with me. They are little prop planes.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Vientiane to Chiang Mai - turbo prop plane very modern flight friendly staff - had a little snack - would fly again!

### Lao Skyway customer review
Short flight HAN to LPQ. Sparkling ATR77 with charming and helpful attendants. A tasty snack served.

### Lao Skyway customer review
I have used Lao Airlines in three occasions (Luang Namtha – Vientiane; Vientiane – Pakse; Pakse – Siem Reap) and enjoyed flying with them. The airplanes are relatively small but the limited length of the flights avoids any discomfort. They are also clean and with a funny design. Hostesses and stewards are nice and food is ok.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang to Hanoi. My partner and I were both unwell prior to this flight so weren't looking forward to it. Simple check-in friendly crew and smooth flight even when landing at Hanoi in a typical afternoon storm. The plane was a clean and new ATR.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Hanoi - Luang Prabang Luang Prabang - Chang Mai. Aircraft clean and modern. FA's friendly and professional. Although both flights were only about an hour long we were served a rather good meal and drinks.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Siem Reap to Pakse. Very happy with this flight. We were not sure what to expect but the plane ATR-72 500 was very clean with new upholstery and plenty of leg room. Not that leg room was an issue with only 16 people on board. The flight is 40 minutes and was on time a free snack was served shortly after take-off and a bottle of water which was good given the flight duration was so short.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Pakse to Vientiane nice new aircraft on time good service would be happy to fly again with this airline.

### Lao Skyway customer review
BKK-VTE - very clean cabin and good service very friendly and helpful staff. Departure and arrival on time.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Luang Prabang to Siem Reap on a 70 seat turbo-prop. The plane was clean service fine flight comfortable. Short stop in Savannakhet and arrived in Siem Reap 30 minutes early.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Vientiane-Luang Prabang return. Short flight only 40 minutes. First flight was flown with new ATR72-500. Nice leather seats. Very cold air conditioning. Serve only a glass of water (last time was cookie and water ) clean cabin with friendly crew. The return flight was by MA60 delayed about 20 minutes. The same served with a glass of water and serviced by friendly crews.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Bangkok-Vientiane. The aircraft was clean a new ATR72-500. Tuna sandwich with some choices of drinks. FAs were helpful and kind.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Vientiane to Hanoi route is a code share with Vietnam Airlines but if you book with Lao Airlines the price is significantly lower (though still a fair sum considering the distance). Equipment on this route was a new Chinese made Xian MA 60 aircraft. This turbo prop aircraft offers adequate comfort for its size in a 2-2 configuration throughout. Though there is apparently a business option on this route it is very difficult to see the benefit and indeed as the usual entry to the cabin is at the rear a seat at the back is preferable for many. Though the flight is just over an hour a reasonable box meal is served comprising a fresh sandwich (tuna on this flight) fruit a biscuit and a drink. In addition tea and coffee are served by the friendly crew. Coupled to this the check in process whilst entirely manual is reasonably swift Vientiane airport is small but pleasant and bags were delivered quite swiftly on arrival in Hanoi. My wife is not keen on small aircraft and said she would rather not fly this type of aircraft again; I on the other hand certainly would and can recommend Lao Airlines (who also have some jet ATR 72s in a fleet and no Russian antiques) to anyone.

### Lao Skyway customer review
Vientiane-Luang Prabang-Bangkok In November Both flights were on time and the aircraft were clean. Cabin crew were courteous and a small snack was provided on both flights. I would be happy to fly with this airline again.
