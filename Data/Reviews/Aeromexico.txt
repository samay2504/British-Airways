### "Very customer unfriendly"
I do not recommend this airline. They closed our gate without calling us, we arrived 18 min before the flight and were denied. The rebooking would have cost more than the original round trip for a one way ticket so we decided to fly with a different airline. Very customer unfriendly and the employees were rude

### "Very disappointing"
Not Verified |   Flew Premier Class. Sky Priority check in and a wider seat. That is about the extent of the benefits. No Clase Premier lounge at MEX (both closed for renovation). Not advised at thine of booking. Basic drinks and snacks offered. Very disappointing.

### "not customer friendly"
My past flights were friendly and comfortable. Now I made a mistake and switched my first and last names accidentally on my ticket. I called customer service, but they decline to correct a name change because it is a basic ticket. I understand if they want to prevent a ticket being resold, but here they are sticklers and not customer friendly. Cannot recommend.

### "incompetent customer service"
If you enjoy selecting your seats in advance, only for them to be deleted by the airline, then choose Aeromexico. If you enjoy sitting around airports for hours with absolutely no assistance, then choose Aeromexico. If you enjoy dealing with technology that never works and feels like it is 30 years out of date, then choose Aeromexico. If you enjoy paying for upgraded seats, only to lose that upgrade, then choose Aeromexico. If you enjoy dealing with completely incompetent customer service staff, then choose Aeromexico. Basically, they have been an incompetent disaster from start to finish, and absolutely zero help with problems caused of their own making. I will never fly with Aeromexico again.

### "Return flight had problems"
I booked London - Mexico City - London Business Class tickets. Outgoing flight gave us access to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow and it was excellent. Return flight had problems: could not check in or select meal on-line using iPad (their website only works on Microsoft). Though in transit, I had to go through immigration, baggage reclaim and security before handing back my luggage to be loaded on the flight home. Refused admittance to their Heineken lounge because I presented more than 3 hours early (just arrived on their flight from Cuba) Lounge was noisy, cramped and spartan when I did get in. But flight was good.

### "Very disappointed"
Flew from Mexico City to Toronto March 2025 , had very uncomfortable seating and was charged an Exorbitant amount to transport my golf clubs home ($190). My flight to my winter destination, the charge by WestJet was $75 for my golf clubs. During my flight I had requested an alcoholic beverage and was told they didn’t have any. Upon arrival in Toronto my golf club travel bag was basically destroyed. Very disappointed.

### "Badly maintained aircraft"
Not Verified |  Badly maintained aircraft for not very old in years. Broken seat, terrible paint work and dirty inside. Delayed flight. Be aware even if you pay for a bag they will force you to lose seat space (bag under the seat in front) so other customers who haven’t paid for a bag can put their carry-on in for free.

### "routinely misplace baggage"
The return flight to JFK was bad enough. We were traveling in business class and they ran out of meal and the entertainment system did not work and the place was old, tired and the seats barely reclined. We arrived at JFK at 11PM and one of our bags did not. It was difficult to find anyone at the airport to whom we could report the loss. In the end, they had me scan a QR code. The code uploaded a form for me to fill out only in Spanish. I do not speak Spanish and as we were in the USA I’d expect to be able to fill it out in English. The next morning, I called the number I’d been given at JFK for lost bags. Nobody answered. I left a message clearly stating that they should call me for an address to send the bag. I left 3 more that day and called the 800 # 6 more times. I spoke to 5 agents and was assured that the bag which was in Mexico City would arrive that day and would not be sent without speaking to me. Instead, it was sent to an address I’d put on the Spanish form (a commercial building) and left with a night security guard (not a doorman). I was already home and not in NYC so I did not get me bag for another week. I had to replace some things in it. Now AeroMexico will not pay one cent for any of the items I had to purchase. The bag had a medical device in it that we could not replace. AeroMexico keeps saying how sorry they are, but does not accept responsibility as if this is all normal. So I guess it is and that they routinely misplace baggage. They said they’d have paid for the items that may have been needed if I was for example, a Mexican person arriving in NYC. But as I was in my home country, they had no obligation to do so even as they never called me as promised, had me filling out forms in a language foreign to me, and somehow managed to misplace a bag on a direct flight. I surely will never fly on AeroMexico and hope anyone reading this won’t either. My bag was marked “priority" as we flew business class. So imagine how coach baggage is treated? Or how Aeromexico deals with any problems. Be careful, I booked on Delta and this was a code share.

### "we would highly recommend them"
I recently flew with Aeromexico for the first time with my husband and 4 year old son, and we had an exceptional experience. From checking in to landing, the customer service was top-notch. The flight attendants were attentive and kind. We were incredibly surprised by the meal we got when we were expecting just a snack. It consisted of yogurt, fruit cocktail, eggs with bacon and vegetables, or waffles, accompanied by a drink and bread. On our return flight, we enjoyed a satisfying pasta dinner meal. The flight entertainment system was also impressive, offering a wide selection of new movies, TV series, cartoons, and music. We appreciated the free earphones, which allowed us to enjoy the entertainment options without disturbance. The aircraft's cleanliness was notable, with spotless bathrooms and a well maintained cabin. Overall, our experience with Aeromexico was outstanding, and we would highly recommend them to anyone. We look forward to flying with them again in the future.

### "sheer disregard for the customers"
Not Verified |  The level of incompetence and sheer disregard for the customers is beyond unacceptable. I feel utterly scammed and insulted by the treatment I’ve received over what should have been a simple process: booking and using a plane ticket. First of all, the customer service is a complete joke. It’s clear the staff has no clue what they’re doing. Every single person I spoke to gave me different answers, none of which resolved the issue. Secondly, nothing short of a scam to leave people stranded with no help and forcing to get new ticket is dishonest and predatory. And then there’s the absolute disaster with no accountability, and not even a hint of an apology. The audacity to leave paying customers stranded with no support is appalling. The airline is a disgrace. The way you treat people is shameful, and the fact that you’re still in business blows my mind.

### "not worth the hassle"
Not Verified |  A cheaper flight than the decent airlines was not worth the hassle annoyance and stress making an overall first and last experience with this airline. We upgraded to business class after a misleading offer. Don’t do it. It’s barely second class. The premier lounge is little different to a cheap overcrowded and hot cafe. Given how much money the country makes from tourists they could do so much better.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced from an airline. I was travelling with my boyfriend and our small dog in the cabin from Puerto Vallarta to Medellin. We get to our gate and right before we are scheduled to start boarding the flight is delayed two hours. Already off to a bad experience. Then before we board the flight the awful employee tries to zip tie my dog's bag shut! I have flown on over 100 flights with my dog and NO airline has ever done this-Even the stricter ones. Their website says they are "dedicated to providing the best possible in-flight experience—and that includes for your beloved pet. Aeromexico's accommodating rules and friendly customer service ensure you safe and stress-free travels" - this couldn't be further from the truth. I tried to argue with the heartless employee and he would not listen to a word i was saying. He kept on repeating himself and shouting "if you want to get on the flight" I told him what if I need to give her water or an emergency happens and he said it's not his problem! Why would they even pretend on their website that they want to ensure the best possible flight experience. Complete lies! Luckily he didn't zip tie is properly and I got on the flight. I would not have gotten on had he zip tied it shut like he intended to. To make matters worse on our flight back from Medellin to Puerto Vallarta - they don't allow us on the flight. We had all of our dog's medical records in order and when we landed in Medellin we got an ICA form and she emailed me the form to show when we leave Medellin. When we arrive at the Aeromexico desk to check in they tell us we need a new one to leave the country. I have travelled to 15 countries with my dog and have never needed such a thing. No one told me I needed a new one on the way out. The ICA office was unfortunately closed while I was trying to check in and the women at the desk were so unhelpful. They said there's nothing we can do and didn't even try and help. They almost seemed to be getting pleasure out of our misery. So it's 11pm and we quickly find a place to stay while we figure out our travels. I call Aeromexico and the guy helps me book new flights that I have to pay for - they don't give me any discount for the inconvenience. But he does say he will transfer the credit for my dog so I don't have to pay for her. Right when he is booking the new flights the call gets disconnected. I try calling back and I wait on hold for over an hour! It says I am the only caller in the que. Someone finally answers after 1.5 hours and it's a new person who doesn't see a new reservation for me and is trying to charge me for my dog AND doubles the whole cost of the new reservation. I told him about my previous conversation and he just keeps repeating there's nothing he can do. I will never fly with this airline again and you should not either. Absolutely terrible people working for this airline.

### “That seems rather ridiculous”
Not Verified | Aeromexico states that travelers in business class (aka Premier Class) can preselect meals. This is only true for flights departing Mexico City. The airline also states that passengers with special dietary needs can reserve a special meal regardless of their point of departure. This is only partially true. For example, special meals such as diabetic meals can only be ordered for flights longer than 9 hours. That seems rather ridiculous. If Aeromexico were really interested in accommodating passengers wants and needs, it would allow the meal selection on all its flights, especially for passengers who have dietary restrictions.

### "Worst airline I had to deal with"
Worst airline I had to deal with, yet. My flight has been cancelled, the proposed replacement was just ridiculous. I asked for a refund, but never received it. Their customer service is as bad as the airline itself. Except for some standard blurbs, asking you to wait for some mysterious reason, nothing else comes from them. My first, and for sure last time I bought a flight with them.

### "closed the gate already"
The first and last time I’ll fly this absolute garbage excuse for an airline. I had a flight departing from MEX at 9:50 so just to be safe I arrived at the airport at 7am. Checked my bag and proceeded to wait around for nearly 2 hours for them to display a gate. I go to my gate to make sure I know where it is and then I head to a lounge so I can sit for a bit when I suddenly get a notification that the flight is now 10 mins delayed on the AMX 2.0 app. So I think, ok, the flight is leaving at 10 now, I’ll go to the gate at 9:30 and when I arrive they tell me there’s no delay and we closed the gate already. They literally let someone in right in front of me and told me “no, doors closed 5 mins ago and the list was already send.” So, you’re telling me you’re going to send a notification that the flight is delayed and now departs at 10am and then proceed to close the doors 40 mins before this new departure time? The employees at the gate looked inconvenienced that I was even asking them questions, they call over air control and he tells me they can offer me food vouchers and put me on the next flight that leaves 7 hours later. Sorry, the app doesn’t work sometimes.” Are you kidding me?! I’ve been a frequent flyer for over a decade, and I’ve never experienced anything like this before. The hate I have for this airline is palpable

### "the flight ticked every box"
Boarding was done efficiently by zones with nobody trying to push in. The aircraft was a brand new 737-900 max and it looked pristine. The PE seats were comfortable with sufficient pitch. It was a short flight and we were offered a choice of soft drinks or beer. Each seat had its own screen and the aircraft was equipped with wifi. The cabin crew were pleasant and efficient. The aircraft seemed remarkably quiet and both takeoff and landing were smooth. Overall the flight ticked every box.

### "worst I have seen in Service Dog policy"
Not Verified | Aeromexico is the worst I have seen in Service Dog policy (not Emotional Support Animals). If your disability is not apparent they will treat you and your service dog like a passenger traveling with a pet. They have no respect for the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and they will not have respect for you. My experience with them is based on a flight I bought from a US airline's website from Los Angeles to Mexico but the US airlines was partnered with Aeromexico. In the end I was not allowed to board on the Aeromexico flight due to documentation they asked (my service dog's health certificate), which is not required by the Mexican government for any cat or dog traveling to Mexico from the US. It is important to know that though passengers purchase a flight with a US airline and your US flight is partnered with Aeromexico they will not respect the service dog policy your US airline abides by and Aeromexico will ignore the approval of documentation the US flight provides you. Aeromexico will ask for your service dog documents again, as if you bought a flight from them, and make you believe it is a Mexican government requirement. In speaking with Mexican government officials responsible for inspecting animals arriving from all over the world, they were surprised Aeromexico goes to the extent of not allowing passengers on a flight without a health certificate when they don't even require it from US visitors with service dogs and/or cats or dogs to Mexico. My thought is why not just simply state on their website, "As Aeromexico we do not abide by ADA regulation and we do not accept any animal, service dog or not, to fly with us from the US to Mexico without a health certificate. This statement would be a whole lot clearer to US airlines partnering with them, and save time of US flights making you go through all the process of uploading documents to approve your service dog on the flight-which Aeromexico won't respect anyway-and passengers with service dogs will not even think twice of purchasing a flight with them to Mexico.

### “staff super friendly”
Flew MEX-OAX round trip in business. Quick and friendly check-in both ways, with access to Aeromexico’s Salon Premier at MEX. The lounge was busy but I got a seat and had a decent breakfast. Again, staff super friendly. Flights both ways were on time and, despite a flight time of just 40 mins, the cabin crew managed to serve a pastry and coffee en route. WiFi worked perfectly. I’d fly with Aeroméxico again.

### "they denied me travel"
I must clarify that I have never actually set foot on an Aeromexico flight -- they denied me travel using the ticket that I have successfully paid for through their own website. This is all due to their poorly communicated and disastrously (un)documented "payment validation policy", the details of which I will explain below. Soon after purchasing my ticket, I received an email stating that my "reservation...[is] subject to validation of the payment method" by showing the original form of payment. Admittedly, the email is appropriately titled "IMPORTANT NOTICE", but the lack of any indication of the possibilities for such a "payment validation" PRIOR to payment was already a failure. Of course, I did not have the original form of payment (a physical credit card) with me, but the email NEVER described the repercussions for failing to present it (ie. being denied boarding). Furthermore, the email lacked emphasis on the specific requirement for the original credit card (rather than any credit card) just worsened Aeromexico's ineptitude in communication. This is especially problematic given that I (and I believe the vast majority of travellers) had never encountered the requirement for payment validation, and even Googling in hindsight does not yield meaningful results, including from Aeromexico itself. Upon discovering such an issue at check-in, it was crystal clear that Aeromexico also completely refuses to recognize and provide solutions for almost inevitable issues resulting from their vague communication and lack of transparency. After being informed that I cannot use the ticket under my very own name and "successfully paid for" (their words), I suggested using another credit card to pay for the ticket again. This was simply repeatedly denied with "the system is unable to do so". Then, I suggested simply replacing my originally purchased ticket with a completely new one that I will purchase on the spot. However, the ticket was deemed unable to be cancelled and also unable to be replaced with a new ticket in its place with no specific reasoning. Lastly, I requested Aeromexico's ticketing staff (rather than check-in staff) to be contacted about this issue, but this was again denied, and I then had to personally discuss the issue with Aeromexico's call center, to no avail. At a more foundational level, the existence of payment validation in the first place is already incomprehensible. Their OWN website, through which I completed the payment, has already verified the credit card using 2-factor authentication. Ultimately, this whole matter just seems like a moronic excuse for deeper issues within Aeromexico's operatios, such as overbooking their flights (one reasoning for denying me repurchasing the ticket was that the flight was 100% full). At least the refund was claimed to be automatic and to the original form of payment, but this was the bare minimum of their obligations given such a despicable, arbitrary demand before a passenger who booked the flight 11 days in advance can use their very own ticket. Of course, I cannot discuss the other aspects of Aeromexico due to being forced to have never been on their flights. Nevertheless, I feel confident in suggesting everyone else to avoid Aeromexico for their potential of whatever other unfaithful practice.

### "zero customer service, zero empathy"
A TOTAL NIGHTMARE! I was trying to book a flight for me and my son with Aeromexico, so I did select the dates, and the itinerary after submitting my payment information the website failed to load and I got a yellow message saying "Oops something went wrong, please try again. , so I FOLLOWED the instructions I got from the website thinking "well, probably this credit card rejected the transaction", so I did try once more planning to use a different credit card when I was at the point to book the flight I noticed that the morning scheduled I wanted wasn't available anymore for the date I previously selected so I thought: "well, maybe THIS is the reason why the page failed to load a few minutes ago, this flight is no longer available", so I continued with the process and I tried to pull up the calendar for the day before to see if that morning schedule was available and indeed it was, so I selected this flight for the day before I had previously selected on the failed transaction. So I filled out all my personal info along with a different credit card's information just in case and this time, the transaction was completed correctly! so I went straight forward to my email to check the summary of the purchase and BOOM! I found there were two email confirmations with 2 different itineraries! Aeromexico CHARGED ME for the first transaction that didn't go through even though I got an error message on the website during the payment process!! Aeromexico charged me for that first transaction and of course for the second one that went through correctly but the problem is that they CHARGED ME TWICE FOR A FLIGHT FOR THE SAME 2 PEOPLE! I've been calling them, submitting tickets, and numerous Emails and they have ZERO EMPATHY! they keep on saying that was my fault that the website failed and they can do NOTHING FOR ME because that error wasn't their fault, they could help me for "duplicity" but the dates don't match, so my issue won't be considered duplicity therefore there's nothing they can do to help me. I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY to explain that it WAS NOT a duplicity issue, the website failed and even though I got the error message it charged me without me noticing! I've been dealing with this for almost 10 days already and at this point, they are just ignoring my Emails, they are closing my tickets without even responding to any of them when I call they say that I could get a reimbursement but a ticket should be submitted and when I submit the ticket these agents immediately close them without giving me a reason or anything! They don't respond to my messages anymore. THE WORST PART OF THIS is that I decided to book with Aeromexico because my original plan was to book with Volaris but some friends told me that it wasn't a good idea to go with them, instead, they said I could book with Aeromexico which was more secure and comfy so I followed their advice and I've canceled my flight with VOLARIS the very same day I booked it and within 3 business days, THEY GAVE ME A FULL REFUND FOR MY PURCHASE!!!! WITHIN 3 BUSINESS DAYS!!!! and here I'm still begging for mercy with Aeromexico so they can put on my shoes, have a little empathy, and understand what I'm trying to say so I can get my money back but nobody seems to listen/pay attention to what I'm saying, zero customer service, zero empathy, no sense of urgency NOTHING! With the responses they have given

### “no compensation at all”
Not Verified | Avoid this company, don’t make the mistake buying a ticket because it may be cheaper. 11 PM - First they delayed the flight 2 hours, then just no information, I’m there at the airport with husband and 2 kids, no compensation, no drinks, nothing. Just waiting and waiting. Then at 2 AM they said the flight is cancelled because the "cabin crew" didn’t show up and announced a new flight for the next day at 6 PM. They dont want to give us more information, and no compensation at all. Let's see if we really get into the 6 pm flight.

### "I have no complaints"
Not Verified |   I have no complaints, especially since I’ve usually had to fly American out of the worn-out Terminal 1. But aside, I found the staff at MEX to be polite and professional; and English-speaking though I used Spanish. The in-flight amenities were quite good, with a light meal served to Economy passengers both ways on this flight. And again after usually flying American out of this airport I appreciated especially the seatback IFE system. Needless to say for my flights to ORD out of MEX Aeromexico will be my go-to.

### "flex fare is basically a con"
I purchased a flex fare with Aeromexico. Whilst the flight itself was very comfortable, efficient and on time, I have to highlight how the flex fare is basically a con. After purchasing the flex fare which is openly advertised as allowing changes to flights without additional cost or fees, changes to the flight at any time, or to even change your flight if you miss it ... this was my experience. I needed to change my return flight from June 15th to August 2nd. The online form to do this straight up didn't work - it constantly gave an error. So I called. They could only give me one flight option for the date and quoted me a price that was not only larger than my original (return) ticket cost but was double the advertised price on their website. When I challenged them on this they acted confused. So I asked for a refund - and they started getting funny about it telling me that I needed to fill out a form online. So I filled out the form. They sent me an email telling me that I needed to call for the refund. So I called again - and they told me I needed to fill out the form again. They have utterly refused to be of any help whatsoever on this issue and have effectively stolen my money.

### "don't have an answer or adequate compensation"
Lost my suitcase and won't compensate what I had to buy. After they lost my luggage, I had to buy a few things and although I was being told at the airport to keep the receipts to be refunded, I’m now being told after weeks of chasing them that the refund would be 30e which is way under what I had to spend because I had nothing. After 25 emails & 1 month after, I still don't have an answer or adequate compensation.

### “No refund after three months”
No refund after three months. My flight from Mexico City to Tulum was cancelled like a week before the flight. I was supposed to get a refund in maximum three weeks but I still haven‘t! They often don‘t respond to E-Mails and calls are way too expensive from my country! They kept telling me they paid the money to the booking agency but that‘s not true!! They don‘t care at all about the customers!

### "miscommunication and misinformation"
In reviewing the experiences encountered with this airline, it becomes evident that there are serious shortcomings in both service provision and transparency. The initial disappointment arises from the discrepancy between advertised prices and the actual costs incurred by passengers. While online booking platforms such as Expedia present enticing rates for checked baggage, the reality at check-in counters deviates significantly, resulting in unexpected financial burdens for travelers. This lack of consistency between online representations and in-person charges not only erodes trust but also places undue financial strain on customers. Furthermore, the airline's technological infrastructure appears alarmingly unreliable, as evidenced by recurring website malfunctions during crucial check-in periods. This not only inconveniences passengers but also raises concerns about the airline's ability to maintain essential operational functions. Customer service encounters, unfortunately, do little to alleviate these concerns. Instances of miscommunication and misinformation, such as the failure to register baggage during phone transactions and the inability to rectify errors without substantial inconvenience to passengers, highlight systemic deficiencies in service delivery. Moreover, the inconsistency in pricing practices, as witnessed at the Cancun airport, further compounds frustrations, with passengers being subjected to arbitrary charges due to system limitations.

### “a terrible airline”
Not Verified | Aeromexico is a terrible airline, they’re always late, they don’t even open up in the mornings so they unexpectedly say that you’re flying Delta Airlines and not Aeromexico which is really confusing. They’re unhelpful and just overall a terrible airline company. Do not fly with them ever.

### "it was a huge mistake"
First time using this airline, but it was a huge mistake, my luggage arrived to SFO without one of the wheels and I have been trying for a month to get a refund of the new luggage and the wrapping I had to paid at the airport to get my other flight because there was no one of Aeromexico at SFO airport to assist, they do not answer the calls and emails take forever. They just want to refund 75USD when just the wrapping was 20USD and I will have to assume payment for things I wouldn't even have to pay in a foreign country where the currency is much higher if they would treat luggage so badly.

### "a waste of money"
Rather a waste of money. The carrier cancelled my flight and offered me a ridiculous replacement. Thus, I had to cancel the flight. Since 2 months I keep asking for the refund, but the only respond I receiving are some standard texts about the request being processed.

### "policy about flying with pets"
Aeromexico belittle me not knowing the policy about flying with pets. I bought second seat for my second pet but I wasn't allowed too. It didn't say specifically on the website that I couldn't do that. Their customer service is not existing and didn't change second seat to pet cargo. They wanted me pay more for pet cargo and no compensation for second seat. Called customer service but no help and they don't have real department for customer service. I tried work something out with Aeromexico but they just said no and charge me over $600+ . Just fly with different airline.

### "had a great experience"
Not Verified |   I flew Aeromexico premier class which is first class and I had a great experience. The staff was kind and they had nice outfits. We had a variety of Alcohol choices and peanuts or chips. First class seats are huge and this flight was delayed by 30 minutes but I didn’t care. I paid for checked baggage two days before my flight and no issues at airport, wifi was free but very slow and you can only use it for messaging apps.

### "such terrible customer service"
We were stuck in Tijuana airport for 12 hours due to a delayed flight. I had paid for upgraded seats for my family of four. They rebooked us on a flight, but we didn’t get to keep our upgraded seats. On the way back from Cancun we sat on the airplane for three hours, because the pilot called off sick and they had to find a new pilot. When I got home, I emailed Aeromexico to ask for a credit for our troubles. Their website says they refund up to $700 for delayed flights. Not only did they not give me money for the delayed flights and the time we spend at the airport sleeping on the floor. They also refuse to give me back the money I lost for the upgraded seats. When I asked for my money back, they gave me a voucher worth about $200 and it has to be used within 30 days. Why the heck could I fly Aeromexico ever again with such terrible customer service.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Our return flight was cancelled. We were automatically rebooked for the following day without any options given. Later I find out by their staff at the counter that I should receive compensation for charges incurred for the extra day. However that same staff charged me a ridiculous amount for checking in bags. I was under the impression that I’d get courtesy check in due to our troubles with the airline. How silly of me. When trying to get assistance I received none. Called customer service multiple times and received no guidance, no empathy, no compensation. All I wanted to hear at the Aeromexico counter was “we are so sorry for the inconvenience we have caused, let me make it up to you.” But no. They even told me that they rebooked without charging me. The nerve of these people. Customer service is non existent here. Do avoid. I always feel like like I get ripped off in Mexico. Worst airline I have encountered. Avoid at all costs.

### "we have not got a penny from them"
We were due to fly to Mexico City from Heathrow airport on the 31st October on business class. Our last destination was Guadalajara. Just as we arrived to the airport we were informed that our flight had been cancelled. We were given a voucher to stay the night at the Hilton in Terminal 4. We were told that we would get dinner. Much to our surprise when we got there we were informed that our food had been served and the restaurant was closed. We had to pay for dinner ourselves. After a couple of hours trying to sort out a flight out for the next day. We were offered the same flight the next day. We asked why we could not go on the earlier flight, we were told that it was full. We had to spend all day in the airport because our flight was at 22.30 pm. However, we went to London for a few of hours. Luckily the hotel kept our luggage. As we were making our way to the hotel to collect our luggage we received a text letting us know that the flight had also been cancelled. We were not only furious but also distraught. We were going to a wedding and we were not going to make it on time. We went to the Aeromexico desk the employees at the airport were excellent. They told us that they had been cancelling that same flight, for the last 4 days, because the aircraft had a mechanical problem. We could not believe it. They knew the night before that our next flight was not going to depart and yet they gave us that flight. We got to Guadalajara 2 days later than planned. We arrived to the wedding but only because they put us on a British Airways flight. I guess the people in the desk saw how upset we both were and they took pity on us. When we got back on the 10 November we started the process to get compensation from them. We are on the 3rd of March and still now we have not got a penny from them. My understanding is that you get 600 euros per cancelled flight. As far as I am concerned, we are owed for 2 flights, the refund of the first 2 nights of the hotel in Guadalajara that we paid and did not use, 2 meals for the 2 nights that we were stuck in London and the lunch and tube to London (since we were stuck in the airport) and we had to do something. We have been arguing with them for the last few months about this but via email. Apparently, you can't speak to anyone if you want to complain. I’ve tried 3 times. Of course you can speak to someone if you are buying a business class ticket! We have had to email and this is also shambles. The latest they asked me to send a picture of my credit card, which I refused. I got an email back to say that I had to otherwise they were not going to process the payment. Reluctantly I sent it but the name on the card (my married name) does not coincide with my passport name (my maiden name). So now this is another problem. That was the card that I paid with and I used my passport to make the booking. The last email I got from the woman that I am dealing with is that she will close the case at the end of this month if I’ve been paid or not.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |   My girlfriend and I recently flew from Toronto Pearson to Guatemala City via Mexico City. At the gate at Pearson, we were informed that the flight was too full to fit all carry-on baggage and that we could check our carry-ons at the gate for free. We normally wouldn't mind doing this, but because we were connecting and then also not staying in Guatemala City, we were leaving for elsewhere in Guatemala, we preferred to keep our bags with us just in case they got lost during the short layover. However, we were also informed that if the overhead storage bins were full, then our luggage would not be moved down below but instead be put on a different flight to Mexico City the next morning. Again, we were connecting and then still not staying in Guatemala City, and we were not given any information about when our luggage might arrive in Guatemala City, only that if we didn't check it at the gate, we risked having it fly out the Mexico City the next day. Completely unacceptable to ask customers to make decisions of whether or not to check their bags at the gate or risk having them not even be on their flight at all, especially for those who are connecting elsewhere. I have never heard of another airline doing this instead of just putting any additional baggage down below on the same flight. The reason we were given was that doing so would delay the flight, but we also still left Pearson 90 minutes late. Overall this was the worst customer service I've experienced from an airline at the gate. Definitely avoid this airline if you don't want to risk not having your luggage with you for at least part of your trip!

### “Avoid this nightmare”
Not Verified | AVOID this airline at all cost. They advertise a basic fare like many other airlines. However, unlike other airlines, what they don't tell you is that their basic fare is a stand by fare. We had a reservation for a family of four--parents and two kids (3 yr and 10 yr old). Aeromexico first declined to assign us seats during check in as they have oversold, and then forced us to fly in two different flights. As a mom, I had to travel with my two kids in a new country without their dad. Aeromexico refused to pay any compensation for splitting our reservation. They sent their terms and conditions page which states when they deny seats due to overbook, they have to first advertise to get volunteers with offered compensation (which they did not), and no where it mentions they can split reservation and force a family to travel in different flights. However, any litigation needs to be done only at Mexico city which they are very well aware that most passengers wont be able to follow. In short, AEROMEXICO is the WORST Airline and uses malpractice to inflate their profit. Avoid this nightmare.

### "Non existent customer service"
Not Verified |  Non existent customer service. The flight itself was fine, if you run into any hiccups you're screwed out of your mind. They only speak Spanish, and customer service will not get back to you. Their website is a mess for any claims. You will run in circles. Only fly with them if you only have carry on luggage. If you have checked luggage you're rolling the dice.

### "they canceled my return flight"
Everything terrible, avoid this airline, the bathroom was really dirty I was the first one to use it, that says that they didn’t clean it from the last flight. They give you some nuts as the food service. They don’t respect the zones then is the same if you are skypriority or not. The Aeromexico premier lounge in Mexico City, is horrible with horrible food and service, also is really dirty. I didn’t catch the plane from Mexico City, and they canceled my return flight without returning me my money.

### “waste of my time”
Not Verified | Both my connecting flights from Mexico City to Cancun and back got cancelled and given long layovers, waste of my time when I should've been relaxing on my vacation.

### “Uneventful flight”
Uneventful flight on new years. Check in could have been better organized - no point having zones if there is no coordination. Crew were in a good mood and mostly helpful. Snack was ok but not much. Entertainment system had an error so that all movies and tv show only played spanish audio. This had also happened on the first flight.

### “service was great”
Of all the North American carriers I have flown (okay there haven’t been that many, but enough), AeroMéxico is one of my favourites. The equipment is modern, well-maintained and clean, and the staff are friendly, bilingual and efficient. Our 4 ½ hour flight from México City to Toronto was over before we knew it. The legroom was normal in comparison to other international airlines and the food was actually quite good – the service was great.

### "pleasurable, although very short flight"
What a pleasurable, although very short flight. Queretaro (QRO) airport even had skybridges. Although the crew didn’t have time to pay us much attention the brief exchanges we had were very pleasant. There was no time for a meal/drink service, but at least we enjoyed the 2 x 2 seating configuration with okay legroom to make the flight an brief comfortable one.

### "absent crew on both flights"
Everything was just average. The ground staff at London and on the return at Mexico were more pleasant to deal with than the absent crew on both flights. Food was bland and the same in both directions, chicken or pasta, then eggs or pancakes (which were literally 2 dry pancakes). Only see the crew at meal times - no walk through with water or soft drink outside of dinner service so 11 hours with minimal effort from them. Some of them also came with a serious attitude problem. IFE was decent. Next time would go BA.

### "surprises of over selling"
The flight to Mexico City was good, quite wondered why this airline has such bad reviews. However, our return was an extremely stressful situation. We performed our check in 23 hours prior to our flight. We printed our boarding passes (seats also assigned!) just to show up at the gate and to be told that "our boarding passes are not valid and we are not in this flight". Don't fly Aeromexico unless you can take surprises of over selling and to be lied. $$$ is more important then customer satisfaction.

### "such a disaster of an Airline"
I have never experienced such a disaster of an Airline. 16 hrs stuck in the airport with no solutions and no staff cared. After decided to call it a night because of no solution it took me 2hrs to get my luggage. Then supposedly my luggage was lost until I gave them cash and it suddenly appeared. I booked a flight with another airline and left the following day. Now the battle began to try and get a refund and compensation for the hotel I had to book and meals. I submitted my Refund today and already gave me a date of revision for the 21st of this month.

### "will not give a refund or a credit"
Total scam. They cancelled the flight. And will not give a refund or a credit. Sent no alerts for cancellation. Our entire plane was stranded at airport with no flights out for 2 days. They have no customer service their chat is a robot and their phone numbers the people don’t care at all. Like I don’t think you could pay someone to care less. They said their flights are non refundable. No credits or refunds allowed even if THEY cancel due to THEIR plane having mechanical issues. Their customer service literally said don’t book Aeromexico because their rules are strict. You will be stranded and have to pay 3x as much for a new ticket with another airline.

### "we got a bottle of water"
From check-in to deplaning the staff were always friendly and helpful. Ground services were smooth, and the in-flight team did the best they could on the short-haul leg from Querétaro to Mexico City as pleasant as possible- at least we got a bottle of water. For the price and ease of connections a definite do again. Gracias

### "as pleasant as possible"
From check-in to deplaning the staff were friendly and helpful. The transfer was a long walk, but easy, and the in-flight team made the long-haul from MEX to YYZ as pleasant as possible. The meal was as you would expect on today's in-flight service menus, For the price and ease of connections a definite do again. Gracias

### "wanted us to pay for extra luggage"
We were traveling with an infant. When booking the ticket it showed clearly that the baby was allowed one baggage of 25kg, while the parents could travel with hand luggage only. When we checked in however, this didn't show and at the counter they wanted us to pay for extra luggage. I showed them the screenshot and it suddenly was no problem anymore. I am disappointed with the airline.

### "waiting months and months for a refund"
I purchased two refundable tickets on November 6 2023. 4 hours after I requested the cancellation and a refund. I called by Phone and sent an email to Customer service. They responded that it would take 15 Business days for my refund and that I would see the money in my account. I waited for the time they asked but there was no Money in my account I called my Bank no money was transferred. I emailed them again But the answer is still I have to wait. I see from reading other people's reviews in a similar situation to me, are waiting months and months for a refund that never comes.

### "Do not trust Aeromexico"
Not Verified |  
Booked a flight from Mexico City with my 2 dogs. Both are dobermans, called Aeromexico to confirm they accept the breed. They told me “of course”. Proceeded to take a payment of over 2000 dollars for me, my partner and our dogs. We gave a full description as require - including the colour, breed etc. Today my partner calls them to verify a small detail and they agent asks surprised to know that there are Dobermans on the booking as they actually don’t allow them? They changed the policy the day after we booked it and no one thought to inform us so we would of gone to the gate to be denied booking. We have booked connecting flights based off of this flight as it was the longest one so will now have to change our entire itinerary with no apology, solution. Do not trust Aeromexico.

### "I have been constantly lied to"
My issue is with customer service and getting a refund for the money they have taken  from my account, they have double charged me for a ticket and owe me almost £1000 when they assured me the first charge wouldn't get taken as it was pending and then took it anyways once they made me pay for the ticket again. They keep telling me its going to be refunded in 5 days, then 15 days, then 30 days, its now been 3 months. They have stolen my money and ruined my holiday to Mexico. I have been constantly lied to and have had to call and email dozens of times. I've even gone to the desk at both airports and been told to email as there was no one there that could help.

### "does not care for their customers"
Ok first we never flew with Aeromexico because we were never given a chance. Before booking with anyone I thought Aeromexico would probably be the best for customer service. Big mistake! Our trip was 19 days away and well we were super excited because we were going to see my husband's sister and our nephew who is one. I shouldn't say excited but we were finally going to see him because he is very sick from cancer and they don't think he will make it to his second birthday. Anyways, I always have a habit of checking on international airlines because they always change the time or date. I couldn't check because it said I didn't have a confirmation number or flight number. We had two stops before getting to our destination so I had to call Delta first. Delta said Aeromexico cancelled our flight. I then called Aeromexico and they said I called and spoke Spanish to cancel our trip and get a refund, mind you I always ask to speak to someone in English because my Spanish isn't to great. Then I ask to speak to a supervisor and they said none were available. Next day I called to speak to a supervisor and a agent was going to investigate what happened. He than calls me again the next day and says that I sent them an email asking for a cancellation and refund, another lie! I ask for someone higher than him because this was upsetting already. Still no one. The next day he calls me back and says, it wasn't me who sent the email but my 17 year old daughter. Another lie! I think they just went down our itinerary and picked a name to blame. Our dog was supposed to go with us because I couldn't leave her here for so long. I paid almost $400 dollars for her. They said they don't refund pet fees and airline fee etc. I lost almost 1,000 dollars because of Aeromexico. I had to cancel our Airbnb and they didn't give us our money back. This airline does not care for their customers.

### "Awful experience"
Awful experience. Sat at 31A, staff told me I had to move to 30B as they needed this seat for staff. Super rude, never offered me food or drink. Never again.

### "have awful customer service"
Both our flights were delayed. The outgoing flight to Mexico City made us sitting on a hot runway for more than two hours. The delay on the way back to the US made us miss our connecting flight to our home destination. We needed to cover a hotel room on our own for the night while we waited for our rescheduled flight home. When we asked for a clarification and compensation, the company flat out denied any responsibility. Don't book with Aeromexico if you can avoid it. They can't get you there on time and have awful customer service.

### "Never fly AeroMexico again"
Not Verified |  
When we got to the airport and they charged us $150 to stow one bag. We were appalled by the cost but was left with no choice. When I checked my account a couple days later, they had charge us twice for that bag and then added a third charge of $100. So, $400 for 1 bag. After submitting the concern which was very difficult in itself, they responded 5 Weeks later. Asking for more information. I sent requested info. They came back and asked for even more info and one of the requests was an image of the credit card used to pay for the bag. That didn't sound right, and I contacted my banks fraud department. My bank advised me to never send an image of a credit card to anyone. So now my bank is investigating this. I doubt if we will ever get our money back. Lesson learned. Never fly AeroMexico again!

### "customer service is the worst"
Their customer service is the worst, especially when you are in a foreign country. No one to help and the only option they have to go purchase more tickets. After purchasing 1st class tickets, our tickets were canceled and no was was able to help us, not even the airline. Unbelievable, especially since we had insurance on our tickets. Ended up spending the same amount again to catch a flight home for 4 people. Disgusted! If I could leave 0 stars I would.

### "middle seats in different rows"
I just tried checking in with Aeromexico from Cancun to Mexico City and they gave my wife and me middle seats in different rows (I didn't pay for specific seats). Then I tried to change our seats and pay for "comfort" seats (same as economy but further forward) and was bombarded with attempts to sell me First Class seats (same as economy but further forward). When I paid for the "comfort" seats the payment "failed" and then I tried again and the exact same seats were over double the price! The price increased by over double as soon as my payment "failed" for unknown reasons, and the comfort seats were now more than the upgrade to First Class! We'll just sit in different rows to Mexico City.

### "the supervisor was very rude"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I ever had in a flight. The ticket we purchased for my baby son was sold twice to another person. Instead of helping us to accommodate and find a solution for our 1 and a half year old son seating, the airline officers and a supervisor blamed us when we were already seating before the flight and accused us in front of the passengers of passing security with the wrong reservation (which of course never happened) even though we showed the seat and ticket reservation with our son's seat number. Specifically, the supervisor was very rude with me, my wife and father in law that is an elderly person in front of the passengers. Unfortunately, me and my family won't be flying with this airline again, the disrespect and distress caused by the supervisor and his crew was not excusable, some passengers even said that they never saw such a disrespectful treat of someone with a baby. At the end, we decided to remove our baby's chair and take our baby on our lap, as we thought, the baby was stressed and cried most of the flight (that was the main reason we purchased the seat in a first place). The airline hasn't refunded the purchased seat yet and haven't apologized on the incident, or the fact they sell same seats tickets to different people

### "frustration and disappointment"
Words cannot adequately express the level of frustration and disappointment I have experienced with AeroMexico. My recent trip to Salina Cruz, Mexico turned into an absolute nightmare due to their abysmal service. Not only did they lose my essential surfboard bags, but their customer service has been shockingly unhelpful and downright rude. Despite numerous attempts to reach out for assistance, I've been met with nothing but callous indifference and even had the audacity of being hung up on. It's been almost a month since my bags went missing, and AeroMexico has shown zero urgency or accountability in resolving the issue. This experience has soured what was supposed to be an exciting surf trip, and I implore anyone considering flying with AeroMexico to think twice. They've demonstrated a complete disregard for their passengers and their belongings.

### "no respect what so ever"
Not Verified | I booked them through Chase Travel Portal. Unfortunately, I missed my initial flight from LAX to Mexico City due to a check in error. I checked in on the Aeromexico app, and received my seats AND the boarding passes. I get to the airport and Aeromexico said I didn't check in and explained that I had seats 11D and 11E, but was unable to pull up the boarding passes on the app because it was too late already. An Aeromexico employee put my girlfriend and I on a standby list and after 8 hours, we were able to get on a flight to Mexico City. Upon speaking with numerous amounts of Aeromexico agents and Chase Travel agents, I was guaranteed a flight back since I did take a standby flight from Aeromexico. I wanted to confirm once I landed whether this was true, and unfortunately, Aeromexico said it wasn't the case and that I would have to buy a whole new ticket. I contacted their customer support and I haven't received anything regarding that. I had to pay $800+ just to get a last minute flight back to LAX. Aeromexico is absolute trash and I saw this with no respect what so ever. I review places on Yelp all the time and I NEVER give a bad review, but Aeromexico wants me to be stranded in Mexico City without giving me a flight back home.

### "wasted money for a flexible ticket"
Not Verified | When I purchased flights, for an additional fee I was offered a more flexible option for changing flight dates. I took the inbound flight, then thought to return a week later than planned. When I tried to use it, the change fee was more than the round ticket itself. I went to the airline website and purchading an one-way ticket was even cheaper than changing the date. In my case I wasted money for a "flexible" ticket.

### "failed to meet even the most basic standards"
If you ever consider flying with Aeromexico, I strongly advise against it. In my personal experience, this airline has demonstrated a lack of professionalism and reliability. One of the major issues I encountered is their frequent changes in flight areas without providing sufficient means for passengers to stay informed. The availability of screens displaying these changes is limited, and there is a notable absence of announcements in English or bilingual employees to assist non-Spanish speakers. During my journey, which involved a stopover in Mexico City on both the outbound and return flights, I encountered a distressing situation involving my 87-year-old grandmother. Aeromexico staff separated her from the rest of our party, despite the presence of completely vacant seats on one of the flights where we could have easily been accommodated together. When we approached the employees for assistance, they claimed there was nothing they could do, leaving us feeling frustrated and disappointed. Regrettably, the most appalling customer service experience occurred on our return journey, as well as on our way to our destination. All members of our travel group contracted a parasite during our trip. As we were boarding the flight, the airline initially announced that they would wait for a passenger in the bathroom, only to abruptly change their decision and close the doors, leaving us behind. It is common for groups traveling together to prefer not to leave anyone behind, and this unexpected action forced us to endure a gruelling 12-hour wait at the airport. Even after spending approximately $580 per person for the return trip, we encountered further rudeness from the Aeromexico staff during security procedures. Considering the involvement of three countries in our travels, one would expect a certain level of customer service, but unfortunately, Aeromexico failed to meet even the most basic standards. I strongly recommend exploring alternative airlines and investing your money elsewhere for a more satisfactory travel experience.

### "Absolute sham of an airline"
Not Verified |  Absolute sham of an airline. They offer me an upgrade to Business class - I paid £3100, they took my money and then I ended up in Main Class - I spoke to them and they stated that it was a system error and they would refund me - that was over 7 days ago and still no refund so going to have to make a claim with my Credit card. Awful to deal with - you keep getting fobbed off, I'm convinced they lie to you or make things up just to get you off the phone. I've also noticed that there a Facebook page set up for disgruntled customers who have also been scammed by the Business class upgrade offer. Stay clear of these cowboys.

### "before boarding they downgraded us"
Not Verified |  We had business class tickets in row 2. Just before boarding they downgraded us to middle seats in coach. They lied that they switched aircraft’s and there weren’t enough seats now. Not true. They downgraded us because someone probably paid more money for their tickets so they sent us to the back of the plane in middle seats. We flew 8 hours out of our way to get to Mexico City for this business class flight only for them to take it from us! They are the worst. Do not fly with them ever.

### "cut and dry sort of unfriendly"
It was a 48 hour trip. Our flight got cancelled in one of the connections, FCO-CDG-MEX-PVR, in Paris. We overnight there. Then, the next day, the flight was cancelled again and I was lucky to get on the next available flight. Arrive in Mexico City MEX, late and missed my connection to PVR. One more night at a hotel. The following day I flew to PVR in economy class because business class was full. Arrived in PVR but my luggage did not. It arrived 2 days later. My review is not about the delays but the bad service of Aeromexico crew and ground service. Aeromexico flight attendants are cut and dry sort of unfriendly. They are not rude but they seem that they are not happy doing what they do. During the flight, some of the pursers talk too much. I like to have 1J seat and I constantly hear they chit chatting among themselves. Another annoying factor is that as a typical Mexican Airline, they love sponsors. Ground personal, are the worst. They seem all so unhappy that I try to do my check in at home and not face them. Watch out, if you have a problem, then you are in trouble. Seldom they find solutions but try to make it more difficult for you. If you are going to connect in Mexico City Airport, do yourself a favor, choose the fastest connecting flight, I think it is one of the worst airports I have been and don´t rely on Aeromexico Lounge. It is a lounge for anyone that pays a fee to get in. It is uncomfortable, crowed, noise and there is seldom any food to eat. If you are a frequent flyer with AM, you probably already realized that their mileage programe is a hoax. If you want to exchange for a business class ticket they ask in a R/T trip in some cases almost 1 million points. In economy if you are luck with 300,000 points. Do you know how long you will take to accrue that many miles? Aeromexico rips you off and gives bad service. I fly 3 to 4 times a year to Europe alone and I barely have 300,000 miles plus some transferred from my Amex.

### "Won't fly again with them"
I made the purchase (and paid the difference) for a direct flight Madrid - Monterrey which was modified by Aeromexico with stopover in CDMX. Modified for the second time delaying the scale an hour 17:55 hrs , 3rd 18:00hrs, 4th 20:40hrs, fifth time 23:10hrs, and finally being canceled. During my 8 hrs waiting time, two flights left for Monterrey in my scheduled hour contradicting the reason that the changes were due to weather and we were told BY SPEAKER that we would wait for the staff coming from flight 118 cd juarez, which would land at 20hrs. Making it clear that there was a lack of personnel to take off. The service given by the employees of customer service is very slow, it is deficient and it is incredible that they have so little ability to solve simple questions. Having no refund response, hotel, accommodation, your answer "check customer service", we dial during the stay at the airport and tell us "that is solved at the airport, not with us", you go to the sales module and tell us "here we only sell tickets, we do not know anything about hotel or refunds, call by phone", we approach another employee and his answer is "send an email" that is no one can help you solve anything personally (And don't even think that by email they'll solve something) The bags were delivered to us with all the contents inside wet, not damp, soaked, could squeeze clothes. On the return flight from Madrid, there were no water bottles in the seats, as there are regularly. For a 12 hrs flight. Won't fly again with them. Choose Iberia!

### "This airline is truly awful"
This airline is truly awful, and truly incompetent. They don't care. And they're unscrupulous and disingenuous, aka crooks. I flew to Vallarta from SFO via Mexico City. Outbound was an hour late. They changed my connection flight despite our arriving on time for me to make the original connection. Had a four hour layover as a result. All of that was inconvenient, but within the realm of airline travel in our times. The real issue was the return. I checked in online, had my boarding passes, arrived on time and was ready to board. When I checked in at the desk, they told me I was bumped because of a "credit card problem. The roundtrip had been fully paid for and posted two months prior so I knew that was nonsense. I argued, pleaded, used logic and my fluent Spanish. I called for the manager all to no avail. Ten stoic employees observing my rancor, nothing. Long story short, I had to buy a one-way return on another airline (no way was I going to reward bad behavior by rebooking with them). Another day in Vallarta on the weekend and another night of hotel are not the end of the world, but my nerves and usual motto of "assuming good intentions" in people took a hit. It's tragic that the flagship carrier of a nation of otherwise good and honest people should be marred by the actions of the few. Luckily, I had paid with credit card that treated me like a customer and refunded me 50% of the fare, but still. Caveat emptor.

### "Everyone keeps passing the blame around"
We had a multi city booking through Expedia to travel in Aeromexico. We had to change one of our travellers tickets, when we called them they didn't offer a penalty fee, didn't say because we booked through Expedia we need to call them, they sold us a whole other ticket for $700. We've now been back and forth with their customer service, Expedia and the insurance we purchased and no one can help us? Everyone keeps passing the blame around and no accountability. Not to mention their customer service in general on the phone or at the airport is garbage. Not only have they haven't given us any type of partial refund, but they did sell the seat to someone else which they have denied. Yet, the seat was taken on our flight back. So no refund, they charged my mother a full ticket and sold her seats.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  AeroMexico is one of the worst airlines I've ever had to deal with. They have a horrible customer service experience. We called them regarding our flights being canceled and they refused to give us other options. They also refused to give us a refund. When they refused to give us a refund, we asked for a future credit, which they also denied. I will never book any flights through AeroMexico as they don't try to work with you in any shape or form for any cancellations or reschedules, even when things were on their end to fix. For us, our flight got cancelled due to volcanic activity in Mexico City, which I understood it was out of everyone's control. But the fact that they were unwilling to give us a credit / refund / alternative flight it's just outrageous. They essentially just kept the money. Please do yourself a favor and never book through them. Not worth the fight.

### "hope I never get near Aeromexico again"
A thousand words are not enough for me to describe how horrible it was for me and other hundreds of people the experience we had with Aeromexico during the weekend of May 20 and 21st - 2023. Apart from the fact that Aeromexico lost my luggage (then LATAM recovered it), I had to wait in line for literally 6 hours so I could ask "where's my bag?". Other people waited for much longer than 6 hours, I was a lucky one. The, when I finally got my turn in line the woman tells me it's not their fault and that I have to look for my luggage again elsewhere or talk to LATAM (which was responsible for my next flight). That weekend while other companies were also having trouble because of some unfortunate climate events, Aeromexico was the only company which made people wait for more than 30 hours so they could take off. Their website is trash. Their app is trash. And based on other's reviews it seems they don't invest enough in tech so they can offer a better and more automated service. Not to mention the fact that they offer flights in international airports and when you ask their staff if they speak english they just shake their head and turn their backs for you. I hope I never get near Aeromexico again.

### "So many people left stranded"
Worst Airline in the World! Flight was delayed from Mexico City to Guadalajara by several hours and then once we finally got to Guadalajara, the second leg of the flight to Tijuana was eventually cancelled. We were left stranded in Guadalajara for the night without any meal vouchers or hotel accommodation. I had to pay for a hotel and taxi out of pocket. So many people in the airport were left stranded and Aeromexico staff were not helpful at all. They were giving so many mis-information. I called to submit a claim for reimbursement for the hotel and taxi and they keep giving me the run-around and just keep telling me it's not their responsibility. I have had similar delay experiences with British Airways and American Airlines in the past, but these airlines have at least reimbursed me for costs incurred because of the delay OR at the very least provided free accommodations.

### "the worst for customer service"
Not Verified |  Aeromexico is the worst for customer service. They changed our flight to include an overnight stay in Mexico City without offering any help in getting accommodation. When I made inquiries, they made all types of excuses and would not take responsibility for their actions, let alone offer any help whatsoever. Also, they refused to transfer our luggage in Mexico City, so we had to carry it with us to and from the hotel. The staff at their call centre where condescending, rude and abrupt. The same with the staff at the airport. As well, our luggage was damaged and we were lucky that the contents were not damaged/destroyed.

### "worst ground staff in Mexico"
Aeromexico has the worst ground staff in Mexico. Bring your ear plugs, for, there are so many announcements, so irritating, but, the worse is when you are watching a movie, they stop it and slaps you an ad from one of their sponsors. The flight attendants are in most part 90% apathetic. Food average. I choose always 1J, sometimes i regret , the flight attendants talk all night when they are not working. If you are a frequent flyer and want to use your miles, good luck, for a business class R/T you would probably need aver 800,000 points. Ground servers in Mexico are not pleasant at all. It seems that they either don´t get paid well enough or just don´t like their jobs. Avoid any problems.

### "Will never fly this airline again"
This is the worst airline I have ever experienced. We spent an extra 60$ to get better seats at check in and we ended up missing our connecting flight and they gave us awful  seats even though we paid to get good seats! The staff was super rude. Not to mention we missed our flight because they didnt get us there in time. Our returning flight was delayed for nine hours. There were other returning flights that were earlier but they didn’t put us on any of them. We bought these tickets five months ago. Will never fly this airline again.

### "cancel all of our return trips"
This airline doesn’t even deserve 1 star if you ask me. Myself, along with a group of friends had booked a round trip from Vancouver to Peurto Escondido with a connection in Mexico City. After booking our trip, our flights had been changed at least 4 times leaving us with a 6 hour layover in Mexico City which none of us were happy with, as we had planned on arriving in Puerto earlier that day. Because of this change we all decided to book a flight that would get us to our destination sooner, therefore missing our connecting flight. We assumed everything was fine as all of us continued to receive emails regarding our trip home with Aeromexico, we were even able to check in for our flights online. Little did we know, because we had decided to miss that connection in Mexico City, Aeromexico decided to cancel all of our return trips with no notice. We found this out because a friend of ours had left a day early and gave us a heads up so we called the airline. They were able to reactivate some of our tickets but 3 of our friends were forced to pay another $1200 to buy seats on the same flight back that they initially had. They also do not put the correct gate on the boarding pass or light board which makes for a very stressful airport experience.

### "seldom see good service like that"
Not Verified |  We had a problem with our original flights with another airline to Mexico and couldn't miss our hotel reservation. Brian at Aeromexico not only went above and beyond to put us on new flights, he made sure our baggage fee was waived and if that wasn't enough, hand delivered our connecting flight boarding passes when we already boarded the first plane. Although the flight was expensive, you seldom see good service like that!

### "it was a good flight"
In all it was a good flight. The seats we were saying sitting at the emergency exit the seats were quite bad. I’m a bit overweight person have a big tummy and I could not get into the into one of the washrooms only one washroom I could get in on the right side. Why do they make these washrooms so small the doors that’s very sad. Overall, we had a great flight, and went to next flight to Aguascalientes.

### "staff were extremely rude and unhelpful"
Not Verified |  We had a terrible experience checking in with Aeromexico in Mexico City. We bought our return flights with WestJet with whom we have free baggage. The staff at Aeromexico stated that they were unable to verify the free baggage claiming that they don’t have a partnership with WestJet. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful, lacking customer service skills.

### "Do not fly with Aeromexico"
Aeromexico changed my flight twice before our scheduled departure date and our outgoing flight turned out to be an overnight layover. They offered no hotel accommodations and wanted to send my luggage to the final destination. After 2.5 hours of waiting at our 1st arrival, we recovered our luggage so we can wash up before our next flight. Again, no accommodations were given or food vouchers. Our flight going home, same thing - 7 hour layover and no food vouchers to eat while waiting at the airport. We were forced to buy the overpriced food at the airport both times. We lost 2 days of vacation because Aeromexico changed our flight! Also, the WiFi did not work on the flight home and the plane was much smaller, making it a very long and uncomfortable ride after waiting 7 hours at the airport. Do not fly with Aeromexico. They do not care about their passengers. They want to squeeze as many people into 1 plane as possible, even if it means changing your schedule.

### "never travel through Aeromexico never again"
Not Verified |  Worst Mexican airline I have ever traveled. I bought my tickets 8 months before and they overbook the flight and we couldn’t board that airplane after waiting 4 hours or more in the airport with two little girls that were tired and starving. Plus the time dealing with them to give us another option to flight to Los Ángeles, at least they pay the hotel and meals for us for one night. The next day the flight with a delay of 2 hours. Horrible service, we will never travel through Aeromexico never again.

### "why do I pay for seats and not receive them"
First and foremost, why do I pay for seats and not receive them, it's a waste of my monies to pay for a service and not receive what I've paid for. I've been on this airline 4 times in 2 years and it still the same bad service and not getting what I paid for. The aero app is useless, never works and never has my downloaded pass, I go from second class row 5 to the back of the plane - stealing money they are. Parent Delta is just as bad, same as above, then they act as if it's all new to them and never heard of issues. Also unless you apply for credit card you get no skylines, I've been four times and haven't received.

### "Not worth the stress"
Got bumped because flight was overbooked. Travelling with 5 children I asked them to offer compensation to others as we wanted to fly. Very unhelpful staff. Second time this happens. We now have a 8 hour wait and will arrive at destination after midnight. Wait time at priority line was more than one hour. Never again will i fly them with my kids. Not worth the stress not knowing if you get on despite their setvice inflight is ok.

### "Never again will we fly Aeromexico"
I’ve flown with Aeromexico before and had a great experience which is why I felt confident in inviting first time flyers. I cannot stress how disorganized, unprofessional and non accommodating our experience was. We planned a month in advance, bought out tickets, rented a car and airbnb and all fell through because this airline decided to give our seats to other people and we were only 5 amongst 20 other people experiencing this problem. The employees there to assist ended up crying and screaming on how overworked they were while we had to wait for a 7 hour delay. Everyone had a stressful day and it’s understandable that things may go wrong but the level of disregard to the guest was shocking. Never again will we fly Aeromexico ever again.

### "Terrible service from Aeromexico"
Not Verified |  Terrible service from Aeromexico and from the person in charge at the Benito Juárez airport, Terminal 2. The airline sells a ticket from Colombia to London with a connection in Mexico, they force the passenger to buy a new ticket because when going through immigration the passenger arrives a hour before the flight and they don't allow you to board because you can't check your luggage. It is an abuse, how can they sell a ticket with a connection in which there will not be time to board the flight. Neither the lady in charge at the airport nor any aeromexico employee offered any alternative. Pésimo servicio de aeromexico y de la persona que se encuentra encargada en aeropuerto Benito Juárez, terminal 2. La aerolínea vende un billete desde Colombia a Londres con conexión en mexico, obligan al pasajero a comprar nuevo boleto porque al pasar por inmigración el pasajero llega una hora antes de vuelo y no le permiten abordar porque no puede documentar su equipaje. Es un abuso, como pueden vender un boleto con una conexión en la que no habrá tiempo de abordar el vuelo. La señora encargada en el aeropuerto ni ningún empleado de aeromexico ofreció ninguna alternativa.

### "terrible and dysfunctional airline"
Just such a terrible and dysfunctional airline starting with customer service. The app is terrible, service has no interest in being of service, business class is nothing of the sort. Stay away.

### "FA's on Flight 616 were nasty"
I will never fly on this Airline again. From the terminal at AAA, and the entire flight reeked of Incompetence. Terminal 3 is a joke, similar to small airlines like Air Tobago. There were many Mexicans flying to Canada, and having them fill out their immigrations forms, was done one at a time, not in a bunch explaining. 40% of the AC/USB hubs in this disgusting terminal are DOA. Finding a vacant one is like looking for an oasis in the Sahara. Then the flight: I've never had Flight Attendants who were surly, but several of the FA's on Flight 616 were nasty. I have flown on almost every carrier in N. America, but have never been told that the washroom at the front of the plane was for First Class Only. So the rest of the plane, had two use 2 washrooms, with broken fixtures. No toilet paper, no paper towels, no soap. I was served a salmon pastry, when I told them I have a seafood allergy, they snarled at me to be quiet.

### "fly with someone else!"
My brother and I traveled for a music festival. One of Our flights were delayed, which caused one of our luggage to be left in the states couldn’t get a hold of customer service so we had to get an Uber back to the the airport which was over an hour away. We had 4 luggage and all four TSA approved locks were broken open and to our luggage is damaged. We had to replace one going to replace. Total cash value was USD$ 760 After 7 months I was only refund $ 203.81. Avoid the hassle and fly with someone else!

### "I cannot have a refund"
Charged for an incorrect booking/flight. I was in Mexico City airport at the ticketing counter. I asked for the earliest return flight to Phoenix. The man asked for my card and charged my card, then gave me the ticket. I asked why the destination was Houston TX and not Phoenix. I proceeded to ask for a refund or to have my flight changed. He said he could change the flight, after about an hour of waiting he now says that the flight cannot be changed and I cannot have a refund. I went over to volaris and bought a return ticket without issue. I cant believe these people can get away with scamming their customers. I contacted customer service but after months of the run around this is the message I'm finally sent "I am sorry to inform you, I wasn't able to complete your request due to the fare purchased is not refundable and any clarification of purchase made directly at the airport has to be completed there. I apologize for the inconvenient, It was an honor to assist you. Cordially, Customer Care Representative" Never do business with this scam company.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
I’ve had two flights with Aeromexico and both times: Despite being told I would receive wheelchair assistance: none was provided. Nor was any accessibility assistance provided unless I went over their head and contacted the airport or the other airline I was flying with. On this last flight, my hip partially dislocated due to all the strain of managing things myself — something that I was trying to avoid. I’ve encountered issues before as someone who only needs mobility assistance in certain circumstances, but I have never encountered this level of ableism or neglect while flying. Flights were delayed by more than an hour. On the return flight this resulted in me and my companion missing two connections and having to travel an extended route to return home. Despite requests when booking, checking in, and at the counter, they were “unable” to seat me next to my travel companion even when we had more expensive seats and were willing to downgrade. Customer service hung up on me twice and chats failed for hours until I was finally directed to someone who instantly disconnected when I informed them of the gravity of the situation. They have refused to talk to me on both Facebook messenger or WhatsApp (they use both services for chat messaging) and their phone lines either don’t answer or I get hung up on. If you have any kind of disability or impairment, please avoid this airline at all costs.

### "Attitude is terrible"
Attitude is terrible, not only on board services, my luggage was damaged and there are few holes on my backpack and the staff at baggage claim asked us to find the on duty supervisor. The female supervisor was annoying when reached to us and ask "who asked you to find me"? She found some staff to do the baggage claim application but returned around 5 minutes later and just irritating us by poor attitude saying ‘actually these are ONLY VERY minor damage compared to others damaged luggage, it is not totally tear apart you cannot use it.’ What kind of service is this?

### "the same uncomfortable seats"
Premier class or whatever they call it is a complete waste. They give you the same uncomfortable seats and only put a bulky divider in the middle seat that they won’t allow you to remove. Especially if traveling as a couple it’s better just to have economy and sit next to each other.

### "Just disgusting service"
My family planned a trip to Oaxaca end of October, flight was delayed 4 hours caused by the mechanics of the plane. The delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in Mexico City. They then had no flights for more than a week that they could get us on. They'd take us to Mexico City and no guarantee they'd be able to get us to our destination! They wouldn't give us a refund at the airport, told us we needed to call the customer service! So I have, 3 times! Each time they tell me they can't help and for me to email. That I can only get a refund if I email. I've emailed 3 times since October and never get a return email. Don't fly Aeromexico. They don't value customer service or their commitment to get you where you paid them to take you! Just disgusting service!

### "Such a bogus airline"
Not Verified |  Such a bogus airline. I paid an extra $100 for an economy plus upgrade for extra foot space. The unfortunate result is that our IFE screen were not functioning. I asked the flight attendants to fix it and they claimed to restart but didn’t. I had to ask 3 times and they started to ignore me. Unbelievable lack of customer service. The customer service email address is a joke too. I notified them of my experience and they offered to provide a voucher for the equivalent amount for the upgrade, but didn’t provide one after asking 2 times. This is such a joke airline and I cannot recommend this at all. Lack of professionalism and accountability is unacceptable.

### "really bad experience"
Terrible experience with Aeromexico in Mexico City, flight number AM 378, on December 28, 2022. First of all they don’t even board by zones, and second thing I was on zone 3 along side with my wife I paid for the seats I was in. I wasn’t even ask to gate check my bag and one of the staff member just pulled me aside and took my bag without asking what zone I was in and than proceed to throw the tag at me, really bad experience with Aeroméxico will not recommend.

### "all was as expected"
In spite on all the negative reviews I have to be quite different. All worked well, in time and with professional attitude. Some might dispute food, seat comfort etc. But for the 3h+hrs flight I think that all was as expected.

### "Never flying with Aeromexico again"
Not Verified |  Very bad communication from Aeromexico customer service. Our flight was delayed from Vancouver to Cancun resulting in losing one day of our vacation time. On contacting Aeromexico customer service regarding the matter, I got a reply after exactly 1 month that they cannot do anything about it. Customer rep name is Alfonso Urbina Valdez. Extremely rude and inconsiderate agent. Not only this, our 4 year old was assigned a separate seat from his guardians. Upon requesting airport staff first they said they cannot do anything about it. Are these people insane or what? I would give negative reviews if I could. Never flying with Aeromexico again.

### "do not recommend the airline at all"
Not Verified | The worst customer service I experienced with an airline!!! I experienced a very bad costumer service on the same day of my flight. I first decided to upgrade my cabin from economy to business. While talking to the sales executive on the phone and when realized that I will not be refunded for the seats I already selected and paid for in AM Plus I decided not to upgrade. After the call I received an email (confirmation) from Aeromexico and then I realized my initial seat selection which I paid for them 1 month in advance where canceled! Checking on the app, I had to repay to select the seats while those seats I chose initially were not available and even worse no 3 seats next to each other to accommodate my family! Flying with a 2-year-old I had no other choice to upgrade! Apart from the very bad experience I had onboard in the business class (from the quality of the food to behavior of the crew) now the airline is refusing to pay the seats which were canceled by their sales executive! Its an absolute scam and zero customer service as they blocked my number calling them! No proper answer from the customer service (via email) as well. I do not recommend the airline at all!

### "AeroMexico is a complete scam"
Not Verified |  AeroMexico is a complete scam. Do not use this airline for anything. Through Expedia, Aeromexico claimed to have purchased our tickets on Delta. They are supposedly partners. AeroMexico sent us a confirmation of our seats and our flight. When we got to the airport, Delta claimed that we didn’t have any seats, and the flight was full. We now could not get to our connecting flight in Los Angeles. We called Aeroméxico at the airport, and they said the flight was full, and there was nothing they could do. Aeromexico also claimed to have bought us tickets and reserve us seats from our flight from Los Angeles to Cancun. According to Delta, this also never happened… even though we showed them an obviously fake confirmation from Aeromexico with our fake reserved seats. This company is a complete scam, and it will cost you thousands of dollars to try and not have your vacation completely ruined after planning for it for literally years. Please save yourself

### "Extremely bad customer service"
Extremely bad customer service and communication. My flight was scheduled to take off at 8:55pm and at 9:10pm they announced that the flight was delayed for an hour because they were waiting for the flight crew. An hour later they said that they were still waiting for 2 crew members, they boarded another flight before our flight and no information about our flight, going on 2 hours Daley waiting for the other flight to board and not even the decency to informed us or give us an update. If any passenger is not at the airport at least 2 hours before the flight they will lose their flight and have to purchase a whole new ticket so I think that is only fair that the airline should have to reimburse all the passengers for the flight.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline. I had 4 separate flights with Aeromexico. Each flight was delayed for hours without an explanation or something for the inconvenience. I will never fly this airline again. Horrible.

### Aeromexico customer review
I used to be the biggest fan of Aeromexico. The staff was amazing - professional, courteous, and very friendly (and still are with the obvious exceptions (mentioned below). Unfortunately, our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with, a disability, you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues (health, age, children, etc) need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. It's not meant to be a free-for-all. Well, not unless you board your Aeromexico (AM) flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport, NLU (Santa Lucia). NLU is a relatively brand new airport (opened March 2022) and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos, we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee, etc, and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized, it wasn't the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight, NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board, there were no zones or even basic pre-boarding. AM had a group of 20-30 who appeared to be traveling together (not young, disabled, etc) who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding -- one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope, it was a cluster eff free-for-all. Oh, silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76-year-old amputee husband need the special boarding, but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didn't get it. So, we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby had problems with his carry-on (which had his meds) and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand, I realize that space is limited on flights, but if you pay for certain benefits, you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand "too bad, so sad" letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course, that's not going to happen. No, I wasn't looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says, "we ate the steak. What I was looking for was a small compensation to acknowledge that they did not deliver as promised. Instead, I got a form letter that any trained lizard could, and did, write. We will look elsewhere in the future and heartily recommend that you do the same.

### "no compensation for food or accommodation"
Not Verified | I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico at all. I had a few hour layover in Mexico City which they ended up turning into a 26 hour layover (meaning my vacation literally lost a day) with no compensation for food or accommodation. I also had premium seats on one of my flights which we paid a few extra hundred dollars for and they oversold the flight and put us in economy with no food that we ordered and no refund. Also the most turbulence and worst landing I’ve ever experienced - they braked so hard when landing that everyone got shoved forward in their seats. Don’t fly with this airline.

### "wouldn't recommend flying with Aeromexico"
My main complaint with Aeromexico is they don't stick to their scheduled flying times and flight delays are the customer's problem, not theirs. Due to a flight delay I had an unplanned layover of 16 hours at the Mexico City Airport. The airline doesn't offer any compensation. It doesn't have any customer service. The price I paid for a hotel stay completely negated the savings of buying a cheap plane ticket. I think they should tell people that sleeping on an airport bench is part of the travel package and your airline itinerary is just a rough guide. I wouldn't recommend flying with Aeromexico.

### "a fair to poor experience"
Traveled in business on three Aeromexico flights on this trip AMS-MEX-GRU-MEX. Overall a fair to poor experience. The biggest positive is the seat is quite comfortable, and that's important. The negatives include an absolute horror show at Mexico City Airport T2 (and an even worse transit to T1). Nothing is particularly easy or smooth and Aeromexico does little to nothing to help ease transiting passengers through the madness. The lounges are third rate and overcrowded. As a result ended up finding a few cafes in the terminal which were far superior than the lounges. The really surprising negative were the Aeromexico business class cabin crews. While efficient in serving meals and performing basic tasks, not one crew had warm, friendly people that either welcomed you or smiled. They come across as some combination of angry and arrogant. It's surprising to me because it's not reflective of Mexico itself, which has some of the warmest, kindest people on earth. Not sure where they find these crews or how they train them but they don't do a particularly good job.

### "nothing they can do refund"
We had a flight leaving Puerto Vallarta connecting in Mexico City to Toronto. Our fright from PV departed late and then when we landed in Mex City our plane was unable to gate for about 15 mins. When we finally got out of the plane at 17:43 we raced to our connecting flight which is supposed to depart 18:05. We got there at 17:55 and were denied boarding. They sent us to customer service that got us on the next flight at 23:55. We paid for upgraded seats because I’m a tall guy and we did not get them on the later flight due to availability. When we called the airline customer service for a refund for the upgrades they told us to contact the customer service email and promptly hung up on us. We called back and spoke with another representative and she informed us we would indeed have to email customer service. We did email them, but got a prompt email back basically telling us there is nothing they can do refund us. Now that I’ve read reviews for this airline I see it’s a common problem. I will be doing a charge back on my Mastercard when the payment is processed.

### "suggest you fly with another airline"
Not Verified |  I suggest you fly with another airline if you speak English! They are not fluent in English. The customer service is poor. They cancelled our flight because we could not accept the changes they made, which was a 24 hour layover. They would not refund our money, and tried to charge us $1,200 more dollars for another flight. I hear that they continuously have layover issues. Several people were late to our resort for a wedding due to this airline. They will not accommodate you in any way if you have car trouble and miss your flight. They will not give you a standby flight! They expect you to pay for another flight. Please be wary of this airline! It would be better to spend a little more money, and get better customer service, and know that you would be accommodated fairly if there were issues, which are sometimes inevitable.

### "they have no customer service"
Not Verified |  I did not make this trip because Aeromexico does not have bad customer services, they have no customer service. I booked Austin to Lima roundtrip in first class for my husband and I. Approximately 3 months before our trip, I began receiving e-mails with changes to my itinerary ... significant changes which ultimately resulted in 2 extra legs to the trip and removal from first class for all travel except Mexico City to Lima. I have an extensive record of my efforts to speak to someone to address these unacceptable changes - e-mails, calls, Facebook chats - for 2 months and never spoke to anyone who could do anything except give me a different e-mail address to submit my problem to. Thus the extensive record using multiple e-mail addresses provided to me by Aeromexico staff. This itinerary was impossible for my elderly husband - changing planes 4 times, taking an entire day of travel, and riding in coach (after paying for first class) was beyond his capabilities. Ultimately, we had to relinquish our trip - continued to seek some kind of compensation, and have yet to speak to a single person who had any authority to assist us before or since the date of our travels. I will never use this airline for any trip ever again.

### "told that the ticket had not been paid"
This review is about the ticket purchase. On September 30, 2022, I purchased a ticket from Aeromexico, in my partners name to fly from Tijuana to Puerto Vallarta. The ticket price was $169.04. I paid with my Capital One credit card, but the transaction was held because my bank questioned the charge. I responded to the bank immediately and the charge went through. All this within 10 minutes or so.. I then received an e-mail confirming that the flight was booked and he was ready to fly. Great, no problem. In the meantime Alejandro got the notice that it was time to check in. When he attempted to check in on line he was unable to do so, and instead was notified that he had to see a gate agent. On Monday October 24, Alejandro got to the airport and went to the ticket counter where he was told that the ticket had not been paid, and he’d have to pay about $436.00 for a new ticket. Not having any other recourse, and needing to get home, he reluctantly paid the exhorbitant amount that Aeromexico required. The next day, he called Aeromexico and told then that the money had been originally paid for the ticket and that he wanted a refund of the more than $400.00 that he was forced into paying. Their response was to offer to refund the $169.04 that was the original cost of the ticket. Note that offering that, indicates that they know they were paid originally and they knew how much. It’s hard to think that this is not a scam, but it is highly unusual that an airline would release the ticket and then turn around and claim it was never paid.

### "ever going to fly with them again"
Bought a trip back in 2019 for easter 2020, and then COVID hit the world. Instead of giving me my money back on a flight which didn't even take off, they wanted to give me airline credit. On top of that my final destination flight were cancelled permanently, I had no way of getting to the destination I bought the ticket for. They however claimed I could use this for other destinations, which is not what I bought. I sued them and finally received my moneyback after 2 years, obviously with a steep commission paid to the lawyers. Aeromexico has no regulation or care for their customer. I am never going to fly with them again. Don't be swayed by their cheap prices, it’s all a cover up for poor customer service.

### "worse than budget/low-cost airlines"
Not Verified | As a frequent flier with Star Alliance, Oneworld over the last 10 years, I STRONGLY recommend anyone to avoid Aeromexico at all costs. Terrible policies (12-month refund period for a flight that they delay for nearly a day) and even worse customer service. I can confidently say they are MUCH worse than budget/low-cost airlines.

### "Aeromexico canceled the flight"
Not Verified | This airline refuse to refund my ticket that I purchased through Priceline the traveling day was Nov 19 because I had a family event in Nicaragua. Aeromexico canceled the flight and changed to Nov 18 with a layover in Mexico for 10 hours I call the same day I got an email from Priceline saying the change of traveling plans. Their response was contact Priceline because the ticket were booked through them but Aeromexico charged my credit card Priceline said they can’t refund ticket because they only can make changes back and forth.

### "The luggage policy sucks"
The luggage policy sucks, I had 3 more kgs in my luggage and the airline charged the equivalent of 3 pieces of baggage. I had never been charged like that before, not even on transatlantic flights. I will avoid this airline when travelling for work definitely. The service on board was poor, and the flight attendants were not kind. Poor service and you don't get value for money.

### "Airline seems to be giving up"
Not Verified |  Club Premier seating it dated. Food in business class was limited to a sandwich, nuts. Thankfully, drinks are included that’s with any other reasonable airline. Airline seems to be giving up — it’s sad.

### "not be back on this airline"
Not Verified |  Masks required and policed. Will not be back on this airline. Also, they wanted me to upgrade so I could have a suitcase. That’s when I found out I was only allowed a purse, no carry on suitcase. A $190 upgrade would allow me a suitcase. No way. Never again.

### "I do not recommend it at all"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience and lack of professional ethics with customer service personnel, they do not give correct information when buying their tickets. They say everything is included and in the long run an ok ends up paying for luggage. Bad coordination. They should put more professional and trained staff and take the trouble to serve the customer and not be on the phone talking more with other people and then attend to a 45-minute wait for a check-in is ridiculous and this happened to me in Mexico. Very bad if there were less than 0 is my evaluation I do not recommend it at all. Muy mala experiencia y falta de ética profesional con personal de servicio al cliente, no dan una información correcta al momento comprar sus tickets. Dicen todo está incluido y a la larga un ok termina pagando equipaje. Mala coordinación. Deberían poner personal mas profesional y capacitado y se tomen la molestia de atender al cliente y no estar en el teléfono hablando más con otras personas y luego atenderlo a uno 45 minutos esperar por un check in es ridiculo y más esto me paso en México. Muy malo si hubiera menos 0 es mi evaluación no la recomiendo para nada .

### "not refunding fully refundable tickets!"
Aeromexico is stealing from customers by not refunding fully refundable tickets! It’s been 5 weeks since I cancelled my flight and I still do not have my $1600 back. I have asked 3 times to speak with a supervisor and the agent refuses. I also asked to talk to someone in the refund department and they told me that department doesn’t have a phone number! I have no confidence that I will ever get my money back.

### "very rude how you are treated"
Not Verified |  Aeromexico didn't tell me about the visa when I checked in, then I lost the flight because Oficina sent me back and forth. I had to pay an exaggerated new ticket of 2500 euros. A return flight from Mexico to Germany. My luggage is gone too, I'll probably never see it again. Partly very rude how you are treated, no advice and no help. Somehow even foreigners Hostile. I speak spanish but not perfect. I will never fly with Aeromexico again because they ripped it off badly. A short phone call was enough in their own ranks to help me,  Aeromexico hat mich beim Einchecken nicht auf dass Visa hingewiesen,dann habe ich den Flug verloren ,weil dass Oficina mich hin und her geschickt hat. Ein übertriebenes neues Ticket von 2500 Euro musste ich bezahlen. Ein Rückflug von Mexiko nach Deutschland. Mein Gepäck ist auch verschwunden,werde es wohl nie wieder sehen. Zum Teil sehr unverschämt wie man behandelt wird,keine Beratung und keine Hilfe. Irgendwie sogar Ausländer Feindlich. Ich rede Spanisch,aber nicht perfekt. Ich werde nie mehr mit Aeromexico fliegen,denn sie haben kräftig übers Ohr gehauen. Ein kurzes Telefonat hatte ausgereicht in ihren eigenen Reihen um mir zu helfen

### "putting a lock/zip tie on your luggage"
Not Verified |  Highly recommend putting a lock/zip tie on your luggage. I packed my girlfriends brand new shoes in my luggage before we left and our bags weren’t there when we arrived at our resort. The people told us we’d get the luggage in two hours, we got them the next day. Also opened my luggage to missing shoes.

### "both legs of the flight I lost my baggage"
Not Verified |  I flew with Aeromexico both ways going to Peru, and both legs of the flight I lost my baggage. The first one I was able to receive after 2 days, but the coming back flight it's already been a week and haven't received it yet. They've located it but keeps pending and not sending it to me.

### "you can't change your flight date"
It's important to know that if you book a ticket in economy you can't change your flight date if you need to. With over a month's notice, they would not let me change my flight date. I had to lose the entire ticket - full payment. First thing is they should warn you about this at booking. I understand paying a penalty, but having to pay the entire ticket is unbelievable to me. I'll never fly with them ever and I'll advise others to avoid them also.

### "I will never fly with them again"
On February 28th, 2022 I purchased three airline tickets from a third party to fly on Aeromexico. One for me, one for my husband and one for my daughter. On April 10, Aero Mexico changed our flights. The change of the flight did not work for my daughter. So I had to cancel her flight and re book by calling Aeromexico. Which they charge me extra for her new flight. They did not let me daughter on the plane with this ticket. They said it was fraud since I was not at the airport with her to show my ID since I purchased it with my credit card. They told her the flight is full and she can not buy a ticket. Twos hours back and forth with them they told her they have a seat for her which she has to pay for. So they cancel her first flight without telling us and the same thing happen for her flight coming back. I will never fly with them again!! If anyone ask me about AeroMexico Ill will definitely tell them not to fly with them! I'm still waiting for my money back!

### "Mean and unkind employees"
Terrible service. Mean and unkind employees. Left me waiting 46 minutes to find a wheelchair. Doesn’t have enough staff to operate wheelchair or check everyone in. Horrible food.

### "It is the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Lines of an hour and a half to be able to check the luggage, more than 35 minutes of waiting to be able to get off the plane and take my connection to my country, delayed flights and consequently loss of connections with themselves. Staff unable to provide support and solutions. They play with people's time because of their lack of competence. The supervisors will try not to compensate you and after receiving 20 people with the same case they redirect you to schedule your new flight. They send you to the furthest hotel (50 min) and are inflexible in giving you an alternative. An incredible lack of empathy, attention and service! It is the worst airline. Filas de una hora y media para poder chequear el equipaje, más de 35 minutos de espera para poder bajar del avión y tomar mi conexión hacia mi país, retrasó de vuelos y en consecuencia pérdida de las conexiones con ellos mismos. Personal incapacitado para brindar soporte y soluciones. Juegan con el tiempo de las personas por su falta de competencia. Los supervisores intentarán no compensarte y luego de recibir a 20 personas con el mismo caso te redireccionan para programar tu nuevo vuelo. Te envían al hotel más lejano (50 min) y son inflexibles en darte una alternativa. Una falta de empatía increíble, de atención y servicio! Es la peor aerolínea

### "Such a terrible experience"
Aeromexico just kicked us out of the plane right at the plane door, eventually, we are done boarding check and have a ticket on hand. It’s unbelievable! Our flight from Mexico City to Vancouver on July 3, 2022 , flight number Am694, we are a couple. The flight was supposed to take off at 1:30 am July 3 but they delayed until 6 am. It means we already waited here for 4,5 hours - the whole night for the flight. At the boarding time, they just pulled us back and said that they need to check our passports, so we had to wait at the boarding station for 10 mins for their checking. We didn't know what they were doing, then we were released for heading to the plane. When we were about to get into the plane, right in front of the plane door, one of the staff just stopped us and said that he need to check if there were available seats for us. We did our check-in 14 hours ago and we got a ticket here, we got the seat number here and you did the checking, what do u mean u need to check if there were available seats for us. We waited there for another 10 mins and they just shut the plane door, right in front of us, left us there and the plane took off. We were so shocked by what was happening and couldn't believe what they did. The manager came and said that there was an error in our reservation so they could not let us board the plane. They will transfer us to the next flight without any other explanation. And we had to wait here another 3 hours for the next flight. They gave us business class tickers for the next flight but we didn't need them, we had been in the airport for 11 hours already and we will have to be back to work right after the flight. When we backed to the boarding station, they already issued new tickets and already took our check-in luggage out of the plane. We guessed that they took our seats and gave them to ppl who missed their last flight or whatever. We didn't know the real reason. Aeromexico, they just shut the plane door in front of us, left us there, and took off. Wow! We were so shocked and mad at what was happening. The reason they gave us is a reservation error, the machine couldn't read our ticket Q-code. That was not our false and they checked our passport twice, which means if there was something wrong they should have known abt it. They just did it to us for an unacceptable reason and didn’t care about if we accept it or not. Such a terrible experience! This is my first time with AeroMexico and also will be the last time. You never know the feeling until they do it to you! Hopefully, my sharing can let u consider not booking this airline - a terrible service!

### "would avoid it at all costs"
Not Verified |  I would avoid it at all costs. They are very disorganized, all 4 of our flights were randomly delayed, and we ended up losing a business class seat that we paid for and they never refunded us. No one from customer support is responsive, they lie and ignore your emails and questions.

### "incredibly unprofessional and frustrating"
Not Verified |  On May 16, 2022, I purchased 4 airline tickets from Aeromexico for myself and my family. In less than 24 hours, we had to cancel those flights. When we called to cancel, we were assured that a full refund would be issued in 7-10 business days. After that time frame, we called again. We were given confirmation numbers of the cancellation, the refund amount and again assured that a refund would be issued within 2 weeks. We called again after the two weeks and were told that the refund was already issued and my bank must be holding it. I work at the bank and knew this to be false information but I called the bank anyway for due diligence. The bank assured me that no refund was being held and there were no pending deposits. So, I called again! This time we were told that the refund was issued and would hit our bank within 3-4 weeks. Now, we are at 36 days and counting. This is incredibly unprofessional and frustrating. We receive a different response every time we call. The only consistency is that we are told the refund is issued. The total amount is $1458.07. They've given us this number several times. That is a lot of money to be held interest free for over a month.

### "never fly with Aeromexico again"
I will never fly with Aeromexico again. Hardly speaks English. Customer service is very bad. I was not able to get my luggage even after 72 hours. No tracing no help tracing them and no compensation. Their reps are rude.

### "you’ll be delayed on every step of your journey"
Not worth it. An overpriced piece of garbage of an airline. The airline sells itself as being above the other way more economical airlines. The reality is that you’ll be delayed on every step of your journey, the staff will be rude and overall they don’t care about getting you on time anywhere. My flight was delayed in Amsterdam and then canceled in Mexico City. I have to wait 5 hours for my next flight. Ah and also my screen on my seat was broken. I truly regret paying for a 'nicer' airline. If you can avoid it don’t fly with them.

### "the worst airline I've ever flown"
This is and was the worst airline I've ever flown! Our flight is 4 hours late and counting. They gave us noticed for the flight change when we were checking in to the flight and again when supposed to board at the later time. They promised to give us 600 pesos redemption for any food (except alcohol) at the restaurant. As soon as we got there they said that the coupon was only good for only one type of sandwich and a coke. Check-in bags are super overpriced and we are overall extremely dissatisfied with Aeromexico! Just terrible! We will never fly with them again.

### "communication is the absolute worst"
I purchased a business class ticket for Sunday with a return on Friday from Medellin Colombia to San Antonio, Texas, USA. I had the times confused with 12:30 am being at night and I figured out my mistake, luckily it was the afternoon and the flight was delayed but while I was at the airport I was held up and was late for the first flight. Not only was my first flight missed, but Aeromexico also canceled my second flight for no show. I had to rebook my flight for Personal instead of Business (it was a full flight) and that flight on Friday was over 3 hours late. We were supposed to leave at 6:15 pm but ended up leaving at 9:30 pm. I can understand missing my first flight, I got confused between 12:30 am and 12:30 pm and when I realized my mistake I arrived a little too late. I understand this, but then my second flight was canceled and Aeromexico was 3+ hours late on their flight return flight and also very late on their flight out that I missed and thought was Sunday night, not Saturday afternoon. I accept missing the first flight but I would have liked my 2nd flight to be refunded. It was a full flight so there was no money lost on Aeromexico's end and in fact, I paid more for the second flight. I don't feel it's fair that the airline canceled my second flight even though I flew out of Medellin a few hours later and rebooked the same ticket through you the same day. It feels very unfair I get punished so heavily for being late but when Aeromexico is late on both flights there is no issue on their end. I've been a very good customer, I have only been late to a flight one other time in my life. I am totally okay with losing the first flight but feel it is very unfair to lose my 2nd flight, especially since the return flight was full,  the outgoing and return flight was very late (3+ hours), I booked the same flight twice, the second booking was more expensive than the first, and the second ticket wasn't business class. Their communication is the absolute worst! I have called numerous times, the chat on their website doesn't work, and I have emailed them 3 times in the past month with zero response. I would really appreciate a refund on my second flight or at least airline credit because again Aeromexico didn't lose any money (in fact it made more since I booked the same flight twice for more expensive) and I arrived home very late last night.

### "No more Aeromexico for me ever again"
AM0025 to Amsterdam was supposed to leave at 22:10. What followed over the next three hours as we waited in the aircraft were repeated announcements of imminent departures in 5, max ten minutes, the last time at 23:25. At 00:12, we were informed that our departure would be transferred to a different, shorter, runways which would require us to first reduce some mail tonnage and we should not expect to take off for the next 25 minutes. I think this was the only announcement during the whole flight. At 00:21 at least the stewardesses decided to show themselves offering passengers a glass of water, basically the least they could do. At 1:00, the mail truck arrived to remove the excess mail baggage. Eventually pushback started at 1:15, and flight finally took off at 1:35. After that service was friendly and consistently in Spanish, despite me consistently indicating that I didn't speak Spanish. Luckily I managed to get some sleep, but when I awoke I found that the entertainment system had frozen. I just read my book for the remainder of this awful flight. No more Aeromexico for me ever again.

### "said that they cannot offer a refund"
Not Verified |  I had a business flight to the USA from MX in January. They canceled my flight on Monday and rebooked me for Tuesday. I get there on Tuesday, they cancel my flight again. I believe it was due to low staff and people getting COVID. Fine. I guess I just will not go, it was suppose to be for 3 days total anyway. I asked for a refund at the desk, they said I have to call. I call, they said I have to send an email. Five months later, after multiple tickets being sent in, they finally responded about my refund. They said that they cannot offer a refund because it was due to weather conditions, I'm pretty sure it wasn't, according to what the front desk told me. Late response. No refund.

### "pay the extra and fly a different airline"
Not Verified |  I’d rather walk or swim to my destination than fly with this  company again. Hidden fees, a totally incompetent staff, subpar food and inflight service. One attendant didn’t care that I had my allotted 2 carry on bags, another charged me $93 dollars to check one of them even though the weight and size was okay. It’s no wonder they went bankrupt. Just pay the extra and fly a different airline unless you enjoy getting bent over.

### "will never fly them again"
Flight from LAX was delayed so they rebooked us on a flight 8 hours later. Asked and denied our request to be rebooked on a partner airline in order to make connection. All the agents at Lax were delta air. Literally took hours to rebook as they’re unfamiliar with Aeromexico booking policy. At Mexico city, had to to wait another 13 hours for connection. Made us pick up our checked luggage, then refused drop off because departure flight was more than 6 hours away. Food was also terrible. Economy food might have been better. Got a fairly decent deal for this flight. But will never fly them again no matter how good of a deal again. Not surprised this flagship airline is only the third largest in Mexico.

### "they are just not professional"
Start great, get people in the plane, little late but nothing crazy (10min). Shortly after everyone is in it start to be really hot, 45 min later we got told to unboard the plane due to mechanical, no more announcement, everybody know they gonna miss their connection. But AeroMexico tell everyone that everything is fine We will replane the aircraft shortly (but don’t know went) and everything will be taking care of in Mexico City. 1 hour later, We all know we miss our connection basically. Basically land around 4pm… In Mexico City We got information in the plane, for me that was to present myself at gate 62. Run to the gate, there was no one there. Try to find a place to sort my stuff because again knowing that everyone was late, and waiting in Guadalajara, why not make it there. Finally after 3 hour in line, finally talk to a person, Get another flight at 1am. No refund on my upgrade I made on the flight I miss ‘cause no more seats. And a beautiful 350 pesos vouchers for Starbucks. Avoid at all cost please, they are just not professional.

### "Unbelievably terrible treatment"
Torreón to San Jose del Cabo via Mexico City. Why pay Aeromexico prices for budget airline treatment? Unbelievably terrible treatment from Aeromexico. We were flying from Torreón to San Jose del Cabo via Mexico City; arrived in Mexico City to find out that they had over overbooked the next flight by more than 16 people. We were kicked off the flight, stranded in Mexico City with the next available flight not until 7am the next day (aka waking up at 3am). Because they had overbooked ALL the flights for today. Then we wait in customer service lines for over an hour just to get rebooked. I get that overbooking happens but more than a dozen of us paying customers who made reservations FAR in advance should not be treated like cattle. Families with children, elderly people, all stranded. This is criminal behavior. We paid for a flight with convenient arrival and departure times, and instead are receiving a cheap early AM flight. And worst of all, not even a single "we're sorry. We will be avoiding Aeromexico at all costs; if you're gonna be treated like livestock anyway, might as well go with a cheaper airline.

### "the cabin crew told us we will take care of you don’t worry! A joke!"
I had a flight from Cancun to Los Cabo’s with a connection in Mexico City. Mexico City airport is a disaster! We were 30 minutes late leaving Cancun then right before we were to land in Mexico City the plane went in circles for 15 minutes. Upon arrival the cabin crew told us don’t worry we know people have connecting flights and we will take care of you don’t worry! A joke! When I was able to finally get off plane I had two minutes to get to my gate, upon arrival they let some people through that were on my flight but not me. I had a first class ticket and the attendant at desk told me the previous airplane had issued and they had to downsize to a small airplane and 60people don’t have flights. When I saw a lady go through that was on my same flight I asked why is she able to go and he said I’m not sure, they then directed me to the a desk to rebook my ticket which is for a whole next day! No compassion or care they gave me my vouchers and that was it. Question to this airline why do you have connection flights if you know your not going to be able to fulfill the flyers to their connecting flights. I’m waiting for my luggage and I can’t wait to see what type of hotel they set me up in after reading these reviews.

### "will avoid at all costs having to fly with them again"
They delayed our flight and we lost our connecting flight, we had to stay in Mexico City and this is the place Aeromexico sends their “guests”- Wonderful VIP treatment as you can see below. I’ve got only one good thing to say about this hell hole. The staff are lovely and very friendly The hotel resembles more a 2 star prison than a hotel. Extremely frustrating and disappointing is not enough to describe the whole experience. Traveller beware photos attached for reference. At this point I’m just hoping we won’t wake up with bed bug bites. How on earth is this considered a 4 star hotel is beyond me. What a joke! Will let the pics speak for themselves Enjoy! Showcasing the welcoming elevators. Bathtub/ shower combo pealing away and featuring stains from past guests. Another nice feature the tub didn’t drain the water, therefore with two of us in a room I got to enjoy a tepid dirty shower. Stains on the rugs everywhere and beautiful finishing touches. Sanitation protocols in place as we find hairs in the beds and bathroom sink, delightful touches. Next morning they delayed the flight again now leaving Mexico City going to Canada because they had no flight crew. Been waiting for hours with 100’s of people in an overly crowded room because there are 3 delayed flights all with no crew and still no hope in sight of getting home. Had to sit on the floor because there is no room for some many people with delayed flights. Once we had boarded the flight, they said the plane was over capacity so they had to take 6 people off, threatening that otherwise the whole flight would be canceled. Finally after much convincing 6 people got off. It took another hour or so to sort out whatever situation that created, as they had to sort and find the luggage and get it off the plane. Needless to say they have lost our business and will avoid at all costs having to fly with them again

### "don't have any type of consideration"
They don't have any type of consideration and respect. I have my cousin that they wont let her board to the gate. Not even do her check in just because she was 2 hrs before the flight. They wanted her to be there 3 hrs before. I can't understand what's the difference between 2 hrs and 3hrs before the departure. When she was talking to them they simply ignored her.

### "Delayed flight as always"
Delayed flight as always. Aeromexico loves to delay flights, and very bad customer service. Now we have to wait for more than 2 hours because “the crew is on their way”. I will try to never fly with Aeromexico again.

### "Worse experience with an airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. The staff review documents multiple times and give imprecise instructions to passengers. No call to announce departure and seems like purposely want passengers to miss the flights. Worse experience with an airline.

### "Pretty much no customer service at the airport or online"
Pretty much no customer service at the airport or online. They left my luggage in Mexico City. At the airport staff were rude and not willing to help. I've submitted a claim but after 12hrs there's still no response or updates. Because my MX to La Paz flight is not showing up in the system I need to reach a customer service representative to edit my claim but it's impossible to reach anyone. They promised at the airport they would update it but they didn't. Oh and my TV screen didn't work on both flights!

### "there will be no refund and they are sorry for the inconvenience"
Not Verified |  Some friends and I were flying from Zurich to San José del Cabo. We booked Economy Comfort seats using the Aeromexico homepage. First disappointment: At the airport they said something didn't work, they cannot seat us at the booked economy comfort seats and we got very bad middle seats. At least it was said the charge for the seats gets refunded since it's clearly seen what was booked and where we are seated. Several other people had the same issue (in fact everyone who booked a seat upgrade online - the queue at the service desk was therefore quite long). Second and even worse disappointment: I got in contact with Aeromexico for the refund, a month later I got the answer that there will be no refund and they are sorry for the inconvenience. This is just fraud, they double booked and got paid for the economy comfort seats (in advance online and then again on site) and refuse to refund a performance not rendered. Never again.

### "Arrived at LAX with missing luggage"
Not Verified |  Aeromexico left my bags in Mexico City after checking them in. Arrived at LAX with missing luggage and no help from the lazy workers standing around. Nobody knows the correct information, Nobody wanted to help except Cynthia at the Delta Luggage assistance desk. Although I paid for my luggage, paid to get back into the US once we stopped to connect to another flight in Mexico City. I arrive home in Los Angeles with no luggage and little help. I called customer service and the representative informed me to send an email to [email protected] and wait 15 - 25 days for a response. Also, paid for wifi during the flight which was nonexistent.

### "the most miserable travel experience"
This is my 5th flight I've taken with Aeromexico. (All within the same itinerary). Currently, waiting for my 6th flight and I don't have high hopes. I had to take 3 one way tickets to fulfill a wedding schedule. LAX to MEX to GTO GTO to MEX to Cancun Cancun to MEX to LAX This airline was not on time once. 5 flights ALL delayed. And I'm sure the 6th will be as well. Apparently the only flight to leave on time was my connection back to LA from Mexico City. 2.5hr delay LAX to MXC 1.5hr delay MXC to GTO 3hrs delay GTO to MXC 2hr delay GTO to Cancun (resulted in a missing my first day at the resort) 1hr delay Cancun to MXC (resulted in a missed connection) My first 2 flights were First Class, the 3rd Economy. The staff is friendly enough, but the food is atrocious. In Cancun, once I finally arrived after being delayed leaving GTO and MEX, my suitcase did not come out until near the end of the baggage, even though it should have been priority as I was First Class. I am assuming it's because the priority tag was ripped; but I feel that the Ground Staff should know what their Priority tags looks like. All and all, I will never fly this airline again. This was the most miserable travel experience I have ever experienced.

### "Hopefully won't be flying with them anymore"
Not Verified |  Decided to join their loyalty status, I flew with them for over 2 years, then the pandemic came. Since COVID was with us for a couple of years I couldn't fly for obvious reasons. I had the joy of getting married a couple of weeks ago only to realize that my plans to use the miles I accumulated to go on my honeymoon weren't there anymore. Hopefully won't be flying with them anymore.

### "Aeromexico is a terrible airline - buyer beware!"
Aeromexico is a terrible airline - buyer beware! Think twice before you book a flight, and make sure you read the fine print every time. I have traveled to hundreds of cities, and I have never experienced such a terrible level of service. I purchased a ticket, confirmed my flight and I was bumped from the flight at the last minute because they "didn't have enough seats". Of course, one would expect a refund having paid for a flight and being denied boarding, but even this was not confirmed at the gate and the airline said I need to reach out by phone. Here's the catch - Aeromexico has no customer support phone line! They only accept emails. This is incredibly frustrating and borderline manipulative. Do not fly AeroMexico!

### "Shame on them for their lack of compassion in extreme situations"
Not Verified |  My mother was in a bad accident and in ICU fighting for her life. We had a flight coming up and though we didn’t pay the premium airfare, we thought maybe with a medical emergency they would allow us to pay the cost and move our dates. I called customer service and was told no I didn’t get that type of ticket, but maybe send an email to customer service (makes no sense) and they would be able to help me. I send the email and get a confirmation number back saying they’ll be in touch in a couple of days. I waited 2 weeks. I tried to reach them via email and by Facebook messenger and all I would get is an automated response saying someone will be with me shortly. No one ever comes on. Finally, I got tired of waiting and left a bad review on their Facebook page. Surprise! I get a message asking if I needed help. They told me to send a document proving my case, which I did even though the hospital stated that’s a HIPPA violation to state her diagnosis like they asked. I get an email back saying sorry but you will just have to take the loss on your tickets. So on top of my mother in an induced coma for the last 4 weeks, I now lose almost $2000 in airfare. Shame on them for their lack of compassion in extreme situations. I was even offering more money to fill their greedy pockets and they still said now. I will never use them again and will always steer my friends away from them. They should be ashamed.

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. They charged me 50 dollars for local flight and 30 dollars for international one and then they lost me. The worst part was that there was no representative in baggage claim at 2:30 am and waited for 30 minutes to somebody call them. Food is mediocre. Wifi is only free for messaging and they don’t provide blanket. Definitely would not recommend it.

### "essentially stolen £884 from us"
After being issued EMD vouchers for flights cancelled by Aeromexico in 2020, they refuse to extend the validity of our vouchers for 6 months to allow us to travel directly, safely and affordably. This is despite the fact that for the entire duration of the vouchers validity, AM were not running direct flights from the UK, the costs of all indirect flights now total four times more than the value of our vouchers. This renders the EMD vouchers useless and Aeromexico have essentially stolen £884 from us. Hours and hours on the phone, told conflicting information by phone operative vs email operative. So sad and disappointing, we are UK tourists desperately wanting to experience Mexico but instead have felt completely frustrated and robbed. Do not book with Aeromexico, British Airways have flights for a fraction of the cost and are much more reliable and less corrupt.

### "kept the money from a canceled flight"
They kept the money from a canceled flight in 2020 and said they won't refund it nor issue a voucher or anything. No matter how many times I contacted them, also it's very very hard to get a hold of someone and they never reply the email requests.

### "The staff were unhelpful and rude"
This was the worst airline experience I have ever had. On our flight from Chicago to Mexico City our bags were forcibly checked for being the “last to check in” even though we checked in via their app at 6am Thursday for a 12:30am Friday flight and then checked in again upon arrival at the airport at 7pm. This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous. Our flight home from Cancun to Mexico City was delayed for over an hour and we were not informed of this delay until we were supposed to be boarding, we still do not know why the plane was delayed. We had a connecting flight to make in Mexico City which we made them aware of and they promised 3 times that we would make it, Mexico City would hold the plane for us. We were told we would touch down in Mexico City at 6pm, instead we touched down at 6.37. Our connecting flight left at 6.50. We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home. It was a struggle to find anyone in the airport in uniform who spoke enough English to understand us. Person after person just told us, we don’t speak English, sorry we can’t help you. We finally get someone to help us book a new flight that was 15 hours later. Aeromexico gave us vouchers for a hotel, transportation, and some food. Very generous, thank you. We get to the hotel they put us in to find out the hotel was booked up completely and we were going to have to wait 30 minutes to then be shuttled another 20 to a new hotel. By this time it was 12.30 in the morning and we had to be up again at 5 just to head back for our new flight. It was such a frustrating travel day. Our new flight starts boarding on time at 9am, we are so excited to be leaving and leaving on time until we sit on the plane fully boarded for 40 minutes before we even take off. Again, the flight was delayed. Out of 4 flights in total that we took on this one trip, 3 flights were delayed for at least 40 minutes. I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico and I especially do not recommend flying with them when you have a connecting flight. Your odds of making it are slim. The staff were unhelpful and rude and if at all possible I would rate my experience with them a 0/10. Never again will I be flying with Aeromexico.

### "Aeromexico is a total joke"
Never Again. Aeromexico was a very bad experience in so many ways. Food is cookies and coke, chairs are so old, on-board Wifi connections with no Internet, Movies stop working every five minutes, passenger boarding from front to rear instead of rear to front, insufficient overhead storage, no gates in Mex City. Inability to arrive/depart on time, lack of accountability, Lying to customers and blaming air traffic control for company delays to avoid issuing hotel vouchers, cabin crew who disappear during the flights. I arrived 2 hours ahead of departure time and checked in with no problem. I was told that flight was on time and boarding would start 320PM for a 4:10 PM departure. The plane arrived at 3:40 in Merida. Shortly after they announced that, the flight would be delayed until 5pm due to air traffic control delays. A big lie of course. Around 430PM the gate paged me and told me that I should not get on the plane because most likely my connecting flight would depart before we arrived. The gate agent manager said tough luck and refused my accommodation request. I opted to board and take my chances. When we arrived my flight was still on the ground. But the pilot parked 3 feet short of the spot he needed to be and a tow truck took 15 minutes to move the plane another 3 feet. First class disembarked using the staircase, but then the staircase broke and another 15 minutes were required to get another staircase. Pilots did not inform the passengers about the bad parking job nor the staircase. My name was removed from the passenger manifest to Miami without even informing me or asking consent. The new flight was the next day. With me off the passenger manifest, my original flight to Miami could take off without me. After I made a huge scene in the middle of the hundreds of people waiting at the Mexico city counter, I was awarded a hotel room and 4 hours of sleep. And of course as mentioned by others, another COVID test costing 750 pesos was required. Aeromexico is a total joke.

### "just ignoring my refund messages"
I bought a ticket for a flight from Ecuador to Russia with Aeromexico and Air France. The day after the purchase, I received a letter that one of the flights was changed, the new route was not suitable for me, because I do not have a visa to Europe and I was not able to fly on the new changed route. In this connection, an involuntary refund was issued, the money for which the airline does not want to return. Today is March 7th 2022 and support is just ignoring my refund messages.

### "offered us nothing for lodging costs and inconvenience"
We were scheduled to fly from Merida on 28Feb 2022, flight# AM 829 and connect to Delta flight# DL605 to Minneapolis. AM 829 was 2+ hours late causing us to miss our connection to DL605. We were told we would have to return to the main ticketing counter to find a solution to our problem. Going back out of the security area and waited to talk with an agent. When we finally spoke with an agent, we were told we would have to wait until the next day to get the same flight. Asked if we could take a different flight to anywhere in the USA, then to Minneapolis, was met with a resounding NO! How about a hotel voucher? NO! How about a voucher for a new COVID test because AeroMexico delayed our travel? NO! Several other passengers were in the same situation. One person did talk someone into a hotel voucher, but we were refused. Our decision was to get out of Merida right away and make it to Mexico City, so we did not have to deal with the endless no responses we were encountering from AeroMexico. AeroMexico did get us boarding request with Delta (not boarding passes) but offered us nothing for our extra lodging costs and inconvenience. They said Delta would determine if our COVID test were still valid. We were lucky to find seats on DL605. We had paid for Comfort+ but had to settle for Main 1. If I was Delta, I would cut my alliance with AeroMexico yesterday. Local flyers said this was typical for your punctuality.

### "meals almost non existent"
My wife and I left Nicaragua on 20 Feb 22, Business class to Vancouver via Mexico. There was no meal served other than a packet of chips on the first leg, on the leg from Mexico to Vancouver there were 16 business class seats and a proper meal for 8 people other than a disgusting 2 minute noodles which went in the bin. Be warned do not fly with these cheap skates, their cabin crew are rude and meals almost non existent.

### "frustrating and disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Their customer service is worst. They seem very helpful but each one gives a different solution. I canceled my trip in December 2021 and was issues an open ticket. Since then have been calling them to get a new reservation some agents says they can help some say that there is an issue with the reservation and only customer support (AMCS) can help. Its been 15 days and this AMCS and responded to my email. I lost my hotel booking and had to pay penalty. I called the number again hoping someone can assist. Was on a call for 2.5 hours (1.5 hours was on hold) and she said she can exchange my ticket but will need to call me in an hour. She didn't call but generated a new pending reservation with difference of $3500 while she said the difference will be not more than $200. I called the number again today (the next day), after 1 hour of explaining the entire issue she says only AMCS can help but I need to pay for exchange and she can do it. Finally I agreed for new dates for exchange, she hung up the call. This is so frustrating. My $5400 is stuck with Aeromexico and I have lost around $500 dollars on hotel booking cancelation due to their pathetic customer support. their agents itself have no way of contacting the AMCS which seems like a high authority of customer support who can only take decisions about upgrades or refund. Such a frustrating and disappointing experience.

### "are rude and unprofessional"
The staff in Mexico City are rude and unprofessional. I went to terminal 2 which is what my ticket said and waited for someone to check us in, finally at 830 they said no you go to terminal 3. I go over there and the lady said sorry your flight is already gone? I said it wasn’t supposed to leave until 915? She said you should of checked in, I told her I’ve been trying nobody will help me and my phone has no service here. She said to me not my problem you have to buy more tickets I asked to speak with a manager she sent Javier to me, he said nothing I can do you gotta buy more tickets or go to a different airline if you don’t like i. Which I ended up doing I went to American airline and thanks to them I got home.

### "Disappointing on all fronts"
Disappointing on all fronts. They offer online check-in, but there is no bag drop line. Which means despite having checked in in advance, I still had to wait in the same line as people that didn’t even have boarding passes. Furthermore, the check in agent informed me that my electronic boarding pass would not work so he issued me a new, paper boarding pass. The boarding process in YUL was chaotic and disorganized. I had to connect in MEX and luckily I had plenty of time as there was no gate information available, not on the boards in the airport, not on the app, not on the website. The aircraft were underwhelming, uncomfortable, and the service subpar. I won’t be taking Aeromexico again unless absolutely necessary.

### "horrible experience with this airline"
Not Verified | I have had a horrible experience with this airline. If you don't have any issues, consider yourself lucky. Most of the staff isn't polite and will refuse to help even when the airline is at fault. My flight got changed 3 times. Now, I have a 22-hour layover. I'm not even able to buy extra luggage because the app won't allow it, and their "customer service" line will not help. First, you will need to call dozens of times and wait for hours on the phone before getting someone to pick up. Then, if you are lucky, they'll direct you to someone else and go in circles for a few more hours before they tell you they can't help.

### "my covid test result had expired"
On January 3rd, 2022, I arrived at the airport in Acapulco to board my flight, upon arriving at the counter at Aeromexico, I presented my negative covid test result which was sent to me by the lab just an hour prior. I was told by a very rude, young girl that she was going to consult with a supervisor regarding my covid test result. I waited and waited, hauling my heavy suitcase back and forth to the counter and back. Finally the supervisor showed up and indicated that my covid test result though negative had expired by approximately one hour. She maintained that it had expired, that I wouldn’t be allowed to fly and no matter what I said to her she just stated that those were Aeromexico’s policies. I had to take a cab back to where I was staying and proceed to undergo another expensive covid test. I also asked if Aeromexico was going to book me on another flight and I was told that they were not going to honour my original round-trip fare, that I had to purchase a new ticket, which happened to be quite expensive. Needless to say we were ripped off.

### "made me pay my own way home"
Went to airport 3 hrS in advance as instructed only to find out my word of mouth flight canceled. Staff took 3.5 hrs to work a new flight and offered no water and made me pay my own way home. Not impressed.

### "they can't admit when they are wrong"
Worst airline. We called to change our flight from 10/18/21 to 10/19/21 days before and the person who helped did not understand proper English because he confused Tuesday with Thursday. He booked on 10/21/21 and we called immediately to fix his error. Someone helped fix this but when we arrived at the airport on 10/19/21 before 1 pm the airport checked us in, registered our luggage, and gave us boarding passes. We went by our day trying to get by the next 4hrs and were sitting and the lounge. When it was boarding time they told us we could not board as our tickets were canceled by Aeromexico. They had us running around trying to get help so we wouldn't miss our flight and went to 4 different stations, had to get out of the airport after being checked in just so we can get our tickets fixed. The 2nd person which helped us did not confirm our tickets yet we received confirmation, etc. Aeromexico showed no type of sympathy, just put us on the next flight 8hrs our initial check-in and aside from this they lost our luggage (& lied to us that it was on the new flight, after asking them many times since they had checked it in earlier). Months later they reply back after submitting my claim and no sympathy whatsoever! Worst, they can't admit when they are wrong.

### "I’ll never fly again with them"
Not Verified | Horrible service! On my way to Mexico (Acapulco) the flight was delayed over than 2 hours, and lost my connection flight to my next destination. They paid for a hotel in Mexico City. But I had to pay for my own transportation and food. The same trip, days later, on my way back to the states the same problem the flight was delayed again and lost my other flight to Orlando! They put me again in another hotel, no transportation, no food. No bags cause they were on the connection flight. I was so mad and sad. I asked for another flight to other city near to Orlando cause I needed to get that day to my destination, I had a job and other responsibilities, and it was not my fault at all, can’t be possible that every single flight was delayed for hours, and they said not we can’t change destinations you have to buy your own tickets again if you want travel the same day. Or stay and leave the next day. I was not the only one, around 10 people had the same situation than me. I’ll never fly again with them.

### "they voided the ticket"
I booked a round trip flight through this airlines Sao Paulo to Santo Domingo via Mexico City, I called to change the return date of the return flight, minus 1 day. They did that. But come flight day, I found out that that instead of just changing the return date, they also cancelled the departure flight. It became a one way flight and just the return, Sto Domingo to Brazil. And then I had to call them again to have them fix it, i had to be moved to a different day, so I had to change the succeeding flights I'm supposed to have after that flight that they cancelled. I also had to do multiple covid tests because of the rescheduling that happened. And they did not make it easy for me as well, when I called to have them book the flight that they cancelled, they keep on transferring me, refusing to give me a supervisor, and then hanging up on me, I called multiple times in a day, spent almost 2 hours just for them to fix it. I gave all the information they asked for. They phone reps are also rude, very unprofessional and keeps on insisting things on me, offering to change my flight dates, things that I already specifically asked to not do. They are also not apologetic of the inconvenience, of their mistake. of all the stress they brought me. None. They refuse to give any compensation for all the problems they brought. Then comes the flight day, the ticket is cancelled again. They never called me or sent email. No nothing. Then 1 hour after they cancelled the ticket, I received an email notice in the same format as a purchase confirmation, it says you're cleared off and ready for takeoff to Sto Domingo, and there was just a note at the very bottom, that they voided the ticket because they need information, asking me to call them back.

### "Stuck at the Airport for 22 hours now"
Terrible airline. Stuck at the Airport for 22 hours now. I spent an $60 on just food. No apologies. No refund. No food voucher. I have not seen my bags in 24 hours . Don't know if they still have them. They been pushing back every hour flight. Zero sleep.

### "Do not choose this airline"
The customer service with this airline is terrible. We have been trying to contact someone in the lost luggage department since Nov 9th 2021 and haven’t had any replies. They finally replied to us on Dec 11 2021 only to say that our lost luggage report has been closed. I will never fly with them again. Do not choose this airline.

### "Aeromexico is like those street vendors"
I bought a premium economy ticket (almost double the price of a common ticket) because I needed to dispatch a luggage. The website stated that 25kg is the maximum. As I have some special needs, my luggage weighted 24kg leaving Brazil, when I had no problem. I carefully control luggage weight, and at the end of the trip, I had 24,5kg. When I checked-in Cancún airport, I was told that 25kg is only allowed in domestic flights in Mexico, and for international flights the limit is 23kg (despite the site stating otherwise at the time of sale), and I would have to pay 100 USD for the extra 1,5kg in the CDMX-São Paulo leg of the trip. I did not pay this and had to take something out of the luggage and carry by hand it to the cabin. I think Aeromexico is like those street vendors in the south of Mexico trying to squeeze every little cash from tourists in a “smart move”.

### "check-in process was downright horrific"
Our outbound flight from JFK to Mexico City was fine -- quick, easy boarding, separate queue for business class passengers, friendly staff, and very comfortable seats in the business cabin. The seats reclined fully to a flat bed (not really necessary for a daytime flight, but nice) and were very spacious. The return flight, however, was the worst business class experience I have ever had. There were many check-in lanes that said they were for SkyPriority passengers, but it seemed as if everyone on every flight was in that line, which took two hours to get us up to the desk and get our boarding pass. We were unable to check-in online (probably because of COVID verification requirements) and waited so long just to get a boarding pass -- we were not checking any bags) that we can within 5 minutes of missing our flight. At one point the check-in attendant said the problem was our fault because we came late -- but we were there more than two hours before our flight. The gate staff were very pleasant and handled the disgruntled crowds well, but the actual flight was disappointing. The seats were sub-par, uncomfortable and with no real footrest, and the staff, although very friendly and cheerful, were virtually absent most of the time. They didn't even respond to call buttons, and they kept the curtain closed during the entire flight so that anyone who wanted service (or to use the toilet, for that matter) had to pull it away and duck under it. I've never encountered cabin staff who kept themselves so isolated. It was a short flight, but memorable as deficient, and the check-in process was downright horrific. I'll avoid Aeromexico as much as I can in future.

### "wouldn’t refund or replace our ticket"
Not Verified |  Aeromexico took our families money and wouldn’t refund or replace our tickets after we couldn’t fly to Mexico during the start of COVID. We were suppose to fly in April 2020 and Mexico had shut down it’s border and didn’t open for a long time. Any company that is not willing to understand the circumstances of COVID and simply not refunding or helping in replacing purchased flights is crooked and is not to be trusted.

### "Avoid if you can"
The airline sucks, but most workers we interacted during the trip were trying to compensate it. Avoid if you can. Never ever have connection in MEX airport. We booked Aeromexico because it was the only flight with couple hours layover from SFO to LIM. The airline changed the flight schedule a few times and we eventually had 11 hours layover in the MEX airport. Aeromexico did not offer refund, but only voucher. Aeromexico customer service offered VIP lounge as a compensation, but in the MEX airport we were asked to pay for it. On our way back we had a horrible experience of waiting in line about TWO hours to pass MEX custom for connection stopover. There were thousands packed in the line. COVID social distance was totally ignored. That was a perfect place to spread COVID or any other decease. Very poor communication: 80% in-flight and boarding communication was in Spanish. Most of the staff in MEX did not speak English. The airline did not communicate COVID documents requirements before the flight. Our forms filled before flight were turned down. In-flight entertainment system was broken or misconfigured - the US movies did not have English subtitles.

### " You never know when you arrive and if your belongings will follow"
Worst travelling experience of my life. I booked a flight with them (only because options this year was limited). They cancelled it a week later and refused to refund me. So I had a voucher for my next flight but I could not apply it online. Had to spend hours on the phone to use it. On the flight day in Mexico City, the plane was going round on the tarmac. The captain announcing that they were waiting for the weather to clear up before taking off even though it was sunny. Then they parked the plane and asked 17 volunteers to get off because the plane was overloaded. By the time volunteers came forward, got off, with their baggage we were hours late all the while waiting in the plane. But that's not the worst. Once I finally arrived, my two pieces of luggage were missing and I was not the only one. So they threw them out along with the volunteers. One luggage was delivered to me a week later. The second one I never got back 3 weeks later. You never know when you arrive and if your belongings will follow. They have no luggage service (just one email address I wrote to multiple times along with their legal services) and never bother to answer. Nightmare. They treat customers like livestock.

### "my baggage was lost"
Upon arriving to Cancun, I was horrified to find out that my baggage was lost. I had paid $30 USD to check in this baggage, only to be disappointed. We had arrived very late, close to midnight. Waited and waited and could not find my baggage. Approached a staff, and they told me this happened all the time, they told me there were 2 more airlines that would arrive after us, and most likely my bags were mixed up and they promised to deliver that night. We had only 4 days to spend, after wasting one whole day (October 7th) getting from Houston to Cancun. Waited for someone to call me, at close to 3 a.m. I finally gave up. Next morning, I called Aeromexico and was given the run around, it was impossible to get a hold of someone who could tell me the status of my lost baggage. All my clothes, medication, snorkel gear was in that bag. We had an early excursion planned that day and had to cancel because I did not have all my clothing and gears. Facebook Chat staff was not courteous, Whatsapp them and it was pointless too, I could not get a hold of someone. Thankfully, one of the ladies at my hotel had a contact who worked at the airport, he gave me a Whatsapp contact and only then I was able to find out that my bag was found, but had no idea when they were able to deliver. We finally left for an excursion, and at around 2:00 p.m. on October 8th, they called to say they were going to deliver my bag. No sorry, no apology. To top it off, my son had a velcro patches of Texas Flag and U.S. flag, they were both missing. The velcro was really strong and it was impossible that it had fallen off by accident. I wanted to call to get my $30 checked in baggage refunded, but you could not imagine how hard it is. I am probably going to place a chargeback.

### "If you want to lose your money go ahead and book with this airline"
I'm a European citizen who was planning a trip to the USA and Mexico. However, because of a travel ban imposed by the US government, I am not allowed to travel. My booking is a non-refundable one. However, I want to travel, but I am not allowed to. I explained the situation to Aeromexico, and requested a voucher, which was denied. It not my fault that I am not allowed to travel, but Aeromexico doesn't care about it. They've already got my money, so they don't really care about giving me a chance to use the service I already paid for, once the travel ban is lifted. The customer care service is of extremely low quality. If you want to lose your money go ahead and book with this airline. By seeing all those negative reviews, it seems apparent to me that Aeromexico has financial difficulties.

### "can't make any changes online"
I haven't travelled yet but I am dreading it already. You simply can't make any changes online and when you call them, their phone system is insane. They speak English but their lines are muffled and unclear, take forever to answer then charge you double the cost of the ticket online because you called a call centre, but they dont give you any option to do it online anyway. So antiquated. Be sure your flights you book are 100% what you need because making changes after the event is near on impossible without being robbed financially!

### "rude and unaccommodating"
My partner and I had our first flight with Aeromexico from Amsterdam to Mexico city and then to Puerto Vallarta on 18-19/Aug. There were delays (30-60min.) and the cabin crew was rude and unaccommodating. We don't speak Spanish and it was obvious that they had a problem with that. Especially one lady who was really nice to all Spanish speaking passengers but when I asked her something I got just one word answer in a really impolite way. Another flight with Aeromexico was supposed to be from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and from there to Vancouver on 25/Aug. As the first flight got delay almost 3 hours we weren't able to catch our second flight. Lady at the PV airport was unhelpful, and after we approached her, she told us that we had just 2 options. Stay one more night and take the same route next day, or take the first flight to Mexico city and wait there for the second flight to Vancouver till next day. We've been told that it wasn't Aeromexico's fault therefore they won't provide us hotel or meals. After we got out, to our surprise our original flight to Vancouver just began boarding right at the next gate. We happily get there to realize that we can not get in. Why? Nobody knows again. At first they told us because of "weight and balance" after that because they didn't have available seats and so on. It was two of us and another 15-20 people including families with small children who weren't able to get in. We were trying to understand this situation but after 30 minutes no reasonable explanation came. We accepted vouchers for hotel and meals as at the airport in Mexico city miraculously could provide them. Next day after we got back to the airport we were trying to get confirmation about the flight delay as we supposed to be already in the work in that time but we were stuck in Mexico. Of course customer service at the airport was as bad as the lady at our first flight so we got nothing. Finally 50 minutes after our flight was scheduled we were finally boarding, still not sure if we can get in this time. We got in and after almost an hour we started rolling and captain is speaking to us. Unfortunately we had to have a stop in Tijuana to get fuel. In the end this flight had 3 hours delay (+24 hours). I never heard sorry or any kind of apology till this moment. One more thing, after we got vouchers for meals and hotel we've been told that we can catch Aeromexico shuttle in front of the T2 gate which take us to the hotel. We've been there for almost 30 min. and what we've seen was just shuttle for crew. At the hotel we've learned that we should have vouchers for taxi too but we didn't have them so we paid 2 fairs with taxi by ourselves. I would like to see my money for this last flight back but after I read many bad reviews about Aeromexico I think I'll never see them again but I'm more then sure that I will never ever fly again with Aeromexico.

### "both times we were late"
Not Verified |  I had two flights with round trip and both times we were late. The first trip did not matter because Guadalajara was my first destination but return was crucial because I had another flight to take after landing in Salt Lake City. We did not even have an hour to board the next plane and to add insult to injury Delta Air Lines had departure was at 11:30 am and I arrive at the terminal at 11:27. Me and another person are left stranded today until 10:10 pm, unbelievable.

### "Aeromexico really put my nerves to the test"
I have flown on many airlines and have had few problems. I consider myself pretty easy going but Aeromexico really put my nerves to the test. I will just make a list: -My luggage was broken into and my jewellery stolen during my 5 hour layover in Mexico City on my way to Los Cabos. I reached out to the complaints department but not surprisingly no one has responded (weeks later). Upon my return to Toronto, I once again had a short layover for 2 hours in Mexico City. While lining up at the gate to get on the aircraft, the staff closed the door while 15 passengers remained behind standing, me and my family included. it was stressful, messy and confusing and the staff said nothing to us about what was happening, they just pointed a finger for us to go to customer service. That's when we discovered we had been bumped off our flight for the next 24 hours and they couldn't even guarantee us that we wouldn't be bumped again the next day. The customer service rep. explained that we couldn't go on the flight because of weight/balance issues, and that's when my husband and I came to the conclusion that passengers are being kicked off the flight in order to make room for more lucrative cargo. We collected our luggage for the 24 hour delay because after my initial experience, we did not trust our luggage sitting in the Airport with out them being rummaged through and items stolen. When we received our luggage, my bag was heavily damaged and a wheel completed ripped off so I could barely manage rolling it around the airport and to our hotel. The next day we checked in 3 hours before our flight because we wanted to avoid any issues. The line up at the gate was a crowded mess, it felt like I was going to get trampled on. Once seated and on the plane the crew made an announcement that a few passengers would not be coming on the plane again and that their luggage needed to be removed from the plane. So the airline was again doing to others what we experienced the day before. At that point, the passenger sitting behind me told the flight attendant that she just saw the ground crew taking her bag off the plane even though she was still on it, at which point the flight attendant left for a couple minutes and when he came back the plane just started to pull out and he said there was nothing he could do about it at this point. Once we arrived in Toronto Pearson Airport, and made it through customs, my husband and I discovered that our luggage was also taken off the plane in Mexico City. After filling out the necessary paperwork, the Aeromexico luggage attendant informed us that we should have our luggage delivered to us no later than Tuesday September 7th. It has been 4 days now since we landed, with multiple phone calls and emails made on my part, no one from Aeromexico has contacted us about its whereabouts. And after having my personal items stolen out of my luggage on my 5 hour layover in Mexico City, I can only imagine what I will or will not have left in my luggage if Aeromexico ever returns our luggage to us. However, my daughters luggage WAS on the plane, and upon returning home she discovered she still had all her items in her bag but she also had extra items. Shirts and skirts that did not belong to her, which means the baggage staff at Aeromexico is opening peoples luggage to look for valuables and is just stuffing personal items back haphazardly in random suitcases. That tells me that many people are missing items.

### "Never fly Aeromexico!"
Not Verified |  Never fly Aeromexico! I cancelled my reservation and they told me they will issue a refund in one year! I tried to use an electronic voucher issued by Aeromexico and on the screen it appeared that it was used and the amount to be charged to my credit card was lower. A higher amount was actually charged and when I called to resolve this they said that they will issue a refund on a valid voucher in 12 months' time. I told that that it's unacceptable and cancelled the entire reservation. The refund for the entire reservation will also be issued in 12 month's time. With Aeromexico charging customers and not providing service, will it exist next year?

### "never book Aeromexico again"
Not Verified |  We are not able to fly out for vacation. Aeromexico will not reschedule, hold or refund. Our tickets where $589.06 and they will do nothing to help. I will never book Aeromexico again.

### "never travel using Aeromexico again"
First- checking in for our flight was a nightmare. We understand that Aeromexico is a partner with Delta, and with Delta, we don't pay for our checked baggage because we hold the Delta Reserve and Gold memberships, etc. Either way, Aeromexico said that they wouldn't honor but 1/6 bags to be checked for free (there were 6 of us traveling). I spend a significant amount of money with Delta and have many perks for a good reason, so I couldn't understand that if Aeromexico decides to be "partners" with a large company, then they should honor the rewards given to the customers. So we had to pay for 5 bags to be checked, and was told to "take it up with Delta. This is poor and awful customer service and we will never travel using Aeromexico again. Our flight had a rough take off and landing.

### "I would not recommend Aeromexico"
Our couple and my friend couple had a transit at Mexico City coming on the way back from Cancun. We are only 45 minutes away to board the plane and the Aeromexico security lady told us to go out and test the covid test again because they don’t accept the covid done and signed by doctor from the hotel where we lives . The test was done professionally and appropriately by the hotel and I can tell by my medical professional background . We told them that we are afraid to miss the flight but she insist for us to go do the test . We have to pay about $41 for the test again . But the test center they recommended didn’t even do appropriately . They only swab on one side of nostril and not even PCR test which is more specific screening. We have to wait to gets the test result for about 20 minutes . We missed the flight when we come back through the airport security. We went and saw the airline receptionist and they told us to go out of the security gate again to see supervisor . Supervisor named ( Darion ) is very unprofessional. His expression says he doesn’t care and he didn’t even say sorry. He said our covid test at the hotel is invalid because it is expired. But the test was done actually within 72 hours period according to all the airline covid requirement. He literally lie to our face. My other’s friend and her five family members takes Alaska airline on the same day and they accept the same covid test done by the hotel. But they refund the air ticket and we have to stay at the airport all night long to wait for another flight. They didn’t even give us the hotel fees. We have go through security twice which is a horrible experience. This will be the first and last time to travel with Aeromexico. I would not recommend Aeromexico to any of my friend and family members .

### "Worst air travel experience ever"
Worst air travel experience ever. Stranded at LAX for 12 hours because of flight delay and schedule change. Then a 3 hour layover in Mexico city became 13 hour layover. Luggage wasn't checked all the way to final destination. Then had to pick up luggage and denied check in because our flight was 13 hours away. Food was horrible as well. Chicken was rubbery. Steak was dry. Ice cream was melted. Avocado was unripened. Only good thing was the orange juice. Also got a dirty blanket even though it was sealed in plastic. 1st and last time flying Aeromexico.

### "They lost my luggage"
Not Verified |  Airline is not organized at all. They lost my luggage and made a report and they keep blaming each other. Ruined my trip to Mexico because had no clothes to wear having to spend money for items that were in my luggage. I'm home still calling for my luggage and they keep telling me to call back. Hope this review helps someone who's planning to travel with this airline. Be careful with your luggage.

### "The staff and crew were rude to me and my family"
When my family and I attempted to board our connecting flight we were stopped saying our Covid tests would not work and we had to be retested. I received valid Covid tests for me and my family and the airline refused to accept them staying that they "cannot be from a doctor" and can only come from a laboratory. The website from cdc.gov says nothing of the sort and even allows at home rapid antigen tests as long as they meet certain criteria. Because Aeromexico would not accept my perfectly valid tests I and my family had to be retested at the airport, spending another 2300 pesos, missed our original connecting flight and spent over eight hours in the airport waiting for another flight to our final destination. The staff and crew were rude to me and my family, they did not have a valid reason for refusal other than being obviously money hungry. I will not recommend anyone use Aeromexico and I will personally never use them again. Do to this poor experience it affected all other aspects of the flight from seating comfort to snack quality. When we asked to see the supervisor they refused until it was too late to change anything. If I could give less than 1 star I would.

### "Crew service came off as stoic and icy"
I got to fly in business class with Aeromexico as part of a birthday trip. Check-in was handled by Delta and the sky priority experience was fast and easy though it could have been more welcoming. My seat was 1J and an excellent product for a four hour journey. The seat didn't grant direct aisle access however. Once seated, I was asked if I wanted a welcome drink from the crew. Meals rolled out an hour into the flight and a choice between pasta and salmon was offered, I chose the salmon, there were four pieces of raw salmon with cream cheese, sliced bagel, salad and a cheesecake. Meal left a bit to be desired. Cheesecake was good. Crew service came off as stoic and icy. Despite my many thank yous and smiles, the crew serving my section felt serious the whole time. For the rest of the flight, I enjoyed watching films and staring into the clouds through the wide window aboard the 787. Would I fly this product again? My answer is perhaps because the experience is likely better than what's available on this route compared to the competition, but not enthusiastically.

### "I am stuck with my dog in Cancun"
Terrible airline!! Trying to submit the form for my emotional support dog but it says that I am out of 48 hours window of my flight which is not true. I am flying 17 July, 7.29 am. On the website it says that I must submit the form within 48 hours. My flight is in 18 hours and I can’t fly without my dog. I called the customer support yesterday, the guy just told me that he can’t help me, that he just sells tickets, and I need to write an email to connect with real customer support. What is that, he can’t help, and I need to wait for the email response. But no one still has answered. Still my dog is not added. I tried to call today, this time the lady tried to help me, she confirmed that there is an error on your official website, and provided me with the email to submit my documents to add my dog to the flight. But no one has responded! Additionally I received an email from Aeromexico to check in before the flight which isn’t possible too, the system shows an error! What is that, your website provides with the false info and doesn’t work at all! Aeromexico do something about it. Now I am stuck with my dog in Cancun and don’t know what to do.

### "very rude to our family"
Not Verified |  First of all we had book through Delta Airlines a few months back and we received an email that our flight had been changed to Aeromexico. We thought no big deal. We get to IAH in Houston Texas for our family flight to Cancun Mexico with a 3 hour layover in Mexico City. We go to check our bags and we were told that we have to pay for baggage (First Strike because we are Delta Sky Miles Members we thought that because Delta switched us that our baggage would still be free.... Nope $130 one way) Okay so our frustration level has raised up. Now the only thing that was not Aeromexico's fault was that we had a traveler with us that thought the US Passport Card was good for air travel well it's not and the rude with no compassion agent at check in let us know in more ways than one. We just asked her a simple question and we were told not to waste her time with questions (Strike two and Anger Level just went up a notch) We checked our bags and received our boarding passes all the way through to Cancun. Meanwhile we had to arrange to have our one traveler transportation home. We ran to the gate and the agent that checked us in was at the gate and once again very rude to our family which we never said a word to her that would make anyone treat a customer like she treated us. We boarded and arrived in Mexico City. As our family was getting off the flight I wanted to see what gate our connecting flight to Cancun would be and there was no gate number or seat assignments. We never noticed it before we left Houston because of that situation. Well on our tickets they all had standby. Anger level just went up again. We figured out what gate our flight to Cancun was and went to the gate and I went up to the agent and asked why were we put on standby? He said no clue but we were not going to get on the flight because it was overbooked. Now we had arranged for pickup in Cancun for 8:30pm and so we have to figure out what flight we will have to get on if any to get to Cancun. Lucky thing Delta had a little customer service desk and they were able to get us on the next flight out which was an hour later and we were able to get a hold of our transportation. We finally arrived in Cancun around 10:00pm. Trip from hell over. Now this is what I don't understand. I have flown all over the world and have had hundreds of connecting flights and I have never in my over 30 years of flying ever been issued a standby ticket for a connecting flight.

### "rudest I have ever met"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I’ve had! They charged my card $400 for upgraded seats that I never got. They refused to give me customer service. Staff in the Cancun airport are the rudest I have ever met. Never flying with them again.

### "Last time I fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible check-in experience! The line is ridiculously long for no reason other than the staff is extremely incompetent and slow. They take more than 30 minutes with one passenger and then socialize after for another 10 minutes before calling anyone up. Yes the staff is lost, unprofessional and have absolutely no idea what they are doing. Last time I fly with this airline.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. They make everything difficult. I am trying to postpone a trip in May 2021 due to Covid and they don't care. Aeromexico doesn't care about health and safety or their customers. They should not make it such a difficult stressful ordeal to conduct business with them. They will never give you the customer service you deserve.

### "requested multiple times for a refund"
Not Verified |  This is the worst company to fly with! When covid happened, Aeromexico cancelled my ticket and gave me a voucher. I was supposed to go to a wedding and the wedding had passed. I requested multiple times for a refund. I kept getting refused and it’s been hard for me because I cannot afford to travel due to the current situations and I am suffering financially!

### "Unnecessarily stressful"
Chaotic and inefficient check in and boarding. Plane overbooked and they put us on standby but we did make in on the plane after insisting we had to make the flight. Unnecessarily stressful.

### "Aeromexico security said my test was no good"
Not Verified |  We were returning from Cancun with a 2 stop flight to Fresno, CA. 1 stop MEX, 2nd in GDL. When we boarded in Cancun Aeromexico security checked my negative covid test that was taken at the hotel and said everything was good. In Mexico City the same answer. But at GDL I was stopped by Aeromexico security who said my test was no good, that I had to go across the street at the parking lot they had a lab. This was no lab. The lab at the hotel is much better and more professional. I stayed at a nice hotel and I just had a family return the day before with the same test and they made it back with no problems. I overheard them saying that they had oversold tickets and we were kicked off. The test was performed by a licensed doctor at the hotel and signed. They made us wait till the next day to board plane and retake the covid test. Everything was fine with customer service up until that point. Airline shouldn't be kicking people off plane cause they over sell, especially when you have all required documents.

### "Very bad customer service"
I have tried to communicate with you very actively and it has not been possible. Very bad customer service! They misled me in a bad way, over selling my seat, they sat me further back and they did not refund my money. In addition, they charged me for my luggage as if I had only had the ticket where you sat me. Traveling alone with a 2-month-old baby I was forced to pay for everything they said and thinking that they would call me to pay for the error, wherever and whenever as your staff at SDQ instructed me. Not only have they not called me, but they don't even answer any of my attempts at communication. I would never recommend your services, I am going to be in charge of telling and making public with evidence this outrage to a client of your "premier club". ES: He intentado comunicarme con ustedes de forma muy activa y no ha sido posible... Muy mal servicio al cliente! Me engañaron de mala manera, sobre vendiendo mi asiento, me sentaron más atrás y no me devolvieron el dinero. A parte me cobraron el equipaje como si hubiera tenido solo el boleto donde ustedes me sentaron... Viajando sola con una bebé de 2 meses me vi obligada a pagar todo lo que decían y pensando que me llamarían a retribuir por el error aborde donde y como su personal en SDQ me ordenó. No sólo que no me han llamado, sino que ni siquiera contestan a ninguno de mis intentos de comunicación. Jamás recomendaría sus servicios, me voy a encargar de contar y hacer público con evidencias este atropello a una cliente de su "club premier

### "nothing has been done to fix this mistake"
Not Verified |  I had booked a flight with Aeromexico back in December and I wanted to leave my tickets open and was told to just make sure I booked my flight by the end of the year 2021. I had called in multiple times to book my flight since we had decided on a date and was denied this request. They stated to me I had to wait 10 days for a response from their customer service to be able to change the tickets. I waited the 10 days like I was told I even gave it an extra 2 days to wait. Called again like I was told to do and was told it would take 20 days now to get this resolved. I was told by 4 different representatives it would take 10 then all of the sudden by one it change to 20 days. This is ridiculous and still nothing has been done to fix this mistake.

### "First and last time I fly with them"
Not Verified |  I purchased several airline tickets to fly with the family for vacation. I needed to make a change. And no it wasn't a last minute thing. I did with 2 months prior to departure. They have the worst customer service. First to get someone to answer your call as I tried several days and no one answers the phone good luck. Its like playing the lottery with them. And then after the 4th day ( my lucky day because they answered) after one hour of waiting. They can't make my change they said. And if I choose for them to make the change then I would incur additional fees of $900. Are you kidding me. They are obviously not making the money because of all the upset customers they have. That they are trying to make money with any fees they can implement. terrible. First and last time I fly with them.

### "tells me my reservations don’t exist"
I purchased a round trip, needed to come back sooner then anticipated they for some reason couldn’t switch the dates so I lost that money. Fine so then I booked a flight for three to come back home they took my money it went through it was taken out of my bank acct up until today which is May 22 and I still haven’t received it back. When I get to the airport with two minors Aeromexico tells me my reservations don’t exist, yet they grabbed my money and I got stuck in Guadalajara with two kids. I will never fly with Aeromexico again. Nor will I recommend anyone to that airline. I’ve had problems with them since the flights were booked. I spent over $3500 dollars this April just with this airline. I was able to fly back after purchasing $1600 worth in tickets with another airline.

### "won’t give any credits or refund"
Not Verified |  I called Customer Service to cancel My flight that was departing to Mexico City early next day. I explained that I won't be able to make the flight since that day at my office one of the employees was tested positive and I was in close contact with him. The agent had 0 customer service he was helpless and told me that I won’t get any refund or future credit and told me go write an email and explain them they will answer you in few days but I won’t help you. After I wrote the email explaining everything I received a Standard email response that I think it’s an Automatic response that they just to everyone without even bothering to read the circumstances stating that they won’t give any credits or refund and they hope to see me travel with them again.

### "Please do yourself a favor and choose another airline!"
This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Horrible customer service. I do not know how this airline is in business. Just try and call them, even their phones contacts can't help you and have hang up on you no matter how nice you are trying to be. Try sending them an email using the email on their website - it doesn't work! Warning - do not miss your connecting flight! Had to re-purchase my connecting flight from Mexico City to Mazatan which cancelled all my tickets for my return flight home 2 days later. Please read all the other reviews before using this airline. Please do yourself a favor and choose another airline!

### "worst airline I've ever had to deal with"
Not Verified |  There was one flight out of Utila on CMAirlines and one flight out of Honduras on Aeromexico. I had an hour before my flight and they refused to board me. They wasted an hour when they could have just put me through security and gotten me to the gate on time. The woman at the Aeromexico desk said "I'm sorry this desk is closed" and walked away without even trying to book me onto the next flight. I ended up booking a flight on United and lost the $1000 I spent on my Aeromexico flight. Aeromexico is the worst airline I've ever had to deal with and I will never fly with them again. I've tried calling their customer service lines and I have never once reached a human. Don't ever fly on Aeromexico.

### "phone number that no one answers"
Just to start off, they're customer service is you calling a phone number that no one answers. Now to the actual flight, they made me miss my layover they basically told me to buy a ticket for twice as much or to not take my luggage. The supervisor wouldn't even listen, and told me to go straight to buy another ticket. Another couple had the same issue, but they booked through another airline, and were able to not only get not only a reschedule but also their hotel room for the night. I went to another airline, and they gave me better options and very quick help, and it only took them 5 minutes. My only regret is having to wait for more than two hours for Aeromexico's customer service and not getting a flight the same day with the other airline.

### "I've been tirelessly trying to speak to an Aeromexico agent"
Not Verified |  My honeymoon was cancelled due to Covid. The booking company refunded me the hotel but not the airfare, they told me to deal directly with Aeromexico in order to get a voucher (not a refund). I accept that I cannot get a refund, its their policy, but give me an extension to utilize my paid fare. I am very upset because I've been tirelessly trying to speak to an Aeromexico agent to book my new travel plans and it is virtually impossible to get through. Originally I was given one ticket number, apparently I need two ticket numbers for the two plane tickets originally purchased, the agent I spoke to yesterday did not want to bother to search for them under my name and so after a 46 minute hold had to hang up the phone and call back later. Today I got through someone on the live chat and was charging me an additional $533.94 on top of my $910.84 paid value, when I responded a minute and a half later, the chat was closed. They wanted to charge me $1,444.78 for regular cabin plane tickets for a trip 6 months from now. I do not know where else to go and take care of this injustice.

### "extremely dishonest airline"
Aeromexico is an extremely dishonest airline. They will do absolutely anything to keep your money and refuse any rebookings or recourse. Today we were refused entry to a flight despite showing the new COVID measures to enter Colombia do not require a COVID test. Despite that we were refused entry and the employee refused to rebook us; furthermore no one ever answers the customer service, even after a 2 hour wait. Calling back and accessing option 4 for the Premium ticket holder (which we were) simply disconnects the line. Attempting to rebook online requires a 13-digit ticket number. The tickets issued by Aeromexico are only 12 digits. If you put an extra digit on the end, you will be told that your ticket cannot be changed and to call the customer service. Aeromexico are beyond a terrible airline.

### "has to start communicating better"
Aeromexico has to start communicating better because this is completely unacceptable. I had a connecting returning flight from Cancun international airport with a stop in Mexico City and then to JFK NYC. I was not able to check in the night before and I was told by the website to check in at the airport, which wasn’t a problem for me. I left my location 3 hours before my flight departure just to be told on arrival that my flight gate closed an hour before which is odd but fair enough, they can make their own rules. My issue is that on the check-in site via Aeromexico, they don’t tell you what time boarding starts. If I knew what time boarding starts, I would’ve been on time without a doubt. I have never missed a flight in my entire 25 years of living because I’m extremely punctual and Aeromexico better hope I get compensated for this hot mess they call an airline.

### "not offering the flight we paid for"
Not Verified |  So, we booked flights with them leaving April 16 2020 leaving Cleveland OH to Cozumel MX for 7 people. Dur to Covid 19 shut down we were in lock down and flights were cancelled. We called and was told our tickets would be extended for a year. I would have to book by April 30, 2021 and fly by Nov 30, 2021. I have been trying to get these tickets rebook for a couple of weeks. Yesterday I was transfer or put on hold five times and each time the calls were dropped and long wait times. What I did find out is they have no flight from Cleveland nor are they flying into Cozumel. They are only flying from Pittsburgh or Buffalo to Cancun MX. What this means is we now have to drive to Pittsburgh or Buffalo then when we arrive in Cancun, we have to hire a van to transport us 1 hour to Playa del Carmen then again pay for a 1-hour ferry ride to Cozumel. Then repeat the process to get back. To top it off while we paid $431.33 for the original ticket. Now that they are not offering the flight we paid for and we have to jump though hoops to get to our destination Areomexico in partnership with Delta Airlines are changing us an additional $953.40. I had to book flights for two more people. That done I get the email with the ticket in Spanish that I cant read and they never sent the ticket for the 7 that we had to change. I was on the line this time for 3 hours and 38 minutes!

### "problem was with the luggage handling"
The flight in general was great, the problem was with the luggage handling, one of our suitcases was severely damaged when we arrived in Puerto Vallarta, we contacted customer support to get help and a solution to replace or fix our suitcase, I contacted them almost daily to try and resolve the issue as I had no suitcase for my flight back due to their mishandling of the luggage, and the only response I got was "someone will contact you in the coming days". This never happened, no one ever contacted me and no one even tried to fix my problem. In the end, I had to get my bag wrapped with plastic and call it a day! Their lack of support or customer service is very disappointing, I used to recommend Aeromexico as a good airline, now I would say, be careful and pray that you don't run into any issues, otherwise you will never get a solution to your problem, such a shame that they do not help themselves by helping their customers, this is something caused by them with no accountability whatsoever.

### "the staff is rude"
I had confirmed a return date but the airline changed it saying I wanted that date. I spent half my vacation trying to change it back but the airline kept hanging up on me and then blocked my calls. I had to buy a second ticket to go home including one for my son who is 1 yr old but they charged his ticket as an adult. No one at the offices or even the airport could help me with the mistake. They all said I had to call their call center which screened my calls. I finally got an answer by email saying they would call back and im still waiting on that call. Plus the staff is rude. They don't even say excuse me when they pass by. They only offered what looked like a flat day old sandwich and that was on the return flight. On the first flight they only offered peanuts and they couldn't even offer milk for my son.

### "A lot of room for improvement"
I have taken the same roundtrip route twice in the past 3 months. The airplanes are in good shape. Some torn parts in magazine holders but otherwise clean and in perfect condition. Seats lay flat even on the Boeing 787 1 hr 45 minute flight Mexico-Cancun. The long haul flights leave at 10:00 pm or later in both directions. The lounge used by Skyteam in Buenos Aires has been closed for months. No lounge in Cancun. At the Premier lounge in Mexico meals are charged and by no means at a nominal fee. Although the menu offers two vegetarian choices at $10, one was not available. Free are only salty or sweet snacks. Only water or juice served on board prior to departure in business class in the long haul flights. It takes over 45 minutes after take off for the flight attendants to offer anything to drink or serve dinner. The snacks served in the Cancun-Mexico are either salty or sweet. Flight attendants correct but not friendly. Selection of movies limited to18 and exactly the same ones in December, February and March. A lot of room for improvement.

### "I have not yet got my money back"
We would fly from Amsterdam to San Jose (Costa Rica) on July 15, 2020. This was booked on January 19, 2020 at with airline Aeromexico. The flight has been canceled due to Covid. It is now March 2021 and I can report that I have not yet got my money back and I do have vouchers (of 75% of the €3300 that I paid) but that I may also book me another €150 per ticket 'service fees' costs. I think Aeromexico are downright scammers, it really is a shame that they are members of Skyteam. A few facts: - I paid €3300 for tickets, which were converted into a credit in Russian Rubles without my knowledge so that they are now only worth €2600. Aeromexico filed for bankruptcy (Chapter 11) in July 2020, so they do not have to refund people who booked before that time. They don't refund money, to any one. You will automatically receive vouchers, but you have to pay a service fee if you subsequently want to book a ticket. I have vouchers for 4 people, which cannot be exchanged for 1 person. You must therefore go on holiday with a group that you would go with 1.5 years ago. Downright scammers!

### "supervisor refused to let us board"
We were denied boarding because we were one of the last ones to stand up. There was a long line of people waiting to board and the supervisor refused to let us board. When we were on time and was a big line. Do yourself a favor and don't use this airline.

### "I was denied boarding"
Aeromexico has a front desk at CDMX Airport. The desk is not to help customers but to Sell tickets! (Who buys tickets at the airport unless forced to when missing a flight?) I was denied boarding because I had a digitized jpeg of my covid test instead of a digitized PDF (both are digitized images, what difference does it make about the device that recorded the image?). I explained this to Aeromexico flight but they had zero empathy for my situation and refused to help. They said they're sales, not customer service.

### "all of the employees were rude or lied straight to our faces"
Not Verified |  Never use this airline - avoid at all costs. We flew in from Cancun and during our layover our flight got canceled to the states due to weather. Upon returning to the airport for our new flight, we had all of our documents checked by workers twice at the gate before boarding started. Then five minutes before boarding began an employee came to us and told us we were missing a customs paper. I had to run back to Immigration, file for a new paper, pay 600 pesos and then go through customs again to get back to my flight. When we finally got to the gate, they asked for our boarding passes and then turned us away. The lady at the desk said "you were one minute late" and shut the door. I was begging them to please let us in, when another gentleman walked up, showed his boarding pass and was welcomed on. We were not. We had to buy new tickets for $774 USD to get on the next flight home. No one would help us, all of the employees were rude or lied straight to our faces. I will never fly with this company again.

### "brazenly violating American law"
On November 1, Aeromexico cancelled my flight to Santiago, which I booked through my travel agent, Chase. I requested a refund three times from Chase. Chase told me that due to the pandemic, Aeromexico inhibited Chase's ability to issue direct refunds to passengers, and Aeromexico's policy is to only offer travel credit even for flights that they cancel. Three and a half months after the cancellation, I still don't have my refund. Aeromexico is brazenly violating American law.

### "They oversell tickets"
They oversell tickets then leave people on purpose at the waiting room to board. The last place this can happen to you is in Ciudad De Mexico. They were asking people to stay and will give them $300 well no one wanted to stay so they board the passengers that overpay for the ticket and told the rest that the plane was close already. Force me to exit the airport to go change my fly outside and outside they play games and they force me to purchase another itinerary for $1,500.00 when my original ticket was round trip from Los Angeles to Guatemala for $550.00 I had no choice unless i wanted to stay at the airport in DF.

### "I have never felt so mistreated doing business anywhere"
Not Verified |  I gave this rating due to my awful experience returning from Mexico City to Tijuana. I arrived at the gate for my flight AM0170 at 6.13 am on Feb 6th, 2021. The flight was scheduled for a 6.35 departure. As I ran towards the gate one of the two attendants at the desk immediately left and closed the glass door behind him. When I presented the remaining attendant with my boarding pass he scornfully informed me that I was too late to board. There was still 23 minutes before departure. I pleaded with the gentleman to let me board, but it seemed to me he derived pleasure in my denial as he informed me "You're two minutes late. On my boarding pass, which I still have it clearly states boarding is at 6.00 am. It seems unreasonable to allow less than 13 minutes to board. I was forced to buy another ticket at a much higher price without a single concession offered. I have never felt so mistreated doing business anywhere. I cannot in good conscience recommend Aeromexico to a colleague or friend and would in fact discourage anyone from doing business with Aeromexico.

### "run-around when I tried to get a refund"
In brief, they cancelled my flight and then gave me the run-around when I tried to get a refund. In July of 2020 I bought a round-trip ticket London-Cancun for a friend for travel in August. Three days later they cancelled their London-Mexico City flights for the entire month of August. I called to find an alternative, but they couldn't offer me anything, save for travel credit. When I said I wanted a refund, the agent said I'd have to write to a dedicated email address. The email was returned as undeliverable, so I opened a dispute through my credit card, figuring I'd get my money back that way. AeroMexico objected to the dispute, saying my fare was non-refundable; they said I had credit to use within a year, minus a $200 no-show fee. A no-show fee for a cancelled flight. When I finally fixed the problem with their email address, they said that since I bought the ticket through a third party vendor (in this case Orbitz) I'd have to get the refund through them. Orbitz was helpful, but said they still had to go through AeroMexico for their approval before issuing a refund. Months went by, and all Orbitz could say was that the airlines are very slow these days and AeroMexico was not responding. So they have the manpower to object to my credit card dispute and keep my money, just not the manpower to approve my refund. I wrote to them several times about this discrepancy, but they never addressed that issue, just repeating I'd have to go through Orbitz. Let me add, I tried to be understanding. I can see that the airlines are strapped. I said I would accept credit in place of a refund if I could change the name of the passenger (which the rules disallow; remember I got this for a friend) and if the credit were not time restricted (which, so far as I can see, just helps them out even more). They said they could not do that because their policies do not allow it. Of course, their policies are under their control. They could change their policy if they wanted to, or just make an exception.

### "never book a flight with Aeromexico"
Not Verified |  This airline is a joke do not fly them unless you really need to be somewhere and there's no other option. I had to book a flight to see my mother before she died then I had to change my ticket for obvious reasons and they didn't care about the reason they still just wanted my money. They wanted me to pay a change fee that was as expensive as a new flight they put always profit before people. I ended up buying another ticket from them because that was the next available flight. This is really the worse service by far I have ever received from an airline and there are many really bad ones out there. Many airlines would have compassionate waivers in cases like mine but they don't care. Do yourself a favour and never book a flight with Aeromexico!

### "no social distancing implemented"
There was no priority boarding as was included in my ticket. We were boarded last (apparently a covid 19 measure) however, there was a huge crowded line for boarding which completely defeats the purpose. Additionally, no social distancing measures were implemented. Our so called “dedicated” overhead compartment was given to anybody and everybody and our luggages were moved farther away from us, to make space for other people’s luggage. No point buying their premium tickets because the services are the same, in-fact due to the covid measures you are better of getting the cheapest tickets and you will board first. Overall, they give empty promises and 0 services. Its an airline that calls itself premium but offers basic budget services. Overall don’t get high hopes about their quality.

### "only provide instructions in Spanish"
Not Verified |  They only provide instructions in Spanish. My husband and I were separated for a random security check. They don’t announce that it’s time to board. They also don’t put the flights they are boarding on the screen in front of the gate. We needed up paying an extra $700 because of their complete lack or organization when it comes to boarding.

### "not given any type of refund or credit"
Not Verified |  My granddaughter was getting married in Cancun Mexico in May, 2020. We needed to reschedule our flight for January due to the resort closed because of the pandemic. Now, in January we are not able to fly because of COVID and were not given any type of refund or credit. Will never book with Aeromexico again.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. I was on hold for over 2 hours to pay for travels fee and they kept disconnecting me. I had to call over 5 times to talk to a representative but they kept transferring me.

### "one of the worst experiences"
It’s one of the worst experiences I had flying. The check in is a nightmare, to get to the plane you take a 30 min bus ride, the flight was delayed. Avoid this airline even if you pay more! It’s not worth it.

### "did not even offer to refund the money"
I purchased a ticket from Mexico City to London on August 2, 2020. On August 9th, Aeromexico cancelled the flight. They did not even offer to refund the money paid for the ticket, as they must do by law. Rather, the cancellation message said that we could have an open ticket to any destination. To this date (December 23rd), Aeromexico has neither refunded the ticket price nor honored their offer for an open ticket. All I get when I call the airline are lies and more lies -- first, they said that the money had already been refunded, and then that I would get a voucher for 115% of the ticket price, but none of that is true. The airline's latest communication was to send us a notice informing us that our claim was subject to their bankruptcy proceeding in New York. Yet another lie - that proceeding does not affect any claim against the airline that was created after June 30, 2020. They'll probably also claim that the flight cancellation was caused by Covid, although they sold the ticket and cancelled the flight in August, well after they knew all about the pandemic's effect on air travel. (I suspect that their plan all along was to cancel the flight four weeks out and just keep the passengers' money.)

### "problem is with the change policy"
Not Verified |  The service was alright, my problem is with the change policy. Even with the pandemic in full swing and things going to a red light in Mexico City. They do not want to change my flight. I would not complain if every airline was doing the same thing, but they seem to not be doing any  changes for their basic fares. All i get is we cant do anything for you. I'm not canceling or asking for my money back just changing my flights date. I'll never use them again. I will avoid them.

### "a complete joke of an airline"
This is a complete joke of an airline. They disconnected on me 6 times for two days and issued me a voucher with the wrong date of birth that I cannot claim. Not only that, I have to prove to them that they caused the error to get the new voucher issued. I ended up disputing with credit card.

### "worst airline I’ve ever traveled"
It’s the worst airline I’ve ever traveled with they did not transfer the luggage is from one aircraft to another one we had a stop in Mexico for my next flight. Their customer service is the worst I had to contact them because they lost my luggage and kept it with them for days the day I received my luggage they wanted me to go pick it up at the airport and I said no they had to deliver to my home. To my surprise when I open my luggage everything was missing in my luggage her luck they had open my luggage and stole a lot of stuff in there they left me empty-handed, and the airline doesn’t want to accommodate me  and they don’t want to look into it. So don’t travel in this airline because customer service will not be held responsible or they will not help you at all. I had trouble before and the only problem is I had hat is it they have a lot of delays and other little things like those that I don’t care about but they stole a lock for my luggage I don’t even know how they opened it.

### "experience was extremely poor"
Not Verified |  This trip was almost a little sad, as Aeromexico have for years seemed to build a reputation as a quality airline. It seems however that the current economic situation is hitting Aeromexico hard and the service shows. Check in was poorly organized and I was somehow checked in twice (along with my two dogs) and social distancing was non existent in the chaos. Boarding was similarly poorly executed with distancing ignored and staff unable to create organization. On board the entertainment was good and Aeromexico has a good range of options. Food, however, was as bad as I have experienced in any transatlantic flight ... no choice just a simple pasta and pesto with a small bread roll (apparently times are so dire butter is outside of the budget). Breakfast was an inedible lunch Ivón croissant. Overall, while punctual and modern, the experience was extremely poor and it would seem Aeromexico is really hurting in these hard times. If you are flying from Mexico and can take another airline I recommend doing so, preferably also one with superior Covid 19 protocols.

### "This airline is totally unreliable"
Not Verified |  This airline is totally unreliable. First of all, trying to book a flight on the website is usually impossible, and when you try purchasing your flight over the phone, somehow, the flight prices are higher, even if online there's a cheaper price for the exact same flight. Today I wasn't allowed to check in and board my flight because I arrived an hour before the flight departure. I understand it's a policy to arrive two hours earlier, but I have never been left out an hour before the flight. As soon as I arrived to the desk the woman kept saying no without looking at me, no to everything I asked, even if her answer didn't make sense. I asked her to please give me a phone number and she didn't know anything. After I found one online and called, the person on the phone didn't know anything and said he couldn't help me, he could only purchase another flight for me. The staff are ignorant to anything there is to know about their job. I have never been truly helped by them.

### "clearly they have cut corners"
My past experiences of Aeromexico economy class have generally been very good but clearly they have cut corners to on long haul services to a degree which is unacceptable. The flight AM 004 from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Mexico City on the night of 31 October 2020 was fine in every respect but one: after five hours in transit at Charles de Gaulle the day after France went into lockdown meant one could not buy a drink, cup of coffee or food of any kind as everything was closed. When supper on board finally arrived after our 11 pm take off for a flying time of 11 hours and 55 minutes, it consisted of a small dish of ravioli, a tiny roll, a mini Kit Kat bar, a sliver of cheddar cheese and a small pudding. There were no vegetables or salads and there was no choice (usually there are two for the main course). More than 10 hours later breakfast came in quite a large box but consisted of a mini croissant butter and jam and a another mini Kit Kat bar. There were some alcoholic drinks on offer - wine, vodka, rum and tequila but no gin or mixers. There was a very poor and very limited choice of new films on their entertainment programme. Aeromexico staff are always respectful and pleasant but I could not hear any of the announcements from the cockpit or indeed any that were not pre-recorded because the volume was so low.

### "COVID policy is a pure lie"
Not Verified |  COVID policy is a pure lie. I asked for a change on family tickets because my daughter is sick. They have me waiting 1h45 and ask me to pay a price higher than the initial price when it is very clear that planes are empty. I asked to talk to a manager, she made me wait 15 minutes more, then terminated the call. Total lack of respect, avoid at any costs.

### "My experience was perfect"
When reading the bad reviews I almost decided not to book with them. But so glad I did. My experience was perfect. Staff was friendly and took all the needed measures to hygiene & safety by wearing masks and cleaning toilets multiple times during the flight. Every meal had a little bag of alcogel and all middle seats were kept empty. I had a stop-over in Mexico-City, without having to pick up luggage. It all arrived perfectly in my final destination! The inflight entertainment and the food are somewhat limited, but still good enough. I have no complaints and would even rate this flight better than several other American Airlines I've flown with. Especially as the ticket had the price of a low-budget airline.

### "do not go for Aeromexico"
Couldn't regret more to have booked in this airline. First, you can't do anything online, you have to call and it will take forever for someone to answer your call. Second, they want to charge me to change a flight, when I can't even fly cause it's not allowed due to Covid and when I mention that, they want to tell me there's no restrictions (they basically don't have the information), but luckly I had searched before and after a long call they would notice I couldn't fly, but still don't help. Should mention that they almost have no flexibility for changes (they don't care for Covid). Followed by terrible communication, not helpful or nice at all and can't even understand English well. After all, when I have a new day for my trip I will have to call again and spend God knows how much time (this one was about one hour). Honestly, if you have any chances of not flying, do not go for Aeromexico!

### "no refund would be given to me"
They canceled my flight from Cancun to Huatulco and therefore I had to buy two more tickets and a hotel night when I contacted them they told me that they canceled the flights due to Covid but that no refund would be given to me. Me cancelaron el vuelo de Cancún a Huatulco y por ende tuve que comprar dos boletos más y una noche de hotel cuando me comuniqué con ellos me dijeron que cancelaron los vuelos por Covid pero que no se me daría ningún rembolso

### "we’ve lost our money"
Our nightmare began April 17, 2020 when I attempted to purchase online flights to cancun MX. I completed the purchase of 2 tickets when a pop up box informed me the transaction had failed to try again. So, I did. The second time the transaction went through and I that moment I checked my email for a confirmation and found that I had in fact purchased 4 tickets in the same flight to Cancun. I immediately called the customer service line and spoke with Adrianna who assured me that they would refund the duplicate tickets. She issued 2 refundable tickets and said it would be 4 to 8 weeks before we would see the refund on our credit card. In the meantime, in walks COVID and our 2 other tickets are cancelled so I call and I am assured we have the option to fly for up to one year after our flight was cancelled. All good right? Not at all! No refund ever happened on the duplicate tickets and here we are in August. Our other tickets appear to be issued for June 2020 flights and no flights existed at that time that we were aware of. Our trip was medical in nature and needed priority but, no such luck. We ended flying on American thinking we’d book before our year was up to use the tickets. I don’t know what was done but there were no flights I could find on AeroMexico in June. We are desperately trying to get a refund on one set of tickets and flights that were promised on the other two. I’m afraid we’ve lost our money and what recourse do we have?

### "demand a voucher or a refund"
AeroMexico canceled my connecting flight from Mexico City to Cancun. I had to book another flight. And got no help from their costumer service. They answered only a few days after my flight was scheduled for departure. And they could do nothing for me which I find completely ridiculous. Not even a flight change proposition. I demand a voucher or a refund. This is not fair.

### "unorganized and frustrating"
Horrible experience. Flights kept getting changed right before the trip. The worst part was when my return flight was changed and it overlapped with my connecting flight home. How does this even happen? How can I be on two planes at the same time? Thankfully I caught this error before going to the airport, but Aeromexico should have reached out to get this sorted. On top of this, the fight was rescheduled for the next day, causing me to have to take an additional day off from work at the last minute. Boarding of the plane was unorganized and frustrating. Despite me paying extra to sit in premium economy, I was forced to board the plane last! This didn't make sense to me and caused me to have to check in my carry on at the gate because there wasn't enough storage space in the cabin by the time I got on the plane. This was my second time flying with Aeromexico. The first time my luggage was lost at one of my connecting flights and I was without my items for one week. I decided to give them a second chance this time, but this is the last time I fly with this airline. International travel is stressful enough and I shouldn't have to deal with incompetence and disorganization on top of that.

### "they cannot give me my money back"
I did not even get the chance to fly due to COVID-19. I completely understand the situation; what angers me is the company's complete disregard for its clients, their lack of ethics, and their greediness. It is almost as if they were using the current horrible emergency to scam passengers. I was bound to fly on the 4th of July; the flight got cancelled, but they only option they gave me was an open ticket to any route and any destination. They claim that they are waiving change fees, but that I will still have to pay the fare difference. The catch is that I was initially flying MEX-CDG-TLV and CDG-MEX; if now I want to change to say round MEX-IAH, I still have to pay a difference between 100-300 USD! If you quote a round MEX-IAH on this same company on the same date, you can get it for around the same price as the difference. Do note this: I wanted to fly on july 4th to attend a particular event and I decided to spend some of my money on that. The airline is unable to provide with the service I required, so I want my money back. Instead they tell me that they cannot give me my money back, in fact, they are penalizing me because they were unable to provide the service. Avoid this horrible company at all costs. When things go well, they are just another average airline, but when things go wrong, they show their true colors. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have such an experience with this airline. I give them 1/10 just because I cannot give them a negative score, but in my head they have around -3.5.

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico City to Cancún. Don't fly with this airline . During COVID 19 emergency they are still flying at capacity ! Nonetheless, when asked to be moved or why they are keeping flights at capacity I was left alone with a response of this is what it is, you wanted to fly to Cancun and this is what we have. Just not worth it . Estoy extremadamente preocupada y además dolida con el gobierno Mexicano al no poner restricciones de medidas de salud básicas. Estamos en una época donde la seguridad va más allá de la economía. Los vuelos están a capacidad en espacios reducidos y además de pésimo servicio al cliente Recibido por las azafatas . No obstante la única medida de regulación es la temperatura . Da tristeza tener que pensar que esta aerolínea no se preocupa por la seguridad de sus pasajeros y más solo en la remuneración económica.

### "extended our voucher's validity"
My family and I booked our flight tickets for Mexico in March and we were looking forward to our vacation in July 2020. Unfortunately due to the COVID outbreak we were starting to reconsider the trip and called customer service to inquire about our options. We contacted Aeroméxico in March to request a refund (over $3,000CAD). We were directed not to be haste and to hold on for a while longer, until we were closer to the departure date. On May 21st we called again Aeroméxico, requesting a refund for the 4 round flight tickets and we were informed, that unfortunately that would not be possible. The gentleman was very courteous, acknowledged our feelings and explained their policies regarding a refund. He then proceeded to inform us that Aeroméxico would, however, allow us to reissue the tickets for a later date; however, the flights would have to be rescheduled for a date no later than April 30th, 2020. At that point I e-mailed several letters to Aeroméxico Customer Service department and requested them to please extend the vouchers deadline (provided them with a time frame that would work for us) and explained valid reasons why we would not be able to travel within the time frame given. We also stated the reasons why we would not be able to travel this July. In my letter I also mentioned that I have been a frequent costumer and I have always enjoyed traveling with their airline and would like to continue to be a loyal customer. (We love Mexico and we love to travel there.) At the end, they stated that they appreciated our patience in resolving the matter and have extended our voucher's validity to our satisfaction. Would we have like a refund? Yes, of course! However, we tend to forget that everyone has been affected by the COVID pandemic, even big corporations have lost and are continuing to lose billions of dollars due to this unprecedented situation. All of us need to be united, understanding and try to find a compromise in which both parties will be pleased with the outcome. When filing a complaint, my advice is the following: Write a tactful and well written letter, state how you would like to resolve the matter, try to compromise and be persistent. Good luck to all of you!

### "refuse to give your money back"
I had a trip to Cuba with Delta that was cancelled amid Covid. I requested my refund without any problem. However, when i tried to get my money back from a cancelled flight amid Covid, it was horrible. To begin, I would like to say it was very hard to get someone. I tried all the numbers, the chat, no emails, messenger with a robot. Days of trying and waiting. I want to clarify that I understand this time that we are living, but in my opinion this was extreme. After exhaustion I finally was able to chat with someone. I wanted to change my flight to September. They wanted to charge me like $80 more per ticket and we are four. Just to change what was cancelled. For every written response I had to wait 5 minutes. It was not fluid. If you like it or not that's it. Pay more or lose it. Refund is not an option. They refuse to give your money back. The guy was telling me it was not their fault. It's not one's fault. You just suppose to take care of your clients. Lesson learned, do not flight Aeromexico. Not one can be happy with their policy during this time that we are living. Plus if I don't want to lose my money, I have to reserve before January and travel before April. I can't believe what they are doing. Getting rich at the expense of the crisis we are living.

### "Will not offer refund"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. Rude customer representatives. Never flew they emailed me & changed my flight & date then cancelled due to Covid 19. Will not offer refund they decided to keep customers money with hope of them using it in fortune but I will never use this airline in my life & I will let everyone know not to.

### "refused to refund the money"
Not Verified |  I book a flight with Aeromexico a few weeks ago, now they cancelled the flight 2 weeks from the departure. They refused to refund the money that i pay, that it was a round trip from Chile to Canada, (not cheap), even if they cancelled the flight. Is not the pandemic, some planes are flying anyway, and airports are open for the people that need it and have all the requirements to do so. Is them, they are just taking the money from people and cancelling flights. The only option that they give me was an open ticket with them. That means, just 1 ticket. that also I have to pay the difference and also an expensive fee for service?

### "staff did not act adequately"
Unfortunately there was an aggressive man on the plane, he pushed hard against my seat several times when I put my seat back to sleep. The staff did not act adequately, the flight attendant even walked away when the man became physical (he pushed hard against my seat). Supposedly to get security (I think? ), But the flight attendant returned alone. When I later stated that I did not feel safe and wondered aloud if it would happen again, the response was laughable. We don't know if he'll do it again, ma'am. I didn't feel taken seriously and was very scared for the rest of the flight. I sat down somewhere else, and I never came back to it. I felt unsafe for 8 hours in this 10 hour flight.

### "refuse to offer any refund"
Not Verified |  I had a flight booked from London to Mexico City on 2nd April, obviously this was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. I have since then spent countless hours on the phone trying to reach them as well as emailing them, they either never reply or just ignore what you say in your email. The Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that a cancelled flight has to be refunded if the passenger wants to, but Aeromexico refuse to offer any refund. Honestly some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. Aeromexico at least you've accomplished one thing, that is to persuade me to never fly again with you. Terrible terrible airline ! Do not fly with them - you with be riddled with problems if you do.

### "this airline is completely useless"
Absolutely frustrated by this company. Had a flight from Vancouver, BC, to San Salvador, El Salvador but El Salvador closed all borders as a result of COVID-19 and we would have been unable to land during travel dates (April 2 - April 17). Aeromexico cancelled the flight on me, and my family, and is refusing to extend their unhelpful ticket booking deadline. I was to fly with my grandparents, elderly and both are immunocompromised, but somehow Aeromexico still believes they'll still be safe and good to fly before Feb. 28, 2021. I explained many times, we would still fly with the airline they just need to extend the dates for ticket reissuing. It's a blatant disregard for the well being of their customers and simply proved that this airline is completely useless and doesn't know how to provide any valid options.

### "refused to refund me"
My flight was cancelled because of COVID-19, and they refused to refund me, like many other reviews suggest. I haven't received a credit either. I submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Transportation because flights operating in the US are required to refund passengers after cancelling their flights. I also disputed the charges through my credit card company. Aeromexico is very unethical!

### "refused to change the date"
Not Verified |  New York to Los Cabos. This is the most insensitive/money hungry airline I’ve ever had the displeasure of doing business with! My mom and I planned a trip to Cabo. However, due to COVID-19, we were on lockdown and as a result the date I booked the ticket for wouldn’t work. My mom is an essential employee and would not be granted the permission to take days off from work. Additionally, the extension date we were given would have coincide with my school. I explained I didn’t necessarily want to cancel my trip, I would have been fine with a later date then their deadline. They refused to change the date or give me a refund. Mind you I’m not an essential worker and lost my job due to the virus. They didn’t at all care, the only thing that mattered was their money! If you can’t count on a company during a tough time like this, when can you?

### "no respect for its passengers"
I don't recommend Aeromexico. I had a return La Paz to Mexico city and they canceled it probably because there were not enough passengers. Immediately, I tried to call the call center in the United States, without response; then Canada, without response, then a center in Europe, without response, too. I ended up buying another flight, so an additional cost with an expensive cost with the time spent on the phone because the internet was bad, and I couldn't call by Skype. So I wrote to their complaints department to request the reimbursement of half of my ticket (I made Mexico La Paz) which took weeks to answer me. And the response was up to Aeromexico's indignity. After a careful review of your case, we are sorry to inform that we will not be able to grant your request. Please allow us to share with you the reasons behind our decision: unfortunately, since your flights were canceled as a direct result of the regulations enforced during the COVID-19 threat, no refunds can be offered under those grounds. Nevertheless, since your flights were canceled due to the COVID-19 threat, your ticket qualifies for our protection policy that would allow us to rebook your unused flights, with the same traveling route and cabin, at no cost to you, as long as the new flights are completed before February the 28th of 2021. If the aforementioned policy does not meet your needs, you can make use of our flexibility policy that would allow you to make use of the value of your unused flights and change your traveling route or cabin, to book and complete your new flights before February the 28th of 2021; however, in this case, as there would be a change of route or cabin, if the value of the new flights desired exceeds the value of the original ones acquired, the difference in cost would have to be paid.We apologize for the inconveniences this decision may cause. We hope that you find our airline’s efforts useful. The answer was in April and my flight in March and their inaccessible call centers probably because they canceled a lot of flights. Aeromexico has no sense of service and no respect for its passengers.

### "will not give us our money back"
Bogota to Oaxaca via Mexico City. Given the current Covit-19 Pandemic and flight calculations world wide, an the fact that AeroMexico canceled and changed our flights five (5) times and on the fish time they did not provide a flight for the first flight [Bogota, Colombia, to Mexico City, Mexico] of our trip with them. And the fact that the last flight [Mexico City, Mexico, to Oaxaca, Mexico] was scheduled to land over 23 hours after our original booking time of arrival. We could not leave our home country so we had to cancel our trip and all flights. Every Airline carrier refunded our money except for AeroMexico who will not give us our money back. Complaint: It is a fact that we purchased two [2] Basic fair tickets, that Aeromexico clearly states are non-refundable. But I find Aeromexico’s business practices morally questionable and their rules and regulations to be deliberately vague and lacking in transparency. As they are able to place all of un-natural and natural occurrences and squarely places the blames on shoulders of its customers. Take for example the current Covid-19 pandemic. People, families, and whole nations are being quarantined by their local governments. And there is a very large percentage of people who last month had a full-time job, had money to do what they wanted in life, and did not know that their job my be on and will most likely be placed in unemployment until this pandemic can be better managed by the world. And at the same time people have to worry about meeting basic need and essentials [food, medical]. Then there are companies like Aeromexico who refuse to return their customers money when the service provider cannot provide a service. In the current humanitarian crisis that this pandemic is causing people all over the world, it must be nice for a service provider to take money for a service that their clients can’t possible use and then provide only two [2] forms of compensation; (1) new reservation at a later date, (2) or an open book-ticket. But given the epidemic and the growing percentage of deaths worldwide. It seems to me that people should get their money back so they can use it take care of themselves and their family. And yet it seems financially advantageous for a company to keep their clients’ money giving this worldwide Covit-19 epidemic and the fact that your clients have an ever-growing chance of dying from Covit-19 and get to keep that money for basically doing nothing. I find this possibility sickening and I hope this is not a business practice of AeroMexico. As a customer myself who cannot travel because Covid-19 and whose money you are basically trying to steal because I need it back and for the fact you canceled our original flight. I hope that I can get my money back. As it stands I am just unhappy customer who will never forget this.

### "Utterly useless"
Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Mexico City. Avoid. Their notion of Customer Service, doesn't understand what a Customer is, never mind the Service. Being told by the British PM to "not leave your home" because of COVID-19 was not understood as a reason as to why my flight needed to be cancelled. Asked to move it to another date - they did not understand how that would be possible. Utterly useless. Also, way overpriced, unless you get me there in half the time, review your ticket prices. It's a joke.

### "definitely recommend"
Not Verified | Torreon to Atlanta via México City. Our flight was canceled and Aeromexico paid for our new flight, hotel and meals. Phone wait time was only about 3 minutes. I would definitely recommend this airline to anyone.

### "The menu is very poor"
Mexico to New York JFK. At the last moment, the plane was changed from the new Boeing 787 to the first Boeing 787 with the layout  of seats 2-2-2. Armchairs are laid out in a bed, but not as comfortable as in the new one. The menu is very poor.

### "choose any airline but this"
Well, I purchased round trip tickets from Seattle to Veracruz with a layover in Mexico City and the person I was to meet up with in Veracruz cancelled so I figured I'd just stay in Mexico City and catch the returning flight later since it also had a layover in Mexico City and Aeromexico thanked me for doing business with them by cancelling the remaining flights that I paid for after I stayed in Mexico City. It is their anti-customer policies like that right there that make it so I will never use their airline again and I will continue to warn others to avoid this airline. They cancelled my flights and of course won't refund any money so I figure I'll get even with them by costing them money. Basically they have a policy in place for every little thing that can happen when you are traveling not to help you but to rip you off so do yourself a big favor and simply choose any airline but this one. Good luck and thanks for reading

### "big $ money maker for AeroMexico"
Merida to Mexico City. We booked a round trip Mexico City to Merida, Yucatan, Feb 15/March 1, 2020. Aeromexico changed the return trip departure time that did not allow sufficient time to go from the national terminal #2 to the international terminal #1 which also requires security clearance again. Distance between #2 to #1 is great and Terminal #1 is very large with much walking required. Long talks with agents and supervisors with inflexible responses. On two days the supervisors suggested I call back to speak with them on the following day to see if they would allow us to take an earlier flight to make our connections. Both times I called back at the suggested time and both of the names they had given me were unknown to anyone at the Houston call center. If they make a two hour or greater change their inflexible policy is only then accommodation is possible! They know exactly what they are doing to generate extra revenue. We were forced to buy an earlier flight at higher cost and they got to re-sell our now later flight a second time above my earlier booked price. We were held hostage in Mexico until we paid up or being trapped in Mexico City if we missed our flight home due to their change in departure time. They well knew this would impact many people on a large flight north. Result was that the inexpensive original return flight turned into double price for the earlier departure at premium (2 base cost +4 -premium double price equal 6 times the cost for a two hour flight and then their ability to resell my later flight seats a premium - a big $ money maker for AeroMexico. Look for any other options to save your self the same expensive trapped experience.

### "Very bad experience overall"
Cancun to Mexico City. Fast priority lane at check-in counter. No lounge available. Delayed flight with rather chaotic boarding. Comfortable seat. Most disappointing meal service. Cold lunch” turned to be nuts and a chocolate bar. The same as for “breakfast” on previous flight. Luggage took ages to be delivered at MEX and we were actually filling in a complaint at baggage service desk when our pieces finally showed up on belt (with priority tags on, delivered last and 15 minutes after regular luggage). Very bad experience overall. Frequent flyer miles not credited and had to complain.

### "disappointing meal service"
Mexico City to Cancun. Fast automated check-in, good lounge, efficient boarding, on-time flights, comfortable seat. Very disappointing meal service. Breakfast” turned to be nuts and a chocolate bar. Uneventful flight, and luggage quickly delivered on arrival. Frequent flyer miles not credited and had to complain.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Lima via Mexico City. I bought a ticket 3 months before my flight. It said last ticket and I wanted to be on the same flight with my wife and mother inlaw. So buying it under impulse it was $1650.00. Then my wife paid another $500 to get upgraded seats so we can all sit together and we have a baby. So she decided to check online a week ago if there was any seats available on the same flight. And behold there were many. The price was $1200. Then my wife emailed customer service and they told her nothing they can do. She then decided to check our seats, and they never did upgrade them. So I called them. I was on the phone for an hour until I finally asked to speak to a supervisor. He said to check my email and they will upgrade our seats. I waited and no email. 3 days went by and still no email. So I called again. They looked into it and asked us for more money to upgrade the seats. I told them I'm not giving them anymore money. After 2 hrs of arguing with them, they finally gave us the seats. They wouldn't do anything to adjust the price. They wouldnt give us anything for their mistake. I was so stressed with this. We'll see if they even give us the seats that we paid for when we fly next week. I will never fly with them again, even if it's for free. They are the worst business ever.

### "the worst airline ever!
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Mexico City. This is the worst airline ever. The seats are tiny and you cant move at all and really hard. The good is awful and you get two small meals on a ten hour flight, and one glass of water. The staff is rude, unfriendly.

### "I won't select this airline again"
Kansas City to Cancun. I booked through google flights and in the process somehow the dates of travel were changed. I booked the flight so I messed that up but I called the booking agency and they said they would take care of it. They tried to change my flight but Aeromexico wouldn't allow it. I reached out to Aeromexico and asked them to let me switch flights, they had open flights on the days that would work and I was happy to pay the increased fee for the new flights. The travel dates I needed were sooner than the booked flights and since they had open seats on the flights that would work I don't see any reason why they wouldn't have let me switch flights even if I was charged to do it. Their recommendation was to get on the plane anyway, knowing that it was after my work conference was over. Needless to say I won't select this airline again since now I'm going to pay for my ticket twice.

### "Horrible customer experience"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Mexico City. Horrible customer service experience. Booked Aeromexico operated flight through Delta, and while seats showed as reserved on Delta's side, it was impossible to verify this on Aeromexico's system (the carrier actually operating the flight). Apparently, every time I logged into Aeromexico's website, it automatically erases my seat selection, which is insane. Therefore, I had no guarantee that the seats were actually reserved! Horrible customer experience in this day and age

### "Never again. So Disappointed"
London to Mexico City. Booking Cancelled by the airline without notice to the customer. The original booking was modified at the airport counter for an earlier flight. The airline representative sold a new ticket instead of modifying the existing booking. When attempting to check-in for the return flight, it was noticed a message of "contact the airline", The booking was cancelled for not "taking the existing reservation" which it was not modified by the same airline. A new ticket was sold for $1,700 to be able to fly on the same route, which it was paid due to the urgency to return to the UK. In addition. Our luggage was requested to be dropped off at every airport we had a connection. Aeromexico made our trip as inconvenient as possible. First time using the airline. Never again. So Disappointed.

### "flight attendants really rude"
Mexico City to New York JFK. The flight attendants on AeroMexico are really rude. When they should be working, they are actually watching movies (see photo). They wake you up by poking you in the leg when you are sleeping to move you to another seat so that they can sit in the seat you're in, to watch movies. How can you be watching movies when you are supposed to be working? The plane is very cold and I got sick from the flight. No refreshments offered. I wrote to complain about this, and nothing was done. In fact, they told me they were going to close my case without doing anything about my complaint. I will not fly AeroMexico again. If I could rate zero stars, I would.

### "The treatment is obnoxious"
Mexico City to Madrid. The treatment that this company gives to their clients is obnoxious. Lied repeatedly over some delays from saying that the plane was there and 20 minutes later was not at all, saying that the plane was in maintenance and that would be in 1h 30min ready and then there was no plane (again). Changed 3 times to different gateways. All this from midnight to 8. Did not offer any hotel, just after 5am when you cannot check in anyway. I will not even continue but this went on for a while. Worst ever.

### "forced overnight stay"
I bought a ticket to fly AM on May 26th on the sector San Jose to Havana via Mexico City in business class. The airline notified that they had rescheduled the MEX-HAV flight for May 27th. This means I have to stay overnight in MEX. I asked a supervisor at MEX airport when I transited the airport on January 7th, if I could get a voucher for the forced overnight stay. She answered that I just had to check with AM at arrival on the 26th of May and they'd give me a voucher. I verified this by email and to my big surprise I was told that AM would not pay for my (by them forced) overnight stay at MEX airport because they advised me ahead of time that my flight was rescheduled. I was offered a refund of my ticket, with the airline well knowing that I have no alternative (Skyteam) connection from SJO to HAV. This is the second time this happens. I had bought a ticket for December 26th 2019 MEX-SJD. This flight was cancelled well ahead of the departure date, and also here I had to stay overnight in MEX airport. No compensation, no voucher for my overnight stay.

### "a great experience"
Mexico City to Buenos Aires. The boarding process was without any problem, we could change our seats because the aircraft wasn't full, Aeromexico provides you with free whatsapp and a little amenity kit with earplugs and a mask, dinner and breakfast. The dinner was ok but the breakfast was excellent, the FA were polite. The legroom is quite good but recline could improve. In general a great experience. The return flight only the check in process was terrible but the rest fo the overall experience was as good as the first flight, well the food was better in the second flight. Both flights arrived on time. IFE could have more movie or tv series options.

### "staff was very unpolite"
We flew with Aeromexico from Amsterdam to Mexico City and return. On both flights the staff was very unpolite. In particular the treatment of passengers by female flight crew members is rude and without any service attitude that you would even find in cheap European airlines. Multiple times the flight crew was bumping against the edge seats. Food was dashed off on the table without a word. When asked if a meat or vegatarian dish was available, the answer was "no, thats out already" and walking away, rather than "no sorry, but may I offer . instead". Coffee/tea was offered by shouting through the cabin "coffee? tea?? rather than asking "would you like a coffee?". I witnessed that behaviour with all passengers around us likewise. I have never seen such unpolite and rude behaviour in any other European, American or Asian airline carrier. On top of all of that, the return flight was delayed by 1.5 hrs so that we missed our connecting flight, resulting in a 5 hrs. delay of arrival at our final destination. The answer of Aeromexico whether they can offer a compensation was: "we can offer a sincere apology". Finally, the flight was not even expensive, but above average for that route. All in all, I will never travel with Aeromexico again, but will rather resort to well established European or Asian carriers.

### "try to avoid them from now on"
AeroMexico from Mexico City to Amsterdam. As Ticket package i booked the "Classic Package", which included selecting a seat and luggage up to 23KG included (this package is ~70US$ more expensive, than the basic fare without luggage and seat reservation one-way!). I did the online-checkin-process, which went very smooth and chose my seat. One hour before departure i checked again in the customer-page, if everything was fine - it was and my seat was still blocked for me and the whole row (two more seats free). Until here everything was perfect. But then the boarding started. My digital boarding pass on my smartphone was rejected several times, so the ground-stuff-guy went with me to the counter and gave me a printed boarding pass with another seat. I asked why they changed my seat without further announcement or communication to me, as passenger? After all i paid additional money, to choose my seat, but now the ground staff changed my seat. He just said, i shouldn't be so excited, it is exactly the same place, just in another part of the airplane. I again started discussing with him, that this behaviour is wrong, changing the booked and additionally paid seats of the customers - but he just turned around and went away. Consequently i ended on the seat directly in front of the toilets, where the seat recline was much less, than on my booked seat - sleeping was a torture for this overnight-connection. My original booked seat got a woman with a kid of about 12 years, they blocked obviously the three seats and laid flat down all the way to Amsterdam. But it is unbelievable, that people, who paid additional money for reserving a seat are removed and moved to another seat, while others, who didn't pay and reserve their seat before, get benefits for free. They could have gotten those seats, but then they needed to pay also additional money for getting this comfort. The stewardess in the airplane was completely incompetent. I showed her the two boarding-passes and she just said in a rude way, that my digital boarding pass is invalid and now i need to move. No offer for an upgrade to the premium-economy or business for this impudence. So, reserving seats against money is in AeroMexico no good option, you anyway have no guarantee to get your reserved and booked seat. I will try to avoid them from now on, even if I flew already a few times with them.

### "leaves much to be desired"
Panamá City to México City. On our flight today there were 2 wheelchair passengers, myself and another lady. Because of renovations at Terminal 1 at México City airport we were forced to deplane using stairs and walk to a shuttle bus. I had a cane and was able with the help of my husband to get to the bus. The other lady, however, who was alone, received absolutely no help from flight attendants or ground crew to get down the stairs which she painfully managed by holding on to one rail with both hands and moving both legs onto each step. Once on the ground, she received no help either with walking to the bus or getting on the bus. Eventually, some other passengers helped her onto the bus and my husband gave up his seat for her while 2 ground employees occupied 2 seats. At the terminal I had to urge the said employees to help her off the bus and in the terminal was a wheelchair for her but not one for me despite having arranging on the ticket for one. This was despicable treatment of both flight and ground staff in ignoring the needs of a disadvantaged person. This is the second time we have transited via México City en route to another destination. A month ago we were travelling with Aeromexico from Vancouver to Panamá City and this was the return trip today. On the first occasion México City to Panamá City I had to walk down several flights of stairs from the gate to get to the bus and then climb upstairs onto the plane. Fortunately, my legs were working that day. Although the flights were good value the treatment of wheelchair passengers leaves much to be desired and we won't be making this trip again with Aeromexico.

### "worst I had experienced"
Cancun to Vancouver via Mexico City. Aeromexico boarding service was the worst I had experienced. A representative at the gate refused to board our entire family of 5 people (including 6 yrs old daughter) because we passed on to him all 5 passports and boarding passes in one pile (like we usually do everywhere else in the World). Instead he wanted us to enclose each boarding pass into the corresponding passport. It took us about 20 seconds to do so. However the representative tried to send us back to the end of the line. Moreover while discussing he detached an immigration/visitors form from my son's boarding pass (we all have seen him doing so) and few minutes later he claimed we didn't submit the form and he has a right to cancel our flight. To my request to call for his manager and solve the problem hi simply replied 'I'm going to call for a police. It's not your country, you'd better follow my instructions' We found that statement offensive and inappropriate for international airline representative. For our future trips we are not going to consider Aeromexico service any more.

### "Worst experience ever"
Vancouver to Merida via Mexico City. Worst experience ever. Worst airline ever. Worst customer service ever. I had to rearrange my return flight with a different low-cost airline and the experience was way better. I have never felt so disregarded by an airline before in my life, they didn't show the slightest intention to help me at any time. I guess they just don't care about average people, just hi-end business travellers. I'll never use Aeromexico again, not even if they give me the tickets for free.

### "refused to take responsibility"
Havana to Los Angeles via Mexico City. We flew with Aeromexico late November. If it were not for their lack of baggage handling abilities, we would have been repeat customers. Although the flight itself was pleasant and comfortable, upon my arrival in Los Angeles, I discovered that I had some items stolen from my luggage. My partner's bag was also destroyed, the zipper ripped from the bag and his bag arrived to us in a plastic bag on a plastic tray. When I contacted Aeromexico to resolve the issue, their customer service team informed me that they did not recommend valuables be stored in check in bags. I asked if they would seek to implement measures to ensure their duty of care on the contents of check in bags were met (as of course, you cannot put everything into your carry on if you are travelling for an extended period of time). Their team merely responded with 'I do understand your displeasure regarding this situation. In this case, I can only provide you with the corresponding information regarding our baggage allowance rules and policies'. So unfortunately I now have to take the step of informing other travellers of this situation as Aeromexico has refused to take the appropriate responsibility.

### "Will try to avoid Aeromexico"
Veracruz to Mexico-City. Aeromexico is in my opinion one of the worst airlines. I was cancelled for my inbound flight after no using my outbound flight without further advice. Staff had absolutely no flexibility to solve the problem and I had to buy an entirely new ticket. Will try to avoid Aeromexico flights in the future.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Salt Lake City. This is easily the worst airline experience I've ever had. I had a problem with my departure date and needed to switch it for another day, and not only did they not help me switch it but said it would be impossible to change my flight and refused to give me any kind of refund. I will never use this airline again.

### "low cost airline at best"
Aeromexico is, quite simply, as a flagship carrier, a downright embarrassment. Customer service is nil. The product is more like a low cost airline at best. To be avoided if you can.

### "I missed my departure flight"
Cancun to Austin via Mexico City. Awful customer service and corrupt policies. I was told my round trip flight would not be cancelled even though I missed my departure flight. So I got a one way ticket to my destination and expected to use the return flight. No, they cancelled my trip. I will not recommend this to anyone nor use it in the future.

### "my next flight was cancelled"
I found the experience with Aeromexico concerning enough to leave this review and to avoid the use of the airline in the future at all costs, including taking additional layovers to avoid this carrier should they be the most efficient route. The issue in question involves a flight from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and a roundtrip from there to Quito, Ecuador before a final flight to Seattle. After landing in Mexico City for the layover, my next flight was cancelled due to unrest in Quito. Aeromexico issued a travel alert saying that they would not be charging for fare differences or change fees to handle the matter. They also advised me at the airport that they would not be flying into Quito for 5 days. As I was in now stranded in Mexico City, I asked to be put on the next plane to Seattle. This was all transacted in Spanish, which I am not completely proficient in. I expressed concern about making sure I was securing the value of my flight, and they prompted me to call the 1-800 number for the Houston office when I returned to settle that matter. As their travel alert read, I still have the roundtrip value of the ticket from Mexico City to Quito available to book. I called the Houston office on my return to Seattle to be told that I had already agreed to an itinerary change and there was nothing that they could do. They referred me to the complaint department (email only) to handle the matter. After asking for the value of my round trip MXC-Quito segment of my flight to be rebooked, it took almost a full week and a second email to receive a ticket number from them and another five days (and another follow up email) to receive their curt response detailing my implicit forfeiture of my trip value when I agreed to fly back to Seattle from Mexico City part way through this interrupted trip. They also said that I was not on the same flight or cabin and that the value of my trip to Quito was used to cover the difference. I do not see how this could be the case as I paid to upgrade my seats on all four flights in this trip and was still in coach on the return segment to Seattle. I received no print out showing how the value was distributed. So I'm told both that I agreed to sacrifice the value of my ticket, but that loss was implicit. Nothing about the scenario was explicit except their travel alert online which I was in the bounds of, and thus their decision on this matter seems only to be made in a cost-benefit to themselves. I find this sort of service disingenuous. The worst part of their email was the final statement: "thank you for making Aeromexico the carrier of your choice. I WILL NOT CHOOSE AEROMEXICO IN THE FUTURE - likely choosing Avianca or any number of similar operators along similar routes. Although when first using this airline I enjoyed the service and availability of routes, the double-talk between their official travel alerts, and their email-only handling of complaints in a non-customer-centric fashion leaves a lot to be desired by this airline. So for American and English speaking travelers I will also say that email communications leading up to flights and the majority of airline staff are predominantly Spanish speaking, and that if you find yourself stranded away from home, you may find yourself accidentally forfeiting value you purchased with the airline, or at least being told so later.

### "sat on the tarmac for 30 minutes"
We pushed back 30 after departure time and were never informed of why we were sitting for 30 minutes. During the flight, I asked one of the stewardesses and she didn't know anything. When we arrived at Mexico City we sat on the tarmac for 30 minutes and again, no announcement as to why we didn't pull up to the gate.

### "left the gate 1 hour late"
Mexico City to San Francisco. The plane left the gate one hour after scheduled departure. Not once was any announcement made about the delay. There are too many commercials on the entertainment system. There was no way to fast forward or delete them. Pure greed on the part of the airline. I checked with the Aeromexico office in downtown Mexico City to see if my AMEX Gold Delta card gave me priority boarding and one checked bag free and was told yes to all. At the airport, they said no. My ticket was purchased on the Delta website and the flight was a Delta codeshare.

### "completely misled by Aeromexico"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Mexico City. Wooed by the promise of "more personal space, an exclusive in-flight menu, and preferential treatment", I chose to fly Aeromexico's business class on the popular Cancun-Mexico City route. Things started going downhill at check-in when I was told there was no lounge service, even though my terminal had a contract VIP lounge that could easily have been commissioned by Aeromexico. While it had been a very long time since I had flown business class with an airline that didn't offer a lounge service, I expected the on-board catering - which Aeromexico promised would be "premium hors d'oeuvres, drinks and in-flight menu" - would help make up for the disappointment. How wrong was I? I was appalled to learn that the nice lunch I was reasonably hoping for would consist of nuts and a selection of junk food like chocolate bars and potato crisps. After being completely misled by Aeromexico's advertising, I was left hungry by the time I arrived in Mexico City two and a half hours later and feeling as though I had been taken for a fool. If you're thinking of paying extra for Aeromexico's domestic business class offering, please avoid my mistake and don't bother.

### "Aeromexico had moved our seats"
Not Verified |  As most of you already know, AeroMexico partners with Delta. So, we booked our trip to Mexico through Delta Vacations (that part went perfectly, as usual). We not only booked our flights but we chose to go with Aeromexico on the way back. Partially because it went through Mexico City and we had an overnight stay and it was an airline we had not flown with before. To put things in perspective, we have flown with several other Delta partners in the past and have had zero issues (matter of fact, they were great! KLM, Air France, etc.). So, we thought that this would be the same type of experience and of course a new adventure. We were so incredibly wrong! We booked our flights in mid-June for the beginning of October and our seating assignments and everything were set to go (they were first class seats). Two days before our flight we checked both Aeromexico and Delta and the Delta seating arrangement was correct (nothing had changed) but Aeromexico had moved our seats (on both flights) to the very front of the plane, which we do not like because there is no place to put your hand carry (personal) bags so you have to put them above. Since Aeromexico was for a trip back we were told after spending over an hour on the phone that they would not change our seats until 24 to 48 hours before. This was interesting to us because they had already changed our seating on both flights to the front of the plane (without any warning). From what we understand after speaking with our Delta representative (because Aeromexico was almost impossible to get in touch with) this had been the second change they made to our seating without advising us or even giving us the option to choose. So now sitting in Cancun, Mexico (wasting more of our vacation) 24 to 48 hours before our flight back, we checked Aeromexico. To our great surprise, they had not only moved us again but this time out of first class and into the main cabin, which would be fine if that’s what we had paid for. So again (while on vacation), we get on the phone and waste our time with Aeromexico. Then after no resolution or better said waiting on the phone (eternal hold). We called Delta again, this call took an hour and a half and the Delta Representative was told by Aeromexico (the first time he called) that they would change us to a different flight. Then, after 15 minutes of no changes the Delta representative called back and he was told that not only would they not change our flights but if we wanted our old seats back or a different flight that we would have to pay. Of course, we refused (Who in their right mind would hand over more money?). We asked the Delta representative what his response was to them and he said that he took it to their management and they also refused saying the same thing. What it appeared to us is that Aeromexico was trying to upcharge us for services we already purchased. This should be brought up to the Aeromexico corporate headquarters, and used as training and a teaching tool on how to not treat your customer. Because we fly so much with Delta and because we think they’re just a better airline, the Delta Vacations representative took us off of the Aeromexico flights and found us flights home on Delta (for no additional cost and the same day!). We would not and could not recommend Aeromexico to anyone at any time for anything. Moreover, we are actually shocked that they remain in business with these types of unethical practices and behaviors.

### "I'd certainly fly them again"
London to Tuxtla Guitierrez via Mexico City earlier this year. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by Aeromexico, although my trip did not get off to the best start as their booking system is atrocious. Specifically, when booking multi-city trips (rather than a direct return), the website does not give you a choice of different economy fare classes, but just the one "tourist class" option. When clicking through to the payment page, the website tells you that one checked bag is included in the fare. However, once payment was made, the ticket sent to me said no bag was included! A check of the fare class rules confirmed this was correct, but the booking page was highly misleading. I then had to pay GBP 50 each way extra to check a bag. Not the end of the world given how cheap the original fare was, but this was poor for a supposedly professional company. I complained about this to the cheery check-in agent, who apologised but merely replied "sorry, the website is terrible, isn't it? Not good enough! However, things picked up from there. The flight out was only 1/3 full in economy, so almost everyone had a row to themselves. I could stretch out across 3 seats and get a proper night's sleep. Flight was on time, crew were friendly and food was OK if not great. IFE had good, up to date film options on a decent screen. One of the best economy flights I have had - only complaint was a funny smell that appeared in the cabin from time to time. On the return leg, check in and security at Tuxtla was very efficient - it's a tiny airport. Domestic leg on an E195 was uneventful, although a longer flight than planned due to very high levels of traffic at MEX. Connection at MEX was seamless as there are no exit checks/passport control for domestic-international connections in Mexico. MEX terminal 2 is architecturally pretty cool and not a bad place to spend a couple of hours. Return flight to London was unfortunately completely full with no spare seats, so not as pleasant as the outward leg. There was also a delay of around an hour and a half after boarding whilst a technical problem was fixed, but captain kept us well informed and crew were friendly once more. Once in the air, food service was again OK and despite the busy flight I could get some sleep (the Boeing 787 is in my opinion one of the best planes to fly long haul, along with the A350, due to the better pressurisation/lighting and quieter cabin). The one annoying thing about this flight was the lack if responsiveness of the IFE screen. It kept trying to call an attendant instead of begin a film, or turn the reading light on instead of the flight map .. highly bizarre and irritating! So overall, I'd say Aeromexico were pretty decent and I'd certainly fly them again (especially at the price I paid), but there are certainly a few areas for improvement.

### "they don't respond to their email"
Cancun to Havana. I have tried to make contact with this business multiple times over the last month. This airline does not offer phone support other than for very basic assistance like sales. Everything else must be through email. However, my issue is they don't respond to their email. I asked for a tax to be refunded that I was never supposed to be charged as I was exempt from this tax, as well as a refund for a phone booking fee that I was not notified about until after the charge was completed. They responded to me that ¨everyone is notified about the phone charge, and that the tax would not be refunded¨. I replied on August 28th clarifying which tax I was referring to, I also asked them to review the call recording as they would hear that I inquired about the phone fee to be refunded while I was on the phone with the representative. The sales agent did not mention the fee. I inquired with him about the fee after seeing it on the receipt in my email. He told me the only way to receive a refund was to email the complaints department. This was during the sale, not in another interaction. Furthermore, I would have never made a phone reservation but their online booking system was having an issue and the error message told me I needed to call to complete the reservation. For this reason alone they should have refunded me that fee. However, I received no response to this email. I emailed again September 17th, to let them know that I was injured in an accident and would not be able to make the flight. I emailed them a medical certificate, and photos of my injuries, and I requested that they provide either a refund or a credit to be used on a future flight. They couldn't even be bothered to reply with a ¨no¨. Just no response at all. I later realized that my Visa Infinite card that I made the payment on came with trip insurance, so I filed a claim with my insurance company. My insurance company requested a letter from the airline stating that the trip was canceled. The airline did send this. However, after I submitted the letter to my insurance, my insurance company requested that the letter also include additional details. I requested a revision to the letter on September 23rd. However, once again, I received no response. Despite being routinely ignored by this business the only thing I am asking for is a document confirming 1. the cancellation of the flight, 2. the amounts reimbursed and the fines charged OR indicating that there will be no refund. Also, an apology for simply ignoring almost every communication with them would also be nice.

### "Customer service is a complete joke"
London Heathrow to Bogota via Mexico City with Aeromexico. Customer service is a complete joke. they just care about money and it is absolutely no good value for money. Please avoid it. Sometimes cheap tickets end up being more expensive and spoiling your trip.

### "Terrible customer service"
The customer service rep at Aeromexico in Mexico City airport, did not let us unto our flight to Vancouver although we arrived at the gate with more than 20 minutes to boarding. Terrible customer service. Le representante de servicio al cliente en Aeromexico en el aeropuerto de la Ciudad de México, no nos permitió nuestro vuelo a Vancouver, aunque llegamos a la puerta con más de 20 minutos para abordar. Pésimo servicio al cliente.

### "won’t recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I am very disappointed with Areomexico and this review is based on my last experience with this airline. I had a reservation for my mom, unfortunately she had a medical emergency and needed a gallbladder surgery, when I contacted Aeromexico about this to re-schedule the trip, they told me that I had to pay U$200 dollars to change the date and U$150 because not shown, also that I have to pay the difference in price if there was any because the new dates, we did not have insurance and that is how the company works, the only way they will give the money back is if she would’ve passed away, surgeries and other emergencies are not applicable and you have to pay. I must mention we did not want any money back, just travel date updates. The communication was all over email, there is no way you can talk to anyone from customer service, just people from sales department. Long story short I accepted to pay the U$350 and started looking into new dates and prices on their website, after my research I found out that the new price was U$771.48, this price is from Aeromexico website, so I decided to give call and book / re-schedule the trip with the new dates. At the time of my call the agent confirmed the price I got from their website but after telling them that I was just going to re-schedule and gave him my old reservation number they told me that the prices on their website which is the same price he gave me did not apply to me anymore, the customer service representative said that new tickets prices are different than change of date rates, and I had to pay U$879 for the change of date, U$350 fine and U$529 because the difference in prices, keep in mind on their website a new ticket is U$720 and I originally paid U$1024. Also, I am buying the same destination, same economy seats, same hours, just a different dates and paying the finds and difference in price is there is any, the same agent confirmed that in my case was better to buy a new ticket with the new days than re-scheduling the fly, can you guys believe this? What kind of customer service is this? I won’t recommend this airline anymore; it is ridiculous the way the treat their clients. At the end was cheaper to buy a new ticket than changing the dates.

### "plane was very comfortable"
Vancouver to Mérida via Mexico city. This was our first time flying Aeroméxico and can’t speak highly enough about the staff and service provided. The plane was very comfortable and the staff went above and beyond to make our trip pleasurable. Dori at the check in desk in Mérida was outstanding. Thank you so very much for taking such great care of us!

### "Boeing 787 is amazing"
Not Verified |  Manzanillo to Geneva via Mexico City. From the moment we checked in to the moment we got our bags back we couldn’t have asked for a smoother experience. The children slept. We slept. The Boeing 787 is amazing. Even the flight from Manzanillo to Mexico City was good.

### "flight attendants were extremely friendly"
This was my first flight on a Dreamliner (XA-ADH) which was delivered one year and six months ago to AeroMexico. My experience with the airline was a very positive one. Check in was a breeze, even though my bag was a bit on the heavy side I was not charged. According to my ticket I was allowed one hand piece as well as one overhead piece. 45 minutes after take off a very light dinner was served along with a full bar service and wine service, afterwards coffee was served. There was a big selection of movies the only thing I had trouble with was the inflight WiFi which kept on turning on and off. Midway through our flight over New Orleans another drink service cane around with more booze and an hour prior to landing water was served. The flight attendants were extremely friendly and bathrooms were very clean. It’s great to fly with an airline which offers great service.

### "my camera bag was gone"
Toronto to San Jose via Mexico City. I had packed a carry on bag, only for the airline to force me to stow it. Upon my arrival to Costa Rica, I noticed my camera bag was gone. So contacted them via email and telephone only to have no return and then placed on hold for an hour+ only to be hung up on. Clearly they have an issue with the trustworthiness of staff. If you value your belonging, reconsider flying with this airline. The flight there was fairly decent. The return flight airplane was extremely dated and in need of repair.

### "never again AeroMexico!"
Panama City to New York via Mexico City. I have been to Mexico maybe 6 times in the last two years, including last week. This is the first time the airport crew took my passport in an envelope and kept it with them and won’t give it back until I reach Mexico. The reason being that my passport is from India and they want to understand my business in Mexico, my business is that I am returning home to New York through this pathetic excuse for an airline and I am legally allowed to walk into Mexico as I hold visas from UK, USA and Canada - never again AeroMexico! Once I got to Mexico, I was escorted into a holding room where they had 15 or so people who were in transit without legal grounds in Mexico. I had to show my documents to the officers in the holding room for the airline crew to realize they were wrong to do this. No apologies or nothing, the crew member just said she doesn’t know why “the people” in Panama did that. This was the longest 30 minutes of my life, I managed to take a photo without any of the officers noticing me. You can’t hold me hostage ever again Aer Mexico, no thanks!

### "seats are narrow and hard to sleep in"
Check in process was easy except for one very upsetting thing: I was not allowed to lock my luggage. I was told that mexico does not have ability to open a TSA lock and they might break my lock if the decided to check my bags while going through Mexico City airport. This was quite upsetting as I had valuables in my bag. I have to remove camera and other things out of concern that I may not see them again. Food service started with lunch. I opted for a Japanese meal since the western meal did not seem to be that good. During the flight they leave a few snack items but nothing appealing, a few Japanese things, no fruits, no juices. Cabin attendants just about disappeared after the meal service and did not seem to want to be bothered. Lounge in Mexico City was poor but this time it was not overrun with pool;ke and internet seemed to work well. This airline advertises free messaging and whatsapp access which is a complete lie. Both inbound and outbound internet was not functional even though I would have used paid internet! In short the seats are narrow and hard to sleep in. Airplane is clean, restrooms are cleaned frequently but otherwise nothing great. Flight from Mexico city to DFW qs co=mfortable and meal was OK.

### "cheaper than any options"
Dallas to Tokyo via Mexico city. I picked this flight because of the price and type of aircraft. Aircraft from Dallas to Mexico city was a smaller one. Flight from Mexico city was late. Lounge at Mexico city was severely over crowded and I could not get room to sit down. We had to sit at the bar for a few hours as some people were laid out on the bench type seats. Food quality was equally poor. About as bad as Ahmedabad India lounge. As far as the flight goes service was mediocre, food quality was average. Seat was narrow making it hard to sleep. There was a long time when here was little food available and the choice of snacks left in a corner were far from desirable. Only good part is that this is cheaper than any options. Announcements were poor at best and entertainment was OK. One good thing was that they cleaned restrooms frequently. They claim to have free Wifi between Mexico City and Japan but it did not work on either flight (outbound or inbound).

### Aeromexico customer review
We were met at the door by a cordial flight attendant who checked our boarding passes, and then directed us to our seats. The 787-9 Business Class cabin is arranged 1-2-1, and our seats were the last on the left side in the front section, just in front of the walk-up bar. A flight attendant welcomed us with our choice of water or orange juice, as we were settling in to our seats. The inflight entertainment system played commercials and the safety video, and only then were we able to select personal programming. A menu was presented detailing the two main course options-on this flight fish or pasta. Following dinner I slept for at least 3 hours. Considering everything, very satisfied with the service and flight. Did not have the need to stay connected, so did not subscribe to the inflight wifi.

### "Not up to standard"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Mexico City. Their premier / busineses seems like a joke. Sky priority check-in. When I hold my ticket show their people about to check in sky priority because I'm in business class, they don't even look at it, just tell me to follow other economy class to lineup. Until a few mins later, I try again, point at the class on the paper, then they stop chatting, open the block let me check in with their sky priority. After get on flight, my wife's tv is freezy, not working at all. My chair's leg lift up is broken. Could something really works here? We were paying for premier price for price service and equipment. Not a broken seats. And the bottom of the seat seems been broken for a while, the glue around seems very old. Priority luggage pickup. They did put the priority tag on the luggage. But when we waiting for our luggage, economy's luggage all went ahead then our's. Not up to standard at all.

### "Worst flight ever"
Guadalajara to Chicago O-Hare. Do not recommend this airline. Do not understand how paying extra for priority seating gets you last on the plane. Also having your carry on baggage removed and taken down with all the other luggage just because the flight did not have enough space. Makes no sense that I paid extra money and for the staff to be rude and not find a spot to put my luggage at and just take it out and give it to a person to put down not acceptable. Do not recommend this airline what so ever. Worst flight ever. Not worth it.

### "seats are comfortable"
The plane left Toronto and arrived in Mexico City as scheduled. The seats are comfortable and the Flight attendants are respectful as this is a red eye flight.

### "I will never give them my business"
This was the worst airline I have ever bought a ticket from. I had to change my trip because of a death in the family and was looking forward to using my credit (after additional cost) however the cancellation policy was lost in translation and I was told I had one year to use it. Not the case. Two weeks after the one year mark of the original purchase I call to book and they’re sorry “I will have to take it as a loss”. I would have happily paid to extend it - now I will never give them my business. Good customer service doesn’t cost a company anything, and keeps people coming back. Disappointed is an understatement after the Experience with Aeromexico. Do not bother!

### "Clueless staff"
Not Verified |  Overbooked flight. Online checkin not possible. Clueless staff. Customer service close to non Existent. They give preference to family members of staff and off duty pilots, upgrade them to business flight before their frequent flier customers. To those they have no problem saying the flight is overbooked. I wonder if someone from customer service management reads these comments, it seems not to be the case, if they would use the feedback from these sites and implement them they could learn to become a national airline to be proud off. But it seems there is not even any willingness.

### "how bad the customer service is"
Vancouver to El Salvador via Mexico City. I can not put into words how bad the customer service is with this airline and the lack of caring and inability to provide a basic level of service. We did not even make it onto our flight due to outrageous prices to re book a flight on top of our original purchased tickets and with penalty fees. We lost a vacation and a lot of money. I do not understand how an airline is allowed to operate out of a Canadian airport and only offer by phone customer service back to the defunct business they are allowed to run in Mexico. I hope that if anyone reads this before considering flying with this airline please re consider at all costs. This airline is criminal.

### "had to buy another ticket"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Quito via Mexico City. Horrible rates when changing flights. $200 change fee is a little high plus air fare change. Basically had to buy another whole ticket. I always have used American Airlines and I will be returning.

### "a horrible travel experience"
Vancouver to Merida via Mexico City. It have never experienced a worst customer service anywhere. We booked a Business Class flight to Merida from Vancouver and it was uneventful, it was not bad but was not good. Mediocre food and mediocre customer service. On our way back is when it became a nightmare we had a 2 hour delay due a mechanical problem in our plane, we had to connect in Mexico City and after running with bags and cases to the gate 15 minutes before the plane will took off. The lady at the gate did not want to let us in (we were still in time to board), they were many passengers in our delayed flight and was actually fault of Aeromexico, but she say nobody inform her about the delay. She simply didn't want to help or even call a superior to help, she was rude and completely careless. She send us to another stand to make changes in our flight and we got one flight but in Economy, even they had seats in Business Class. They didn't offer absolutely any compensation or apology for the now 8 hours delay in the flight. Then at home, we called and emailed many several times for many hours and months where we have dealt with so many different people and phone numbers, they just refuse to compensate the delay and the downgrade on our tickets as it was our fault. They offered a ridiculous upgrade with a code where you have to call a special number and that only apply to specific flights and so on, practically an offer you cannot claim. I feel scammed and robbed, we pay for a service and they didn't provide it and they simply refuse to reimburse what we pay, or the difference of it. I have flown many times and with many different airlines and I have never experience a completely lack of empathy of the customer service personnel. It's almost as if Aeromexico sees customers as a threat, forgetting we are paying a service that they seem unable to provide. If you can avoid it, then choose another airline. Aeromexico will make sure you have a horrible travel experience.

### "terrible customer service"
Guadalajara to Sacramento. The most insanely terrible customer service Ive ever experienced. Check in nightmare, even with priority status. The man at desk was new and had no information, going back to get approval from his supervisor for everything, who never came out of his office to help. Spent 30 minutes checking in and arguing over bag fees they wanted to charge. They didn't end up charging because they were wrong, but it was like talking to a wall, and took 35 minutes, just to to properly check my bags. The plane was old, no power outlets. The flight attendants were nice but service terrible. Boarding sucked, buses, so on. But its really about the service. Every time I check in at Aeromexico I feel like the employee sees the customer as some sort of existential threat. There seems to be no understanding that this is a purchased service. I dont know how this Delta partnership can work.

### "I highly recommend"
London to San Jose via Mexico city. Before flight i read a lot bad reviews about Aeromexico but price was very good. Ground service was  good, they give all answers to all my questions. The flight service as well was wonderfull. Flight from mexico to san jose (costa rica) was same. Plane was little bit old but that no problem. I highly recommend fly with Aeromexico.

### "is the worst airline"
Mexico City to Austin. This is the worst airline. They will work to make you miss your connection, and force you to re-buy your ticket. You would be better off walking. Over a month later I still shudder to remember flying with them. Constant stress and extortion. They should be permanently grounded.

### "lower than competitors price"
Not Verified |  London to San Jose via Mexico City. We chose the airline due to the lower than competitors price point (which was still not cheap). Both flights left without delays as scheduled. My partner had actually forgotten a valuable item on one of the flights and we were lucky it was handed in by the crew to Lost and Found office at the airport after the flight had landed. Many thanks for that! 3 out of 5 is for the comfort - on both flights the seats were broken (not reclining) and taken it was a 10 hours flight it was very uncomfortable. Online entertainment is ok but not as good as other companies. Also would be great to see more reusable cups than single-use plastic.

### "just wanted to change our return"
Not Verified |  Where to start... The booking part of the flight was fine and easy. After that it was a nightmare. We boarded our flight in Moncton and where delayed due to problems with the plan therefor we missed our connection flight we where stuck in Toronto airport with 3 kids searching for our luggage for 5 long hrs. After that we where told we would have to wait until Friday to get a flight and get to Mexico. No compensation for hotels food or lost luggage they finally got us a flight Wednesday night to Calgary and told us there was a flight Thursday morning to Mexico and once we got to Calgary go to the agent and book it with them. Once we arrived in Calgary there was no flights again until Friday and we had to Find a hotel for 5 people and get there and wait till Friday. Which means we have lost 2 days of our vacation. We were told in Toronto Calgary would be able to help with compensation of hotels once we got there NOT TRUE. once we and the 3 kids where settled in our hotel I started contacting Aeromexico where I was told we could change our return dates with no charge and she put me on hold then there was no one when I called back I was told not possible and to contact west jet. West would not do anything and told me to call Aeromexico and they said no should have got the first agent to change the dates and this new agent would not do it and said he didn’t feel it was necessary. I tried explaining he was being unfair and the first agent said she would and that we where protected. However he wouldn’t. So I contacted red tag and delt with an agent who told me no problem to change our return dates so we could have our full time she said she needed to call me back however never did. So then I ran out of time and we left for Mexico. Once I got there and dealt with our hotel which we where two days late for ans still has to pay for those days along with our hotels when we where stuck in airports. I was told there was nothing anyone could do. I feel cheated I paid for a family vacation and not only did I not get to spend the week with my children on the beach I spent 2 days in airports and hotels. Had to pay for 4 hotel rooms 2 in Canada and the 2 in Mexico. And was told nothing anyone will do. I didn’t think I was asking for a lot I just wanted to change our return date by 2 days and was told it was no problem. There has been nothing done as of yet.

### "don't care about the customer"
Toronto to San Pedro via Mexico. Do not travel with Aeromexico! My husband and I planned this vacation for 5 days in Honduras, where we have friends and since we bought the tickets through an agency we never were told that my husband needed a special permit to get into Honduras due to his nationality. When the date comes we get to the airport and the girl who checked us in never mentioned or asked us about this permit when checking our documentation. She only asked us for our USA visa and our Canadian visa which we had. After we get to Mexico City and the same thing happened. Nobody told us about this permit even though they knew about the final destination was Honduras. When we got to Honduras the Migration agent didn’t let us in as my husband didn’t have this permit. So we went to claim the airline for letting us get to that point without notifying us what we needed when checking our documentation and all we received was a very bad attitude, unprofessional and disrespectful like we owe them something. The information we got from every single person that we talked to was inconsistent and they kept avoiding responsibility and telling us that it was migration fault to not let us in. Which is ridiculous. Another guy at Mexico City told us that the airline was not responsible to ask the passengers Or check if their travel documentation were in order. We have traveled around the world and the first thing the airline ask for is your visa or permit in order to let you get into the plane. Anyway, They gave us a return ticket to Mexico but didn’t give us a connection ticket from Mexico to Toronto, and when we asked for it they would through the responsibility to other members a part from that they didn't give us time to even communicate to our friends who were waiting for us on the other side. After that we realized that they assigned us separate seats and when we asked to help us getting two seats together they got angry at us like it was our fault. staff not helpful or even interested to be accommodative. The story keeps going on. After all my husband and I found a common factor of this company Aeromexico don't care about the customer, all they care about is our money. Garbage Service!

### "The worst experience"
New York to Lima via Mexico City. The worst experience of my life. They are totally inflexible, the treatment to the client is terrible, inhuman. I made a 3-day trip to Peru for the death of a family member and on my return to NY they did not let me board the flight because I did not have an American residency letter in process. I had to take 4 extra days and pay almost $ 600 for the letter from the embassy, ​​which told me that this happened only because of the REGULATIONS OF THE AIRLINE. After this I tried to take a flight as soon as possible back to NY since I was losing many days of work, in addition to having left my 2 little children of 2 and 4 years and with whom I had many responsibilities. The airline did absolutely nothing to help me. On the contrary, they wanted to charge me $ 2000 for the change of ticket since the only available space was in premium class and that seat can not be sold "like that". Finally, due to the lack of empathy and support from Aeromexico, I had to buy another ticket in LATAM for $ 726 one way and FOR CERTAIN NEVER REQUESTED ME THE EMBASSY LETTER for which I spent 5 days doing the procedure. ES: La peor experiencia de mi vida. Son totalmente inflexibles, el trato al cliente es pésimo, inhumano. Hice un viaje de 3 días a Perú por el fallecimiento de un familiar y a mi regreso a NY no me dejaron abordar el vuelo porque no tenía una carta de residencia americana en trámite. Tuve que tomarme 4 días extra y pagar casi $600 por la carta de la embajada, la cual me dijo que esto sucedía sólo por las REGULACIONES DE LA AEROLÍNEA. Después de esto trate de sacar un vuelo lo antes posible de regreso a NY ya que estaba perdiendo muchos días de trabajo, además de haber dejado a mis 2 pequeños hijos de 2 y 4 años y con los cuales tenía muchas responsabilidades. La aerolínea no hizo absolutamente nada por ayudarme. Por el contrario, me quisieron cobrar $2000 por el cambio de boleto ya que el único espacio disponible era en premium class y ese asiento no lo pueden ceder "así nada más" . Finalmente, ante la falta de empatía y apoyo de Aeromexico tuve que comprar otro ticket en LATAM por $726 one way y POR CIERTO NI ME PIDIERON LA CARTA DE LA EMBAJADA por la cual pase 5 días haciendo el trámite.

### "Customer service is terrible"
Buenos Aires to London via Mexico City. My seat and entertainment area were broken for the whole duration of the flight. We booked Premier class seats so we could have a fully reclining seat on a long flight. These tickets are 4x the price of a normal seat and are advertised as extremely comfortable, fully reclining seat and so on. Could not use any of the features Premier stands for and the upright position of the seat is stiff and uncomfortable. Their reaction was: "You need to contact customer services to get compensation, there is nothing we can do. Customer services finally got back to me and they claim and I quote: "the entertainment services inside our aircraft are considered courtesy. What do you pay so much extra for in premier class if it is all considered a courtesy? I don't even care about the entertainment, it is the seat and back support you really pay for but as it is completely electronic chances are those don't even work and you still can not lie down. At least in economy you can move the back of the seat back a little regardless if there are electronic issues! The Customer service is terrible as they don't care about anyone. You have to be lucky that even when you pay a lot of extra money you get a working seat. A gamble we are not taking again.

### "staff are not accommodating"
Five of us flew from LAX to CAN, each of us had 1 carry on luggage and 1 personal bag. We checked the Aeromexico website prior to our flight and the information there was we are allowed one carry on with 22lbs each. We had no problem with our luggages from LAX-CAN. But to our surprise when we are flying back to LA, Aeromexico ground stewardess was weighing our carry on luggage together with our personal bags, so obviously all of us are going to have overweight baggage. We explained our side that from LA we didnt have the same problem but the staff are not accommodating. We had a bad experience with this kind of service and probably won’t be flying with Aeromexico again. We had to check in three pieces of luggage and will have to wait for it at LAX. Had we known that our personal luggages will be included in the 22lbs allowance, we should've prepared better. I dont see the point checking the baggage information in their website if it is not clear. It is the first time that I encountered an airline weighing the personal bag of their customers.

### "It’s extremely shady"
I travelled with Aeromexico to Medellin Colombia and on arrival my bag was not there. After talking to an Aeromexico service desk , I was told the ‘system’ was down so She could not track my bag. So I asked to fill out a lost luggage form - I did this (with my friend who speaks Spanish as her native language) and was told to call the Aeromexico Medellin number the next morning. My bag was never found and after 21 days I was told to compile a list of the items in my backpack , along with receipts and that I would receive compensation for all items with receipts and 25% of the value for the items without receipts. I did this and from what I was told - I was eligible for almost $2,000 in compensation. I received an email back informing me I was not eligible for compensation because the report was ‘made by courtesy’ . I replied asking for further explanation and received no response, I called the Medellin line and they told me it must be a mistake and to send the email again. I did this and received the same response , again I asked for further explanation and received nothing. When I checked my bag in st Mexico City - the attendant was slow and rude to both me and my Colombian friend. My friend saw him ticket my bag but we found out later that he did not give us the corresponding tickets for the bag. It’s extremely shady, and although I still don’t have an explanation - it seems that the attendants did not give me the correct forms to fill out or did not enter my missing bag into the system. To Make an insurance claim I have to prove I have made all lengths with the airline first. This is impossible as the phone lines never answer and there email correspondence is ridiculous. Even as a budget carrier I expected more. At the very least and explanation and compensation for my immediate expenses - I was left with nothing and lost many items not just of financial value but personal too.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible Service! Would have given zero stars if that was an option. Several hours before our flight I received an email informing the flight was delayed 12 hours. When I called Aeromexico to confirm the flight delay, they told me the flight was not delayed and I should go to the airport for the normal scheduled departure. I called twice to confirm and was told to go to the airport. When I arrived at the airport, there were hundreds of people in line for AeroMexico and agents only said to wait in line and gave no information. After an hour in line that never moved, I walked up to the front of the line and demanded to speak to an agent. I was told that the flight was delayed until the next morning. Our flight was rescheduled and delayed several times over the course of 15 hours and we had to sleep at the airport. The final attempt to reschedule our flight was on an overbooked flight and they could not seat us. We were told the only available flights would be many 5 days later! This caused us to miss our entire trip. The counter agent told us to call Aeromexico and maybe the operator could be of service. We called and was on hold for nearly an hour before being given an email address as a source of contact. There is no one to speak with regarding complaints or flight cancellations. The company only communicates via email. Horrible customer service. I wrote an email explaining what had happened. The company responded saying since they offered us a flight, even if it was 5 days later, they would not refund the tickets nor offer a credit! We spent over $1400 on two tickets and they could not even offer a credit.

### "don't ever fly with Aeromexico"
Not Verified |  We also were victim of poor management by Aeromexico. After two delays our flight on january 2nd 2019 was canceled leaving us stranded in Puerto Vallarta. This airline doesn't inform passengers, doen't plan ahead and most of all doesn't care about you! Passengers had to inform themselves what was going on. Story most heard was that due to fog in the morning in Mexico City Aeromexico started to book passanger from the first planes that had to leave out of Mexico City over to later flights. That meant that the last flights had to be cancelled. They knew that from the start. Didn't act and let passenger on these last flights hours in stress before telling them at midnight that they could retrieve their bags from the belt and look for shelter. We had a 24 hour delay, had to take a bus to Guadalajara because this stupid action which also caused overbooked flights for the next four days(!). There were no excuses, no compensation whatsoever. Just a reaction that it was due to weather condition (which false, the weathet was perfect that afternoon. My advise: don't ever fly with Aeromexico. If you do, don't complain (and you will be sorry!! ).

### "been refused reimbursement"
Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver via Mexico City. Our flight was postponed so our connection was impossible to make. We were transferred to a different airline. So far so good. However, we had paid for our luggage (via the internet the night before, as requested by Aeromexico) and now we have been refused reimbursement of the cost (despite the fact that we paid the second airline for the luggage as well). So, the cost of transporting two pieces of luggage back from Mexico to Vancouver now stands at $100US. Outrageous. We refused Aeromexico's offer of a coupon for a future flight as we will not be flying with them again. There should be a law against this type of gauging.

### "Worst customer service"
Bogota to Los Angeles via Mexico City. Worst customer service experience in over 30 years of travel! Aeromexico employees in Mexico city are of the utmost unprofessional, ill informed employees I have encountered. From the moment our plane arrived we were misled, disregarded in regards to a connection to LA. We had a conversation to make and had to get our luggage to move forward. We were missing one piece of luggage. I Immediately I went to representatives, showed them my ticket and was told to just wait. This us where the ineptitude and arrogance began. Not only was I misdirected to 3 wrong areas but was just pointed in the general direction of where to go by supervisors of all people! Knowing that we were on the verge of missing a flight at NO fault of our own. I insisted that we be taken by someone Personally and this employee took me to the wrong area as well. NO ONE knows what is going on and above all RUDE about it. Aeromexico is not the airline you want to consider traveling with first and last time with this home of a company!

### "superficial and uninspired"
Monterrey to Los Angeles. Service in the air seems superficial and uninspired. The flight attendants told people to take out their headphones during ads in w/ a rude tone. The food was very salty and looked old. The ground staff and services were nonchalant and unaccomodating. Overall, Aeromexico doesn’t seem to care about customer experience. Disappointing!

### "never book with them again"
Mexico City to Zacatecas. Booked a flight for my father with Aeromexico and on his connecting flight they cancelled and reassigned his flight 5 times. An 8am flight turned into a 9pm flight, he was stuck in the airport for hours with agents telling him they couldn't help. When I called they promised he would be on a 4:30 flight and still reassigned him 3 more times after that. Absolutely terrible will never book with them again.

### "Horrible customer service."
Horrible customer service. We boarded our flight to Guatemala and my husband has a medical emergency before take off and we were taken off the flight and taken to the hospital. I have been trying to get a confirmation of our flight cancellation for insurance purposes. They say the cannot cancel my flight because they only have my ticket information but not my reservation. Orbitz cannot cancel my flight they say AeroMexico needs to. This is ludicrous! Apparently no one has our reservation but they can see our ticket and that we did not take the flights.

### "definitely one of the worst"
Not Verified |  I recently made a round trip Montreal to Mexico City. My passport showed two last-names and my plane ticket showed only one last name. For this reason, Aeromexico made such a big fuss and made me buy a new plane ticket. It seems that adding only one last name to the plane ticket was extremely difficult for them since they refused to understand that all they had to do was a minor modification and not a change in the name on the plane ticket. Unlike many other airlines which are supportive and helpful in situations like these, their staff were extremely impolite,  and very unprofessional too. All they want is rip you off and get more money from you. Also, for unknown reasons, I received e-mails from them in which they confirmed two reservations, that I never requested, with different return dates, what an awful mix-up, not only are they rude but also incompetent. I strongly discourage anyone who is planning to fly Aeromexico: poor staff, bad service, terrible food, etc. I have travelled all over the world and this airline is definitely one of the worst. I do not recommend it, Aeromexico never again.

### "significant issues with this airline"
Portland to Mexico City., The AeroMexico website boasts about a great deal of wonderful services, on board WIFI, wonderful food, in flight Entertainment and so on. This flight was not anything like that. They continually failed to deliver these amenities. There was no Wifi on any of the four planes I flew on. The Entertainment was impossible to hear over the noise of the engines. They boast about their "Complimentary Tequila". It was so incredibly bad. Special comment should be made about the "food" served on this airline. It should be noted that there is no alternative food or beverage service available for purchase. The food they served was so bad. On the Portland to Mexico City flight we were awakened at 2am by the cabin staff by the cabin staff serving Breakfast. This consisted of a cold and somewhat stale bun, with a paper thin slice of ham and a paper thin slice of cheese. (No condiments - just the dry bread and the ham and cheese), and a child sized serving of apple sauce) On the return flight from Mexico City to Portland, "Dinner' consisted of a 5 ounce cup of badly wilted "greens" which were garnished with a teaspoon of peas (No dressing just bare greens), a bare bun (No butter or other condiment), and about a Cup and a quarter of Rigatoni Pasta. This was garnished with about a teaspoon of unseasoned tomato sauce). The "dessert" was a small plastic tub of Vanilla Pudding-like product. Mexico is the home of Vanilla. This item contained none of that - it reeked of cheap artificial vanilla. Beverages are served in what appeared to be a 4 ounce portion. This included the Coffee and the water served on board. A six hour flight and four ounces of water per passenger. The Aeromexico hub is the Mexico City Airport. Each time, When we boarded the first leg of our flight, we were not told where to find the second leg of the flight. The airport is incredibly poorly marked - and no AeroMexico employee we talked to within the Mexico City airport could tell us where to go to find the second leg of our flight. On our return flight, the Departures Monitor told us that our flight would be leaving from "Gate K". Which is impossible because all of the actual gates at this airport bear numbers and not letters. It took us two hours to get of the first plane and find the second plane. There was not enough time to buy bottled water or any other alternative food. There are some significant issues with this airline.

### "We had a a great experience"
We had a a great experience flying with Aeromexico from London to Mexico City and back. Both flights were on time or arrived earlier and  the staff were extremely friendly and professional! The food was also on overall good level  we had some chicken curry, chicken with spinach and corn on and Mexican style breakfast on both flights). The tequila open bar was also great and we had some good tequila on both flights. Check in process and boarding process is also efficient and fast (except for the check in for one of our flights not working on their website so we contacted customer care and it was solved). We found everything to be of good standard and most importantly no delays or cancellation. In contrast, our flights with another airline (approximately 3 hours) got delayed by an hour each.

### "In-flight service was robotic"
Overall I would rate the experience a 5 out of 10. It was neither the best or the worst of many flights I have taken. In-flight service was robotic. 30 mins after take off food tray was placed in your table then drinks were served. This was a 6 hour flight and not even a second drink offering after the first one. It said on the airline website that “Hot Meal” will be served but it was just a cold croissant and a yogurt. AVOD is ok. Not a lot of New Release movies. Aircraft cleanliness is OK as well. The negative part of my trip was the friendliness of the ground staff in both Mexico City and PVR. YVR airport staff was great. Friendly and smiling all the time. Check in took some time but it’s fine. Robotic ground staff in Mexico City and PVR. They don’t smile and seems bothered by what they do so I’m not sure why they work there. I would fly with them again if the fare is good. Now I know to siginificantly lower my expectation about Aeromexico service so I won’t get disappointed again.

### "worst experience ever"
Reynosa to Mexico City. I flew with Aeromexico for the first and it was the worst experience ever. We went from Miami to Mexico City and it was fine but from there our flight to Reynosa was delayed so we booked another one. When we booked another we didn’t receive any sort of receipt or proof of flight so we went to check what departures are leaving soon and the flight that we apparently booked was until 3 days later and we had plans so we couldn’t wait. We took an autobus from Mexico City to Reynosa and it took 15 hours. Now that we are there we do everything we wanted to and our flight back was the worst. We had flights from Reynosa to Mexico City and from Mexico City to Miami. We weren’t allowed to board the plane because we didn’t verify that we were actually in Reynosa since we never took the flight, they used the excuse that they sold our tickets and we couldn’t do anything about. So the next day we went back and everything was fine and we got home. Never flying with Aeromexico again, worst experience, next time I’m taking American Airlines.

### "They are just awful"
Houston to Mazatlán via Mexico City. Please read before you book any flight with Aeromexico! They have awful customer service when mishaps happen! My family and I traveled with them a few weeks ago and I will never travel with them again. Flight to Mexico was great. Flight coming back was a nightmare. They delayed our flight for no real reason (weather was perfect, plane was there and fine ... we asked multiple people and nobody had an answer). We then waiting on the tarmac for 1/2 hour .... right in front of an open gate. No reason. Because of these errors on their  part, we missed our connecting flight in Mexico City. Customer service was awful. I’ve never been treating so poorly and it was their fault we were in this inconvenient situation. Their best flight they could do for us was the next day - 20 hours out. We asked about different airlines, different airports to fly into, or at least accommodation for our family (a baby and 2 other small children) to go to. They just kept shaking their head no. It was horrible,  and we had no choice but to take our exhausted babies to a hotel and feed them and let them rest for the night. All hotels within a 1/2 hour hour radius are well over $300. And we were not even close to being the only ones who missed flights due to their errors and their claims they had nothing until the following day (even tho this was at noon). It made me wonder if they were in on it with the hotels and purposely doing this to their customers. They made us miss obligations back home, they turned a hard 6 hour travel day with little kids into a 26 hour travel day, and we are out over $400 for their short comings and inconvenience they brought onto us. And they refuse to reimburse or try to make any of it up to us. They are just awful!

### "enjoyed every bit of our trip"
Vancouver via Puerto Vallarta via Mexico City. Fly a great deal in and out of Mexico for last 8 years & this is the 1st with Aeromexico, will not be the last! Impressed from baggage to seating, warm blankets, free earplugs, full choice of Movies, TV, News programs on nice  large screens. Food and drinks ll flight long. We enjoyed every bit of our trip with you!

### "A complete disappointment"
Mexico City to Santiago de Chile. A complete disappointment, I thought Aeromexico was somehow a "professional" well managed airline but looks like it is not the case (no comparison to the average Skyteam standard). The Club Premier Lounge in Mexico City is a joke, I wanted to take a shower after my redeye flight from JFK and at front desk they directed me to the SPA: at 8AM the SPA manager told me showers would be available from 9AM, when I popped up at 9AM I was told by another representative that they never open before 9:30AM. As I got nervous and complained for that, she would eventually call the SPA manager and at the end they agreed that at 9AM there was another guest booked - who never entered the SPA so it went from joke to fraud. Boarding was an "all in" experience since the different boarding groups lines were not enforced. FAs nice but felt like an amateurs crew, with no shared guidelines on how to greet, serve or respond to biz class passengers. This "confusion" feeling lasted the whole trip, since I was skipped for no apparent reason from the pre-departure drink (at that point I was too tired to complain), after being served the main course I had to ask twice to have some bread as well, and drinks refills took forever; surely having only 2 FAs for a whole 32-seats business class cabin does not help. Food I would say average although options were limited (just 2 for main course, compared to 3/4 on most airlines). The seat was probably the worst part of this flight: really really narrow, somehow short when in lie-flat position (I'm no giant, 180cm/5,9 feet tall) so that I had to sleep on a side, the headrest is so thick that it gets annoying when you place the pillow on top of it as your neck innaturally bends. But most of all, the seat is not completely flat, there are some "bumps in the wrong places" that make it uncomfortable; luckily I asked for another comforter and placed it on the seat as some sort of bedding and it worked ok, otherwise probably I wouldn't have slept at all. Amenity kit on par with other airlines (probably better than AA shoe sack but no comparison to the new BA The White Company pack on Club World or Ferragamo on AZ). Overall a bland experience, with a big con on the seat which is crucial on a 10 hours flight.

### "got a free upgrade"
Aguascalientes to Mexico City. I got a free upgrade to Clase Premier along with my travel companion. It was a nice short flight, the flight attendants were attentive and called us by our names. On time departure and arrival, Sky Priority and a snack with beer.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Mexico City to Aguascalientes. The flight attendant’s service was very positive and service oriented. Captain explained to us the route, as well as he would make interesting remarks while flying somewhere particularly interesting. Free snacks and beverages were served. Seats were comfortable, good space 2x2 seat configuration. No TV screens as this is a regional aircraft, but it was a very short flight. Arrived 15 minutes before schedule and fast arriving bag.

### "singled out and told to comply"
Mexico City to Tijuana. I was singled out and told to comply, never given a real reason other than my carry on wouldn't fit in the plane compartment and that it needed to be checked. I measured my bag and it fit just fine, like it had on so many past flights. So I refused to check it. When I raised my voice I was reprimanded by an aggressive and intimidating male employee who told me that I should not speak to a woman that way. I was singled out of a long line of people who had not yet boarded. I was told that there was not enough room on board for my carry on. A lie. There were at least 23 vacant seats as well once I boarded with my luggage that I refused to check. I had a laptop and some delicate art unframed that I had purchased in Ecuador that I had no intentions of checking with baggage.

### "heartless non-cancellation policy"
No Customer Service Available for Emergencies. One day before we were set to fly back my husband had a scuba diving accident resulting in severe decompression sickness. The doctor said that he could die if he flew. I called Aeromexico to let them know we could not fly on our set day. When I called back to reschedule. They said that we could not reschedule without incurring penalty and extra costs unless we went through Customer Service. Guess what? Customer Service does not have a phone number. You can only contact through email and the wait time is 10-15 days for a response. When my husband was well enough to fly, we had to return to the US for treatment about 6 days after his accident. I booked Aeromexico tickets that cost about $900 one way. I figured we could work it out with Aeromexico when we returned home. However, Aeromexico refused to refund either our original tickets we purchased or the replacement tickets, even when we provided documentation of the accident and a letter from the doctor saying it was impossible for my husband to fly. I strongly suggest using an alternate airline. I have flown al over the world and have never encountered an airline with poorer customer service or a more heartless non-cancellation policy.

### "could improve the inflight service"
Mexico City to Boston, the services was ok, chicken or pasta and no more options, they ran out of some beverages so I had to chose another one. The space for the legs is good but the seat is okay for a flight of 3 or less hours, after that is not so comfortable. I think they could improve the inflight service.

### "Service non-existent"
Vancouver to Lima via Mexico. Stone cold bagel is not an adequate meal for a 6 hour flight in business class. Dedicated check in counters? No, never heard of it. Online check-in? What's that? Priority luggage handling - doesn't exist. Access to lounges in Lima and Mexico (that belong to SkyTeam, separate complaint) - no, I have to pay. Despite the SkyTeam rules, clearly stated on the website (false advertising when it comes to Aeromexico). Crew doesn't speak English on international routes. Transiting in Mexico city - beyond disastrous. I almost missed my connection. Airport is a mess, no signage, nobody speaks English. I had to clear the customs and border control, and then run around looking for my gate, just to pass another security control (which was useless and ridiculous). Cabin crew on YVR-MEX route was atrocious. Service non-existent. Aircraft was dirty, passengers were seated in business class just because they knew someone or spoke Spanish. All four legs of my flight had completely different "service standards", with LIM - MEX being the only one with remotely acceptable in-flight service.

### "an excellent flight"
Boston to Mexico City. Crew attentive and professional. Good food and drinks. Loyalty to Club Premier paid off and we got an upgrade to Business Class. Good in-flight entertainment and WiFi. Very new and well maintained plane. Good seats. The baby crib service was amazing as our baby was able to fully rest before our arrival. The flight arrived early to Mexico City. Baggage came out quite fast. In general it was an excellent flight. Aeromexico ground personnel in Boston friendly and patient with us and kids during baggage drop/check-in process.

### "nice and quite new airplane"
Mexico City to Boston. A very nice and quite new airplane with Boeing Sky interior, different lighting schemes that help you relax. The food was good, (free full meal including beer and spirits). AM Plus (Premium economy) was quite nice and spacious. The overhead bins had a different configuration that made the cabin more spacious too. The flight crew were quite attentive and came offering different services during the flight (meals, duty free sale, drinks and water). Used WiFi for almost three hours and allowed me to work and stay in touch with the ground. We were traveling with a baby and AeroMexico offers a baby bassinet service.

### "professional and attentive"
Guadalajara to Mexico City. High-quality service by professional and attentive staff. Free snacks and drinks (including alcoholic beverages) were served. Personal in-flight entertainment screen in all seats and USB port. Good in-flight magazine and  WiFi on board. Flight connection and luggage delivery information given immediately after landing in Mexico City and while taxing to gate.

### "would recommend AeroMexico"
Miami to Mexico City. At check-in, AeroMexico staff were very nice, I really like their policies except for the 25 dollar charge for bags. Boarding was quick. The seats at the plane were comfortable and AeroMexico have Inflight entertainment on many planes with many choices. The food was tasty and free of charge, the flight attendants served coffee and beverages, and the plane had Gogo wifi. I would recommend AeroMexico for its destinations and modern planes.

### "friendly and professional"
Mexico City to Guadalajara. Used web check-in services, got my mobile boarding pass. Used the Sky Priority line in Mexico City’s T2 security checkpoint. Sky Priority and zone boarding was done perfectly. Bin space was good, the crew extremely friendly and professional service-oriented. On time departure and early arrival. In-flight entertainment with individual tv screens and also good wi-fi (I started my writing my review with Aeromexico’s GoGo in-flight WiFi!). I am a frequent flyer and enjoy using AeroMexico very much, I find it of high standards and very reliable.

### "crew were very attentive"
AM 698. Check in at Mexico City Airport was a bit slowish due to the fact that many international flights were leaving mid-afternoon. While boarding the plane newspapers as well as candy were offered on the jetway, once on board the aircraft we were handed out headphones. The crew on this flight were rather courteous. This flight was on a Boeing with Sky Interior which had bigger bins and private TVs on every seat with a wide selection of movies. For this flight I chose row 29 since the last few rows offer an extra seat of legroom. After take off people were offered bottles of water, about thirty minutes after that beer, spirits, sodas and juices as well as a bag with peanuts or some sort of trail mix. Since I was in the back I had no choice on dinner but at least food is free. I was offered pasta with veggies and cheese, yoghurt, beer, salad and bread, there was another drink service mid flight and prior to landing more water bottles were offered. By far this was a great five hour flight, crew were very attentive and curious and you get better perks than what American carriers offer on flights between Mexico and the USA.

### "recommend this airline"
Houston to Mexico City. This was the second leg of my trip from Houston to Mexico City. An hour prior to boarding the gate agent called me to inform me my connecting luggage was ready to be put on the plane and I could pick it up once I arrived in Mexico City. This flight was operated by AeroMexico Connect on an Embraer 190. Once we started boarding it was done from zone one through three. Newspapers and candy were available on the jet bridge in both English and Spanish and flight attendants smiled and welcomed us onboard. About an hour into this short two hour flight snack boxes containing a mini croissant, two slices of cheese, apple sauce and a chocolate were handed out in economy class. Alcohol was available I ordered tequila and orange juice. Afterwards I was given a beer and we landed in Mexico City on time. Service was great what makes it better flying a Mexican carrier is having a latin crew as well as not having to pay for alcohol or food. Would recommend this airline.

### "try not to use this airline again"
Aeromexico personnel at the airport are rude and incompetent, they feel that we are begging for a favor when we are the ones paying their salary, if you ever need a flight think twice before choosing Aeromexico. My kids arrived to the wrong gate, for thus reason they arrived 1 hr before their flight to the correct gate, they told the attendants their flight was soon to depart but they didn't do anything and had them wait in line which was going to depart at a later time. By the time they got to the counter it was late and they lost their flight, customer service couldn't do anything for us. We will try not to use this airline again.

### "recommend the company"
Mexico City to Amsterdam. Bought flights was in time, and landed before schedule. Service on airport was good, important you save the immigration ticket you receive on arrival, you need to give this when you board the airplane on return. Absolutely everything have been smooth, and its important to keep eye on monitors. Terminal 2 is small, so in case of gate change you dont need more than 5 minute from end to other end. Gate shows normally 1 hour before boarding time, so you have plenty of time. Crew gave a super service, with great food and alcohol, and I can recommend the company.

### "sat in the airport for 8 hours"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Houston. The connecting flight from Mexico City, Aeromexico/Delta gave me & my fiancé a really bad experience. They did not assign gate numbers for their flights initially and when we asked staff around us for our gate number they kept giving us the incorrect one causing us to miss our first flight at 3 and had to have it changed to 8. So we sat in the airport for 12 hours because of misinformed staff. We spoke to a manager for Aeromexico who was very rude and snappy and kept telling us that we should have been at the right gate even when we explained to her that the rep gave us the wrong gate number. She didn’t care what we had to say and just told us that it would be $400 to change flights. Something told us to speak to another Supervisor and their happened to be a man who politely listened to us and understood that we did not intentionally miss our flight because of the misunderstandings and as a courtesy he had our flight changed. Downside was that the next flight was not until 8pm so we sat in the airport for 8 hours. Will not be flying through this company again.

### "cancelled my reservation"
San Luis to Tijuana via Mexico City. Aeromexico cancelled my reservation without any phone call, email, or text message. When I asked why or how this could have happened they had no explanation other than I should go to an airport and show my ID and card. Which I did, immediately but did not do any good. I had to re-buy the tickets but this time for $300 more than when I made the purchase 12 hours earlier. They have no live customer service that deals with billing issue, they have only an email team that didnt see anything wrong with what they did. I wonder how many other people they cancel on just to re-sell at a higher price.

### "show them my identification"
Bogota to Seattle via Mexico City. I purchased a ticket for my brother so he could come to the USA. I used my credit card to purchase the ticket. The next day I received an email from AeroMexico saying that I had to drive 2 hours to the airport to show them my identification. I contacted my credit card and was informed that they had approved the transaction. Turns out AeroMexico has a third party system that randomly flags charges and denies them and there is no way to override it. This is obviously a company from a developing country as this would never happen in a US company.

### "late 15 mins for check-in"
Vancouver to Havana via Mexico city. I was late 15 mins for check-in and there was at least 40 min. for me to go for boarding and people in the office said I was too late and didn't want to help. When i called customer service they said they need to charge no show up fee, Fare difference and another penalty so the total was like 600 CAD for the next flight. But new flight ticket was almost the same price. All I asked was at least the cancellation of no show up fee or the refund but they said it is non refundable. I asked if i could use the return but again I was told no. So they made me pay the whole ticket price.

### "Aeromexico is a mess"
Mexico City to Toronto. Aeromexico is a mess. Oversold flights, departure delays. They charge even if is their error. Hidden cost and a total lack of care of their customers. I’m a Sky Priority at Aeromexico, I cant choose any other airline to fly inside Mexico. So i know really well that Aeromexico is a dishonest airline.

### "convey a could-care-less attitude"
Guadalajara to Sacramento. This is our 2nd time flying Aeromexico. Last year was a complete disaster with the flight that was supposed to leave SMF 2315 and land in GDL 0515, instead leaving SMF st 0530! The entire nite we were given zero info/updates and only once offered a drink. The shops were closed, and my husband, is a diabetic controlled by diet so needs to est every 2 hours when awake. No employee would help us. Our return trip last year was 3 hours late. I am usually a glass half full type of person, so when this years annual trip to visit family was being planned I decided to give Aeromexico another chance. The dates/times/prices were the most convenient so we decided to give it another try. We never entered a complaint last year. This year our trip to GDL was uneventful. But the return trip we encountered the ticket agent from hell. We were never notified that the weight per luggage piece had been changed, and the carry on that should have been free, was 2 kilos overweight. Under then new guidelines, our 2 large luggage pieces were a combined 10 kilos underweight. We usually pay $25 each for the large luggage. At the GDL terminal u go thru the first line, then are given a piece of paper, have to go to a 2nd area, wait in line to pay for ur luggage, then return to the first line provide ur receipt and get ur ticket, not very convenient or fast) nothing was said by the ticket agent about overweight luggage, but when I went to pay I found I was going to be charged $114 for the carry on, which was 2 kilos over by the new guidelines. I pointed out that our total was still 8 kilos under, and that we were never notified of revised guidelines to no avail. I refused to pay, saying I would rather move 2 kilos to another suitcase. I was told to return to original ticket person and that he would return our luggage so we could make the changes. When i returned and told him what I wished to do, he put all 3 pieces of luggage on the conveyor where it automatically rolled to the back, gave us a paper with UPC codes, and told us we could get our luggage back "down the hall". I asked him numerous times where down the hall and he refused to say more. We looked "down the hall" to no avail, and no other Aeromexico employee were helpful. We finally asked a Volaris employee who walked us to an area that we would never have found. It took almost an hour to get the luggage returned. We adjusted the weight, and then had to wait in the LONG ticket line starting the entire process all over. It's a good thing we always arrive early for our flights! When we got to ticket counter again, the carry on was .03 over. The ticket agent was prepared to start the whole have to pay for this deal again. I pointed out that the total was still 8 kilos under and her response was "and what does that have to do with anything?  I quickly removed 1 pair of socks which put it at 9.90 kilos, under the magic 10 kilos. We have continually encountered employees for Aeromexico that are rude, unhelpful, and basically convey a could-care-less attitude. The only time Aeromexico seems to shine is when you are actually on the plane. The stewards are great. Excluding a very rough landing at SMF (bounced several times before finally staying down) the in air experience is great! Unfortunately that does not compensate enough for the issues you deal with while on the ground. Obviously last year was not  a flux, we will not fly Aeromexico again!! !

### "my seat was in standby"
I arrived to terminal 2 in Mexico City, 3 hours before my departure, and when I checked in, the person told me that my seat was in standby. She try to be kind, but it is the first something like this happens to me. I went to 3 customer service inside the terminal, and they said that the captain had to decide between passengers or fuel, because the external temperature was too hot. All of them told me that captain decides, and there are 20 passengers in Stand By. A day before happened the same, and searching this issue, it is not the first time this happens with airline. I understand safety reasons. but 20 passengers in Stand By list, in every flight, let us in a really bad position. It is not nice to depend of luck to know if we are going to fly or not.

### "don't really care about customers"
I flew from Montreal to Zacatecas via Mexico City with three baggages. When I was on the plane, I was informed that one of them was refused because one of the items could not go on the plane. However, they told me I could ask for a reimbursement (I paid 240 USD for the three of them). I went through all the process and now they said they can't reimburse because it was not their fault, however the service I paid for was not provided, so they just took my money. Also, my two baggage arrived in a bad condition and several of my personal belongings were broken and we are talking about a one-connection flight only! I found their customer service is the worst, they really do not care about customers and personnel on the ground is often rude, but they take advantage because they are the biggest airline in Mexico, so they don't really care about customers. They do have good routes but with a lack of a good customer service the outcome is still not good.

### "the worst customer service"
Mexico City to Montreal. Aeromexico has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Because of their negligence, I missed my return flight and then they insisted I pay for a new flight. It was my first trip to Mexico, and at no point was I told I would need the immigration paper they gave me on arrival to leave the country. They did not ask if I had it when I checked in, or at any point until I was boarding the plane. The immigration paper was in my checked bag, which they had enough time to remove, and make me buy a new ticket, but not to let me get another immigration paper. I asked the Aeromexico manager how many times a day this happens to people; she said oh MANY. Then isn’t this a problem, I said, couldn’t Aeromexico check for this paper when the other documents are checked, at check in? She rudely said this was not their problem. In fact, Aeromexico makes a lot of money off this- if as she says many people a day encounter this and they do nothing to fix the issue.

### "learn our flight has left"
Mexico City to Boston. Went on a girls trip the last week of April to Cabo flying into Mexico City via AeroMexico. Getting there no problem we all arrived all of our baggage arrived. However our leave date we are sitting waiting to board our flight the is to board and leave at 3:10pm. Another girlfriend and I are told we need to go to immigration to get the card we were given when we arrived ok no problem we have time before our flight leaves, however how about its told to every one flying into the Country that that slip is needed to get out, and how about the cost if it needs replacing? Give me a break there are all these procedures to get in and out of places I bet its not hard to verify who we are and where we are going or coming from. With that said we return to our gate at 3:00pm to learn our flight has left, its not supposed to leave until 3:10pm we learn we were not paged at all nor were any finally boarding calls made for this flight the customer service after this was absolutely horrendous! You are an international airport not one of your employees cared to apologize that our flight was gone nor did anyone care to speak English to help us everyone was pointing us in every other way, we were told there would be no flights until the next day. We then go to the AeroMexico counter where we encounter another rude employee who tells us there is nothing he can do but we can check with Delta so we go over to delta and he says all i can tell you is we have another flight but you need to get AeroMexico to change yours, so we go back to AreoMexico to try and explain what Delta has said, him not understanding. So we go back over to Delta and explain what AeroMexico says and that he will not go over and talk to him so Delta gets up and goes over to AeroMexico returns to us to say we now have 10 minutes to go to international baggage claim and get back to get this flight because our bags were removed from the flight. So we do not get back within 20 mins trying to get back to the correct place to book a new flight was shit because not one of your employees knew or understood English, we finally get to where we need to be and again we are told there are no flights. Then we are told its going to cost us a pretty penny to book a new flight home. So now we are in the process of trying to get reimbursed which is again hell.

### "one of the weakest Sky Team members"
London to Mexico. As mentioned before the general customer service is lacking. I booked an AM Plus seat which is advertised with priority checking, priority boarding and priority checking. Of these three only priority checking is done (you can use the skypriority lane). Besides that the AM Plus extra leg space isn't really worth the money and seats are still cramped. Friendliness of both ground and cabin personal could be better (excluding a few exceptions). They focus in their messaging on their new planes and technology whereas they really should increase their overall customer experience. (including their terrible website). The food quality from LHR to MEX was just terrible, the pasta was just bland pasta with some cream. Absolutely inedible. Definately one of the weakest Sky Team members. Value for money was okay as I managed to purchase a cheap ticket.

### "resent being relegated to standby"
I flew out from Heathrow to Mexico City on 29 March 2018, and later I flew from Mexico City to Havana on 11 April, returning on 14 April, before returning to London later that evening. Flight from London was good (although we had upgraded to AM plus). Flights to and from Cuba were both fine too. I had read that the planes were old on that route, but everything seemed ok to me. My beef is with the return trip from Mexico City to London. I checked in very early that evening (it was impossible to check in online from Cuba as the website said I had to go to the airport in Mexico City), yet was told that I was on standby. I booked the flights in 2017, and Aeromexico should have realised that I was travelling with them from Cuba to Mexico City, getting the first available London flight. The rise of budget carriers such as Easyjet has made booking and flight processing more easy. Overbooking is an air industry scandal, and yet Aeromexico staff in Mexico City confirmed that is what they had done. I resent being relegated to standby when I had booked well in advance, and had even upgraded some seats. I was not informed I had a seat until just before an hour before take off. Aeromexico staff on the ground had to deal with young families, single women and groups of women who had all been demoted to standby, like me. The staff said it was company policy to overbook. I find that this is where Aeromexico lets itself down. The stress involved in having to consider getting cash, replanning all transport back in the UK and contacting those who needed to know is an unnecessary one. Aeromexico should reimburse money to all affected passengers. Never again.

### "not a professional customer service"
We had a flight from Amsterdam to Panama which was delayed about 4 hrs because the airport in Mexico was closed. After, when we were changing flights to Panama, they lost our luggage and we had to wait one day to get them back. Even when they told us what time we could expect the delivery, they were about 1.5 hours late. I've been trying to contact Aeromexico to complain about luggage and nobody has answered since December. Its not a professional customer service. Every time I write an email to the main reception, they send me back to other departments.

### "a disgrace to the Skyteam group"
Flight from Amsterdam to Mexico was OK, the seat was comfortable enough and sitting in 6J with an infant on the first row of economy class right behind I was lucky enough to have a quiet flight. Service was attentive and the food, while lacking in presentation, was edible. The trouble started upon arrival in Mexico City at 3am, where I was to connect to a flight on the same business class ticket, but operated by Avianca. I’d chosen this connection for its shorter layover time. The transfer desk in the arrivals hall at MEX was unmanned, so I proceeded on my own to the departure hall’s Aeromexico check-in area where I was told to switch terminals to check-in with Avianca. Since the monorail was not operating at that hour I was supposed to take a taxi. Once at the Avianca check-in counter it became clear that I was booked in economy to Bogota. Nowhere during booking was this evident (I even retraced my booking steps on the same connection at a later date to verify any mention of travel in economy). It seemed that the AV was already overbooked (i.e. known to Aeromexico) at the time of booking. Aside from the economy experience on a business class ticket, the less than smooth connection at MEX, Aeromexico took 6 weeks to respond to my complaint. Their Twitter account ignored me completely and when I received an e-mail response, let’s just say that, for the result, in the end I might as well not have complained at all. On the return flight, no connection issues, however the food both out of BOG and MEX was subpar and the service was distracted and messy especially on the long haul stretch. Comming into AMS I had to ask for coffee creamer twice (coffee was poured and no milk or creamer was at hand on the trolley) and I had to grasp it from the purser’s fingers as she dangled it over me when she came back from the galley talking to someone else. I left the omelet untouched, because I couldn’t identify its filling and it tasted of nothing. Aeromexico is a disgrace to the Skyteam group.

### "Both flights were fantastic"
London to Mexico City return. Excellent flight, marvelous staff and great value for money. Both flights were fantastic: on time, easy check-in and check-out, the staff was helpful and friendly, comfortable seats, clean plane overall. I was pleasently surprised by the food quality. I ordered a vegetarian meal and got 2 delicious meals that consisted of a fruit plate, salad with dressing, bread and a main curse that changed: curry rice with broccoli, roasted vegetables with a promodoro sauce, vegetable stir fry and chilaquiles with beans.

### "they simply do not answer requests"
Los Angeles to Havana via Mexico City. Aeromexico lost my bag on my recent trip to Havana. I tried unsuccessfully to communicate with them for 5 days. I then did manage to find a very helpful person who located my bag in Havana where it had been all along. This young man got my bag forwarded to me in Australia however, Aeromexico would not pay for delivery to me in Sydney. I eventually paid a courier $70.00 to deliver it to me. So, it took in all 12 days, lots of phone calls by me( none by Aeromexico), to get my bag and by that time the holiday was over! I have been emailing their lost baggage dept at the contact address they gave me to get the compensation they say I was entitled to and hopefully my $70, but they simply do not answer requests by phone or email I guess they think you will just disappear if they keep ignoring you. I think I was very lucky to get my bag back actually albeit late and soaking wet.

### "worst airline in the world"
Bogota to Calgary via Mexico City. I have traveled on a number of national carrier, and AeroMexico indeed earns the review as the worst airline in the world! I arrived at Bogota's El Dorado airport for a 7:57am flight to Calgary, Canada, checked-in and received my boarding pass, cleared security, and headed to Gate 48 as was indicated on my boarding card. At 7:50am I learned that the proper gate was in fact 48A, which was separate from where my waiting area was at Gate 48. I never received any page over the intercom, and was  unaware of the difference in areas. After sprinting downstairs to Gate 48A on a mezzanine level I learned from another El Dorado Airport staff member not affiliated with AeroMexico (but still useless) that the boarding had closed and I had effectively missed my departure. I spent the next 30 minutes trying to track down an actual AeroMexico representative at which time I was told that the error was completely my fault, and that the best that AeroMexico could do was offer me it's "deepest regret" at my problem. The Bogota AeroMexico representative offered no solutions and ultimately took me to their back office in the airport where she proceeded to close a large door in my face, hide like a coward along with the rest of her colleagues, and summon security to escort me back to the main departure hall so that they could carry on with their day removed from my issue. Ultimately I had to book $1,500 worth of flights on United Airlines and linger around El Dorado for 16 hours before leaving on a 1:15am departure the next morning. AeroMexico has no interest in providing solutions to traveler problems; has no interest in acknowledging their error even in spite of overwhelming evidence including official boarding passes stating the correct gate, AeroMexico website screenshots for the flight showing the same gate information as my boarding card even two hours after departure, and pictures of two entirely different locations (see attached); and is entirely focused on taking your money and reservation and then letting you navigate your way through their processes without any assistance and at your own peril. Save your time, save your money, save your effort and sanity, and book your travels to Central and South America with any other airline if you can, even if the number of connections and time to arrive at your desired destination is longer, as dealing with AeroMexico is a textbook lesson in business incompetence.

### "flight attendants were really professional"
The boarding of the Aeromexico flight AM26, Amsterdam to Mexico City started on time and even if it was only from one door was quite efficient. It was completed 15 minutes prior to departure. The flight attendant passed through the aisles to serve orange juice and champagne before departure. The flight departed on time. With some turbulence, the seat belt sign stayed on for the full duration of the flight. The meal consisted of a choice between the breast of chicken, rigatoni pasta or fish. I selected the chicken. Although the appetizer (smoked salmon) and salad were really good, the chicken was over cooked and missing sauce as it was really dry. For breakfast, the omelette, sautéed spinach was really good. All flight attendants were really professional. The flight arrived on time in Mexico City. The custom lines were empty and the delivery of the luggage came on time. The priority luggage was delivered first.

### "Excellent price-value ratio"
Flight Amsterdam - Acapulco via Mexico City in economy class. Flight to Mexico City on brand new Boeing 787-9. Seats in economy were good, decent width and leg room. Also inflight entertainment made a good impression on me. Touchscreens were responsive, quite big and provided good quality. Choice of movies, definitely not as large as on Emirates but still sufficient, even for a long 12 hour flight. Service during the whole flight was very good, cabin crew were kind and attentive. Connecting flight to Acapulco on Embraer 190, which is my favourite regional jet. Seats on this airplane are really comfortable. I really enjoyed flying Aeromexico! Excellent price-value ratio!

### "everything worked well
Flew Mexico City to London Heathrow. I fly pretty often with Aeromexico, since I live in Mexico and I never choose Aeromexico for long-haul flights, however this time it was the best option in terms of schedule and time. I have to admit that everything worked well. The aircraft was pretty new, my seat was a standard business class seat that transforms into a fully flat bed. Entertainment was fair and sufficient, plenty of movies, service was outstanding, friendly, efficient and attentive. Food wasn’t really special, however it was good, with options of chicken, pasta or beef. Wines were ok as well. Service at check in was fast and friendly. Time schedule were perfectly on time. For this time I can rate Aeromexico as pretty good and trustable airline.

### "upset about how we were treated"
We purchased our flights from Vayama on Jan 4th 2017. We paid 653.61. We got to Mexico City and due to Immigration hold all flights coming in. We arrived at 5:30am. Our flight was to leave at 8am. Needless to say we missed our flight due to Immigration holding all incoming flights. We also told them we had a connecting flight we were told to wait in line, When we tried to get the flight and it was 7:45am we were told you missed your flight. So we were told by your people that because we used a travel agent you would not honor our tickets. So we ended up spending another 600+ to take flight 3490 leaving mexico city at 14:35. I'm very upset about how we were treated from AeroMexico that due to no fault of our own we did not make that flight. I asked several people for there names and NO one would respond or even had a name tag.

### "not allow me to take the next flight"
Calgary to El Salvador via Mexico City. Aeromexico in Calgary, never checked that my passport had 5 months and 28 days to expire, in Mexico City they did not allow me to take the next flight to El Salvador. I have to stay in Mexico City and after 3 days, spending more than US$1,000 the Canadian embassy issued a temporary passport. At this point my nightmare continued, they lost one of my 4 bags that l checked in Calgary. After one month dealing with this company, they only paid me back $1,100 Canadian dollars and my claim was for $4,000 US.

### "had the worst experience"
Houston to Zacatecas via Mexico City. I had the worst experience with this airline. I booked a flight for December 3rd to fly out for my grandmother’s funeral. The flight was supposed to fly out at 1240. We got to the airport at 945am and were at the terminal ready to fly out by 1015. However at 1245 they announced a delay. Every 30 mins they would report a delay. At about 230/3 they said some parts needed to be replaced but that the parts were on the 545 flight. They said the repairs would take place then and then we would fly out afterwards. At 645 some other passengers were commenting that the flight had been canceled. So we lined up and after another long wait we were told that indeed the flight had been canceled. 6 hours later!!! They offered to rebook the flight for he morning but said i would have to speak to a supervisor to see if they would be willing to get us a hotel for the night. They said they dont do it because we live in Houston. I live more than an hr away from the airport and we had been dropped off, not to mention bad weather had just started. We had to wait for our ride and ended up not leaving the airport until 945pm. We were there 12 hours! We honestly could have driven and made it to where we were going. Apart from the long wait, i was traveling with my toddler(yr and a half). After we had waited 2 hrs i asked if we could borrow one of the cribs used on the plane or heck even just a box would work. She just needs something to sleep in thats not wide open. The Aeroméxico staff member said they didnt have any and she couldn't help me. It was miserable because she couldnt take a nap. After 4 hra of waiting I went and asked the staff again. Different staff member told me there was a nusery with beds right around the corner. Are you kidding me? My kid was fussy and miserable and the solution was right around the corner? Heck for the long wait they could have at least fed us. Airport food is expensive and them saying here go eat wouldve been nice. I also wasnt told that when I pay for an infant ticket I get to check in a 50pound bag in for free. I ended up paying online for a bag, thats $25 I could have saved. We ended up not being able to fly out the next day because we still wouldnt make it in time for the funeral. So we asked to change the dates. They said they could but I had to go back to the airport and change the tickets there. So 2 days later I drove back to the airport only to find there was nobody at the aeromexico terminal. On the board it said there was a flight leaving at 1130 but the airport supervisor said there was only air china flying out. So another 2 hrs wasted. I ended up having to call and after being disconnected 3 times, 40 mins later they were finally changed. Again nobody said I see you paid for a bag but you’re entitled to a free bag. Nothing. Wasted so much time, missed my grandmother’s funeral and spent extra money on food, gas and luggage than what was necessary.

### "one of my favourite airlines"
Mexico City to London. This was our fourth flight with Aeromexico in the last two weeks. Flying from London to Mexico City. Then to Huatulco. Then Oaxaca to Mexico City. And finally back to London. I can say that this is now probably one of my favourite airlines having travelled around the world for many years on many airlines. Friendly staff. Helpful. Very comfortable seats. Slept more on these planes than others. Great food and drink. Easy check in on their website or at airport. Good prices. Would recommend them as an airline. Surprised as their reviews are not so good so wasn't expecting much. But so happy to have used them. Best thing was the wonderful Tequila after their meals. It was an amazing taste. Great films.

### "the gate staff were rude"
Mexico to Detroit. The gate staff did not call for families with small children to board first, when I asked why that was the case I was told it was company policy and I was quickly dismissed by the gate staff. Upon boarding the gate staff were rude (assume it was due to my question/complaint about the boarding process). I told the gate staff that I was unsatisfied on their boarding process (again) and she simply ignored me. I made a final comment of dissatisfaction with their entire company and as I was boarding she flagged security and told them that I needed a "special screening".

### "answers I get are very blurry"
Seattle to Medellin via LAX / Mexico City. Aeromexico made major changes to my itinerary, instead of waiting 2 hours in each airport (how I booked the flight) I would have to wait 16 hours on my first flight and 11 hours on the second one. For this reason I could not take this flight. The airline offered me a refund of 100% of the cost of my ticket. Now that the flight was cancelled they are putting all the responsibility to the agency that I booked with saying that I have to talk with the agency. While the agency tells me that they have accepted giving me a refund but they need the refund from the airline. The agency is still waiting for the money back to give me my refund. And at the same time Aeromexico throws the ball to the agency. I have been on this issue for more than two weeks. Every time I call the answers I get are very blurry and they don't give me a straight forward answer. I have requested to talk with supervisors but they say that the supervisors are not there. Or simply they leave me waiting for one hour of waiting on the phone and finally they hang up (this has happened several times).

### "I will not fly Aeromexico again"
Quito to Mexico City. In Quito, I locked my suitcase with a TSA-approved lock. When I claimed it in Mexico City, the two metal fasteners to which the lock had been attached had both been cut and the lock was gone. Apparently the perpetrators were not interested in what was inside (mostly dirty laundry! ), but the suitcase was permanently damaged and can no longer be locked. I complained to AeroMexico online, which promised a prompt response. 5 weeks later, I got an e-mail from them giving me a case number and asking for photos of the suitcase, my boarding pass, the luggage receipt, and my passport. I furnished those. They then replied that the damage was considered "minor" and not eligible for compensation "under our internal policies. So, tough luck, customer. Buyer, beware. I will not fly Aeromexico again.

### "rude and disrespectful"
Cancun to Mexico City. I am a frequent flyer and I have never experienced anything worse from any airline. 5 hour delay for a 25 minute flight and then refusing to let a family with a baby to board the plane because their attitude was bad. They are rude and disrespectful to customers. We had  paid for an upgrade and it was removed at the airport. We were told to speak to the customer service hotline to try get a refund for the upgrade. Good luck with that!

### "Aeromexico is much more expensive"
Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta. We wait for our flight in the VIP lounge of the airline, a very nice place to spent the time before, unfortunately our flight was delay, as always in Mexico City, but we were called just in time for boarding. The seats are in very good condition, and space between them is ok for a one to two hours flight. The flight attendants are nice, but not incredible. A good option for beverage, even beer, whisky and other alcoholic beverage but the food is horrible, some peanuts and thats all. There is no screen or something and the all entertainment is the airline magazine, again not bad for a short flight. Aeromexico is much more expensive than other airlines and the services is just a little better than Interjet for example.

### "absolutely awful experiences with Aeromexico"
I previously had absolutely awful experiences with Aeromexico, but did not learn the lesson and booked a trip with them again. Once again I faced delayed flights and incompetent, ignorant service. My flight from Mexico City to Oaxaca was delayed for more than an hour, but the information in the Aeromexico terminal was displayed as "On Time" with no gate number and no sensible informatiom from staff who I approached at least four times. Finally I was directed to the Aeromexico counter and sent to the gate where we were kept waiting long past "on time" departure time. But it was fine as Oaxaca was my final destination. On my way back though I had only 1.5 hours in Mexico City between flights, and the flight from Oaxaca-Mexico City was delayed for an hour. In Oaxaca I was told by an agent at the counter that I would have to go through security in Mexico City, therefore could not buy Mezcal in Oaxaca as I only had a carry on bag. Since I lost an hour of transfer time, I lost all hope of making my flight to New York, but in Mexico City I did not have to go through security and ran to make it to the departure gate. However, this success was spoiled when I was refused an aisle seat as "that was a full flight". In the cabin, though there was an aisle seat which I was able to take with permission from the crew, and it was not the only available one. How inhuman it was to not accommodate my request at the counter! I only hope I will never have to fly with Aeromexico again.

### "Bottom Line, stay away"
Washington to Mexico City was uneventful other than the fact that the plane was incredibly old, reeked of fuel, and there was zero padding left on any of the seats. MEX back IAD and beyond was where AeroMexico showed its true colors. While attempting to board the plane we were informed that there was customs form that was mandatory to board. Absolutely our fault for not having these (we arrived 10 days prior and had discarded these not knowing how important they were). We were told that we needed to go back to the immigration office and get new ones and that it would take 5 minutes and they would wait. So we ran; and while sprinting back up to the gate they looked up; saw us approaching and proceeded finish closing the boarding door. We begged, pleaded, etc obviously to no avail. After that we were basically treated like dog sh*t to be scraped off a shoe and be rid of as quickly as possible. We were told by the gate agents (just rude angry people) ticketing agents (dead-eyed and uncaring) and supervisor (slightly more sympathetic but also completely unwilling to actually do anything for us) that immigration documentation is our responsibility, and as such we would need to pay $250USD per plus about $400 in fare difference (that's $650 each or $1,300 in total y'all) to simply get rebooked on the same flight the next day (it had seats available). Trying to get us on another earlier flight with a partner airline was completely out of the question. Uninterested in this extortion; we ended up paying for a hotel for the night and used points to book a return flight on a real airline. But hold on folks; it gets better! Our bags! They were checked on the original flight. Upon returning to the US I called their 800 number and got someone who told me that I needed to call the lost and found line (a Mexican number). This not sounding quite right to me (I had the bag tags and wanted them to just do a search and locate them) I asked if there was a supervisor I could speak to. I was put on hold; and after waiting for over an hour, ultimately hung up. The number he gave me to call is unsurprisingly not in service. At as loss for what to do I drove to the airport and went to the ticket counter (they fly one flight a day out IAD and don't have a baggage office). Here I found some nice people that actually tried to help. They did a search and told me the bags were still in Mexico City. Oh Wait, they didn't tell you? she says. When you don't board a flight that you checked bags on they're required to remove your bags from the flight before they depart! You should have been told to pick them up in Mexico City and recheck them on your next flight! They filed a request to have the bags brought up on the next flight and promised to call with an update on when that would be the next day. That was two days ago. They gave me a number to call and check on the bags. It goes directly to a VM box. I left a message. Not confident I'll get a response. There are thousands of dollars worth of climbing gear and technical clothing in those bags. I guess it's possible that I will see this all again but I'm losing hope. For anyone who might have had baggage issues with this airline; here's the baggage number: 571-502-8784. Bottom Line, stay away. It's not worth the $100 you might save to fly on this airline. Incompetence and a customer service apparatus that is very clearly designed to keep you at arms length and make it impossible get help.

### "airline is extremely disorganized"
Mexico City to Chicago. This was our first time connecting flight stop at Mexico City and it will be our last. The Aeromexico attendants were rude. For starters no one explained to us about immigration forms that needed to be filled out and ready to board the plane. Second of all they sent my wife who is an American citizen born in the USA to the immigration office which is odd because I am an American citizen and so is my sister. Also all we brought was carry on bags and they checked through fine through security but then minutes before boarding our plane an airline attendant randomly puts a tag on one of my carry on saying it is too big and heavy and will have to go down with luggage on the bottom of the airplane. And my wife went through security just like my sister and I, and before boarding the plane they called her name over the intercom to check her carry on luggage and body search again. This airline is extremely disorganized and they need better leaders to lead and explain the same information at all times to all the employees. We will not be traveling Aeromexico no matter how cheap their prices are it is not worth it. Please take my advice and don't waste your money and save yourself from unwanted stress.

### "I thought Aeromexico were very good"
London to Cancun return via Mexico City and I thought Aeromexico were very good. To me by far the most important factor is the legroom. They are definitely better than many airlines in this respect especially on the London to Mexico flights. The in flight entertainment system is very good and the cabin crew were nice. The only problem was that flights did not always show on screens at Mexico City airport and it was necessary to ask to find the boarding gate, but I think this is most likely the airport's fault.

### "no fault of the airline"
Mostly good flights going and returning from Atlanta to Queretaro with Aeromexico, but this information may save you some aggravation: 1) Don't bother completing and printing the online FMM form. Just do it on the plane. Pre-printing slows down the process, seems few people are doing it and some of the folks handling the online forms are not yet comfortable or familiar with them. And once you've finished, there's no way to edit in case you discover a mistake later - as I did. This probably applies anywhere in Mexico. 2) "Get to the airport 3 hours early for international flights. No. We departed Queretaro at 06.30, and nothing began to function until [after] 04.00. It's a small airport, so once up and running things went quickly. 3) Departing Queretaro we had copied boarding passes onto our cell phones online and checked no bags, so no waiting at the counter. After waiting in line at security, we were sent back to the ticket counter because Aeromexico could only process paper tickets upon boarding. So we found ourselves at the back of the counter line waiting for supposedly unnecessary paper, after which we once again trudged back to security processing. This could change some day, but probably no way to easily know when. 4) There was a fog delay outbound from Queretaro. Obviously no fault of the airline, but maybe good to know about flight conditions this time of the year.

### "never fly Aeromexico again"
❎ Not Verified |  Vancouver to Managua via Mexico City. An absolutely infuriating experience. Hopelessly incompetent customer relations staff and I’m convinced the whole ordeal was a scam! We were on a layover and waiting at the correct gate to board the flight. The ticket said that our gate time was 1550 and we had checked in earlier to see if we could board. The flight attendant said to wait. So we waited and listened. During this period there was 6 last calls from Mexico city to Monterey. I know this because I was listening intently. At 1535 there was the first and only last call for our flight. Quite literally we were at the gate 5 seconds later at which time the gate attendant looked us in the eye and shut the gate, even with people still visibly walking down the ramp to the plane! 7 people missed that plane and all 7 of us were at the correct gate on time. I honestly thought the lady was joking when she closed the gate immediately after saying last call. Missing the flight was one thing, but we then proceeded to get pinballed around the airport for hours. Speaking to one supervisor saying that he/she couldn’t do anything and the only person who could help us was the next person, and the next person. Will absolutely never fly Aeromexico again.

### "has the worst customer service"
San Francisco to Guadalajara. This company has the worst customer service. There are many things that they did wrong. First, our flight got delayed because of the bad weather but we managed to get to the airport for our connecting flight 1 hour prior to departure. However, there was no staff from Aeromexico at the counter so we couldn't get our boarding pasess. No self-check in option either. Called customer service and their solution was to book another flight because they couldn't do anything. What an awful, stressful and enraging experience. Never booking with them again.

### "unpredictable and inconsistent"
Aeromexico is relatively cheap to fly with, but their service is unpredictable and inconsistent. Recently I flew with them on a long series of flights, including Mexico City to Lima. On some legs of the trip, counter staff glanced at my bag and judged it to be too big to carry on. On other legs, staff glanced at the exact same bag and instantly ok'd it for carry on. En route an urgent issue arose and it was physically impossible for me to access counter staff so I had to phone the call centre. I explained the problem at least 4 or 5 times clearly and in detail but the agent would not listen or answer my questions. She just referred me to counter staff. On line check in is terrible - virtually impossible to use and judging by the long periods of time it is unavailable, Aeromexico does not give it priority. Seat comfort was average. Movie selection was excellent, music selection was abysmal. You need to pay extra attention to their scheduling. They have some short delays but once, for an international connecting flight I had, they suddenly, with less than 24 hours notice, scheduled departure for one hour earlier. Often Aeromexico offers the best fares, but they also have the earmarks of an airline that is increasingly trying to cut corners to the detriment of customers.

### "horrible customer service"
Washington DC to Mexico City. Horrible customer service - I will never fly with Aeromexico again. 3 hour flight delay from Dulles to Mexico City caused me to miss my connection. Customer service barely understood English and showed little concern. I found them rude and unhelpful. I ask my wife (who is Mexican and speaks fluent Spanish and English) to assist me in changing my return flight which was also on Aeromexico. The customer service person was not only rude to her as well but they provided inaccurate information regarding their own flight routes and hung up instead of trying to understand the request of their customer. Never again. I gave them one star because they are the only flight from Washington D.C. to Mexico City overnight direct.

### "not heard back from anyone"
Mexico City to Huatulco. I have nothing against the flight attendants but our experience with the Aeromexico airport crew and phone customer service reps last June have been nothing but horrendous. We had a connecting flight in Mexico City that was canceled because of a storm and I understand that it is out of your control. But what happened after that was the problem. We were by the gate when they canceled the flight, no one would help us rebook nor recover our checked luggages. All they had given us was a local number to call for instructions. Good thing I had friends who were able to speak Spanish and had phones with them but even with that we couldn't get help. The number they gave us was useless and we couldn't go in the carousel area since they would not let us in to just get our bags. After a couple of hours of running around the place and pleading with security so they can let us in to get our unsecured luggages in the middle of the arrival area, we were able to rebook a flight. Then they canceled that flight too and so we had to do everything all over again. It was a nightmare. On our way back, we were downgraded from business class to coach. So they apologized and compensated us with a voucher with an instruction that I can use it to upgrade any future round trip Aeromexico tickets. But the catch is that I should use the voucher within a year. Now, I called customer service and they are not helping me in any way. I have booked my flights and wanted to use the voucher but they are asking me to do a lot of things before I can use the voucher. This is just unacceptable. This second experience isn't helping my frustration with the first experience. I feel like I'm in Mexico City airport again trying to figure out what to do without anyone trying to help. It is just too much work for me to be able to use the voucher as what I have been told. To have an upgrade for any roundtrip tickets of aeromexico. I mean, I am not even asking for free flights. I am only asking to use the voucher that I have been given. I have not heard back from anyone.

### "customer service seemed incompetent"
Tuxtla Gutierrez to SFO via Mexico City. I few with Aeromexico in August in three segments from Tuxtla Gutierrez to SFO, and I wanted to get miles credit for these three flights. But the SkyTeam website and their customer service seemed incompetent to me and I am giving up trying to get the credit for these flights. I sent them a message by website too, but no response. On the other hand, I contacted United MileagePlus for Avianca flight (on the flight there), and I got the credit soon.

### "not appreciate being treated like this"
Mexico City to Washington. I was traveling from Cabo San Lucas to Washington, DC. My connection flight was in Mexico City. I spent $25 USD on my first flight from Cabo to Mexico City to upgrade my seat, as well as have zone 2 boarding. That flight was great. On my connecting flight from Mexico City to Washington, DC I spent $75 USD to upgrade my seat and have zone 2 boarding. Before boarding I was called up to the front desk by a AeroMexico representative, who I informed immediately I did not speak Spanish. He told me that I was going to have a random bag check and to step to the side. I agreed, as this was no problem. There was a second gentlemen in front of me who was also having a random bag check. When he was finished, I was told by another AeroMexico representative to proceed to the security woman to check my bags. When I gave my passport and bags to the security woman (who I also informed I did not speak Spanish) she waved me through without checking my bags and said I was free to go. I walked down the ramp as instructed and started to wait in line to board my flight. 5 minutes later, the AeroMexico representative that was working the ticket counter came screaming down the ramp, yelling my name and making a huge scene in front of everyone in line. He would not let me talk and was yelling at me that I should have had my bags checked. I was trying to tell him that the security woman had waved me through and that I had stopped like he told me to to have my bags checked. He would not stop yelling and also put his hand on my shoulder pushing me forward. I was being treated like a criminal when I had nothing to hide and also followed his directions. Once he escorted me to the security woman at the top of the ramp she informed him that she had waved me through. He never apologized to me. My bags were checked and I was free to go. I was very embarrassed and scared that I had done something wrong when I had not. I do not appreciate being treated like this, especially when I paid extra money to have my seat upgraded. I was one of the last people to board the plane.

### "horrible and disrespectful"
New York JFK to Buenos Aires via Mexico. This was by far the worst experience that I have. The customer service was the worst. I have no idea where they recruit their staff but they are very disrespectful. I checked my bag and I passed the weight limit by half pound. Well she said that I have to pay extra, but i have a carry on bag and i said i will put that half pound in my carry on. Then she said that she has to weight my carry on. At this point I was annoyed, not only because of the situation but they way she was telling me. Long story short I had to paid $260 dollar more to check in my carry on. The worst part is that she was chit chatting with her co-worker and laughing while charging my credit card. After all the procedure she get back to me with that poker face and said "by the way the flight is delay". I really doubt that the airline provided any customer service training to this people but I guess we have to start with an apology and not "by the way". I get to the gate and they starting to ask to check the carry on bag, and the funny part is that they didnt weigh any of those bags. I decided to ignore the situation and just wait for boarding, My nightmare didnt end, my seat was next to the exit so the attendant was explaining to us in spanish the rules and  when she finished she ask if we understood. I am Asian but my maternal language is spanish, I replied to her yes in spanish. She looked at me and repeated the whole thing in English again and I said, I speak Spanish so I know what you meant. She stared at me like 5 seconds and kept repeating the whole process in english so I just ignored her and closed my eyes, she woke me up and asked me again in english if i understood. The whole experience was horrible and disrespectful.

### "Cabin service impeccable"
New York to Sao Paulo via Mexico City. It was a great service overall. Cabin service impeccable. Flight attendants very attentive and friendly. Food and wine outstanding.

### "was the worst experience"
Los Angeles to Bogota via Mexico City. It was the worst experience I had with any airline. The customer service is the worst. Due to their bad service and lack of interest to help anyone, I missed 3 flights; my total travel time was 33 hours instead of 16 hours originally planned. This occurred during my flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City and Bogota. This airline, never offered any help to accommodate me with a hotel during the delays. I really needed to sleep. And I wasn’t able to sleep at all during this ordeal. Not even food vouchers were given. I arrived ill due to the lack of sleep. This is something the consumer must be aware before choose an airline. The savings are absolutely not worth the painful experience.

### "such horrible customer service"
Lima to San Francisco via Mexico City. I've traveled on many airlines and have never experienced such horrible customer service. The airplanes are old and decrepit .I had to use the restroom on a flight from Mexico City to San Francisco, it was an emergency. It was during the time they were serving drinks. Mind you, this has never been a problem on any other airline. They simply ask me to move into one of the isles- they push their cart and I can easily go by. This time, the rep told me to use first class. I was okay with this but the way he ordered it was obnoxious. I rushed all the way back (they were very close to the end of the plane). As soon as I walked into first class the most pretentious women I have encountered stopped me, and told me to go back and use the restroom reserved for my class! I told her the other airline attendant had told me it was okay to use this bathroom. She literally backed me up into my area and shouted at the other airline attendant that no one was allowed to use those prestigous golden bathrooms. The original flight attendant finally made the room he could have made from the beginning and I was allowed to use the restroom. I have never been more upset on a flight. They had the cheapest prices and they are the worst.

### "Decent flight, on time"
Mexico City to Miami. Decent flight, on time, good service on Business not the best but honest. They treat you by your name etc. Food is poor, better eat at the lounge will be better. The breakfast they serve in Business is equal to an economy class Breakfast in Lufthansa or Air France. A little disappointed to be honest. Multimedia is great and offer a huge selection of movies and a very good screen. Seats are ok the normal standard seat for Aeromexico in short - medium flights. Space for the bags even if the business class is full.

### "staff were very accommodating"
Las Vegas to Mexico City. I bought a ticket with prepaid luggage. When I was making web check in the system tried to make me pay again. So we had to make it at the airport. Travelling with senior citizens and staff were very accomodating. FA were nice. The flight included a lunch service. Flight arrive on time.

### "the airline from hell"
Cancun to Los Angeles via Mexico City. This was the airline from hell. My flight from LAX to Cancun was canceled less than 24 hours before taking off because they were "no longer operating" and I couldn't get on another flight for another 6 hours from the original after being denied many times, a supervisor agreed to book another airline. When I landed in Mexico City for my connection the supervisor said it wasn't her problem and I needed to book another flight so I paid an extra $200 to get to Cancun to make the wedding I was going to. On the way back I had booked with The same airline again unfortunately & when I arrive to the airport they tell me my flight is overbooked! How is that possible when I paid for it? They put me on standby and tell me there's nothing they can do but give me food vouchers or airline vouchers. So she tells me instead of my 11am flight I can leave at 1:20 instead but my connecting flight in Mexico City won't leave till 720pm! So I ended up spending entire days in airports because of their stupid excuses and they gave me a "MasterCard" I can't even activate LOL because I have to call an international number & when I called the airline they told me I need to email customer relations - I thought I called customer relations! This is by far the worst airline and customer service I've ever encountered!

### "I am a very dissatisfied customer"
My husband and I were flying from Mexico City to Shanghai. The plane from Shanghai to Mexico City was extremely uncomfortable in economy class (by the way, do not pay for the emergency seats, they are the worst seats,) so we decided to upgrade to Premium economy to better our seats (around $6,000 pesos more). When we checked in at the airport, we were charged $1,800 Mexican pesos extras for 3 extra kilos as apparently Premium economy means nothing. You won't get any sort of benefits whatsoever, so if you are reading this, just be aware about the luggage requirements and avoid checking in your carry on. You will not find any sort of helpful staff neither at the airport nor via phone to help you understand, clarify, or reinburse any money regarding this issue. We bought the tickets thinking they were a good deal, at the end, we ended up paying way more than if we had bought a more expensive tickets through a different airline. I do not recommend this airline at all. I am a very dissatisfied customer and we will certainly not fly again through Aeromexico.

### "nothing but rude to us"
Cancun to Vancouver via Mexico City. Boarded our flight from Cancun to Mexico city with no issue. Boarding our Vancouver bound flight, and this is where it all went to hell. As usual with Aeromexico, boarding started late. Flight was delayed by about 20 minutes because of it. However, when refuelling the plane, they miscalculated and had to start all over, delaying the flight even longer. After they finished we got the whole safety video and pre take off information, but we hadn't left the gate yet. Look outside, it's pouring, thunder, lighting, hail. It didn't look good. After about 40 minutes of no information, I got sick and tired of it, so I confronted the cabin crew to make some announcements, which they did eventually, in Spanish. Remember, this was a Vancouver bound flight, most people spoke English. After about three hours of little information, little water and no food, they cancelled the flight and deplanned due to bad weather and a fuel related issue. We all thought, well great, at least we will get a hotel. Just getting our exit tickets took about an hour because there were only two gate attendents trying to help over 200 angry passengers. To make matters worse, they said they wouldn't rebook us and we'd have to figure it out ourselves. They gave us a local number to call, only problem, we didn't have local cell phones. Sick and tired of the gate attendents only speaking Spanish, we went to the check in counters to try and rebook, only to find a giant queue of confused passengers. Turns out, the airport cancelled all their flights that night. So we stood in the line and about an hour and a half later, we got our new tickets for a flight in 2 days. To make matters worse we still had to collect our check in bags and find a hotel. 3hrs later, we got our bags and went to Aeromexico to find a hotel, only to learn that they will not be compensating is because the delay was weather related. Mind you, the captain told us the delay and cancellation was due to the fuel misshap. No matter what we said to their "customer service representative" they wouldn't budge. We were forced to spend two days in the airport with our bags and fellow passengers who also got screwed by Aeromexico because by the time we finished this while rebooking thing, all the hotels were sold out by other airlines. Every staff member we witnessed was nothing but rude to us. Also, the vast majority don't speak a word of english. Being an international airline, I would think speaking English would be important. I highly recommend not choosing this airline unless you want to be stranded in Mexico city with no fresh clothes, beds and food for two days.

### "horrible customer service"
Vancouver to Nicaragua via Mexico City. I've flown many different airlines and never experienced one as bad as Aeroméxico! Constant misinformation, horrible customer service and surprise fees! I Will never fly with Aeroméxico again. I was charged $188 each way to carry my surfboard! The max I have ever paid on any airline previously being $50.

### "horrible, unprofessional, incompetent"
Mexico City to New York JFK. I was shocked by the horrible, unprofessional, incompetent way that I was treated by Aeromexico during my recent flight. Their deception, misinformation and incompetence cost me 8,612 extra pesos! I should not have been treated this way. I arrived at the Mexico City airport in the early morning, hours before my flight. I checked in at Aeromexico's check-in desk. The clerk checked my printed ticket and my U.S. passport and confirmed them. I asked if there was anything else, and she said no, that I was good to go. She checked in my suitcase and gave me the receipt for my checked-in bag. Then I went to my gate and waited several hours until boarding. When boarding began, I stood in line and eventually reached the front of the line, expecting to be checked in and board the plane. The Aeromexico employee at the gate asked me for the stub from my Mexican immigration papers, which I signed upon entering the country. The Aeromexico clerk at the baggage check-in had said nothing about this stub when I asked if there was "anything else" I needed. When she indicated that there wasn't, I placed the stub into my suitcase, which she then checked in. The clerk at the gate told me not to worry, that all I'd need to do is go to the Immigration desk and sign another immigration stub. She told me to sign it, then come back to the gate — that I could then board at the gate with no problem. That turned out to be a lie — or at least, radical misinformation. At her direction, I ran to the Immigration desk, signed a second immigration stub, and paid a 500 peso penalty, then sprinted back to the gate, returning just minutes after I had left. Suddenly the clerk at the gate had completely changed her tune. Sorry," she said, "plane's leaving. You can't board. I reminded her that she told me to go get the second immigration stub, return to the gate, and that I'd have no problem boarding the plane. The clerk brushed off my concern like it was of no importance and returned to chatting with a fellow employee. Upset, I went to the Aeromexico customer service desk. The clerk there told me not to worry, that this was no problem at all. There's a 9:05 am.flight to JFK," she said. Just go to the Aeromexico desk at L2 or L3, ask for the manager and have her switch you to that flight. It will be no charge. But this turned out to be a lie too. I should have known something was up because the clerk refused to tell me her name. When I sighed, she told me again: Just go to L2 or L3, talk to the manager, and get the free reassignment. It's just a little bit of paperwork," she said. So I went to L2 and waited in line for 45 minutes to see the manager. When I got to the front desk, the clerk there said that if I wanted to get on the next flight, there would be a penalty - a 8,112 pesos. That's $453.65. It's Aeromexico procedure," they said. In the end, I spoke with 8 Aeromexico employees, but none helped, including the customer service help line. They told me they had no power to process customer service matters.

### "inflight service very poor"
My flight from Shanghai to Guatemala City via Mexico City was 5:30 am so I arrive early at the airport. Aeromexico ground staff in Shanghai are helpful. Flight departure 20 mins delay. Inflight service very poor. It's 16 hours flight but they did not supply any amenity kit. All cabin crew were rude. Wifi is expensive (21.99$ for 110 MB). Inflight entertainment very poor. Food quality average. They serve 2 time food this 16 hours flight. Mexico City to Guatemala flight departure and arrive right time. This segment better than PVG to MEX.

### "never use this airline again"
Guadalajara to Monterry. We had the worst experience with Aeromexico with our flight from Gaudalajara to Monterrey on 23rd July. In the airport we were faced with a huge line to check in and it was moving incredibly slow. We only had to check in our baggage as we had already checked in in the system. There was no baggage-drop line. After we had queued for more than an hour and we finally reached the counter, the staffer demonstrated the worst service I've ever experienced. It turned out that our two suitcases each exceeded the permitted weight limit on 23 kg with 200 grams. It is normally not a problem, as I in two seconds relocate some of the content from my check-in suitcase to my hand baggage but they refused to let us do so, unless we went to the very back of the line. This would mean that we would miss our flight. Instead we had to pay MXN 1800 each (ie in total MXN 3200) for the overweight. It is a significant off-market and burdensome condition not to be allowed to repack the suitcases in order to comply with the allowed weight limit. We will never use this airline again!

### "will never fly them again"
San Antonio to Puerto Vallarta via Mexico City. The lack of customer service is why I will never fly them again. We had originally booked our trip on March 2, 2017 and picked our dates and flights based on the family budget for our vacation. In May we received notice that the return flight was cancelled and come to find out there were no flights with them back at anytime that day. So we could either fly back with someone else and we could stay another day. After looking over the options the cheapest was to stay another day. I understand that this can happen, but with any other airlines they would try to compensate the customer because of the issues. After trying to contact them, found out that in order to get an answer the only option was through email with a 5 day response time. As a group we were just hoping that they might at least pay for our baggage since it would not cost the airlines extra money and it would help us by paying some of the cost we were having to pay out. By the time they finally answered it was to say no, but that they were sorry and really hoped to get our business back. We have flown with other airlines and they moved our flight by 15 minutes and gave use $25 vouchers that could be used for future flights or our baggage. So even with all of this we went and when checking back in, the website would not allow us to add baggage to 4 of our guest as it showed they already had paid baggage, so we add the 2 extra. However, when we got to the airport, it only showed the 2 bags. So now instead of the $20 we have to pay $25. However, when we went to pay because of the currency exchange we had to pay $30 and they were not willing to honor the $20 we would have paid because of their website issues. This does not even cover that the plane looked as though it was going to fall apart at any moment and since they do not seem to do compensation you would think they could pay for upgrading their planes.

### "unable to get on the plane"
Quito to New York via Mexico City. Aeromexico refunded my ticket without letting me know and for no reason. The night before my flight, I received an email from them to check in online, so I did not suspect anything was wrong. Upon arrival at the airport, I was told that my ticket had been refunded and was therefore no longer flying with them that day. I asked why and they couldn't give me an explanation, no one knew why. When I told them that I had received an email from them just the night before, the customer service agent told me, "Well maybe if you would have checked in online we would not have refunded your ticket. He then suggested that I fly tomorrow, which would cost three times the original ticket. After an hour of talking to multiple people, they told me I would be able to fly that day I just had to pay for the ticket. However, their machine would not accept my credit card and I could not take out an efficient amount of money from the ATM to cover the cost, and they refused to take a card over the phone from a family member. So I was unable to get on the plane, and had to re book, which I did so with a different airline.

### "pay a little more to avoid Aeromexico"
I have been flying around the world for more than twenty years and Aeromexico is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. Service was horrible with screens and remote controls falling apart. Quality of food and snacks was deplorable. Connection from Mexico City-Sao Paulo was delayed to the next morning. Aeromexico sent me, my wife and two kids to a downtown hotel far from the airport, with poor quality and extremely noisy neighborhood. We were supposed to arrive in Sao Paulo between 10-11:00 am and we arrived at 10:00 pm. Flight back had no delays but again, horrible food, flight attendants rude and unhelpful. Flying with a family we always try to save the most on our ticket price but for sure, next time I will pay a little more to avoid Aeromexico. Do not make that mistake, I am still regretting it.

### "the seat was literally coming apart"
Done 4 flights on Aeromexico flying from Mexico to San Francisco. Not only were the planes old, the seat was literally coming apart! Headrest, seat bottom all in really bad shape. Boarding is never on time even when it's the first flight. Worse still, they don't always communicate everything in English meaning key statements are missed are not translated but in Spanish.

### "treated really well"
I have heard so many horror stories from Aeromexico that I became scared to fly with them. I can honestly say that they are better than they are given credit for on my flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles we were treated really well, all of the staff were helpful and we were served a full breakfast in a 3.5 hour flight which is almost unheard of in most North American carriers. Another plus was that our aircraft was new and our flight arrived on time.

### "worst cancellation policy"
Calgary to Lima via Mexico City. Buyer beware Aeromexico has the worst cancellation policy I have ever come by with an Ariline. My husband and I had to cancel our flights due to a family medical emergency. I went to re-book the tickets 3 weeks later, I was told there would be a $100USD no show fee applied to our rebooking for each ticket plus a $250 re-booking fee for each ticket! A total of $700USD. I had cancelled our prior tickets more than a week before flying. When cancelling my flight the rep didn't notify me of this policy. When booking it said there is a cancellation fee but $350 a ticket is crazy. When calling in to re-book, I asked for a manager and was told there was no manager available and that I would need to send in an email. The response time was going to be 7 - 10 days. I called again the next night to speak with a manager, I was told that there was no one available. I said I would wait, they finally put me through, I waited for 10 minutes and was hung up on. I tried calling back again, waited on the phone for an hour and no-one answered. Pretty sure they screened my call. Needless to say we didn't re-book with them and were unable to use our credit. Very disappointed in the lack of customer service and terrible policies - rip-off!

### "A really bad experience"
Havana to Veracruz via Mexico City. If you expect a Premium quality service "Clase Premier" is not for you. Check in was average. I just receive one boarding pass and was told to collect the next one in Mexico (system failure). No fast track for security. No lounge access (Aeromexico does not have any agreement in this route). Chaotic boarding (altough it was passengers fault). Welcome drink consisted in a minuscle glass of hot water or warm orange juice (consider that air conditioner was not working in the airport). So I asked for a beer and had to wait about 30 minutes. No personal screens. Many ads in the entertainment system. Meals were atrocious, the lowest quality I have found in business class. After landing my baggage I waited 30 minutes for my baggage and had to make a very long queu to get my connection boarding pass (no priority lane). Taking everything into account you just receive a little bigger seat and nothig else. A really bad experience: Dont waste your money in Clase Premier!

### "Snack food on short flights is terrible"
Flew from London Heathrow to Guatemala via Mexico City. I've flown Aeromexico several times and haven't had any problems. Seats are ok, could be a bit wider though. Snack food on short flights is terrible, food on long flights good, entertainment system is OKish, but no games and not all movies are subtitled. Air hostesses very nice and the planes have been clean. Mexico City airport, past immigration, is noisy, noisy, noisy with nowhere decent to eat.

### "help desk could do nothing for us"
The four of us booked a flight from Vancouver to Bogota, with a 2-hours connecting flight in Mexico City. The flight landed in Mexico City 30 mins late, and we were rushing to get to our connecting flight. We had to go through customs, pick up our luggage, then drop it off again and go through custom and security for our connecting flight, in less than an hour and half. We actually missed our flight, and when we went to the Aeromexico help desk, they said they could do nothing for us, but we had to pay over 800CAD each to take the next flight. It was cheaper for us to book with another airline from Mexico city to Bogota, but apparently, if we do that then our return flight gets cancelled as well. So pretty much, we were forced to pay 800 each, we couldn't take other airline, and we had to pretty much sleep on the airport floor until our next flight left. And they had two flights to Bogota the same day and the flight was pretty much empty! They should've known better that Mexico City had ridiculously slow immigration, yet they scheduled the flight to be only 2 hours apart. Not only that, their flight landed late, and we didn't even have the option of choosing another flight?

### "cabin staff was the rudest"
Mexico City to Paris CDG. The Boeing 787-9 is lovely, a solo window seat in business class. Nice amenity kit. Pillow ok (a bit small) and nice comforter. The video screen was large and the IFE selection was excellent. Food was disappointing - bland and overcooked. Wine and champagne selection was good. International airport lounge in Mexico City closed early at 10pm and they had us move to a very crowded domestic lounge farther away from the gates. The second lounge was dirty, wines were not re-stocked and food was sparse. It was a mess. The cabin staff was the rudest I have ever experienced in business class on any airline. Bare minimum. Rarely came through the cabin. I was not served at dinner, asked for a meal and a drink after waiting over an hour and was treated very rudely. It is a pity that this airline, which has obviously invested heavily in nice equipment, has such lousy service staff - both on the ground and in the air. They need to fix it. I would avoid them.

### "happy to recommend Aeromexico"
New York JFK to Mexico City. I have been a long time customer of AeroMexico, and overall, I am happy to recommend AeroMexico. All of their planes lean to new or recently renovated, their fares are competitive, and their service is competent. On this trip I was flying JFK-MEX-ACA. The MEX ACA route is an E190, and basically so short (45 minutes) that it is not worth reviewing. Only comment I have there is that I am not a huge fan of gate-bus-gangway flights that Aeromexico opts for for its E190s, as a result of having more planes than Terminal 2 at CdMx can handle. The flight from JFK was great, with only a few hiccups. Checking in at a Premier Clase desk is usually a speedy affair, though this time they could not give me a connecting boarding pass for the Acapulco leg until I got to the gate - they said that check in was not open for that flight - something that has never happened to me on this route before (with identical itinerary). Boarding was easy enough - though I would advise travellers to find and line up in their zone early - there tends to be a rush, and overhead space is always at a premium owing to the seemingly lax enforcement to carry-on rules. It always seems that the "personal" bag is the same size as the carry on. The staff was polite, and the announcements clear (and they did get my connecting boarding pass printed). So now on to the Boeing 787 and Clase Premiere, I love this plane. By far the best I have flown. The configurations differ; this was 1-2-1 pods, with little storage bins, lie flat seats and a movable outer armrest (also with storage). The entertainment screen is big, can be accessed by touch screen or by small tethered controller hidden away. There is ample space, both width and length. The seats are comfortable, and the plane feels spacious. There are three bathrooms for business class, two of which feel spacious (they have windows). The inflight service is courteous, but overall can feel absent at times. They serve a beverage before takeoff (water, juice, champagne), a pre-dinner drink/cheese plate, dinner (basic meat/pasta options, salad, roll & dessert) and that's it. Immigration and custom forms are distributed while you are still at the gate, which I like. Previously it seemed like they never handed them out until the last moment. There is a back galley with self service items for later on in the flight, including an attendant who insists on carrying open liquids (coffee, etc) for you to your seat. There was advertisements for Wifi, and the Wifi light was on during the flight, but was never available, either on the US side of the border or the Mexican side. That was a disappointment. Its a no brainer to opt for this plane over the 737 when your schedule allows. This plane makes one trip a day MEX-JFK in the morning, and JFK-MEX in the afternoon. The rest of the Aeromexico planes on this route are 737-8/9. Good planes, same service, but the 787 is in a different league.

### "staff were courteous and informative"
I am a frequent flyer from Canada to Guatemala, but this was my first experience with Aeromexico, fortunately, a good one. Most of the other airlines do not offer what I got on my recent flight, complimentary delicious airplane meals, drinks (alcohol and non-alcoholic) and entertainment. I did not check if there was wi-fi available, I didn't need it. The staff were courteous and informative. Leg room was nice, I did not feel like I was in a sardine can as with other flights. Luggage arrived on time! I have had many issues with other airlines on past flights. It is usual now that most airlines depart delayed, I notice that this flight arrived on time. My experience was great this time. Aeromexico has become our airline of choice for the near future.

### "wasn't disappointed with Aeromexico"
Before taking this trip, I read so many horrible reviews of Aeromexico. We flew from Toronto to Guatemala City, with a layover in Mexico City. One thing I will say is that these flights never leave on time. I think every single one of our flights were late. But, we still managed to arrive at our destinations within 10-20 minutes of the original arrival time (sometimes earlier). Though, I think it would be ideal to keep in mind that if you have to make a layover, try and plan for at least a 1-2 hour layover. This will give you some wiggle room with an airline that is notorious for delays and save you the headache and stress. The food was mediocre, but I find most airplane food is. I have flown several times internationally to Asia, and have never liked the food. On our flights it was a croissant sandwich and a snack - standard and nothing wrong with it. I didn't have any negative experiences with the flight attendants on these flights. No one was rude or unhelpful. Seats were as comfortable as I expected them to be. A few of our flight segments were overbooked, which seems to be general practice for most airlines, which is what seemed to lead to the delays we were experiencing. Overall, I wasn't disappointed with Aeromexico.

### "flight attendants were not overly friendly"
Flew Aeromexico from Buenos Aires to London via Mexico City. Not Great! Flight attendants were not overly friendly. Food was poor, cold and very little of it. We were able to get our boarding passes for the 2nd leg of our trip, but could not check luggage through. Whether this is just Mexico City, but we had to collect our luggage and go to departures, clear immigration and security again. We were informed then by Aeromexico staff that our bike boxes had to be wrapped when departing Mexico City, totally different packaging requirements to what we had been advised by Aeromexico. This obviously caused some significant delays and resulted in us nearly missing our connecting Aeromexico flight. Staff in Mexico City airport were overall very unhelpful. Even though our flight was a day time flight with only a 3 hour time zone difference, we were forced to fly with the cabin in darkness. Individual window controls where overidden, so all the smart glass windows were completely blacked out, meaning there is no point in window seat, no views and no natural light. Wouldn't use again!

### "let down by the airport processes"
❎ Unverified |  Havana to Vancouver via Mexico City. I will say the cabin crew and the flight itself was actually pretty good. My review is regarding the airline's ground crew and counter staff at Benito Juarez International in Mexico City. We were travelling from Havana, Cuba to Vancouver, Canada, transiting through Mexico City. Flyers are unable to do online check-in when flying from Havana. The airline simply does not allow this. So this meant getting to the Havana airport super early for our 6am flight. We were checked in all the way to Vancouver, but were only given the boarding pass to Mexico City. We were told to collect our boarding passes upon landing. The flight from Havana to Mexico City was fine. Landing at Benito Juarez International, upon clearing customs, we were greeted by Aeromexico staff who had pre-printed boarding passes for multiple flights. It was a bit odd because they were standing in the open with literally hundreds of boarding passes piled in front of them, and they were positioned between the exit doors and the bathrooms. They didn't find our boarding passes and we were instructed to go to the kiosks. The boarding passes wouldn't print from the kiosks. We were told this was because we'd already been checked in and the boarding passes had already been issued? So we were then directed to line up for a counter agent. When we reached the counter agent, we were told to go to another line up, for another counter. This counter was specifically for "issues with kiosks printing boarding passes"! There were three counters and two agents working, but only one agent appeared to be working at any given time, as they would periodically disappear. After reaching this final agent, we were able to get our "pre-issued", "pre-printed" boarding passes. This process took nearly 90 minutes from the time we entered the terminal. It's the first time I've experienced something like this but judging from the comments, it's not uncommon. The flights themselves were fine. The attendants were efficient and the food was acceptable. The seats were decent, as was the onboard entertainment system. The flight from Mexico City to Vancouver had USB ports to charge devices while inflight. I really appreciated that. The airline was let down by the airport processes and staff. I could see people easily missing their connections if they got caught up in this runaround.

### "no resolution for another later flight"
Worst experience with Aeromexico! Last night we had a flight to LA from Mexico City. From what they told us, weather did not permit us to enter LA. They dropped us in Tijuana, with no resolution for another later flight to LA, no vouchers for any food, lodging and wouldn't even help us get across the boarder - absolutely nothing. They specifically told us they could not help us because they can't control the weather (which I understand, but keep in mind we had family on the next flight to LA and they went straight to LA, no problem). Aeromexico, won't take care of you in the end.

### "food was really mediocre"
Tokyo to Guadalajara via Mexico. I had very low expectations for Aeromexico after reading all the reviews online. The good aspects of the flights I took were: the airplane was new and relatively clean and the service on board the aircraft was very friendly and somewhat attentive. However, the food was really mediocre and absolutely not "luxe", the AVOD was very limited (thankfully I had downloaded videos of my own on my device), the screens for the AVOD was distorted and blurry at times, the remote control for the AVOD never worked except to turn on the lights overhead, and the seats when fully reclined were very confining in the feet area and not long enough for a 185 cm person like myself. When we booked the flight it was the only nonstop between Tokyo and MEX, but now ANA is in the mix and I would rather take them next time. Wifi was available, but a bit slow.

### "ruined first half of our holidays"
Amsterdam to Huatulco via Mexico City. We were travelling as a family with 2 adult and 3 teenagers. The best thing about Aeromexico would be the staff service on the planes. The seats were not that comfortable. Our further plane to Huatulco was cancelled without any information. We asked other passengers to get information. At the counter before flying to Huatulco, we stood together in one group, telling we are a family. 3 of us were picked for leaving with the plane and the staff told my wife and daughter to go to the next counter for solving some practical problems. Their boarding were torn apart. After a while my wife and daugther were told they could not go on the airplane?! My daugther started to cry and my wife got very worried because she is not used to travel and many people, new places are very hard to cope for her. Two of my children were sitting on the plane, and I had to fight for getting my minor children off the plane again. I felt lucky to get my teenagers off the plane again. It was very stressful and Aeromexico ruined the first half of our holidays in Mexico. Afterwards we thought we could compensation for a lunch or the cancelled flight. We were sent to wrong counter and left ourselves. This is the worst experience from ground staff we ever have experienced.

### "only good thing about this flight was the price"
All round very disappointing flight with Aeromexico from Mexico to Brazil. Service was indistinguishable from what I would expect in Economy class. Seat was flat but at a steep incline and then as such good for rest but not sleep. Food was woeful although given that it was served at 1am I wasn't really in mood to eat. (not their fault - departure time was nearly midnight). Hated Mexico City airport. Lounge was pretty hopeless except for a couple of helpful waiters who managed to organise some crisps and Coca-Cola. Entertainment was ok, not great. The only good thing about this flight was the price which was barely above premium economy. If I were to judge this flight on the basis of it being premium economy I would be much happier. I will as such give it higher marks than I would have if I had paid a true business class fare.

### "customer service is the worst"
A trip that was supposed to be 3.5 hours became 38hrs and the airline never apologized for the delays and cancelled flights. My trip started on time without a problem flying from Houston to Monterrey. My flight was delayed one hour then 3 hours and finally was cancelled. At 5 pm the only flight I was able to get was a flight to Mexico City at 10:30pm with a connection to San Luis Potosí at 6:30 a.m. I thought at least I'll get there in time for Christmas. They gave me a voucher for a hotel room in Mexico City which I slept in it for 2 hours since I had to go back to the airport for my 6am flight which was delayed and re schedule for 11:00 am then cancelled. I had get in line for the second time (the line was taking about 2 hours To get to the front desk) got rescheduled at 2:30. Well it was cancelled again so I had to get in line for the 3rd time another hour finally told the lady to send me with another airline which she did - Aeromar. I went across the hall to check in, surprise the ticket wasn't confirmed so I had to get in line again for the third time. Another hour just to get my ticket transfer confirmed finally my flight was scheduled for 5:30. I arrived in San Luis Potosí two hours later of course I lost my brothers wedding and my car rental reservation. It took me approximately 38hrs from Houston to San Luis. It was supposed to be 3.5 hours trip. I would never use that airline again. I ended up buying a direct return flight with United to Houston for 380 dollars. Aeromexico customer service is the worst.

### "never offered an apology"
Landed in Dallas after a 16 hr direct flight from Dubai with EK. Got my luggage and lmmediately checked into my Dallas to Mexico City flight. The layover which was want to be three hours became 6hrs and was now at risk of overlapping my final flight from Mexico City to Tampico. We arrived at Mexico City with an hour to spare and considering there were several delays faced by Aeromexico on December 23rd, and that the next flight to Tampico was the latest outbound flight, we whre sure we could make it. Then the aircraft parked in a remote location, we waited 10 mins for the bus to arrive and we spent 10 mins in the bus outside the plane after everyone had got on, we then waited outside the terminal building for another 10 mins with the doors closed because the Aeromexico staff where confused at our arrival. At this point the tampico flight had left and we stood in line for 2 hrs waiting to solve the issue. Aeromexico's response is that it's due to weather in Tampico and there is nothing they could do except put us on the next flight at 6:20 am the following day. We waited. At 6:20 am they said there is one cabin crew member they couldn't locate, after several hours we boarded the bus and arrived at the plane, the doors opened and the staff told us weather in Tampico had become bad and we needed to go back to the terminal. The flight was delayed hour on hour until 10:30 when they decided to cancel the flight. They said we needed to call customer service, international call - we rushed back to the check-in area and pleaded with the supervisor on duty, he said he couldn't do anything. During all of this, this 13 hour delay in Mexico City preceded by a 6 hour delay in Dallas, we were never offered an apology, a glass of water, a blanket or bed to sleep in or a morsel of food. There is definitely something fishy going on with the airline management. I will never fly Aeromexico again. In the end we collected our luggage with security, booked a cab to the bus terminal and took a 7 hour bus journey with several others from our flight to tampico, the worst customer experience I have ever had especially because the staff showed not an ounce of humility or compassion.

### "equipment is sub-standard"
Zihuatanejo to Vancouver via Mexico City. Aeromexico offers a wonderful upgrade option, the only problem is their equipment is sub-standard. My wife's seat back would not come forward and mine wouldn't recline. Keeping in mind these are small issues in the grand scheme of life, we were also disappointed to find out that being we paid for an upgrade ($325 usd) as opposed to buying the class premier seat initially, and we were refused access to the first class lounge quite rudely. Major fail.

### "I urge you don't use them"
Tijuana to Mexico City. I booked my vacation to Mexico City with Aeromexico trusting they were part of skyteam. Biggest mistake they ruined my vacation.. I was only 10 minutes late to airport which they said to be there two hours before! Okay 1 hour and 50 minutes the attendant marks my paper later is extremely rude and her manager comes out to say I have to buy another ticket. Do not use them they will lie, treat you horribly and just because you are not Mexican, expect to pay more. I urge you don't use them. They just found a new way to get more money. I told the attendant it recomendar two hours ahead. Not mandatory she was rude and told me I had to buy new tickets for me and my family. Horrible shame on you.

### "multiple horrible experiences"
I recently had multiple horrible experiences with Aeromexico. This first issue I ran into was prior to my flight on October 27 from Tijuana to Mexico City. This was the first flight on my way to Peru for my Honeymoon. The night before the flight I was informed that my first name had been miss spelled by the travel agent who had assisted with booking my flights. I was informed by Aeromexico customer service that it was at the check in representatives discretion whether or not I would be able to fly on each of my flights with a misspelled name. They were not willing to change my name to my correct name and the flight would be non-refundable so if the Airline attendant refused to allow me to fly I would not be able to go on my Honeymoon nor would they be willing to refund my flights. Luckily my connecting flight was with Avianca not Aeromexico and Avianca was able to fix my name on each of their flights. I ended up going back and forth with 14 different customer services representatives with Aeromexico for about 4 ½ hours the night before my trip. Each customer services representative was excuses orientated rather than solution orientated and gave me one excuses after another about why they could not do something as simple as correcting my name. I continued to hang up on each representative after multiple excuses and would call back in. One representative tried to ask for $150.00 fee for each flight to fix my name so it was spelt correctly, this is when I knew that Aeromexico is all about making the travel experience as frustrating as possible for its customers so that it can get more money out of them. I refused to pay the fees and continued to call back in, I was finally able to speak with someone who somehow fixed my name on my flight home and informed me I would need to take my chances on the way there so I went to the Tijuana airport, did my best to distract the Airline attendant, and was able to get through without them catching my first name was miss-spelt as Jospeh rather than the correct spelling Joseph. This entire experience was extremely frustrating, stressful, and not the way you want to start off your Honeymoon. After an entire night of no sleep, a ton of stress, my wife crying due to the concern of potential not going on a trip we spent over $6,000 on we finally were on our way to South America. We had minimal to no issues with Avianca, and did not have another extremely stressful experience until our final flight home with AeroMexico. After our first 6 hour flight from Rio de Janerio, Brazil to Bogota, Columbia, then our 6 hour flight from Bogota, Columbia to Mexico City, Mexico we were ready for our final flight home from Mexico City, Mexico to Tijuana, Mexico prior to using the border crossing into San Diego. This final flight was meant to be an easy 3 hour 20 minute flight. We ended up flying to Tijuana and when we got to the Tijuana Airport we were informed the fog was too thick to land and we ended up circling around the Tijuana Airport for nearly two hours. After circling for nearly two hours we were informed that the Plane would need to refuel at a nearby airport so they flew us into some random airport somewhere in Mexico where we sat on the runway for another two hours. At this point we had been on our 3hr 20 minute flight for 7 hours.

### "we are frustrated by this"
We arrived from Cancun to Mexico City at 6 in the morning to wait 2.5 hours, for our transfer to Aeromexico flight 482 to Las Vegas. As we arrived very early, employees did not have the number of the gate where we would expect our new flight. So we asked an hour later and one of the employees of Info directed us to Gate 62. Where we hope to board the plane. Time passed and nothing. no information of our flight, until we realized that they changed it to Gate 58. We got to the new gate 15 minutes before the plane took off and we were not allowed on the plane. Because we were late. The arrogance of the employees of this airline Aeromexico has no measure. Quite apart we missed the flight, they showed very little interest in helping, any information we did not have our bags. It took over half an hour to locate the bags, go through Mexican useless bureaucracy. We had to stay at the airport that day, with two minors and all the inconveniences. It was the ruin of our holiday. We waited until the following day to return to Las Vegas; and of course we had to pay for 6 new tickets. We are frustrated by this.

### "very uncomfortable and legroom was very tight"
Flew Montreal to Mexico City. Aeromexico is not a premium airline but attempts to make a decent job. Service tends to be courteous and respectful, but not overly friendly. Purser on board this flight was cold and barely answered when talked to (this is why I am rating cabin service poorly). The rest of the crew was OK. The airplane was one of the 737s that has not been yet revamped (N860AM). It was very uncomfortable and legroom was very tight. Armrest earphone plugs did not work, thus it was impossible to watch the inflight movie. Newer airplanes have personal TVs, and since seats are a bit thinner, there are few inches more of legroom. I know AM tries to assign the newer airplanes to the longer routes; but this time they failed and we were flown in an airplane that is better off doing 2-3 hour runs at most. There was a full meal at the beginning of the 5 hour flight and a snack and bar service by the end. All beverages were complimentary, but the meal service was not that good (microwave omelette with a sausage). I see AM trying (maybe too hard) to become something more like LAN or Delta, and in some aspects they are doing it, yet they still have a long way to go.

### "do not fly with them"
Santo Domingo to Mexico City. Horrific experience. If you happen to experience a flight without any hiccups, you'll probably be fine. If anything goes wrong, you're screwed. Their kiosk stopped working at my layover so I had to go through customer service which takes hours (yes, just to print a ticket). Missed my flight, spent 48 hours in hell (running in circles to 12 different customer service lines, 1-3 hours in each line) paid $1000 more in fees, trapped in Mexico on my own dime. If you care about your family, do not fly Aeromexico. If you care about yourself, do not fly with them.

### "will try to avoid Aeromexico"
Montreal to Mexico City with Aeromexico. When you are comparing airlines to select your best flight options, you receive the publicity that Aeromexico includes 2 luggage to check-in and 2 carry on items on international flights. For some reason, they consider flying Canada to Mexico a domestic flight and therefore they only allow 1 checked luggage so I had to pay $73 for the second bag for my spouse and me - this is over $140 which represents more than 10% the flight fare. I will try to avoid Aeromexico.

### "extremely professional and pleasant"
Efficient and smooth check in for a day trip to Mexico City. The outbound flight had the cool 737 MAX with a great cabin, IFE and very comfortable seats with a good seat pitch and seat width. The return flight was an older 737. Cabin crew were extremely professional and pleasant. Drinks were served along with a dry snack. Highly recommended and will fly Aeromexico again.

### "staff treat you well"
New York JFK to Guatemala City via Mexico City with AeroMexico. This is a fine airline. The staff treat you well, and go above and beyond - polite and understanding. The food is free and offered on every flight. I flew AM twice in 2016 and will continue to utilize their services in all of my trips to Latin America and elsewhere - would highly recommend.

### "was the worst experience I had"
I travelled on July in Aeromexico from Mexico to Narita Tokyo - I had never had such a problems I found travelling in Aeromexico. For me it was the worst experience I had from an international airline. On July 4th from Tokyo to Mexico DF, the service was kind of self-service. I felt like the Aeromexico crew was acting as "divas" and we passengers, we were just the audience. They provided us some dinner then we had to wait almost one hour before the arrival to Tokyo to get another meal. Some people stand up to ask what happened with the meal, as almost all people were hungry. They said there was no problem, "everything was under control". Some snacks were provided at the back of the plane, however there was no information about this until you discovered them. On July 28th, the way back from Mexico to Tokyo was the longest flight in my life, as 2 or 3 hours after taking-off, they announced there was an electrical problem, not serious at all however we would need more fuel, so we were on the way to Guadalajara to refuel. This took two additional hours of a 12 hours flight! Also, the maintenance of one of the restroom was not good, as one of the toilet's lid couldn't stand on the tank, so for women we had to use it with the toilet lid standing on our back. I could not imagine how men did, to use this toilet. When I reported the problem to one person of the staff, the Aeromexico staff affirmed that restroom was working well, as she thought I was talking about a problem of flushing it. Then I showed her the toilet lid problem, she said: "Oh, yeah". Maybe for her it was not a problem! Additionally, one of the staff spilled some coke almost on me, the internal communication between staff on the plane, I heard one treating each other as "cabron", which shows again the non-professional staff working in Aeromexico. When they knew I could understand Spanish, they decided to move somewhere else to talk, and instead of being attentive to their passengers, they keep chitchatting during the flight. Aeromexico staff have no notion of in-flight service and service is at not all on the standards of a Skyteam airline. I won't take any Aeromexico flight again.

### "never recommend this awful airline"
Nashville to Cancun. Aeromexico ruined my vacation. Beyond being a big huge mess and cheap, they change flight time several times and do not get any responsibility, even if unexpectedly you lose your flight because you got an email 90 minutes before departure. Their system was down and got no help because employees are poorly trained and do not know how to handle critical situations. Coming back, the flight delayed almost 2 hours, changed gates 3 times at Cancun Airport and it took almost 1.5 hours to get our luggage! Their planes smell bad, windows are dirty, and before landing they asked me for the earphones be given back to them. This was so far the worst experience I had and would never recommend this awful airline to anyone. If you want to go on a pleasant vacation to Cancun, go by Delta!

### "food and service are great"
London Heathrow to Cancun via Mexico City with Aeromexico. LHR and MEX on a B787-8. The cabin pressure better than usual and there was less noise than on other aircraft. More legroom than on other planes was also noticeable. Flight was bumpy over the Mid-Atlantic but pilots navigated around turbulence well. Food served twice and of good quality. IFE modern and easy to use. Flight attendants helpful and friendly. Flight landed 10 minutes early. Flight between MEX and CUN the aircraft was a B737-700 in reasonably good shape. The cabin had been well maintained but no personal IFE. Once again, service was good and flight attendants helpful. A small packet of biscuits was handed out shortly before landing. Flight was delayed 50 minutes due to the pilot not turning up but plane landed in reasonably good timing. CUN-MEX and once again the plane was a 737-700. Flight took off and landed on time in the middle of the night and a bag of peanuts was handed out at about 2am. Flight was bumpy due to thunderstorms underneath but pilots manoeuvred the plane well. MEX-LHR flight was delayed by 1 hour due to a technical problem which they fixed quickly, professionally and efficiently. Two meals served and once again flight attendants were friendly. Turbulence occurred twice: once over the North-East of the U.S.A. and once over the Mid Atlantic. Flight landed 1 hour late due to delay. Overall, Aeromexico was a good airline which uses modern planes on Transatlantic routes and well maintained slightly older planes on shorter routes. The in-flight entertainment system is good and the food and service are great. A good airline.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
When attempting to check in yesterday for an Aeromexico return flight from Mexico City to Los Angeles, I was the told the flight was oversold and there were no seats for me and my wife, despite having booked a round trip ticket on Aeromexico’s website months in advance, having a confirmation number and seats assigned. I was told overbooking by 10% was “legal” due to it being the "high travel season. After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us. She promised to place us first on a waitlist for the flight we had booked. When we appeared at the departure gate we noticed our names were numbers 18 and 22 on the electronic display of waitlisted passengers. Aeromexico and its staff do not understand customer service. Avoid this airline at all costs, particularly if your arrival time is of the essence, either for a connecting flight or an important appointment.

### "added to my 'never again' list"
I flew from London to Mexico City and back with AeroMexico and had an extremely disappointing experience. I used British Airways on this route before and should not have made the mistake of changing the airline. Flight London – Mexico City was delayed 17 hours. We already had boarded the plane when we were told that a technical inspection was ongoing and we would be delayed by 1 hour, then2 hours, then 2.5 hours. After 2.5 hours we were finally told that the flight wouldn’t depart. Admittedly handling of the delay was quite good – it took me only about 1h from disembarking to getting into a hotel room and the following day flight departed and arrived without problems. What was not so good was handling of my request for delayed flight compensation (no answer received to date). On the return leg I made the mistake of going into the AeroMexio lounge in Terminal 2. The worst airline lounge I have ever seen and my travel experience is quite extensive. When I entered the shower I thought maybe it would be better to travel not feeling fresh than risking a disease. The lounge was small, crowded and smelly. This not to mention the incompetence level at the check in – I appreciate that not all counters have to be opened, but the number of open counters should be sufficient not to make business class passangers wait for 25 minutes to check in the luggage. Flight departed with only 1h delay – 16h less than on the way there - progress. Half way through the flight the entertainment system and light in my seat stopped working. Flight was fully booked so there was no way to change the seat. I added AeroMexico to my “never again” list and would encourage everybody to do the same.

### "service is good and attentive"
Aeromexico service is good and attentive. On the flight MTY -JFK in the Economy cabin offer snack (Sandwich, Yoghurt and drinks). The plane normally flown from GDL is old and small plane, also the MTY flying to JFK, which is annoying and which is a flight of more than 4 hours and no IFE. The seats can be a little uncomfortable for many flight hours. Overall it was a good flight and service was good.

### "a positive experience"
Vancouver to Ixtapa via Mexico City with Aeromexico and I had a positive experience. The departure in Vancouver was on time and the service, once in-flight, was impeccable. The planes both ways were top-of-the-line, including the smaller aircraft connecting to Ixtapa. The food was very good on the Vancouver-Mexico City legs, the entertainment was plentiful, flight attendants were checking on passenger needs all the time and the planes were immaculate. There was a gate change in Mexico City airport for the flight going to Ixtapa, with a 30 minutes delay. Mexico City airport would benefit from implementing "automated" English language gate change announcements - if one doesn't speak Spanish, it might be hard to understand accented announcements in English.

### "worst flight ever experienced"
Nashville to Cancun on Aeromexico. Worst flight I have ever experienced! Started off with a 9 hour delay. Then we are traveling with 3 small children and they could not get our seats together. I have flown with my child on several international flights and I've never been told there was nothing they could do to move our seats where at least one parent could sit with the child! Another 1 hour delay on runway on the way back!

### "Would fly them again"
Mexico to London with Aeromexico. It is nice to see the inflight services improving, what is still a disgraceful embarrassment is the service provided in MEX. You first need to print your boarding pass; they claim that you can do it on your smartphone, but the app does not work at all! After you got your pass, you are now randomized into one of the three queues to drop your luggage and get your documents revised. The whole process is a mess, with people not understanding where to go. The red jacket personnel act more like grade school teachers than airport personnel asking clients to get in line. The queuing takes about 20 minutes. Boarding was done by zones, but since we had other flights boarding around, we were quite confused. On board, the airplane is spotless. Cabin crew works hard and is friendly, but a bit aloof. They were neatly dressed and groomed. Seats were the usual economy seats. Some people say they are narrower, but I did not feel particularly cramped. Meal portions were very small but tasty. Inflight entertainment was very good. Inbound flight was a red-eye too, which is very convenient. Would fly them again.

### "the worst experience "
The worst experience with an airline we have ever had! Booked a flight for a vacation to Cancun from SFO departing on 4/29, 11pm. The flight had a layover in Mexico City, then arrive in Cancun 10am 4/30. Needless to say, that didn't happen. Our flight was delayed 45 min, boarded the plane and sat in the plane for another 45min, only to be informed to disembark due to an issue with the plane's cargo door. The time was 12:30-1:00am. We're told that they would inform us every 20min what was happening. We had to inquire ourselves. After another 2hrs, (3:15am), we're informed that our flight was cancelled and we needed retrieve our luggage and await for instructions. All 128 or so passengers waited for the luggage another 45min! (Understanding that at this point, there is only a skeleton crew working at the airport!) Once everyone retrieved luggage, we're told to go to the Aeromexico ticket counter so everyone could be assigned new tickets. We all stood in line for more than an hr without a single movement of the line because there are only 3 windows with three staff members working to help every single passenger! After 1 hour, we hear a person shout out, "Anyone going to Cancun, please head to the Delta ticket counter and they would assist us there". So everyone going on to Cancun are running to the Delta ticket counter with all of our luggage. We had been at the airport for more than 11hrs now. Once at the Delta ticket counter, got in line (now there are people in line checking in for Delta flights) so the line is long. My husband asks one of the Delta agents and they told us we're in the wrong line and needed to move to the "special services" line. So again, moved to this line and waited another 45min before getting to the counter. There was a Delta flight going to Cancun at 7:00am but by this time, too late for this flight. The person assisting us did not know what was going on at all! They booked us on the next flight to Cancun which departed at 8:00am. While we were at the ticket counter, another person who was also being helped, requested a direct flight to Cancun, which they accommodated and it was not even a Delta flight, it was thru United. When we asked if we could do the same, the person told us that he could do this. The tickets he assigned us was all that we could get. We realize what had happened to us was not his fault but he could have assisted us as much as possible. We get to Cancun at 6:30pm and lost a day of our vacation. No apologies, no vouchers, no refunds. The day before we leave Cancun, we try to checkin and it prompts us that we need to contact Aeromexico. Called and we're informed we have to check in at the airport. Get to the airport 2.5hrs early, flight departs at 2pm, get to the counter only to be told, they can not find our etickets in the system. The person from Delta that assisted us, wiped out our return flight tickets. It took another 2hrs with a Delta supervisor helping to get us back in the system. We almost missed our flight.

### "3 hours trying to get help"
I was flying Aeromexico from Tuxtla Gutierrez to Durango via Mexico City. The first flight was delayed and so I missed the connection. I spent 3 hours in the airport trying to get some help but the Aeromexico staff were sending me from one person to another and finally they told me I had to spend the night at Mexico City and that they won't pay any compensation because the delay was due to air traffic control of the airport. Since it's the case that Mexico City airport is always busy then they shoudn't have allowed for only 1hr between connected flights. As a serious airline company they should have local knowledge of the airports.

### "recommend avoiding Aeromexico"
On a recent trip with Aeromexico, I attempted to check in at the airport desk and was told that without proof of exit from my destination, I would not be allowed to check in and board my flight. As I was under time constraints to check in and board my flight, I was pressured by the clerk and the manager on duty to buy a ticket on the spot to show them. I was assured that the ticket I was buying was immediately and fully refundable and simply had to call them to cancel it when I arrived at my destination. I found out afterwards that this was all completely untrue and that I wasn't required to show the ticket desk anything of the sort. Regardless, I had done what they asked in good faith, assuming that at least their reassurance that I could get my money back quickly was true. (Side note: a fully refundable flight from Mexico City to Miami cost over $1400). I then called to cancel my flight and was assured that I would receive my reimbursement within 4-6 weeks. I spent the following two weeks requesting a written statement of this and finally received it by email. Three months later, I still have not received my reimbursement and have been paying interest on this large amount. Customer service has been non-communicative, taking weeks to respond to simple requests for follow up. The call centers refuse to answer questions relating to reimbursements or complaints. Recently, they even admitted in writing that the mistake was theirs due to a typo. Yet, still no reimbursement. I have never experienced such poor and unfair customer service. I recommend avoiding Aeromexico at all costs.

### "avoid Aeromexico in future"
Flew Aeromexico to Managua from San Francisco and of 14 interactions with their clerks (check in, etc) I experienced issues 12 times. Several times the clerks smiled while I was walking them through my issues. Three of four flights we were bumped from the flight despite having a clear reservation and forced to take another flight. One of these bumps ended up forcing my girlfriend and I to stay in Mexico City (not my final destination) and robbing us of one day of a long awaited weeklong vacation. Honestly the people that work for the company don't care and you will feel it at every check in counter. With all of the interactions and issues I faced with Aeromexico I feel like I have enough data to say that 50-75% of the time they will screw up your reservation in one way or another. Its a gamble I will never take again and I'll be happy to pay 3 x the cost of another flight to avoid Aeromexico in the future. I saw these types of reviews before booking originally and wished I had paid more for my flight.

### "unacceptable customer treatment"
San Francisco to Mexico City with Aeromexico - it's a cheap airline, but better avoid it not to ruin your trip. Absolutely unacceptable flight cancellation process and customer treatment. They kept us in the airport waiting for the flight status for 5 hours, every 20 minutes saying in another 20 minutes it will be done and we will depart. The result - from 11pm to 5am in the airport. Then 1.5h to receive luggage and a 3h line to get on another flight - a total of 9h in the airport overnight in lines and without food or water (in SFO it is all closed at night). It is not only ridiculous, but also inhuman to keep people waiting without food, drinks or any other service, especially those with small kids. Absolutely poor on-the-phone support and open lies from phone operators saying that the flight is not cancelled after it got officially cancelled. Getting the operators on the line, in turn, took 1 hour and another 1h in negotiations with high pressure from my side to get a replacing flight the same day. All in all, I got the feeling that Aeromexico openly does not care about its clients and is not willing to do anything to help in a situation of such a case. I've flown many airlines, and they are the worst I've seen so far. In a similar situation many other companies would give you coupon for the next flight, will provide food and drinks, send additional company staff to the airport, and keep transparent about what is happening. I lost my other flight because of their cancellation, and I had to book a new one. None of their managers showed willingness to help, they all just said it's not their business and denied talking about the options.

### "will try to avoid this airline"
Dallas Fort Worth to Mexico City. Aeromexico tickets are cheap, and the flight itself was decent. The staff I dealt with in person was polite enough. The problem I have is with their customer service over the phone. My wife's green card was stolen 2 days before our flight was supposed to take off. The charge to move the flight back one day so we could get a temp I-551 in her passport was almost as much as the tickets themselves. Then the customer service rep tried to tell me on the phone that she didn't need her green card to board the flight when I tried to explain why we needed to try to move it. While he was right, we didn't need it for her to leave the US, we needed it for her to get back into the US, had I listened to him my wife would have been stranded in Mexico. That is the type of thing a customer service rep who deals with a lot of international travel should know. Then after about 20 minutes of talking to them I am told the fee can be waived but it cannot be done over the phone. I have to e-mail somebody and it takes 24-72 hours to hear back. My flight left in 48 hours. I understand that all airlines charge to change things, but their lack support (not having somebody with authority to help with costs I could speak with), their lack of knowledge (almost getting my wife stranded in Mexico) means I most likely will try to avoid this airline on return trips.

### "will never fly them again"
Chicago to Mexico City via Cancun. Terrible airline. The only nice thing is the tv monitors with free movies but they always interuppted with ads. Our flight out of Cancun took forever to get going and got really hot. No aircon. Staff said pilot wouldn't turn on so had more power for take off? Flight from Mexico City to Chicago was delayed over one hour. Sat at gate, no drinks given. Good thing sun was down otherwise we would have baked. Had a meal on the flight - a ham sandwich, but no mayo. Asked for a coke, staff didn't speak english and no ice in drink. They didn't pick up trash for over an hour. They never asked if anyone else wanted another drink. I will never fly them again.

### "good seat pitch"
Efficient boarding in Paris CDG, good seat pitch, good food (ordererd asian vegetarian). During the flight, self service with fruits, sandwiches, cookies and soft drink. IFE old and not very updated. Seats old fashioned, but standard overall great experience.

### "offers very competitive fares"
Travelled last week from Puerto Vallarta to London via Mexico City. I reckon that Aeromexico offers one of the best levels of service in economy class on the North Atlantic on the Boeing 787, and legroom in economy in is quite generous. But what marks out this airline in my experiences, is the quality of the cabin crew. They are really smartly presented and friendly and attentive. The transfer process at the Aeromexico Terminal 2 at Mexico City has been streamlined and is hassle free. The airline also offers very competitive fares for an excellent product.

### "great airline for long hauls"
Aeromexico from Panama City to Tokyo via Mexico City. A Boeing 787 for the long portion of the trip Mexico City to Tokyo, and I was very impressed with the airplane. I was only in economy class however I received a blanket, pillow, night blinders, toothbrush kit and a bottle of water - all waiting on my seat. Seats very comfortable and roomy. Climate controlled and less noise than older planes. Excellent food and all night snacks available at back of plane. Service great and attendants very friendly. I will state that I love to travel and I have been all over the world. I have flown economy and first class. This trip to Tokyo was a very pleasant experience. No complaints about Mexico City Airport and I had no problems at airport with a 6 hour layover. Those that complain should do their homework before booking. Always see what aircraft you are going to be flying on and check it out. No surprises that way. They will tell you the amenities such as entertainment, food service, size of seat, etc. A great airline for long hauls and I highly recommend them.

### "happy with the service"
Villahermosa to Oaxaca via Mexico City. I have flown 7 domestic Aeromexico flights since November and have 4 more planned. I've been happy with the service every time. Peanuts in flight - take a sandwich if it's over a meal time! The staff are helpful but do speak Spanish - we are in a Spanish speaking country! Mexico City terminal 2 is easy and has lots of good / shopping options should you wish them.

### "staff are useless"
Never again will I fly with this horrible airline. Every Aeromexico staff member that I tried to ask for help at Mexico City airport was useless. After being directed by 5 different staffers to the wrong areas for my flight, I was told by the ticket rep that I missed my flight. She then told me that they were holding the plane and that I was to run to the gate with all my baggage. Yep, she sent me through security with my checked bag. Of course my bag wouldn't clear security as it had many over sized liquids and the security staff started hooting and hollering like they hit the jackpot because I was trying to smuggle it in. I tried to explain that the plane was waiting for me and that I was told to bring all my bags by the ticket lady, but of course no one spoke English. I was so upset and obviously missed my plane. Aeromexico staff are useless. The trip cost me an extra $1400 to get back home with a different airline and the stress was unbearable. I received an email after my flight down there asking to fill out a survey on there service but received nothing when they made me miss both flights that I had still to take. Took my money, but couldn't be bothered to find out why I wasn't on those flights.

### "newer planes that were clean"
Flew Aeromexico for the first time from San Francisco to Cancun with short layovers in Mexico City both ways. The first leg was on an older jet that had zero entertainment. Fortunately, this was a red eye and we slept, otherwise it would have made for a long and uncomfortable four hour trip. The rest of the legs were on newer planes that were clean, comfortable and offered personal in-seat screens with a decent selection of movies and TV shows. Not as good as other airlines, but it was decent. Meals were nothing more than a ham and cheese croissant and peanuts. Very sorry excuse for food. Alcohol is complimentary but the selection is mediocre. Avoid the white wine - it's disgusting.

### "never flown Aeromexico"
I have never flown Aeromexico and I am now convinced that this is actually a blessing in disguise. I am planning a destination wedding in Mexico and was ready to book most of my flights with Aeromexico. Over the past couple of months I have tried to book Aeromexico flights numerous times but was never successful. You may be able to get to the last web page of the booking process but are then told that you have to "contact customer service". Calling customer service will require a few hours of your day. You may then find out that the advertised flight on the Aeromexico website is not feasible as the layovers do not provide enough time. The representative will then tell you that you cannot book the flight that you saw on their website. You may have been successful booking a flight via a third party (travelocity, expedia, etc.) only to find that your charge has been refunded a few days later. No warning, no email, no communication from AM at all! The "chat" function on the Aeromexico website is constantly experiencing "technical difficulties". If you actually manage to make it through to a waiting room, good luck! I have spent 2 hours in there without ever having talked to anyone. As a very frequent and global traveler I must say that I can only wonder how this business generates any profit. I can only imagine what the experience must be like once you actually get on one of their flights.

### "no good at all"
Absolutely worthless - no good at all - save your time and money Thanks Aeromexico! For letting me drive 4 hours to make a 9:15 flight to LAX, so I could check in on time - only to be denied and told I couldn't fly for two days. No warning and no offers of compensation. Only after three different phone calls was I able to make a flight tomorrow. One day down from the extended family vacation - and no offers of compensation. One guy even had me on hold for an hour hoping I would go away.

### "cancelled the flight "
Monterrey to Mexico City with Aeromexico, and once again, the airline cancelled the flight 3 hours before departure. They send an e-mail informing that they have reserved one place in the next flight, but actually they didn't. This is not the first time that Aeromexico cancelled fligths, and almost 70% of their flights are delayed.

### "unhappy with service"
Vancouver to Managua return via Mexico City with Aeromexico. Very unhappy with the service on Aeromexico. My girlfriend and I had a horrendous experience at the Mexico City airport while we were transiting. No Aeromexico employees to assist in what was a very confusing and hectic airport. If you can possibly avoid Mexico City airport, please do so. When we returned to Canada, we sent an email to customer service. However, they only permit a very limited number of characters. I requested an email address to explain my complaint. I immediately got a reply back with an email address. However, my lengthy complaint was ignored completely as was my follow up email asking when I could expect a reply. Horrendous customer service. I will avoid flying with this airline in the future.

### "attendant just rolled his eyes"
I flew Aeromexico from Shanghai to Mexico City. I usually wait to enter the plane last because I usually choose the Aisle seat, and I'm a tiny person at 5 feet. Now the first thing I noticed was that they waited till the last moment to board so of course that led to a delay. When I finally boarded the plane all the overhead storage space near my seat was occupied, I went to find a flight attendant and when I explained my situation he just rolled his eyes and puffed and told me to find a place near my seat. I told him that all of the spaces were taken and he again made a noise and asked for my ticket I handed him the ticket and after taking it he just walked away, I followed him as he approached my seat and after checking all the compartments he grunted and again walked away I stood there for a while with my bag on my seat, after a few minutes I saw him again and asked for the space and he said there wasn't any, -for the shape of my bag it was a bit difficult for me to put it underneath my seat- so I asked if he could check again, he again walked away but this time I followed him, he noticed and started forcefully opening all the compartments in the way, he saw one in the business class section and looked me up and down before making a sign that there was space - I got closer and said thanks, he just grunted in response, as I said earlier I'm a short person, so putting the bag in was a bit of a challenge, he just stood there while I struggled to fit my bag, it wasn't until another passenger from the business class got up and helped me that I managed to get the bag in, the flight attendant then proceeded to forcefully shut the compartment and walk away. I'm Asian/Latino so I speak Spanish fluently but during the rest of the flight he pretended that he couldn't understand anything I said. I'm saddened that these people with such heavy prejudice are the ones giving this type of service. Unfortunately for me is the only airline that travels From Mexico to China without going to the States.

### "most disappointing airline"
Los Angeles to Mexico City, and Aeromexico is the most disappointing airline ever! This was my first time flying with them and they lost my luggage. I was in Mexico without any bag and they didn't manage to find it while I was in the country. On top of that, extremely poor support in helping me to even be updated with what the situation is and their rep was extremely rude in not wanting to help! I still don't have my bag nor have they cared to update me about it

### "great service from crew"
Mexico City to Shanghai and great service from crew onboard and at the counter. The pilot greets passengers when boarding. On the flight to Shanghai they make the announcements in Spanish, English and Chinese. They even put chopsticks with the meals. The meals were very well presented. The timings are outstanding as well. Good selection of movies.

### "worst customer service "
Juarez to Guatemala. Be careful when choosing Aeromexico! Flight was cancelled twice due to weather and when I called to reschedule my flight I was told the next available was in 2 days. I scheduled this flight and called back 10 min later to see if I could catch a flight from the US to my connection but was told it would cost twice as much as the total of my trip, even though online I could verify it was cheaper and was offered a flight the next day which I would have to pay a "difference in cost" - which would also cost me more than the total of my current trip. I asked why I was not offered this flight when I had initially called and I was given the run around. If I cancelled my trip I would not get any money back and would only get a credit. I had also upgraded to premier class over the phone with one of their agents and was told I would be charged a total of $125 but my card was charged $215. When I complained to customer relations they denied it, stating they only show a charge of $125 and I would have to send in my bank statement. I sent in my bank statement and have not heard a word from them in almost 2 months. Tried calling to see if I could get in touch with someone regarding this issue but apparently the only way to contact customer relations is via email. Worst customer service ever!

### "never fly Aeromexico again"
Even though our experience was good from Vancouver to México City (red eye, so not much to review really), the Aeromexico flight home was one of our worst ever. We arrived to the indicated section at the airport (national area) and there was mayhem. A total chaos. We had business class tickets but there was no designated line. Trying to get the attention was impossible and, after many extremely rude directives to go back in line, finally one man told us that travelers to Canada (and Canada only) were to go to the international area. With all our luggage we went just to find another single line for all. When we asked about the business class line, we were told (very rude again) that was the only line and that we had to get in line, regardless of what ticket we got. After a good amount of time, we were booked by a rude lady who was more interested in our luggage weight than giving service. We were told that this only happens with flights to Canada because we don't have a reciprocal visa system. We went to the lounge which is old, and in need of repair. Seats are broken, food is bad although the drinks were ok - the worst lounge we ever visited. The boarding was chaotic and the service onboard minimal, no courtesy and once dinner was served, the flight attendants disappeared. Our luggage, tagged "priority" was not in the first batch and our fragile tagged box came with the luggage and not sent to the proper area as it should happened. Even though this is a direct flight, we rather do a stop just to get the service we paid for. Never fly Aeromexico again!

### "excelente servicio abordo"
México a León con Aeroméxico. Vuelo con salida y llegada puntual. Excelente servicio Abordo. Vuelo sin contratiempo. Entrega de equipaje rápida. Manejo adecuado del equipaje. El unico detalle es que se asigno a una sala multiple, de la cual se abordo un autobus y el avion estaba bastante alejado. Esto nos explicaron se debia a la saturación del aeropuerto por ser horario nocturno.

### "not happy choosing Aeromexico"
Every time, the benefits provided to gold members are less and less. I'm not happy choosing Aeromexico as my preferred airline. I'm currently waiting for my flight back to Mexico from Las Vegas and it's just the same - the previous flight departed 3 hours earlier, and I was already at the airport and they did nothing to support me traveling earlier, except if I paid a penalty for moving my flight. I also had to pay for an extra piece of luggage when 2 years ago gold members were granted 2 pieces - worse and worse. I gave feedback to the manager and she was smiling all the time. Smiles are less valuable than positive answers - honestly.

### "considerably cheaper"
Aeromexico from Miami to Caracas via Mexico City, and an older Boeing 737-700 aircraft for both legs and their age was showing in the cabin interior. The service was reasonably good, the food was nothing exceptional. Inflight entertainment was drop down screens. Overall not a bad experience and they were considerably cheaper in looking to get to Caracas where other carriers charge considerably more for a direct flight.

### "Captain said no word"
Torreón to Mexico City, and the Captain said no word during the flight. Flight was delayed two hours because of traffic at Mexico airport. To my knowledge every day same airplanes land and take off, what traffic? After landing in Mexico, the plane was parked in front of the terminal (T2) for 35 minutes waiting for a gate! After that time the plane finally moved but it facing away from terminal, no airbridge to gate and a bus came for us. Ironically I saw at least three gates available at T2. Who knows what happened - no words from the captain. Finally, bags did not came out of the plane according to Sky Priority level, they do whatever they want and throw them in the order they want - where is the benefit? I know part of those issues is Mexico City airport's fault, but come on Aeromexico, you own that airport - especially T2 and you do nothing?

### "boarding in Mexico City awful"
Mexico City to Houston with Aeromexico. Departing to Houston, the boarding in Mexico City airport was awful. There was a single waiting gate for 5 flights. Once we waited, for more than an hour, they then sent us to the plane via bus. The flight was delayed for more than an hour and we had to board the plane by climbing some stairs. Coming back to México, in the airport it was the same thing with delays, to claim our luggage. The plane was a little bit dirty, and the cabin air conditioning, was not working well.

### "flight itself was enjoyable"
Dallas Ft Worth to Mexico City with Aeromexico. The flight itself was enjoyable. Good service and on time. However, arriving at Mexico City we had to deboard to a shuttle and be carried to the gate. On the return flight from Mexico City to DFW in the Mexico City terminal, it was complete chaos at the gate we were sent to. There were several flights leaving from the same gate number. It took us a few minutes to realize that this indeed was our gate and that we needed to get in line. Then we were sent downstairs to wait in another waiting room. Several flights from several airlines were called. The loudspeakers were not used to announce every flight, so many people were confused and did not hear their flight announced. We were very late leaving, probably at least 30-45 minutes. Some people who did not speak Spanish were completely lost as to what they needed to do. This is the second time we have flown to Mexico City and had the problem of not being able to board from the terminal directly to the plane, or having to deboard to the shuttle and then be taken to the terminal. Very inconvenient, especially if one is making connecting flights.

### "would not recommend to use"
Monterrey to Merida via Mexico City, and awful Aeromexico ground service and punctuality. Out of my last 4 flights, 3 were late. Ground staff do not have a good service attitude. The only good thing is the flight crew service. They have improved and are more polite and focused on helping you with your problems. I would not recommend to use Aeromexico unless there is no other option.

### "departed on time"
Montreal to Colima via Mexico City, and service was excellent, flight departed on time with slight delay for deicing. Counter staff helpful with a passport problem we experienced and solved the problem. We were booked through with a second carrier, Aeromar, and Aeromexico handled all the booking. Baggage arrived and was transferred by us as Aeromexico had booked it through. Flight hours were convenient as they were daytime with no overnight or next day arrival

### "will be avoiding Aeromexico"
In the future I will avoid Aeromexico whenever possible, and I recommend you do the same to avoid headaches. I was set to travel from Mexico City to Tapachula. I had my boarding pass, I went through security. However, when I got to the gate they singled me and a few others out for "weight restriction". My only option was to spend the night in a dingy and dusty hotel, and wake up early to face the Mexico City traffic once again. Then, when returning from Mexico City to New York, there was an earlier flight with extra space but they said I could only board if I paid a fee of $250 - more than the cost of the flight. In conclusion, not worth the headache. The only real way to vote these days is with your dollar, so I will be avoiding Aeromexico in the future

### "my worst experience"
New York JFK to Mexico on AM405, 9th January 2016, was a terrible experience! The aircraft was old, when I took my seat in First class (seat 1A) I felt all the structure of the seat because it was in terrible conditions. The plane was dirty and the service was not as the business class deserve - my worst experience of a business class ever! There was no personal inflight entertainment, it was on a main screen that I could never see, because the screen was small and with terrible definition.

### "don't care about complaints"
Madrid to Mexico City, and nothing in Aeromexico's service excels. I would rate it as a less than average airline. They don't care about complaints. I complained last October about their vague treatment with excess luggage and how I was mistreated, and not even a "we-are-sorry" e-mail was received.

### "no inflight entertainment"
Orlando to São Paulo Guarulhos via Mexico City. Service on both these Aeromexico flights was very inconsistent and the people in the airport were very rude. Lounge at Mexico City is one of weakest lounges from Skyteam airlines, and the staff there just look for tips. The food inside the lounge is a joke and the receptionist at lounge the worst at all. The Boeing 737-700 offered no inflight entertainment and on the Boeing 777-220 to São Paulo this worked poorly.

### "was a bad experience"
Oaxaca to Torreon via Mexico City with Aeromexico. It was a bad experience, from Oaxaca we were informed that the connection to Torreon had been canceled by a delay due to air traffic. But the only thing they offered us was to change the flight to the next morning. We were not offered any alternatives or help to resolve the doubts we had. Oaxaca to Torreon via Ciudad de Mexico. Una mala experiencia, desde la ciudad de Oaxaca nos informaron que la conexion con torreon se habia cancelado por un retraso debido al trafico aereo. Sin embargo lo unico que nos ofrecieron fue cambiar al vuelo de la mañana siguiente, yo venia recien operado y no fueron para ofrecerme alternativas de hope daje, no habia quien resolviera las dudas que teniamos.

### "expected a small snack"
Guadalajara to Oaxaca via Mexico City, and the flight left 45 minutes late. There were no Aeromexico employees to assist us to connecting flights. The seats were bigger than economy, but we were not offered anything more that a drink and peanuts, as far as snacks. It was a short flight and I expected a small snack. Nothing was offered.

### "service onboard is poor"
Buenos Aires to Mexico City. I requested Aeromexico Plus seats but when at the airport my seat was taken. People at Buenos Airport were kind and solved it as the aircraft was not full. The price for this upgrade requested and paid in Mexico was higher than what was offered to me in Buenos Aires. Service onboard is poor. Dinner was served and only a few minutes after the flight attendants came by to pick up the tray. Not enough time to eat. Once I had finished I called to have the tray removed from my seat, and it took a long time until this happened. Many smiles, no service.

### "customer service was awful"
Service on board is good, but the seats on the Boeing 737-800 Tijuana to Mexico City flight were old and uncomfortable, and no entertainment whatsoever is available. The use of the B787 on the MEX-TIJ connection is excellent. The flight attendants were available to provide service and assistance. On the return trip, due to Aeromexico delays claimed to be due non-existent fog in Mexico City, Aeromexico did not check our luggage through to Tijuana and put us on standby on a later flight. Having to retrieve the luggage in Mexico City made us miss the standby connection, which caused an overnight stay we had to pay for. Even accepting that hiccup, their customer service was awful. In Oaxaca, the gate agent tried to help but the local supervisor was rude and told the agent to ignore us. He refused to speak to us at all. Sorry, with a full fare first class ticket I expect more. The low rating is due completely to the unacceptable customer service.

### "customer service often very poor"
Villahermosa to Mexico City, and Aeromexico customer service is often very poor. As a passenger you don't have any rights with Aeromexico. Left on the ground on 2 occasions without any compensation or refund. Had to pay own transport and rebooking. Always get the same answer when you complain: "I'm sorry, not possible". They change their timetable like 7 times a year. Very confusing. Unfortunately I'm forced to fly with them often due being destinations others don't serve.

### "serious customer service issues"
Aeroméxico is an airline that appears to be having serious customer service issues. Aeroméxico has made so many of its' clients "special" Platinum/SkyPriority clients that essentially nobody is anymore. The Platinum line when checking in is often just as long if not longer than the line for non-privileged passengers. They need to control who gets to go into the SkyPriority/Platinum line with a little more discretion since little incentive exists to spend your travel budget on the same airline. This flight had no personal entertainment systems although my flight from Mexico City to San Francisco did have a personal entertainment system in the coach cabin. This plane was a much older aircraft in everything including seat comfort and ergonomics. Food has gotten progressively worse even in the first-class cabin over the last couple of years. They used to be a little more creative in first-class and serve decent wine. The food on my last six flights of which five have been in the first-class cabin has been mediocre at best. My real problem with Aeroméxico and the reason I am giving them a rating of 1 out of 10 is that on two of my last three trips they have lost my luggage. Both times I was flying in the first-class cabin and had those "priority luggage" tags affixed to each suitcase. I have never once seen "priority luggage" come out first either when I land in the USA or in Mexico. I think Aeroméxico should just do away with them because they have absolutely zero utility. Aeroméxico has the worst system for handling lost luggage. They just lie to you and don't answer either phone calls or emails even though the little paper they give you promises that they will respond in three hours to email. The lost luggage group never picks up the phone and when you are by some miracle somehow able to get a hold of someone the only thing they are capable of doing is giving you some kind of false apology. Part of the problem is that Aeroméxico is not penalized in any way for not delivering lost luggage in a timely manner. They don't compensate passengers even if that passenger doesn't get their luggage in three or four days. They could care less about what you have trapped in the lost luggage and are unable to give you an estimated date or time when you will actually have your luggage. They are even incapable of simply saying if your luggage was found at the airport of origin. The worst part is that they don't care. This has happened to me twice in my last three trips flying first-class! Save your money and fly one of the new budget airlines.

### "seats  extremely uncomfortable "
London Heathrow to Mexico City with Aeromexico. The cabin crew were attentive, smiley and helpful. However, the seats are extremely uncomfortable (worse each time I fly). This time they scarcely reclined at all. The food was awful, and the drinks badly presented. No more little miniatures (cost cutting), no whiskey at all, wine slopped into one's plastic glass. The choice of films was very limited and the sound was bad.

### "disappointed in Aeromexico"
Mexico city to Ciudad Juarez, and I'm so disappointed in Aeromexico. First they delayed my flight for 2 hours then after a while they cancelled the flight and they didn't give the reason why. They didn't provide voucher for food or stay and didn't even instruct us as to what to do and when a new flight was going to take us to our destination. When I called the call center they didn't provide good options to reschedule my flight, at the end they put me on a new flight the next day and was also delayed at origin and at connection. Horrible experience and bad service.

### "bad first class meal"
Orlando to Mexico City, and very bad first class meal service, schedule means hot meal, not a cold croissant, red wine like vinegar, fake champagne. Seats felt very close, leather seats dirty, restrooms not clean, My luggage was damaged, priority handling took more than 20 minutes. At Mexico City Airport a long line for claim damage and the answer: write an email, keep your tags and send photos.

### "need to improve customer service"
Aeromexico needs to improve customer service in Mexico City airport. There is always a delay on its flights that depart from this city. Also, there is hardly ever a flight status update on the screen so you have to go and ask and find out what's the status of your flight. Also, they should work out transportation from bus to plane. The bus is very compact and very hard to take 1 carry on with you in the bus.

### "retrofitted with new interior"
I still hear a lot complaints about the dreaded Aeromexico ground service in Mexico City, but this time I happened to find some very helpful employees. However, there is still work to do in this area as I saw some passengers being mistreated by Aeromexico staff. The airplane was retrofitted with the new interior and was in perfect condition. Inflight service was nice and efficient. We only received a small snack and beverages, which were enough for this short trip from Mexico City to Cancun. Entertainment was great. I like flying this airline when things go well.

### "counters were all closed"
Aeromexico from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo. The check in process was good and very quick, however they had 3 or 4 counters for passengers traveling with 1 bag only (such as myself) for this to be dropped off. Whilst I think that's a great idea, unfortunately these were all closed. So I had to stand in a very long line to do this for counters for different purposes, other than just drop 1 bag, and there were many people traveling with just one bag. The ground staff was kind as well the cabin staff. Another dislike was the remote terminal, considering there were several empty gates.

### "problem is the service"
Mexico City to Miami on Aeromexico. The new airplanes are good, but the problem is the service. Always the cabin staff takes the luggage compartment from the first rows meant for business class, and the business class passengers need to put their luggage in other places. You need to choice between the pillow or the blanket - come on, this be supposed to be business class. You don't get a printed menu for select the food.

### "my seat was changed"
My first time flying with Aeromexico, from Vancouver to Mexico City. Purchased ticket on their website months before flying. Standard seats confirmed. Try to check in online but was not able to. So I called them. They said I could not check in because I selected an extra charge seat and had to pay more for that seat. But I selected a Standard seat, my seat was changed by the airline. I had no choice but to pay an extra $89.00. Tried to check in online (return trip) no luck. The planes are old but the service was not too bad, but lacks speaking proper English. You get a meal, drinks and alcohol for free. I am on the fence regarding flying with this Airline again.

### "would not fly them again"
This is the second time I flew Aeromexico and would not fly with them again. Tried to check in 24 hours before with booking number that was incorrect. Three hours later, was notified by Aeromexico by e-mail that the check in number was wrong and changed. That cost me a good seat. Connecting flight to Puerto Vallarta was very inconvenient due to gate not posted until less then one hour before (same on first time with ). Hanging in airport waiting for gate was frustrating. Arriving in Mexico City immigration given wrong information out to get a different boarding pass. Flight to Puerto Vallarta at gate 74 - went to gate - had to get bus that drove around the airport twenty minutes before arriving to the plane for flight. Boarding at gate 74 was told to get on six. Six what ? It turned out it was for the bus six to board to fine plane. Followed the crowd to bus six. Mexico City terminal 2 gates and ticket agents on same floor - different for most airports where the ticket agents are on one floor and gates on upper floor. Nothing posted to where the ticket agents are located. No one speaks English - at all!! Asked one agent at Aeromexico ticket desk a question and he was rude and and told me he was tired. All in all it could have been a nightmare except I fly a lot and have experience, but definitely would not fly with them again.

### "lack service orientation"
Even if it's a Boeing 777, it's getting old and on my flight to Sao Paulo I flew Business Class. Business class seats are old, and you can feel the metal under you! Flight attendants are cocky and lack serious service orientation. Flying back to Mexico City on Premium Economy, the limited onboard service. Important to mention that to me, Club Premier is probably the worst frequent flyer program. It lacks of clarity, difficult to know how many miles you need for your next tier, upgrades are a joke, selective and random without clear rules. Instead of making a happy customer, you feel embarrassed for "begging" for upgrades. The mobile APP is worthless. Aeromexico is abusive knowing their dominance in the Mexican market.

### "will recommend to anyone"
London to Guadalajara via Mexico City. I flew Aeromexico for the first time to visit my GF's family in Mexico, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the service was. The journey started at Heathrow Terminal 4 (which is pretty bad) but onboard I was treated to an extent of luxury that some bigger airlines have forgotten. My connection in Mexico City was smooth and well organised with a minimum waiting time for my second flight. A great airline and will recommend to anyone to fly with them.

### "check in was a nightmare"
Flight was fine but check in just before Christmas was a nightmare! Why does it take so much longer to check someone in at Mexico City than anywhere else? Well over an hour waiting in the queue with announcements apparently designed to threaten people in the queue that if they didn't get to the desk in time they wouldn't be allowed to fly. The last minute queue was almost as long as the normal queue. Everyone I saw who was "late" was still allowed to check in so why does Aeromexico feel it necessary to raise stress levels by threatening people with no check in when simply processing people faster would actually be good customer service!

### "never recommend the airline"
I bought a ticket from Mexico to Guatemala and the flight back. When I took the plane to Guatemala on 9th December I brought with me two luggages and nothing happened. When I took the plane to Mexico at 26th December I had to pay 54 USD for the second luggage, they said it was "Periodo de Embargo" from 10.12.2015 to 15.01.2016. It's fine if this is the rule but Aeromexico didn't inform to my anytime, if I would be informed when I took the first flight I would be able to leave one luggage but I couldn't do anything. I had to take my both luggage with me and pay what they asked. Even I didn't receive any information by mail previous to my second flight. I would never recommend the airline.

### "service was good"
Washington to Mexico City, and the flight was fine. I did not expect them to serve a meal and drinks since it was a red-eye flight, but they did. However, I could not sleep well because the screens were always displaying a lot of bright colors. The service was good and flight attendants friendly.

### "no trying to help us"
We had a wonderful Aeromexico flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City en route to San Jose, Costa Rica. The plane had a stop in Mexico City for about 2-3hours and we all had to disembark. We went through Mexican airport immigration and we were given forms to fill out, which we did with no problem. We waited for our next flight to get going, but when I was boarding the flight attendent ask me for the immigration piece of paper that was given back to my husband but not to me. No one said that I needed one also, so we assumed it was a family trip immigration paper. Well, the flight attendant was very rude, could speak hardly any English and just told me I could not leave the country of Mexico without it. She told us to go find someone who could speak English. Well, as you can imagine, everyone else is boarding and we are rushing around trying to find an English speaking person. It was just hell! We finally did find another tourist who had the same problem, he directed us to a very angry man who said we had to fill out another immigration card and give him $20.00 U.S. Before I could leave the country. Well this took about an hour. By this time, our dream first class flight to Costa Rica had gone and so had our money which we had paid for it. We went immediately to Aeromexico customer service desk, hoping we could get on the next available flight - they were able to put us on a flight at 8:30 am the next morning but we were charged $1135.00US for 2 people in economy. We tried to explain the situation and circumstances which happened that were beyond our control. But still, we had to pay the amount or we weren't going. No empathy, no trying to help us at all. It was if you want to go you pay what they say. It was the most terrifying trip, landing there in Mexico and then being told you could not leave because you did not have a piece of paper which I was not given back, just my husband was. So much For Business Class experience which we had saved for a long time for. We were stuck at the airport for 15 hours with not one person asking if they could be of assistance. Terrible experience. Not to mention the cost for us to buy another two tickets.

### "not a comfortable flight"
Flight on January 3rd 2016 from Los Angeles to Guadalajara. Knowing from Aeromexico team in the gate area the captain was not at the departure time. The airplane left LAX 45 mins late, and no explanation from the team at the gate or during the flight. In seats 1 A, B and C were three drunk passengers who continued drinking a lot, disturbing passengers and talking with bad words during all the flight, and they were traveling with kids. I was on row 2. The flight attendant was providing them more wine. She tried to keep them quiet once. They didn't attend her recommendation. Was not a comfortable flight.

### "wouldn't recommend them"
Morelia to San Francisco via Mexico City on Aeromexico and horrible service. The flight kept getting delayed and no one would answer my questions. Rude and lazy employees. My 6 hour flight turned into a 25 hour flight. Everyone who I met on the same flight was as upset as I was. Never flying with Aeromexico again. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.

### "most inefficient and unorganized"
Flying with Aeromexcio was the worst flight experience of my life. On my way from Toronto to Mexico my flight was delayed 4 hours and was told that I would not be able to catch my next flight so I was going to stay in a hotel in Mexico overnight. I contacted my family in Colombia to let them know that I would not be arriving that day. Once I got to Mexico they rushed me to catch the next flight instead of staying overnight. I had no way to contact my family in Colombia because they had no internet access and when I told them this they said, "it was not Aeromexico's problem". The lack of concern was appalling and the fact that they changed my plans without notice was extremely inconvenient. On the way back home after my trip I had to unfortunately travel with Aeromexcio again and they left everyone's baggage back at the airport. It's been two days and I still have not received my baggage. If I could I would give this airline negative stars. They are the most inefficient and unorganized airline.

### "not justify higher prices"
Tijuana to Mexico City. The Aeromexico boarding process is very inefficient by the desk staff as well as by cabin crew. Flight attendants are not interested in helping passengers to accommodate the luggage. The groups for boarding make no sense and make the process inefficient. There are aspects of the onboard experience that are no better in Aeromexico when compared to a low-cost carrier and it does not justify paying higher prices - for example, the service and attitude of crew, space between airplane seats, no food onboard (at least Volaris sell this), poor baggage allowance (Interjet allow 2 pieces of 25 kg, and Aeromexico 1). The only advantages perceived were quicker check in counter and the ability to take a "carry-on" on the plane, which in the end was no advantage, because these had to go down to the aircraft hold for lack of space. In short, the service in Aeromexico is not much better than a low-cost airline.

### "boarding was confusing"
Monterrey to Mexico City, and getting my boarding pass was an awful experience, even that I was entitled to go to a short line because of the short time to my flight. The guy in the counter doesn't seem to be happy to be there, he was not gentle. About the boarding process, it was confusing because I was redirected to a common gate for like 5 other flights, so there were not directions of who was going to board the plane unless you ask the guys in the gate. Aircraft was comfortable but old, and missing entertainment for my child.

### "check in line was really long"
Aircraft on Montreal to Mexico City was new, very confortable and great individual entertainment unit. The return aircraft from Mexico to Montreal was very, very old , uncomfortable, noisy, etc. I could not sleep a minute and still got pain in my back several days later. I wouldn't expect Aeromexico to assign such an old aircraft to an overnight international flight. At Mexico City airport the check in line was really long, and there were only 3 counters working for checking in 2 flights - one to Montreal, one to Toronto. Almost 50 minutes waiting for check in.

### "boarding zone problems"
Chicago to Mexico City flight was pretty bad. They postponed several times and left late. When we tried to check flight information daily through my phone (like flight-tracker etc. ) nothing was correct. Aeromexico should keep that information up to date and not lie to people. There were many problems, because although there are rows for each boarding area, the staff in charge were not organized nor respected the order of approach. For example they called Zone 2 and 3 at the same time, the staff of the area 2 is not organized and that led to zones 3 and 4 entering the plane before zone 2. What purpose do boarding zones have with Aeromexico?

### "should give us sandwich"
Los Cabos to Mexico City with Aeromexico. We left very late, they moved the flight time from 2pm to 5pm, and we ended up leaving at 5:30 pm. Onboard they only provide a mini-bag of peanuts and drinks, I feel that's bad, it is not a low-cost airline and they should give us some sandwich or fruit. There is no inflight entertainment and they do not provide headphones.

### "aircraft was old"
Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro via Sao Paulo with Aeromexico. The aircraft was old and seats were ruined. The cabin crew was in an inexplicable hurry to attend the passsengers during meals service. The meals could be rated as regular to bad. The temperature of air conditioning in the cabin during the flight was extremly cold.

### "unfriendly customer service"
San Francisco to São Paulo via Mexico City with Aeromexico. At the last minute we were told that we couldn't take our 2nd luggage - last minute after all were done. Manager on duty was rude and careless. I will ever again fly this airline. Unfriendly customer service. I'm writing this review even before we fly out of San Francisco.

### "flight attendants were satisfactory"
Late departures all around (JFK-MEX-AGU-MEX-JFK). Aeromexico check-in agents appeared eager to find incremental fees to collect which is a real turn-off in service. Flight attendants were satisfactory and catering was acceptable. Aircrafts were modern, and IFE selection slightly below average. Last leg, MEX-JFK late departure delayed by 2 hours, and when we reached JFK, plane diverted to BOS. Captain statements that JFK was closed were not true, and an airport official noted that given heavy fog that morning, flights were diverted if they lost their place in the landing queue, which means AM was not truthful about the basis for diversion. When we did land (+5hrs late), airport seemed fully operational.

### "little space in the seats"
Mexico City to Lima on Aeromexico. We only got one meal, not even an aditional beverage service before the meal. In previous flights, we used to get a beverage service before the meal and one with the meal, and a second meal. In this case, we should have gotten dinner and breakfast. The food was bad, insipid and overcooked (I got the chicken dinner). There was very little space in the seats and only one pillow for every three seats. However, the wheelchair service in the Lima's airport was very good.

### "friendly and helpful"
Ground staff in Cancun were friendly and helpful. The Premier Lounge in CUN, which is shared by Air France and Delta, is not very new and tends to look a bit gloomy. The flight was slightly delayed, but we made up time in the air. The aircraft was in very bad condition but clean. Seats were worn out and did not recline. Aeromexico is one of those airlines where you can get both senior crew members, as well as very young employees. The purser on board this flight was senior, experienced and attentive, her announcements were clear in both English and Spanish, and was nice to everyone.

### "keeps surprising me"
I thought I had seen everything in Aeromexico, but this airline keeps surprising me. This time we boarded 30 minutes late, they had us 2 hours on the plane without actual notice from the staff that was what happened, while maintenance personnel entered and left the plane several times. And lie after lie from the staff which gave reason for the passengers who wanted to get off the plane, and the staff did not let him down. Finally, after more than 2 hours, the Aeromexico plane took off and we don't know if the plane was broken. Casually Aeromexico has not commanded a satisfaction survey from that flight.

### "not an enjoyable experience"
Sao Paulo to México with Aeromexico and service was good. I did not try the food. The seats are uncomfortable, the aircraft was old and has dirt everywhere, several things don't work and you feel you will get stains in your clothes just by sitting in those seats. All in all, not an enjoyable experience.

### "treat us like it was free"
Flight was good, however, clerk was rude and treating me as a delinquent. I tried to get my ticket one hour before flight at the atm, tried to change seats, it gave an error and request to ask for assistance, I had to stand over 20 minutes on line in order to be attended. The clerk said the flight was closed and that I could not issue my ticket and that I had to check if there was another flight available at another counter, but all flights available were next day. It was 9:20 p.m. and flight departure was 10:10 p.m. (around 50 minute window). He refused to issue the ticket and treat me like if I was a homeless begging. I contacted the supervisor, he realized the timeframe and requested the boarding pass to be printed. I make it to the flight without rush and furthermore, I was able to get in front of the gate before they started the boarding procedure. Too bad that we have to pay for a service and this people treat us like it was free and that was a privilege to travel with them.

### "seats not so comfortable"
A few things that I did not like, such as the 1.5 hrs. stop in Monterrey where we were not able to go out of the aircraft. The business class seats are not so comfortable, other airlines have private accommodations in Business class that are more comfortable. There is no cabin wifi connectivity and Inflight entertainment is limited. They have good service on the ground and inflight, luggage is well cared, schedules are respected.

### "the worst catering"
Nice airplane with the worst catering you can get with a US $3,400 ticket plane, among two type of average wines without any chance to finish your meal with a nice Gin Tonic or good blend whiskey or a nice old age cognac which is standard in many other airlines. Plus, the entertainment offer is outdated, they don't rotate the movies as often as should be. You can find the same films offered in the same route from one year ago! Among a suspicious tendency for silly comedies with bad taste and low quality. When you finally arrive, the crew opens all the acces of the aircraft to exit the plane without giving to the upper paying class tickets passengers the privilege to get out in the first place, policy that makes the exit from every plane from these Aeomexico airplanes, a nightmare. The Aeromexico system at the check in (there are just two guys attending the suitcases) counters are very inefficient in contrast with the air crews that always are prone to help you an any way they can. Plain and simple: terrible Business class experience.

### "cabin crew pleasant"
Check in at Lima was slow and the counter didn't open until 2.5 hours before the flight even though Aeromexico instructed passengers to check in 3 hours before the flight. So, many people were waiting when the counter opened. The flight was fine, cabin crew pleasant and food OK. I had an empty seat next to me and was comfortable. The seatback entertainment system was very good. A downside to Aeromexico is that when you change planes in Mexico City, you have to collect your luggage, go through Mexico immigration and customs, recheck your luggage and go through security again before you can go to the departure gate for your connecting flight. This is time consuming and somewhat inconvenient. The flight MEX to LAX on a Boeing 787 was very pleasant and on-time. Luggage arrived on the carousel at LAX promptly.

### "bad service and costly tickets"
Tickets were oversold in the flight. I tried to check in with plenty of time before departure, but the flight was closed. No Information office where I could ask for advice, employees unpleasent and unfriendly. I had to change the ticket to Monterrey City (the nearest airport from Saltllo) at a cheaper price, but no refund. On top of that I had to pay a taxi from Monterrey to Saltillo at USD 100. I try to avoid using Aeromexico as much as I can due to its bad service and costly tickets.

### "longest waiting time"
Las Vegas to Mexico City with Aeromexico. It was the longest waiting time for me ever - we experienced 6-hour delay and it was the worst communication process from airline to customers in order to inform what was happening and the real delay time. I just receive a message from the airline when we arrived to the airport 2 hours before departing time. We had to go back to the city after checking in and we had no hotel obviously but the airline did not offer anything in compensation for this delay (lunch would be nice at least) and was not clear about the real waiting time.

### "seat was very good"
My first flight with Aeromexico on the Boeing 787. Online check in quick and easy. Seat was very good with ample legroom and comfort. Food was excellent. Staff were very courteous, attentive rand well mannered. This trip was equal to any BA flight I've been on. A couple of minus points. Our seating area had not been cleaned very well and the earphones were broken but the latter problem was resolved very quickly. I will certainly use Aeromexico again.

### "smarten up service onboard"
Mexico City to Buenos Aires with Aeromexico. The Boeing 787 is very comfortable with a business class flat bed seat. Instead of the usual shutter, the windows have a dimming control. Considering this flight actually took off around 10.55 in the morning which is 13.55 in Argentina, they served breakfast about 30 mins later and then, about 4 hours later, lunch. Although the breakfast was quite nice, there was no need for it at that late hour and a good lunch would have been more appropriate. Also, by the time they got to my seat, which was one on the furthest back in Club Premier Section (6C) they run out of my preferred dish and I had to settle for pasta. Worse still was the fact that the steward made some excuse for not serving a pre-take off glass of champagne and a full 5 hours passed by before I was even offered a drink - which was when lunch was served. Surely it is never too early to serve champagne as is customary in Business or First Class? The cabin crew did not seem to come around very often to see if anybody needed anything. The flight was good because the timetable was convenient and plane comfortable, but Aeromexico needs to smarten up the service onboard. Inflight entertainment had good selection of material but it was confusing to use.

### "small space between seats"
Mexico City to Hermosillo with Aeromexico. Really small space between seats. Lack of maintenance inside the aircraft, it looks old! The service onboard was good, flight attendants were nice. Not my first time flying with Aeromexico, but even when sometimes service is ok, my experience with the airline is not great.

### "no sense of client service"
I had very bad experience with no good attention from Aeromexico's side. My flight had a stopover in JFK (originally I booked a later flight but was cancelled and Aeromexico give me the only option to flying earlier that same day). I did the check in PHL and, instead of sending my luggage directly to my final destination, I had to pick that up, carry it to another terminal and try to put it into my next flight. But Aeromexico staff in JFK counter told me that they could not help me because they only receive luggage 3 hours previous to departure of a flight, and due to my earlier flight I arrive much earlier. The personnel was rude and told me that didn´t matter to them if I complain with the supervisor and that they did not care about it. They didn´t give any solution and they only send me to the luggage store office where I had to pay 322USD to avoid carrying my luggage or be sitting in the same spot for hours. In addition my midnight flight was delayed. I used to flight with Aeroméxico in the past but due to some problems with the airline I stop using it, and I decided to start fying again with them as Mexicana is no longer in business. But I really regret doing so. The service during the situation of my luggage was really rough, and I realize the staff from Aeromexico has no sense of client service at all.

### "very bad experience"
Miami to Mexico City was a very bad experience. A 3 hr flight became a 9 hr flight because they make us stop in another airport - for almost 4 hours. There we sat inside the plane, they didn't let us get down for a meal, drink etc. arguing it was an international flight. A bad, very bad experience.

### "seats really uncomfortable "
It was not a good attention from Aeromexico's side, the flight had a delay for more that 12 hours and they justify that they won't pay anything because finally they took me to my final destination (on time or not). I nearly always fly with Aeromexico but from some months ago the service is not as good as it was before. In early 2016 I´m flying to Europe and my last option o choice is Aeromexico. The Boeing 777 I flew to Shanghai was really old, the seats were really uncomfortable and a little bit dirty. The service during the situation the delay in the flight was really rough, and the people from Aeromexico including managers were bad. They didn´t give any solution and they excused themselves due to the failure with the airplane.

### "will avoid flying Aeromexico"
As always Aeromexico flight departed late, supposed to depart at 8:00 pm, at that time the Pilots and the stewards were with everybody waiting to the plane to get to the gate; boarding finished at 8:25 p.m. and arrived to MTY at 9:55 pm. Aeromexico has many flights from MEX to MTY every day, and it was customary that if you get early to the airport and there were seats available in earlier flights. You can sign in on a waiting list and if lucky, to arrive earlier to your destination. This option is no longer available and yesterday had to spare 6 hours in MEX; they did offer me to sell a new ticket for $4400.00 (aprox $260.00 USD) if I really needed to arrive earlier. I watched 4 flights depart with seats available but without paying the Premium (buying a new ticket), I was not able to board. When possible I will avoid flying Aeromexico, this politics is what is helping other airlines, like Interjet and Volaris to grow so fast.

### "delays after delays"
Flying to Mexico City is a mess, not an issue of the airline, but an issue of a crowded airport from quite a crowded city. Attempts to divert traffic from Mexico City airport have been mild and without effect. So delays after delays are always a trouble. If you fly to Mexico City for a meeting, please make it considering that sometimes your Aeromexico flight can be delayed for 2.5 hours. Also do consider this in case of Aeromexico connecting flights. A new airport is under construction, but it will not be finished until 2020.

### "movies you could watch on flights "
Chicago to Huatulco via Mexico City. This was the first time I flew Aeromexico. We had a bad problem in Mexico City with our luggage. Being in Mexico City, not a lot of employees speak English and we don't speak Spanish. We went thru customs and was told by an Aeromexico employee to put all of our luggage on the conveyor, even from what we understood our carry ons. Two of our carry on had name tags an Aeromexico tag and one had no identification on it whatsoever. After about 10 minutes we realized that we shouldn't have done that at least with the luggage that had no identification. After speaking to 5 or 6 people we explained to some one who understood what happened. They took us to lost luggage department and found our backpack that had no tags (about $3000 worth of items in luggage). We figured the other two items would make it to Huatulco. They did not. We did receive our other 2 items within 24 hours. The flights were on time going down but late leaving coming home, but on time arrival. They had movies you could watch on the flights and we had a meal (sandwich and snacks) and they served alcohol at no Charge.

### "don't care if passengers are happy"
Puerto Vallarta to Costa Rica via Mexico City. I am not sure if it truly worth to write this Aeromexico review keeping in mind that the average rating is already at 2 stars and Management apparently don't care if passengers are happy for as long as Bonus Payments are great! I truly hope that the shape of the inside of the cabin is no indication of aircraft maintenance, because inside was horrible! Broken and dirty seats and WC, the service provided was anything but great, one could say that the crew did not like to take early flights. The food was of the lowest possible quality standard. I wish  there would be more competition out there.

### "used to be a great airline"
Aeromexico used to be a great airline, lately though their focus change to make money any way and forget about what the customers look for or need. They are very expensive, restrictive, extremely focus in pushing advertising (even some of the planes look like billboards, inside and out), yet the cabins look and feel old and outdated. Flight crews, still attentive and courteous, not so for the ground staff. I personally will avoid Aeromexico as much as I possible can.

### "food below expectations"
In my business class flights, FAs were attentive and friendly, but they follow Aeromexico procedures and it’s limitations. The equipment was confortable and IFE offered a reasonable number of options. For my perception of food quality, quantity, presentation and timing, Aeromexico was below expectations compared with other airlines. Even in this long flight of more than 10 hrs they rushed the food service. Aperitif (you must ask for your favorite drink) was limited to cold nuts, dry cheese, champagne, red and white wine. A few minutes later, FAs came with my tray : salad, appetizer, entrée and bread. The choice of entrées was limited and there are possibilities of not having your favorite choice since the availability is limited to the exact number of passengers. Wine refill didn’t occur spontaneouslly. For mid-flight snack, the options was limited to raw vegetables and water. The light dinner before landing was enough.

### "ground service is normally deficient"
Overall service is fair/good. The airline is pretty consistent with offerings on board, staff, pricing, etc. Onboard entertainment depends on the aircraft. For short flights there are limited services, which is ok. On the ground the service is normally deficient, especially people in supervising roles, so help is very unlikely and customers will be bounced back and forth if a difficult situation arises. Delays can happen more frequently than normal, and they will not compensate in any way. If they oversell a flight and a customer arrives within a tight time frame, they will just cut you out and nothing can be done (although infrequent, it can happen, so as long as there are no issues, the airline is reliable, but if any problem comes up they're absolutely inoperative). Aircraft in most flights look clean and modern. Staff on board is normally friendly.

### "5 hrs delay poorly managed"
Flight 472 November 19th, Mexico City to Houston. A 5 hrs delay because of fog and poorly managed. No organised procedure for passengers, no water, no terminal, no attention, no information. And the worst, the ground staff were very rude. We feel treated like cattle. Finally they took us into a bus to reach the plane and the crew had to be replaced. So they took us back to the waiting room. Again they took us to the plane by a bus and after 5 hours delay, we were able to fly.

### "Aeromexico used to be better"
New York to Mexico with Aeromexico. The plane was late, no information, terrible service before boarding. We left 3 hours late on the way back. On the way to NY we were 1 hour late. My complaint is about the bad information at JFK and also on arrival to Mexico City where they kept us more than 45 mins inside the plane. No information again. Very sad. Aeromexico used to be better.

### "is a mediocre airline"
I think Aeromexico is a mediocre airline - they comply with the basics but they don't make any effort to give an extra to the customer experience. The space between seats is small, the entertainment system is basic, the food is medium quality etc. Usually the flight attendants are not friendly, I have the impression that they are not committed to their work and are not happy working there. I fly Aeromexico because of the reward program, but honestly each time it gets harder and harder to be able to exchange miles per flights.

### "good service from staff"
Los Mochis to Cancun via MEX. Good service from the staff on the plane but at the airport of Los Mochis they don't seem well trained and are not polite. In MEX, they helped us for the connection, and a great experience. The food inside the plane is only peanuts - its cheap and look like a low cost company. I recomend to improve the food. Good enterntainment inside the plane, large choice of movies.

### "no picture or TV series to watch"
Incredible that in an Aeromexico flight from Mexico to Orlando of close to 3 hours there was no picture nor TV series to watch, in fact the little screens that are displayed from the overhead compartment never went down. Not sure if those were broken or what, but based on the cost of the ticket and the length of the flight this is something the airline should ensure to have working

### "kept information flowing"
Aside from the fact that we had a 4 hour delay in our departure from Boston the service and information from the Aeromexico staff was good, and they did not keep us on the plane for an excessive period of time and they kept information flowing. The return flight was uneventful and early arriving in Boston. The aircraft seats in economy comfort were not very well padded as this appeared to be an older non refurbished aircraft so therefore sitting in the same seat for 4.5 hours was a bit uncomfortable.

### "experience has not been good"
Buenos Aires to Paris via Mexico. My travel experience with Aeromexico has not been good. The only good thing has been the price of the ticket I got from Buenos Aires to Paris (via Mexico), and back. November 6, return November 21. Service is not good, both drinks, timing, food, and some of the staff members are pretty rude, or ignore the questions. Most of them seem not to like their jobs, and hate it when you ask them for something.

### "no wine available in economy"
The flight was punctual, and the equipment in good order. One of the flight attendants seemed to be having a bad day. When clearing trays, he dropped two dirty utensils, one hit my leg, and never said a word. He then proceeded to kick the two dirty forks under someone's seat! At the conclusion of the flight, there was no effort to clean up. I'm used to flight attendants coming through collecting newspapers, stray cups etc. this was a sold out flight, five hours in duration, so you'd expect some effort to keep the cabin clean for customers. Despite the marketing material claims, on this international flight no wine was available in economy. Not sure if I would fly Aeromexico again. One leg of the flight was ok, the other was not.

### "not enough staff at check in"
Mexico City to Las Vegas. Aeromexico does not have a good sytem to obtain your boarding pass online, so I had to spend more than 20 minutes to obtain it at the airport. Besides, the lines to register the baggage were huge, because they did not have enough staff at the check in counters. It took me almost 2 hours to be ready to go to the security filters.

### "label it as mid-range"
Aeromexico flight was okay but I would recommend this airline for short flights only. Their seats are not very comfortable and flights are a bit pricey. This particular trip was on time both way, which is appreciated. Aeromexico is definately not my favorite airline, and I would label it as mid-range.

### "flight is very expensive"
Decent flight but cost of the flight is very expensive compared to Viva Aireobus. Aeromexico has become a very expensive airline for domestic flights in Mexico, specially to Guadalajara and Monterrey. Also when I tried to use my miles in these flights, they cannot be used most of the time. At the end I buy the ticket and during the flight I find out that the plane is at 30% capacity.

### "nice flight in general"
I had a nice flight in general. Some bad points to report however - I flew business class and when I wanted to go to the lounge, it was closed. The Skyteam lounge only opens at 10.00am when the Aeromexico flight was at 09.00. The plane was a very old Boeing 737 with old seats and no entertainment, and they need to refurbish the cabin asap. Because the amount we paid to fly business was a lot compared what we received. Ground staff and cabin crew were nice and professional.

### "complaint about hand luggage"
Mexico City to Shanghai via Tijuana, and the flight experience was pleasant. The complaint I have is about the hand luggage that a lot of people bring o board is far beyond the allowed one. Also the flight crew take up the storage space in the business class so I had to place my hand luggage (which was according to regulations) in a place far away from my seat. Also, the passengers from economy class are always disturbing in the business class cabin by walking up and down - and nothing is done about this.

### "service was excellent"
Flew on a standby airline Staff Ticket. Service was excellent and friendly. On this 2h 40 min there was inflight entertainment with PTV on all seats which was a pleasant surprise. Only improvement could be that on a flight exceeding 120/150 mins the airline could provide a small snack, like a small sandwich. Just a small bag of nuts with the drinks would disappoint me. A week earlier I flew the route MEX-MTY also on a standby airline Staff Ticket and service also excellent. I found it great that Aeromexico had an individual counter to check in passengers with standby or waitlist tickets at MEX, which made check in faster for myself. I was immensly satisfied with Aeromexico and will fly with them again on my next trips in Mexico next year.

### "connecting flight 2 hours late"
Our trip from Montreal to Mexico City was pleasant and uneventful. Passing through customs and immigration was no problem and we re-checked our luggage. The chaos at gate "75" was most disturbing and frustrating, as there was no notice that our connecting flight was 2 hours late, and there is no seating in this very congested area. The short flight to Manzanillo was pleasant. Overall Aeromexico gave good service, but this is the second time we have been dismayed at the lack of information in ZLO.

### "has differentiated services"
Terrible Aeromexico service on the ground in both airports : delays, wrong communications, awful customer service, rude attitude, lack of personnel, facilities and equipment. Inflight services are competitive, but Aeromexico has differentiated services. As a quasi-monopoly for local flights it comfortably extends its abuses over customer without any consequence either regulatory or from consumers. For international services it provides a competitive service.

### "Premier Class may be cheaper"
Washington DC to Guatemala via Mexico. Disappointing menu as usual on all legs, and two delayed flights due to the use of remote gates in MEX Airport. The Boeing 737-700 aircraft on Washington to Mexico is usually dirty and old, except for Boeing 737-800 aircrafts - E90 aircrafts on GUA-MEX-GUA are more modern. The night/midnight flight to/from Washington is quite convenient as it will save you time to clear immigration and retrieve your luggage in 30 minutes in total, and check-in at IAD counter (outbound) in less than 10 minutes. Price in Economy Class may be the same when flying US carriers, but Premier Class may be cheaper.

### "they had closed the flight"
Very bad service. When I arrived to the airport, there was a line of more than 50 persons to check the luggage. After 40 minutes in the line a person told us that the passengers for flights leaving at 10:30 and 10:45 will have to pass to another room and gate. I then have to wait for 25 minutes to check my luggage and went directly to the assigned gate. That by the way was the last one. When I arrive, the Aeromexico staff told me that they had closed the flight, it was 10:12, 18 minutes before the scheduled time. I eventually left at 1:30pm and had to change my plans in Cancun.

### "would never again use"
Chicago to México city with Aeromexico was the worst experience in my life. Don't know where to start. The staff at check point, including managers or the people at customer service from the phone. Nobody knows how to help you or solve a problem from their system to start off. They only want you to pay outrageous fees for no reason, and they just keep pointing fingers at other people. I personally, would never again use this airline, nor recommend it.

### "is the impunctuality"
The Aeromexico small planes (100 passengers) are okay, more confortable than the smaller (50 passengers). The flight nand the crew ng was okay. The thing that Aeromexico has, is the impunctuality. They don't care about the time of the customer and always are excuses of what is happening with their planes. The price in this small planes is always expensive $500USD for a 2 hour plane? I use it because its a business purpose trip if not, I will take an international flight instead.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Monterrey to Las Vegas via Mexico City. Very pleasant flight,  good refreshment and sandwich was okay. Due to weather conditions in Mexico City the flight departed with an hours delay. Coming back from Las Vegas was smooth. I had a chance to read and watch a movie. I enjoy the music available and there were some good movies.

### "not been a single punctual flight "
The ticket purchase experience was okay, the website is friendly and easy to use. Documenting my bag was fast and the service on the counter was good. I was explained the gate had not yet been assigned and it would be announced an hour before the flight. I headed to their lounge and it was ok - drinks including water and alcohol, but I noticed there were not many options on snacks. An hour before the flight the gate was announced, but passengers were never informed that the flight, instead of departing at 21:20 would be 1 hour later. This is very annoying, Aeromexico did not have any consideration in announcing this delay. This is something that happens with every single flight I take with Aeromexico. The boarding time is always the time we are supposed to be taking off. During 2015, there has not been a single flight in which we take off punctually. In flight service was average, their stewards are not nice.

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico to Cancun. Great service and comfortable Boeing 737-800 aircraft with inflight entertainment system. The crew provided impecable service. We had to deplane before departure due to heavy fog on the runway, but received updates on the situation.

### "would not let us board"
Acapulco to Hermosillo via Mexico City. Terrible experience, the flight is delayed one hour from Acapulco to Mexico, and arrived 20 minutes before the flight, from Acapulco 7 people were wondering if we were going to achieve connection and everyone said yes. We then went running through the entire airport, entrance doors, did everything hastily, because in theory we were expecting to catch the flight. The aircraft not yet closed its doors, but they would not let us board. The next flight was at almost 10 pm, so get home at 3.30 am to get up at 6am to go to work. I find it irresponsible and inconsiderate by the Aeromexico, and although I speak to 6 representatives, none of then did anything.

### "change departure times"
Aeromexico has high fares compared to the average of other airlines that offer similar. Aeromexico constantly change the flight departure times. The snacks served onboard are very poor quantities. Incompatible schedules and in accordance with the original reservation from 9:00 to 17:50 hrs before. Aeromexico leaves much to be desired.

### "comfortable Boeing 787 seats"
Aeromexico from Mexico City to Los Angeles in Business class. Excellent service and comfortable Boeing 787 seats and the food was delicious. I've flying regularly with Aeromexico for the last ten years and not had a bad experience.

### "schedules are not respected"
Guadalajara to Mexico City return with Aeromexico on 5th/6th November 2015, and very bad. It was a Friday, and we have to wait 3 hours because no clear reason. Aeroméxico do this very frequently. It is a shame that this happened. The aircraft are okay but the schedules are not respected. It is more serious when we are flying overseas.

### "food as usual was terrible"
New York JFK to Mexico City on Aeromexico Boeing 737. While the plane was relatively new, the footrests did not work. The food, as usual was terrible - it was tasteless and not hot. Although the baggage was marked priority, our luggage was the last to arrive after almost 45 minutes waiting.

### "stressful to fly with them"
The main issue with Aeroméxico is that the common practice of overselling the flight is more than common, is a routine especially in flight inside Mexico, so you can't take for granted anything even if you check in before. But the last flight was just unbelievable. I made my reservation for my wife (pregnant), my little girl and myself, when we arrived to the airport they intend to give boarding passes only for my wife and kid and not me - splitting my family even though we were in the same reservation. No way I will take the risk of not flying with my family just because Aeroméxico have sell more tickets than seats. At the end I had an awful time dealing with a guy without criteria, they only say it is a common practice. When you take these other factors in consideration : the MX City airport is over capacity, the delay of flights now is a guarantee, they oversell the flights and they are selling more flights so the situation is a mess and the least importance is the passenger. It is a business made in expenses of thousands of passengers waiting forever in the airports without guarantees of a ticket they already bought. It is just stressful to fly with them.

### "convenient and comfortable"
Paris CDG to Mexico City on Aeromexico Boeing 787. Aircraft was convenient and comfortable. Flat bed seat, excellent entertainment system, business class food was served properly and beverage service as you will expect in business class. The cabin crew were friendly and were attentive to the needs of the passenger.

### "very bad experience"
Guadalajara to Santiago de Chile via Mexico City. Very bad experience, the Aeromexico flight was delayed for 6 hours in Mexico City, they didn't say the reason of the delay, so we left Mexico City at 5:30 am and landed in Santiago in the afternoon. I lost a very important meeting that day in Santiago. On my way back from Santiago to Guadalajara with a stop in chaotic Mexico City airport, the connection process to Guadalajara was very bad. My electronic boarding pass was not accepted by the airport authorities and they asked me to go to Aeromexico to obtain a printed boarding pass, there was a huge line in Aeromexico to get printed boarding pass. When I arrived finally in Guadalajara my luggage didn't arrive. Leason learned, I will never fly again to South America with Aeromexico.

### "can be always late"
Its grotesque and bad taste from Aeromexico that for the flights between Monterrey and Mexico City, Aeromexico has now added from 30 to 45 minutes to the itinerary. This is so they can be always late and yet say they are satisfing the customers, when they get "on time". Please somebody tell them that they are not on time and they are liars.

### "worst trip ever"
Cancun to New York with Aeromexico was the worst trip ever. The main concern was the cabin crew - totally unfriendly and rude, and nobody wanted to help passengers. And the main concern also was that they could not speak English, I barely can understand them when  speaking face to face! Pretty sure that for future I am definitely gonna avoid this company. I prefer to pay more for my tickets and use other airline.

### "miss our connections"
Before landing in Mexico, we were advised that we have to make an unscheduled stopover in Guadalajara due to climate condition. We stayed in the plane for several hours, first the conditions at Mexico didn't improve, then the crew decided to refuel and lastly they claim that they need to do a paperwork - why they didn't decide to refuel sooner and start the paperwork sooner. We arrive to Mexico late and miss our connections, they booked us to El Salvador to take another flight. The screens didn't post the gate, the Aeromexico personnel weren't friendly, after several inquires they informed us that the gate was in opposite side of the terminal and they were about to board. We ran to the gate to find out that we have to be standing in line for an hour or so, the plane arrived late flew to El Salvador to find out that we miss another connection.

### "not worth that loyalty"
We were scheduled to fly with Aeromexico from Bogotá to Guadalajara via Mexico City shortly after midnight. The plane was ready, but it did not proceed to take off. After half an hour it became apparent that one of the business class passengers, who was already on board, and obviously had a boarding pass, was being told that he could not fly because his credit card had not been charged. He produced evidence of the charge to his credit card in his smartphone, he had his e ticket and his boarding pass and still they would not allow the aircraft to take off. We lost over an hour in these arguments and I found AM´s arguments pathetic. I have had the same thing happening to me twice in the last two months. I am a very frequent traveller and I have to admit that AM has become extremely inflexible, stingy with all its passengers, but specially with its Platinum and Titanium most valued customers, and more concerned with charging penalties than with actually solving problems and adjusting to their customers needs. We did take off, but only after several of us in Business Class had an argument with the Captain, who was arrogant. He cowered by us and he simply shut himself in the cabin. Aeromexico is having severe problems with its booking system, but instead of accepting the criticism and taking action, they are putting the blame on their customers. Obviously they do not have a clue about what service to customers means. Aeroméxico is part of SkyTeam. Their motto is "Caring more about you". They only care about themselves and about charging the passengers. Long gone ar the days when a passenger was a person. I have not heard an apology for over a year, but if a human being reads this review I do expect an apology and a change of attitude or I will switch to another airline after 25 years of devoted loyalty to an airline that is not worth that loyalty.

### "business class meal a sandwich"
Mexico to Washington Dulles. An old Boeing 737 aircraft, no personal screen. This was an international flight above 3 hours and the business class meal was a sandwich! Aeromexico please improve meals on both classes. They also need to remove the almost retired flight attendants with new, energetic and more service oriented people.

### "assigning upgrades to friends"
Durango to Monterrey via Mexico City. Nice flight, the only thing that I saw Is when I called to the call center requesting an upgrade 48 hours before the flight (supposedly in a platinum level you can call even 72 hours before the fight in order to request the upgrade) they told me that they had not available spaces for free upgrades. So I could pay for it or I had to wait to be in the flight date at the airline desk in order to ask for it. When I did it, the person at the desk (Durango airport) told me that she had not available seats so anyway I requested her to put me in the waiting list. I was the 3rd passenger that arrived at the airport for that flight (Durango has a small airport and the second passenger is my friend and he didn't requested an upgrade) - she answered yes no problem I will remember you because I will be at the gate collecting the boarding passes. At the boarding time I could see that the lady called anther person that arrived later than me (about three or four persons) and she gave them upgrades - I don't know why she didn't gave it to me even if I arrived before than them. I think you should allow to get an upgrade to any platinum level that calls 72 hours to get an upgrade because we are into the period of time requested by Aeromexico, obviously if there are free seats. Aeromexico should check personnel in land that probably assigning upgrades to friends or people that they know. This is not the first time that it happens to me.

### "inflight entertainment very bad"
Overall the flight from Mexico to Boston was confortable. There are problems in my opinion with this airline. The inflight entertainment system is very bad, and the headphones are very bad in terms of quality. The cabin video system is also outdated. The seats and the space between legs is awful.

### "service was friendly"
In general good service, but we don't have much options for flights in Mexico. Staff service was friendly, entertainment service was fine but we don't have wifi onboard Aeromexico flights. The worst was the food and beverage service.

### "cancelled without justification"
Aeroméxico just cancelled my Veracruz to Mexico City flight without justification. A very important fare was ending that day so at least 100 people got stranded, since they couldn't assure a seat for me on Friday, Saturday nor Sunday - and not offering a hotel stay or even a meal. I had to rent a car and drive back to Mexico City causing me extra costs, and I still dont know if my unused ticket is still valid.

### "flights were delayed"
Minatitlan to Morelia via Mexico City. I've flown with Aeromexico around 10 times for the last 30 days. This airline is usually the most expensive option in Mexico, but this time to my surprise it was the cheapest for most of the routes I travelled. They used to be a most punctual airline (it was even their slogan for years). Well, that's all in the past. 8 out of 10 flights were delayed. The minimum delay was 30 minutes and there I went to almost 5 hours (for one hour flights!). Their apology always came with the same excuse: Mexico City's airport is overcrowded, and its control tower keeps asking us to delay our flights. I would believe this if other airlines had the same problem. They don't. Flights going from the same airports to Mexico City, at the same time but with other airlines, were all on time, which of course was even more frustrating. Their planes are old in many cases, and all you get on board is 100 grams of salted peanuts and a small glass of Coke. If you have the chance to take another airline, take it.

### "very enjoyable flight"
London to La Paz via Mexico City, return. We had a very enjoyable flight, our return was marred by us missing the flight to London (my fault, caused in part by time zone change between La Paz and Mexico City). However the gate staff provided us with two free tickets to the next days flight. Would other airlines offer such service?

### "flight was on time"
Mexico City to Sao Paulo with Aeromexico in Economy class, and the flight was on time. The airplane was quite old, with small screens for entertainment. The breakfast served was poor. The movies offered were new and the seat confortable.

### "recommend this airline"
Boston to Cancun with Aeromexico was my first time flying this airline. Loved the staff and the service was great. They gave us free food included and drink, even a Corona beer and a tequila shot for free. Also had a seatback TV and watched movies. I highly recommend this airline, and I can't wait to visit Mexico again

### "boarding process wasn't in order"
I was upgraded to Aeromexico Premium Economy, however apart from extra legroom space the seats aren't any more comfortable than the economy ones. The boarding process wasn't in order by zones, it was just business and economy boarding calls. Regarding value for money the crew should offer soft drinks twice, they only offered soft drinks once. There should also be inflight entertainment.

### "bad service quality"
México City to San Luis Potosí with Aeromexico. On the night of October 30, 2015 went to counter to make a flight change, since my flight from Houston was delayed . The attention of the staff and the counter was rude and it took about twenty minutes to make the collection and processing of change. The staff supervisor, who was asked for help, was also rude. To document baggage and boarding passes obtained, the time was too (over an hour). Overall, bad service quality.

### "long line with unhappy customers"
Santiago de Chile to San Francisco via Mexico. The flights were comfortable, and price was great, but customer service needs more coordination. My booked flights had a 4.5 hour layover in MEX in each direction. Two days before my return flights, I received an email saying that the leg from MEX to SCL that was going to depart at 11:55pm was delayed until 5:30am the following morning. I called customer service to confirm and to ask what I could do overnight in that airport? First, I was told that my flight was scheduled to leave at the original time, then she checked and said the email was correct. I was informed that the airline had no obligation to do anything. I could pay to stay on a hotel or the lounge. I asked if the lounge would be open extra hours since the website says that it closes from 2am to 4am, and was told it would be open. At check-in time, I couldn't get my boarding passes online because of this delay. At the ticket counter, I could only get the first leg printed, and I should ask again at the gate. At the gate, it was printed. In MEX, I arrived at the security checkpoint and was denied entry at the same time as two passengers traveling from LAX with the same connection. They said that the boss in LA told them that their boarding passes said 5:30am but they were really for 11:55pm. Security got someone from Aeromexico over who told us to go upstairs to L2 to get meal and hotel vouchers. They sent us to L1. We waited in a long line with other unhappy customers for a while. Then they made a new line for us. I got to my hotel at about 9:30pm, ate dinner, and tried to sleep a couple of hours until the 3am shuttle back to the airport. Then I had to wait in line for a boarding pass because the machine was still printing the original time and date. And that's how I spent my first night in Mexico.

### "Aeromexico does not credit miles"
Decent service on the short flight from Mexico City to Saltillo. However, on the flight from Acapulco to Mexico City, Aeromexico delivered a broken suitcase on the conveyor belt. I went with my suitcase to the counter and was told to send pictures and details to their email contact, which I did. Until today I have not received a response. I will have to travel approximately 6 more flights with a broken suitcase until I get back home. Terrible service! Furthermore I always have to claim my miles as Aeromexico misses every third flight, and does not credit the miles.

### "inconsistency of the experience"
Easy check-in, nice lounge, fine service, was out of T2 in Mexico city within 10 minutes of landing which was great! The problem with Aeromexico is the inconsistency of the flying experience. Sometimes staff are friendly and sometimes just plain rude. Some planes have great tv entertainment and others still have overhead cabin screens with vhs video that is terrible. The worse part is the reliability of Aeromexico flights which often arrive late into Mexico city and is always blamed on too much traffic. Then do something about it! I struggle how the airline can call itself a full service airline when it discriminates against vegetarian passengers- you can never place a special meal request when purchasing your ticket but you have to remember to phone and make a special request. With every other global airline, requesting a special meal isnt a problem but with Aeromexico, on shorter flights its even worse. There is a ham and cheese sandwich or nothing! Why can't the airline simply offer a cheese sandwich to all and stop discriminating? Aeromexico is better than its competition; aeromar, interjet and volaris. Its club premier programme keeps me flying with Aeromexico.

### "airplanes weren't the same"
My flight was good, only I suffered delays because of the airport services. The Aeromexico airplanes weren't the same, I mean that one had individual screen but on the other aircraft there was nothing.

### "no room in the seats"
Mexico City to Chicago, and flight was on time and ran smoothly. Usual complaints, bad food and no room in the seats for medium or big people. Aeromexico still don't properly give preference to families with kids at the boarding time, which I think they should do.

### "professional flight crew"
Aeromexico have come a long way since I flew them about 10 years ago. I flew from Cancun to New York JFK. Comfortable seats and legroom, and each seat with TV screen and current movies, headphones, at no charge. A sandwich was served on a tray. Very pleasant and professional flight crew.

### "an excellent experience"
I had an excellent experience with Aeromexico. They took care of my dietary concerns and I was aware of the baggage policy when traveling to and from South America. Agents met me with instructions concerning my bags in both directions.

### "outstanding service"
Excellent Aeromexico flight from Mexico to Buenos Aires, and punctual. Outstanding service onboard, carefully prepared food which is excellent quality and quantity.

### "food portions more generous"
Ground staff in Mexico City could be better trained to handle issues as they are nice when things go okay but become really nasty when things go wrong. This time we got an older plane and was surprised to see that it had been refurbished. Cabin was not as spacious, but was in good condition. Cabin crew excellent, and food portions were a bit more generous than the inbound flight.

### "a good experience"
Given that the airline is inconsistent I was anxious, but this was a very good experience. I like flying Aeromexico when things go well. Cabin crew attentive and nice. The newer Boeing 737s are really spacious and nice inside, and entertainment options are varied and new. Food was free of charge, but portions were small. I understand this is not their flagship route, but it is longer than flights to NY which get better meal options. All in all a good experience.

### "quick service for baggage"
The Aeroméxico staff attending us at the airport and during the fly, was wonderful. The clean plane, and I appreciate the quick service for baggage claim. Just the food is poor. Other thing to be improved, is the communication of the pilots to the passengers, and nobody talked nothing regarding the flight.

### "never use Aeromexico again"
I flew Aeromexico to Guadalajara due to my father sickness, and after a few day there I decided to stay a few extra days so I called Aeromexico to postpone my fly back to the USA. I figured I had to pay a penalty of a $100.00 dollars since I did that with another airline a few weeks before. They told me that the penalty was $240 - I told the person on the other end that that was crazy since my I only paid $178 dollars for the air fare. After we discussed the options, I had I decided to just not show and buy another ticket, however they told me there there will be a $150.00 dollar charge for no show. I had enough of this nonsense. I called another airline to book a fly back home. I'll never use Aeromexico again.

### "the service was great"
Was anxious about what kind of service we were going to receive for our Aeromexico flight from Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta as part of our holiday, having read many poor reviews mainly from American travellers. The service was great, our check in was very straight forward, helpful staff, timely boarding, clean (new) Boeing 737-800 with very comfortable seats good entertainment system and USB charging. Short flight so refreshments service was all that was needed. Baggage was out on the belt in no time at all. Well done Aeromexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
This Aeromexico flight from La Paz to Mexico City was fine. However, the seats are not very comfortable and tiring. The luggage delivery took longer than normal, nearly 30 minutes. There was a delay in the outbound flight from Mexico City to La Paz, Baja California Sur. The onboard cabin service was excellent.

### "train their staff to be friendly"
Mexico City to Dallas-Fort Worth with Aeromexico. Since Mexicana closed, I have flown with Aeromexico and been satisfied with comfortable seats and leg room, food on the flights is good. On the other hand the flight attendants are very rude, especially if you are a woman and appear to be American. I have experienced this on every flight I have taken to or from Mexico City and I travel twice a year back and forth to Texas. On one occasion a flight attendant told me that she couldn't understand when I spoke English so I spoke to her in Spanish instead and being from Texas I have an accent and she continued with "I can't understand what you are trying to say in English or Spanish and just some advice you should fix your accent when speaking Spanish we can't understand you Americans with an accent you should fix it or don't speak at all". So since the last flight that I took, and dealing with rude flight attendants that act like they are better than the people on the plane, I decided to write this review. Maybe the airline should hire or train their staff to be friendly.

### Aeromexico customer review
I fly with Aeromexico several times a year and service is good. Their boarding procedure is unusual and does not function. Their lounge is also not comfortable, very loud and not much food. Lots of drinks if that's what you like. A good airline with friendly staff.

### "good care and treatment "
Very good care and treatment during my journey. The information about the flights was good and timely. I look for punctuality when traveling and Aeromexico were good on this trip.

### "they have no concern or compassion"
We booked our flight for June 2015 from Las Vegas to Cancun. Due to illness, we had to cancel our package vacation deal. We were able to get back all of our hotel money without any problems. However, Aeromexico did the exact opposit. I received an email telling me that I would only get back 50% of our flight cost of $800.00 and will get credit of $400.00 - but the credit had to be used within six months after cancelation. Two months later we decided to book another trip to Mexico via Aeromexico. We called Aeromexico and they informed us that due to penalty fees and other nunsense fees, we would only get back $39.00. We had our hopes in using our credit of $400.00 but now we lost all our money from Aeromexico. They have no concern or compassion.

### Aeromexico customer review
We have recently returned from Mexico to Canada via Aeromexico. We have nothing but praise for this airline. It was necessary for my husband to have a wheelchair on this trip and they provided one at each stop. The wheelchair attendants were attentive, helpful and courteous in both Guadalaraja and Mexico City. The staff on both planes were excellent. The food provided although not gourmet quality certainly was an added bonus.

### Aeromexico customer review
Aeromexico crew should be more attentive to passangers, especially those flying on business class to make sure, at least, drinks are always available. Meal is something you should not expect on Aeromexico domestic fligths.

### Aeromexico customer review
It's not the first time I've flown with Aeromexico but this time the overall service was just right. The personnel were kind from the boarding gate all the way until arrival but the most appreciated asset was the plane. It had enough space for the legs was comfortable to relax and have a good sleep while traveling.

### Aeromexico customer review
Just before showing a movie, other airlines make an announcement: 1) that the movie is starting and 2) that closing the shades over windows would be appreciated by those watching the movie. Aeromexico does not make either announcement, and so the movie begins without notice, and screens are impossible to view because they are drowned in light. Without an announcement, passengers are oblivious to the fact that their open window shades have any effect. I am not suggesting "forcing" anyone to close a shade, but most people would be glad to cooperate if asked to do so politely. Other airlines do this. Why not Aeromexico?

### Aeromexico customer review
My flight left on time from Tapachula, the personnel at the airport were kind and so were the flight attendants. The plane, although a bit small, was comfortable enough.

### Aeromexico customer review
I recently travelled to London Heathrow from Oaxaca, Mexico and back. The outward leg was utter chaos. My son was scheduled to fly on the Oaxaca - Mexico City section of the journey to connect with a BA flight. I had booked him on the 7 pm flight as offered on Orbitz, to leave with BA at 9.45 pm (more or less). I was told by Aeromexico staff that this was extremely unwise - because of delays on their own airline - and to change his ticket to 3 pm which I duly did, at a cost of about 1000 pesos. We arrived for this flight only to be told it was cancelled and that he had to fly on the 7 pm flight. I had to buy him a ticket on a different airline to be able to get to his BA flight. I then returned to our 7 pm flight with my daughters only to discover I no longer had a seat on the Mexico City to London flight and that we were no longer seated together (I had selected our seats a long time before). I was luckily given a seat and then able to change places with a kindly passenger (the airline staff were no help) to be with my daughters. Why had my seat been taken away? Overselling the flight. At check-in at Mexico City there were a lot of passengers who had a ticket but suddenly no assigned seat and were on standby. Families lost booked vacations because one parent was suddenly not on the flight and the next available opportunity? Try again on Wednesday. People screamed because meetings had been made and would not be reached. It was, in a word, chaos. Once on the plane, we discovered that although it was supposed to be the new plane, the seats were incredibly close together (not so on the return leg) and the journey was uncomfortable to say the least, and I'm not tall. My vegetarian meal somehow transmutated into kosher and I couldn't eat it, as it contained meat. I was offered no alternative. The return flight filled me with dread, but was actually OK. We had an easy-check in and boarding, the plane was a lot more comfortable and my vegetarian meal appeared. The cabin staff on the way back were reminiscent of prison guards, especially a particularly haughty attendant. Two very different experiences - a very unreliable airline.

### Aeromexico customer review
I usually enjoy flying Aeromexico, and have had great experiences with them. The problem is that they are hit or miss, and this time is was a great miss. Only one person checking a whole flight in, other counters were open for the rest of Aeromexico red eyes, yet flights to Canada back then had to be checked in by "specially trained people" (whatever that means) - which today consisted of only one lady who looked overwhelmed. There was no online check in for this flight for the same reasons cited above. On other occasions on the same flight, Aeromexico had at least three agents, and Air Canada has 4 agents checking in two canada-bound flights. There was no priority check-in for those traveling in Clase Premier. Once I got my boarding pass, I went to look for a floor manager so that he could bring other agents to assist this poor lady, I do not know if it worked. Security went swiftly, personnel at MEX tend to be very friendly. Terminal 2 is way better than terminal 1 in that it feels more spacious and smells less bad. The Premier lounge was OK. It has a modern decor which might look a bit cold . It was quite crowded given the high number of Aeromexico's late night departures (YUL, CDG, NRT, UIO, JFK, ORD etc). Boarding happened in a very organized way, but upon boarding, I realized that as opposed to my previous experiences on this route, this plane was not the newer ones. The male purser was standing at the entrance greeting everyone as if it was a hassle. Seats were in terrible condition and the plane was not particularly clean. Entertainment system consisted of drop down screens that had a terrible resolution, and earphones worked partially. Even in Clase Premier, legroom was appalling. The purser was a bit unfriendly, but the other flight attendant, who kept coming back and forth from the main cabin was outstanding. Once airborne, we were given snacks, and except from the aforementioned flight attendant who I kept seeing over and over again, the rest of the crew proceeded to get paid for sitting down in the jump-seat. Food was served one hour before the estimated arrival time, and its quality was borderline. We were put on holding pattern for nearly one hour but there was no information about this from the flight crew, maybe they thought that nobody would notice. Deplaning went swiftly, but after crossing the air bridge, the glass doors towards the terminal were locked and we had to wait some time for Aeromexico ground staff to come and open it (I suppose it is best to open it before passengers actually deplane). Overall a pretty mediocre-bad experience, it is a shame to receive the same type of service you would receive on a MEX-CUN flight on the largest North American route of the company, and for it to be delivered with such carelessness. Consistency is key in customer service, and it hurts me to see how Aeromexico proudly parades this flaw both in terms of hard and soft products. I would only recommend this airline due to my previous good experiences, but be warned that things might go wrong.

I flew with Aeromexico in July, and went to Guadalajara with a layover in Mexico City. I have to say that Aeromexico has some good service. The plane that I was on was new, and the ride was comfortable. The food is what you would expect - airline food. However the entertainment is very nice, and the flight attendant service was also very good. Both flights took off and landed on time. I would recommend this airline.

### Aeromexico customer review
My wife and I flew AeroMexico for the first time this past June. We didn't know what to expect but were extremely pleased. The planes we flew to and from Cancun were new and clean. Screens at every seat. Great service from staff. kicker is that I somehow managed to lose my iPhone on the way back home. I thought it must have been at the Cancun Airport so I called them a few times to check the lost and found. Nothing. Then about three days after my flight I got a call from AeroMexico that they had discovered my phone on the plane. I hadn't even informed them that it was missing because I checked my seat area and was fairly sure that it wasn't there. Honestly I don't even know how they managed to figure out whose phone it was. They may have had to call multiple people in our area of the plane. Anyway I went back to the airport and remarkably, they had my phone. I was relieved and extremely impressed. Needless to say I would highly recommend this airline to anyone flying to/from Mexico. And they are linked to Delta so I believe your points will accrue as Skymiles.

Plane left late, but the staff tried to do their best. The space between seats was good so the trip was confortable. There was no option for the menu, and the taste was not the best, but time passed away and we arrived with no more troubles

### Aeromexico customer review
Bumped! Arrived early at the airport and found out the flight was "oversold" and I had no seat. Offered two choices by employee: find a "volunteer" to cede his/her seat or get on a later flight. Chose the later. Found out later on this flight that the same thing happened to several other passengers. And this later flight was not full, which seems to explain the "bumping". Maybe a wise move in a profit or managerial way, but not a great one in public relations terms.

### Aeromexico customer review
Sunday 21st June, Shanghai to Mexico City Premier Class. Old aircraft with no Inflight Entertainment this situation bother me so much. There was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. Very disappointing. The flying experience was not be very good on Premier Class after I bought an upgrade from  economy class.

### Aeromexico customer review
Check-in was fast. Our plane was  comfortable. Each traveler had access to a touchscreen tv. We were able watch movies, tv shows, music videos and listen to music. They also provided croissant sandwich along with snacks and drinks. We arrived on time and without any problems. Thank you Aeromexico for your excellent service.

### Aeromexico customer review
Ground staff were very helpful and attentive. Aircraft old/new(800). Legroom really tight, airline crew to and from were mostly inattentive and tended to spend most of the time in the galley. They were doing their job perfunctorily, devoid of any concern and hardly smiled. Staff hardly spoke English! Only drinks and peanuts on international flight! I would recommend other airlines given the choices out there.

### Aeromexico customer review
I was more worried about the baggage fees than the airline, come to find out that Aeromexico allows 1 carry on and first checked bag for free up to 50 pounds. The plane that we took from Dallas to Mexico City was a nice plane, 2 seater instead of 3, they served us a Ham and Cheese croissant, peanuts, juice, water, beer, liqour, whatever we wanted. Smooth ride, nice landing, made it to Mexico City, from there we took a bigger plane but a little bit older, still a smooth ride and landing. On the way back from Cancun we were in a very nice plane with our own TV, headphones, several movies to choose from. My experience flying with Aeromexico was really good, nothing to complain about.

### Aeromexico customer review
The seat assigned to me was 10C. When I got on the plane the headrest was broken and dangling down the seat back? Why had no one tried to fix it? What a splendid first impression. The toilet at the back of the plane smelt disgusting. I asked a flight attendant if they at least had some kind of spray to alleviate the stench and she grudgingly produced something and stuck her hand around the door and squirted. I have flown several times on this airline recently and the thing that leaves a lasting impression is the complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. Very disappointing.

### Aeromexico customer review
Aeromexico has recently restarted its flights to Toronto, I had a nice experience flying with them that started with a half price sale ticket. I thought that having bought my ticket so cheaply and being in the lowest cabin class, the flying experience would not be very good, but I was surprised by the kind attention of the stewardesses and also by a tasty breakfast in the morning. Only flaws in the flight was that the flight arrived half an hour late, maybe due to turbulance, the seats are a bit uncomfortable and the audio did not work, but as it is a 5 hours night flight only, that did not bother me much.

### Aeromexico customer review
Just had a recent experience pre flight. I booked a flight in February for a trip May 21-25 from DFW to PVR. Received an email from my booking site (Rovia) giving me details. From that point to the time of the trip I constantly checked Aeromexico's website for the flight info and it told me that I can't check it until 24 hours before the flight is set to depart. I check it when that time comes and the flight has been rescheduled and conflicted with my connecting flight in Mexico City (both Arrival and departure). This was done without any email notice or anything. There was no attempt to fix the mess up with the exception of giving me a flight in days later and flight out many more days after my trip. This was to be my first trip out of the country and this airline ruined it so I am completely unsatisfied and will definitely recommend anyone doing business with Aeromexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew 2 legs- MID-MEX on "Connect" brand and then MEX-YYZ. The MID-MEX leg was operated by an E190 no IFE and the snacks were average peanuts but the seats were comfortable and due to the length of the flight it wasn't important. The second leg was on a 737-700. The seats were comfortable and very nice blankets were provided however the IFE was quite limited (overhead screens that played movies and nothing else and were shut off 3 quarters into the flight) so I would recommend bringing your own entertainment if you're flying an Aeromexico 737. In flight meal was edible at most. Overall there were no major problems but they need to improve their IFE on longer flights and their food.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flight 9100 and 9101 coach seating 4/3 to 4/7/15. I cannot say enough good things about or flight service through Aeromexico. The planes were clean and very comfortable loved having the option of watching a movie TV show or listening to music. The attendants were friendly and took care of us all very well. Lunch boxes were served - that's a pleasant surprise in itself! I was very impressed!

### Aeromexico customer review
Sunday 22nd February - Mexico City to LAX - Premier Class. Old aircraft with "drop down" shared TV screens. Service and food could not be faulted on board the aircraft. Bags did not arrive in LAX - the check in staff in Mexico City had incorrectly tagged my two bags to a flight to Miami. Long story short the bags arrived in Sydney two days later thanks to a very attentive customer service officer in the USA. Ground staff at LAX could have shown a little more empathy with my situation.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew from LHR thru MEX to PVR. Was my first time on the Dreamliner. It's a beautiful aircraft and the AeroMexico service and comfort the best I've experienced in long-haul tourist class. Formalities and connection at MEX Term 2 very efficient. Domestic flight to PVR on very comfortable Embraer 190.

### Aeromexico customer review
AM 669 from SFO to Mexico City in Clase Premier / Business Class on January 23 2015. The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing. Aeromexico should be ashamed of themselves for treating their Business Class passengers this way.

### Aeromexico customer review
AM 681. Flew YUL-MEX on a new 737-800 for the second time. Cabin was in great condition. Food service on this flight was much better than on my previous flights with Aeromexico in Clase Premier. Cabin crew were excellent and very professional. The purser knew each of the business class passenger's last names (there were 16 of us) and she was always around to see if she was needed. I fell asleep and she left me a drink and peanuts for when I woke up. Aeromexico staff is usually just OK - they are efficient but are cold and tend to disappear into the galley afterwards. This was not the case in this flight when there was always a flight attendant in the cabin (even in economy class). Great flight overall wish all crews performed this way.

AM 423 Nov 27 2014. AM 422 Dec 2 2014. I have flown from Miami to Mexico and back many times. For several years I made the trip once a month. I have flown on every airline that services Mexico City from Miami. AeroMexico beats them all. Basic friendliness refreshments and snacks prompt departures and arrivals reasonable and competitive fares all without the ubiquitous add-ones and charges of other airlines. I will adjust my schedule to fly this airline every time. This trip was the first in several years and it didn't disappoint. Keep it up I'm a big fan.

### Aeromexico customer review
JFK to CUN 10/8/14 flight 417. Return flight 416 on 10/16/14. Excellent airline. Starting from check in all associates were friendly and helpful. Personal entertainment in the seat backs was perfect. 1st checked bag free is always appreciated. Food was great and also a bonus as it was served at no charge and with smiling associates. Aeromexico is a new favorite airline of mine.

### Aeromexico customer review
Excellent service and courteous employees. I flew from Puerto Vallarta and had to change planes in Mexico City for flight to Los Angeles. One glitch - my bag was put on a later flight ( about 30 to 40 minutes) along with 20 to 30 other travelers. It was frustrating standing around and wondering until an announcement was finally made.

### Aeromexico customer review
I suppose my experience is similar to other reviews. Our outbound SFO to MEX was great on a 737-800 with footrests and plenty of room. The return tonight was awful. The legroom on business class required my wife to climb over the center console to get out of her seat. The flight attendant came by to offer a drink and slapped down my chicken dinner which was cold. He never returned for two hours to refill my water. They kept the galley curtain closed and he sat and was playing a video game most of the flight. I such a shame when you are a full fare business class customer. Airlines should be required to uphold a certain standard and inform the passengers.

### Aeromexico customer review
I have been using Aeromexico for several years for business travel from Chicago to various locations throughout Mexico. They have multiple direct flights. I have been happy with their service both at the counter at the gate and on the airplane. The planes seem to be maintained well and bathrooms and seating areas are clean. Service is pleasant and professional without trying to be cute during announcements. The food to me just seems to be a little better the service a bit more professional and the areas cleaner than everyone else. Again much of what one views is based on perceptions and a few negative things can color one's view. In my case I see so many small positive things that it has probably colored my view of Aeromexico in a good way.

### Aeromexico customer review
I had never flown AeroMexico prior to my first visit to Mexico in October/November 2014. I was impressed that they have a new modern fleet comprising 777s and the 787 Dreamliner. The check in process at the counters in Mexico City was very expedient and friendly. The boarding and departure were timeous. The service onboard for the quick domestic flight to Oaxaca was super friendly and cheerful. I cannot fault this airline. It was a better experience than most domestic airlines I fly in Australia.

### Aeromexico customer review
The problem with Aeromexico is the inconsistency in the airplanes. Flew MEX-CCS- MEX a couple of times in business class in an old wear out 737-700. Shared TV screen seat that resemble the old American Airlines business class. Then I have flown GDL-MEX in the 737-800 what a difference. Service is nice they treat you well but definitely they need to vamp up the Clase Premier Product.

### Aeromexico customer review
I really think this airline is sadly overlooked in the US market. I took a chance on them a few years back when United dropped direct flights to places in Mexico I visit and found an airline with great service modern planes and competitive prices. The flight schedules are convenient and the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful when I have needed them. Only once have I had a issue due to weather - and they made sure to get me on another flight and while my bags did not make it on the plane they had them secured and waiting for me the next morning. In the past 3 years I have flown with them 10+ times and have no interest in looking elsewhere.

### Aeromexico customer review
1 Oct 2014  San Antonio TX - Mexico City Mexico. Mexico City Mexico - Oaxaca Mexico. I live in Oaxaca and fly regularly to San Antonio to visit family in Texas. I have found the staff particularly patient helpful and courteous with my struggles to speak Spanish. My flights have been on time and the planes clean and pleasant. One trip my connection in DF was tight and the attendant booked me on the later flight in case I missed the one I was ticketed for.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flights from San Antonio to Cuernavaca then back to Atlanta were most pleasant experiences. All the things I like to have happen when flying came together on both flights. Both were on time check in went quickly and smoothly every Aeromexico person I had contact with was professional and friendly and even boarding was quick and efficient. The meals - sandwich and candy bar - was well a sandwich but the bread was fresh and a fun sized Snickers isn't all that bad. This was my second and third flight with Aeromexico and all were very pleasant flights. I caught up on a TV show going down and a movie coming back home. For me the airline did a great job and the fare was very reasonable.

Flight 24. Departed at 11.55pm on Oct 20 and arrived at 12.30pm on Oct 21. Had a very positive experience with my flights to and from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro in Premiere Class. From the gate agents to the inflight crew the service was excellent. The meals and entertainment was also very good.

### Aeromexico customer review
MEX/PVR morning flight. Check-in staff forgot to put a priority tag on my luggage. Even 70min flight Business class meal was only one muffin same as Economy class. The only different thing was refilling coffee. Seat was enough big but old. It's ok because of a short haul but if it's more than 2 hours I take Economy class to save money.

### Aeromexico customer review
Aeromexico is a good airline but there is a huge gap in quality from aircraft to aircraft for instance last week I flew from CUN to MEX in a new B737-800 excellent in every way. My next leg was MEX to TIJ in a B737-700 old cramped no inflight entertainment just one tiny bag of peanuts for a 3 hour flight toilet old and dirty. The boarding procedure AM is implementing is awful and useless. It takes longer and it is absurd. First they board pax on window seats then center seats and on final call aisle seats no matter if you are in row 10 or 24. Uncomfortable at the gates. AM is the best airline there is in Mexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
Return trip - Sao Paulo to Puerto Vallarta connecting through Mexico City leaving October 9th and returning October 14th. One day before departure I received an e-mail informing me that the return flight was postponed from October 14th at 23:15 to October 15th at 08:40. Since I had to be back in Sao Paulo on the 15th in the afternoon I contacted Aeromexico in Brazil to request that my return flight be transferred to TAM who code share with Aeromexico on this segment with the flight leaving Mexico City around 20.00. Aeromexico told me that the notification must be a mistake because they see no changes in their system and all flights are according to original reservation. As proof they even sent me a copy of electronic ticket which really showed all the correct departure times. Also checking the Aeromexico site there was no indication of any delay. So I forgot all about it until one day before my return flight when I got a Trip Reminder e-mail stating again that the return flight was now at 08:40 on the 15th instead of 23:15 of the 14th. I again contacted Aeromexico this time in Mexico and again they confirmed that everything was according to original reservations and they had no information about any delay. After using Aeromexico's online check-in system and receiving electronic boarding passes with the correct time stamped on them I felt somehow reassured. My mistake. When I arrived at the airport to check-in my luggage I was informed that due to "unscheduled maintenance" the flight would be delayed by 10 hours. Unscheduled Maintenance? Really? Either Aeromexico's computer system is totally screwed up and they have no idea of what is happening with their schedules or they simply are lying to their passengers to avoid having to transfer tickets to other airlines. Whatever it is it is totally unacceptable!

### Aeromexico customer review
I had two flights with them in business class MEX-MAD and LHR-MEX. The Madrid flight was in a 777 and the London - Mexico flight was in a new 787. Completely different experience. They have substantially improved their food offering but now the crews have an excellent attitude in the way they treat the clients. The seat in the 777 is outdated as is the entertainment system but the 787 flat bed seat is a great quality seat. I can never sleep on planes and when I went up to the galley for a snack I found the cabin crew to be very friendly.

### Aeromexico customer review
I read all the bad reviews and decided to take a chance anyway. I had three tickets to Mexico from two different places. On all three tickets and on two separate occasions they changed the flights and added a ten hour layover. They said that they would fix it by asking me to leave a day later. I booked through Expedia and they would not help. I was on the phone with Expedia and Aeromexico for at least two hours. They did offer a refund but by this time all the fares were at least $250 more. I had to cancel all three tickets and rebuy on other airlines at an extra cost of $750! Their schedules mean absolutely nothing - and certainly don't book on anything that requires a connection.

### Aeromexico customer review
Due to past experiences I was weary to pick AM on this YUL-MEX-YUL flight nevertheless this time they surprised me and exceeded my expectations on both sectors. Both flights were on the newer 737-800s. I was upgraded on the outbound flight. Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in. New 737s are really modern with PTVs and sky interiors. I don't know if this experience is enough to say that they have really improved.

### Aeromexico customer review
During the 3hrs and 20min flight from Mexico City to Tijuana Aeromexico created a very pleasant experience reminiscent of the golden age of flight. The crew was young and attentive professional and bilingual. The aircraft was a wonderfully well kept 737-800 with a state of the art entertainment system. Complementary snacks and drinks including alcohol were served twice during the journey. Landing was on time and arrival at the gate was relatively quick. I would definitely fly with them again.

### Aeromexico customer review
Was extremely pleased with the level of friendly professional service we received on two flight segments from Cincinnati OH to Cancun Mexico a few weeks ago. The stewardesses on every one of the four flights were so helpful and willing to please that I was taken back due to the fact that of late stewardesses in general have carried an air of arrogant indifference. The planes were very clean. The schedule was adhered to.

### Aeromexico customer review
I was pretty excited to once again fly the Dreamliner especially on the direct NRT-MEX in Biz. The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there. Aeromexico needs to step up its service game if it hopes to compete with the Asian carriers.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew LAX to MEX (AM649) on a 737-800. Paid $30 extra for AM Plus seats on row #7. Boarding at LAX was a bit of a mess because AeroMexico boards every window seat first then every middle seat aisle seat etc. Airplane was clean and my AM Plus seat had a few more inches of extra leg room. Take-off was smooth and the flight was good. A few hours into the flight breakfast and coffee were served. I did not partake because I was asleep (a special thank you to the flight attendant for not waking me up). Flight attendants were courteous respectful and polite. We arrived in MEX about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Several days later I flew MEX to LAX (AM648) on a brand new 737-800. Once again sat on AM Plus row #7. Beautiful brand new leather seats with a personal TV screens. Every AM Plus seat was tastefully decorated with pillows blankets and headphones. A croissant sandwich peanuts chocolate pudding and drinks were served. Flight was smooth and arrived on time at LAX. Very nice flight attendants. Will fly again.

We fly Aeromexico JFK to Cancun. We use them whenever we can. The reasons are many but here are some. The crew are very accommodating and always courteous. We enjoy having food to eat. If there is an empty seat after takeoff we were allowed to move. The plane was new.

### Aeromexico customer review
NY to MX City to GDL - My flight was delayed 2 hours in NY but arrived on time to MX City to catch the connecting flight to GDL. However received an email telling me of the 2 hour delay and my flight back to NY was cancelled. Called the airline and was told the cancellation was a mistake. When time to fly back to NY as scheduled I show up a the airport to be told my flight was cancelled! They could only offer me to fly out by 1am from Mx City to NY or rebook my flight for the next day. Booked the flight for following day and again my flight from GDL to MX City was delayed which made me lose my flight from MX City to NY and had to wait 9 hours until 1am to take the next flight back to NY from MX City. Plus Mx City Airport need to increase their WiFi Service. I was stuck for 9 hours totally bored with no WiFi good service. I was so disappointed because I had liked AeroMexico before and never had problems but this time I noticed their great service has declined. The only thing I thank them for is the food vouchers I got to get free food from any vendor at the airport. However delaying your flight makes a big difference in your entire day and getting home terribly tired with no sleep.

Flight #128. Mexico City to Guadalajara. 7/26/14. When we arrived we were told the flight was oversold. Our seats had us next to each other on our original boarding passes we were separated because someone decided to fly a smaller plane. Our original tickets were for placement on a larger airplane. We boarded the plane. We waited on the runway for almost 2 hours. Every time someone needed to use the restroom they were told to sit down. Nothing was offered during this time. Finally the captain came on and said we had to return to the gate. He said we couldn't take off because of a maintenance issue. We got off the plane got our luggage and were told were told to go to the ticket counter. At the ticket counter we waited for another 2 hours. We asked if staff could at least provide some water and they said no they didn't have any. Unacceptable. We waited another hour until we were finally given a new connecting flight some food vouchers and a hotel room that we napped in for only 2 hours before we had to be back for the morning flight. I do not recommend flying with them.

### Aeromexico customer review
My father and I flew from Lima to Mexico City on the 767-300ER. When we were checking in the agent told us that the flight was delayed 50 minutes. We passed security and went to the business lounge until 1.45am - the time we were told to board. We made it to our seats only to wait 5 minutes and they told us there would be a delay of 3 hours so we didn't board until 4.30am. We went to our seats 1A and 1B. The width of the seats was uncomfortable but they do recline almost 180°. Service was awful. They only served the food no drinks offered and food was either salad or chicken. No AVOD and even not a movie during the 6 hour flight the TV was shared. We arrived delayed in Mexico City. Overall I do not recommend business class it is not worth the price.

### Aeromexico customer review
My husband and I flew to Mexico City and then to Manzanillo. Staff were friendly and helpful. We encountered no problems with this airline. Our flights ran on schedule and our luggage was not lost. On the return trip I was missing a form at the time of boarding staff quickly helped me fill it out and held the plane for me to run back to the boarding gate. We will use this airline again. We feel like we received good service for the price of our ticket.

My children used the unaccompanied minors service from ORD-MEX-VER. I was very nervous as were they. They had never flown before plus being alone they were scared. None the less they had a great flights. Their layover in Mexico City was fun they said. They were taken to a game room that was a restricted area for unaccompanied minors only where they were supervised and played video games and watched movies. My children said everyone they encountered with AeroMexico were helpful and friendly. No problems at all with delays baggage etc... I will use this airline again. My children will be flying annually to Mexico to visit their father.

Paris to Mexico City. The staff at the airport in both airports (Mexico / Paris) were friendly and helpful. The plane is a new B787 Dreamliner with pretty modern installation. The food was served very good and the entertainment was for a long 12h flight very amused. I will prefer Aeromexico for future flights from Europe to Mexico or to Central / South America.

### Aeromexico customer review
Today I was scheduled to fly from Mexico City to LAX but I was connecting from another city. Aeromexico screwed up the connection so I missed my leg to LAX. Instead of simply rebooking me on a later flight (of which there were three) they wanted to reticket me and charge me the then rate which was $650 more than I had originally paid. Seriously? You want me to pay $650 for your mistake. Worse when I said I'd fly Alaska instead they didn't care - but refused to refund me my original money for the MEX to LAX leg. This is the second such instance with this airline. Two years ago I was making the same trip and also was not able to complete the leg from MEX to LAX. They said there was "weather problems" in LA. (My family was at the airport in LA at the time and said it was clear as day and gorgeous weather). So they cancelled my flight to LAX and I was told I couldn't get on another flight until the next day. They made me pay for my hotel room at the Mexico City airport because it was a weather delay (which it wasn't) and was beyond their control. Worse I had purchased an upgrade to First Class earlier in the day (before the flight was cancelled) and when the First Class cabin was not available on the flight the next day they wouldn't refund my First Class upgrade cost even though they were going to put me in Coach. So when I got home I filed suit in Small Claims Court and I won the cost of the hotel and the First Class upgrade cost.

MEX-PVR-MEX-CUN on EMB190 B737-700 and B737-800. EMB190 and B737-800 were new and great B737-700 was old but well kept. First row on economy is great with plenty of leg room. All flights were on time and service was good. They offer only refreshments and alcoholic drinks. Attendants were nice and speak English perfectly. Terminal 2 at MEX is modern and great. Luggage drop and security was very fast. On B737-700 and -800 there was full IFE service with more than 10 movies.

### Aeromexico customer review
LIM-MEX-LIM Business Class (Clase Premiere) in April was a perfect example on how Aeromexico has come to represent an inconsistent product. Plane is an oldish 737 without personal IFE but it was just fine in both legs. Seat Ok and amenity kit that Aeromexico now handles only on overnight flight with some space for improvement even though it was delivered with a really nice IPAD case. As far as service is concerned a huge difference between the MEX-LIM and the LIM-MEX leg. On the first leg it was outstanding with a professional warm and polite flight attendant. Good food and good selection of drinks. On the way back flights attendants did not even bother to greet passengers and performed their job mechanically and without interest. What a difference! What a lack of consistency in the product delivered by Aeromexico. A 3/10 would be a perfect grade to describe this last experience.

We flew back Feb 22 towards our destination which was Los Angeles from Guadalajara Mexico on flight 784. We were told there was haze over LA and we needed to land in Tijuana Mexico to re-fuel and allow it to clear up. After sitting in the plane at Tijuana for 1 hr they told us the plane was no longer going to fly to LA so we could get off and figure things on our own or fly back to Guadalajara and be on standby for flights back. We were supposed to arrive in LA at 9.45 it is now close to midnight and we're stuck in TJ. The flight attendants did not try to accommodate us while waiting. They sat in the back on their phones. We waiting for at least 45 min before we were allowed off the plane then waited an additional hour for our luggage. At the airport there was no help and no assistance. We actually had to have family drive 4 hours to pick us up and I have 2 small children with me.

JFK-MEX-ZIH and return. JFK-MEX on the red eye was completed on an older model 737 with no inflight entertainment (presumably due to the timing of the flight - depart 12.15am arrive 4.40am) but we were served a very nice hot sandwich shortly after takeoff. MEX-JFK return on a brand-new 737 - great plane excellent inflight entertainment and again a nice hot meal. The ZIH-MEX connection was slightly delayed but we were assured that a significant amount of passengers on the flight were connecting to the JFK flight. Sure enough about 18 of us were greeted by an agent upon deplaning in MEX and were escorted as a group to the JFK gate which was in the process of boarding. Excellent service throughout by both ground and cabin crews. Would not hesitate to recommend Aeromexico in the future.

### Aeromexico customer review
LIM-MEX-ORD economy round-trip. My only complaints are: 1) They forgot my vegetarian meal on LIM-MEX leg. The flight attendant brushed me off and just left without even asking if I wanted a drink or a regular meal. Never bothered to check and never came back. 2) They sold me a flight that had a 1.5 hours layover in Mexico City I wasn't aware of the whole customs-immigration-checking my bags again at MEX airport. If they know of this whole ordeal why would they sell flights with such short layovers? Food and service: Most staff were pleasant. The food was pretty decent and free drinks even alcoholic ones. The flight didn't have individual screens so there's only one movie option. They did have radio and gave headphones a pillow and a blanket. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. As a side note if you have a connection through Mexico airport and are pressed for time make sure you ask the personnel if you can't find something as its lacking some signs. The conveyor belt for my flight was in a separate room than most of the belts had I not asked someone I probably would've waited in vain.

Flight 636 on Sunday 2-23-14 (MEX to ATL). In Mexico City they wanted to weight my purse and wanted me to pay 2 kilos extra. Why do I have to pay if my belongings were under my seat? They don't accept dollars just pesos. I have never travelled on an airline that would weigh my carry on luggage or personal purse. The customer service reps at the airport in Mexico City were rude. Flight attendants were nice and helpful. I will never travel with Aeromexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
ATL-GRU via MEX. Thought I'd found a good value on a business class ticket that would let me earn skymiles. Wrong! I flew in business both ways but only got skymiles one direction because of the "class of service". (The leg where I got stuck in the middle seat is the one I earned miles on.) Middle seat in business class" you might be saying? Why yes. Not the seat I reserved when I booked but the seating chart at that time didn't even show a middle seat. Would not recommend don't plan to fly again myself.

### Aeromexico customer review
I booked my trip to Santiago de Chile from San Francisco with AM just because they were skyteam partners. The inflight service was great. I was allowed to priority board with my delta silver status. I even got access to skyteam lounge in Santiago without asking. Food was a bit of a let down especially since I requested a vegetarian meal. Other than that the entertainment was good not hundreds of choices but I found the selection of movies and programs fresh and entertaining. All four legs of the flight were on time and staff were very helpful. Even though I didn't know any Spanish I was able to communicate which is often a problem. Overall be it luck or their usual code of conduct I had a great experience with AM and would recommend to any one. Economical and comfortable despite a 16 hour trip.

### Aeromexico customer review
Los Angeles - Mexico City - Cancun / Merida - Mexico City - Guadalajara - Culiacan - Los Angeles. Staff not terribly helpful. I was initially booked on Los Angeles to Mexico City via Hermosillo with only a 45 minutes connection in Hermosillo. Was told by the staff at check-in they were not sure if that is sufficient time for me to make the connection but they would not change my flights because that's the way the ticket had been issued. In the end they changed it because the Los Angeles to Hermosillo flight was overbooked. Guadalajara to Culiacan departure was late so along with a couple of passengers we missed the Culiacan to Los Angeles flight. All the announcements for the late departure from Guadalajara was only in Spanish though when asked one of the flight attendants would occasionally kept me updated. Passengers were given the option of flying via Mexico City arriving about 12 hours later or to continue on to Tijuana and making our own way to Los Angeles at our own expense. Check in was very slow on all flights. Seems that for most of the departures in Mexico there is a system for printing your boarding passes at the machines in the airport but even then the queue for bag drop itself is at least 1 hour long including in Mexico City. The domestic lounge in Mexico City was reasonable. Hot food station (soup) was manned by staff. Was not particularly impressed by how the waiting staff asked for tips twice (once before serving the soup and once after serving the soup at the counter) when all they are doing is their job.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew the new 787 in business class from Paris to Mexico city on Dec 19th. Flight attendant refused to speak English. Served dinner about 45 minutes later than in economy class meal was lukewarm. Exactly 5 minutes later she showed up again noticed that I was still eating and asked me if I was done. The reason became clear right after desert was served. On this 12 hour flight there is only service in the first 2.5 hours and in the 90 minutes before landing. 8 full hours there is no flight attendant no drinks no snacks. They expect you to sleep and not bother the flight crew. If you can't sleep it will be a long flight. Entertainment is very limited. Movies in the section new are at least a year old. You have about 10 to choose from. Watching out of the window is prohibited by AeroMexico. The windows will be darkened 15 minutes after take off until 5 minutes before touchdown. Service was better in economy class on this flight. Expect AeroMexico business class at the level of "Premium economy class" on any other skyteam airline. For sure not worth the extra money.

### Aeromexico customer review
GDL to LAX. It was a very pleasant flight for many reasons. Staff were very friendly and willing to help with any question. The food served was good for a 3 hour flight. They served yoghurt with cookies and fruit. There was inflight entertainment but no option all that there was available is what they played. Overall I really liked this airline and am willing to fly with them in the future.

### Aeromexico customer review
I had an excellent flight from MEX to JFK on New Year's Day on one of their new 787s. Check-in staff was helpful and well-organized. We boarded and left on time. Cabin staff was professional and friendly; the breakfast frittata was great and there was a variety of movies to choose from during the flight. They even offered wine in Economy Class. The 787 is a great plane and flying in this plane was a great experience. We arrived at JFK 30 minutes early.

### Aeromexico customer review
I had a positive experience with Aeromexico from JFK to MEX via Cancun on Christmas. JFK check-in was efficient with no extra fees for checking a bag. They also served complimentary breakfast which was a decent omelette. Cabin staff was friendly and professional. We left and arrived on time. I had a 3-hour layover before taking a flight to Toluca (at a bargain fare) and asked Cancun check-in staff if I could change that leg of the trip to MEX. I was switched to an earlier CUN-MEX flight at no extra charge. The aircraft from CUN to MEX was brand new and spotlessly clean. We left and arrived on time.

### Aeromexico customer review
Oaxaca / Mexico City / SFO. After my last traumatic experience with AeroMexico I am not looking forward to my next trip next week. This really is the last time I will fly with them - going to pay more for United flights that go through Houston. It was amazing to read some of the reviews below that mirrored my experience. I missed a $150 flight and had to pay $600 to rebook! No sympathy. I was there at the gate 2 hours early so it wasn't that I was late. I hadn't got my passport stamped by immigration because I didn't see the table and even though I was told I had time to go get it stamped and I ran they closed the gate and I missed the flight. All the employees I dealt with were very cold and even seemed to take pleasure that I had missed my flight and had to buy a new ticket. There are so many bad reviews here that I hope others will refrain from using this airline until they adopt a more user friendly attitude.

### Aeromexico customer review
ATL-MEX-ATL in addition to my earlier review I want to add the 2nd part of worst experience I had. Redeeming my skymiles I booked ATL-MEX a new ticket as Aeromexico was not willing to rebook me. At the end of my business trip in MEX I tried to check in for my return flight but I learnt that they have an internal policy that if you are not on your first flight they cancel your booking for the second flight. To get home I had to buy another ticket. The SkyTeam should really choose their codeshare partners more wisely. Never again.

### Aeromexico customer review
ATL-MEX this was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I was on time (1.30pm for a 3pm flight) at the check in counter and was sent to another counter Delta. When I was turned away there as well and sent back my flight had been closed for 5 minutes and nobody could help to get me on or even rebook me to the next available flight. After being stuck at the terminal for over 5 hours hanging on the phone with travel agent and Aeromexico I had to leave home again. I was told to go the next day to the check in counter where I again was told to pay a penalty to get rebooked. I redeemed my skymiles and booked another ticket.

### Aeromexico customer review
I had a great experience with Aeromexico on a round trip from Las Vegas to Guadalajara. The aircraft was very clean. The loading process was efficient and quick. The flight attendants were very professional and all were bi- lingual. The entire staff of Aeromexico were pleasant and concerned with customer satisfaction.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew London to Mexico City no entertainment on 12.5 flight! Very uncomfortable no footrests and not a lot of space. Staff on the way back were rude and impertinent when I asked for a 3rd glass of wine (thimble sized) we were curtly told that we would not be served drinks for 9 hours and that you're only allowed 1 or 2 drinks which is new to me. Staff seemed reluctant to do any work and viewed it more of an inconvenience than their actual livelihood. My seat didn't recline so spent 10 hours on an overnight upright. Food was rubbish as well.

### Aeromexico customer review
MTY to CUN via MEX. MTY to MEX flight was delayed and they didn't do anything about it so I missed my connection to CUN then customer service gave me the run around and tried to charge me MXN$300 to put me on waiting lists for flights they clearly knew were oversold. Aeromexico left me stranded in the airport overnight and couldn't be bothered to offer board and a meal. Hadn't it been for my helpful travel agency I might as well been left there for 3 days until my returning flight to MTY. MEX to MTY was delayed as well as apparently the crew was stuck in TIJ. I'll never fly Aeromexico again.

### Aeromexico customer review
Horrible experience with missed connection. My arrival in Mexico City gave me 1.5 hours to catch my connection to Merida. Our flight was on time so I expected to be ok - but quickly saw that I had a long wait in Customs. It took over an hour to get through that line-up. Carried my bag as fast as I could up to the area where connecting flights were to drop bags off - and to another line-up. The rep working there told me it was too late to catch my flight to Merida. It hadn't left but doors were closed. She told me to go and get a new flight across the hall. When I arrived there the rep told me that I must buy a new ticket. I was shocked. No other airline has ever made me pay for a new connection when I have been held up in a Customs line-up. Even the supervisor on shift would not bend. I could not believe this airline would treat a customer so badly. I had run as fast as possible between customs and baggage check-in - only to be told by the unfriendly agent that "1.5 hours is enough time" to catch my flight. So I paid for a new ticket - no choice! What stung even more was the feeling that AeroMexico just didn't care what happened to their customer arriving alone in a strange city. Never again.

### Aeromexico customer review
MEX to CDG in a 767-200 that was at least 25 years old. The business class seat was not working well and there were no in-seat monitors. The service attitude was not pleasant. The stewardess greeting people at the door were not even smiling. Overall poor quality especially considering that the price paid was the same as the price of an Air France flight which I took on the way back and was incomparable.

### Aeromexico customer review
Tonight I went to the airport to board my flight from SFO to Cancun. I got there in plenty of time and had 2 bags to check. Their website clearly states that the first bag is free and the second bag is 50 dollars. When I got to the ticket counter the agent told me that the flight was fully booked and they were only accepting passengers with one piece of luggage. They were not accepting a second bag even if you wanted to pay. I asked them what I could do and they said I could board the flight but only if I left one bag behind. Forcing passengers with more than one luggage to give up their seats on an overbooked flight so they could solve their over booked flight without any compensation. If you ever take Aeromexico don't assume you can just pay for an extra bag. You can take 2 bags but you may have to either leave one behind or get moved to another flight. I let them move me to a flight the next day. I had to take all my luggage back home lugging it up the stairs because the escalators weren't working. No More Aeromexico for me.

### Aeromexico customer review
LAX to MX City was ok but seat old and lumpy. First trip to Mexico and employees could have been more welcoming. Mother 71 not feeling too good had to make several pit stops as we were misdirected twice to our gate but we still made it 20 minutes before flight time. Not good enough gate was closed and we were sent away. We stopped at what was supposed to be Customer Service in time to hear another couple being harshly criticized for not being at the gate an hour before flight time and forced to buy new tickets to get to Cancun. My mother was so upset and didn't want me to have to buy more tickets but they knew I had no choice. This was the start of our trip and they knew it! On our return flight people were walking onto the plane minutes before the doors closed and the engines started.

BOG-MEX MEX-CUN CUN-MEX MEX-GDL GDL-MEX MEX-BOG. I booked a multi-city including 2 international flights and several domestic flights I can say that the only good thing about Aeromexico is their business lounge. Onboard the aircraft its a complete nightmare service is the worst I have had seats are dated and not comfortable inflight entertainment is poor and food is awful. I would strongly advise against flying with them.

Mexico City to Cancun in Business Class. Lounge in T2 is ok. Flight attendant wasn't very friendly. Only drinks and no food served on the 2.15 hr flight to Cancun. Very poor service. Seat was ok. No entertainment.

### Aeromexico customer review
My husband and I were so excited for our honeymoon. We left LAX on July 21 2013 destination ZLO. The way there wasn't too bad. On our trip back on Aug 3rd we had a 5 hour layover in Mexico City. Numerous flights were cancelled throughout the day and we ended up staying at the airport for over 12 hours until the cancelled everything altogether. We were put up in a hotel nearby which had a 1.5 hour wait to check in due to everyone else's flight being cancelled. We slept for 2 hours and had our departure to LAX early AM. We finally arrived in LAX and Aeromexico lost my husbands baggage. All we wanted to do was go home and we were stuck waiting for an Aeromexico staff for at least an hour so we could give them our contact information and leave. That was the worst trip back ever.

### Aeromexico customer review
I arrived to the airport 2 hours and 45 minutes before my scheduled departure time. I was told that there was a 3 hour mandatory check in time. The agents involved did not want to hear about my issues on my way to the airport. I was told that especially on Sundays flights are full up and my seat was sold to another customer. I had no bags to check in and I had to pay a hefty fine to re-schedule my flight to another day. For all those unfamiliar with the DF airport it takes 10 minutes to go through security and another 5 to walk to the gates. Most flights are not even given a gate number until 1 hour before the scheduled departure time. This was my fist and last time flying with Aeromexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
Contrary to what a lot of people are putting here I had a very good experience with Aeromexico. I was departing from SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) to MEX (Mexico DF). Airline prices change too often and I bought my ticket well ahead of time to get it for a cheap price for a major carrier! Even while still in the airport as I am a nervous flyer the captain was nice enough to reassure me about the flight. On-board the flight attendants were very nice and friendly even giving me advise on what transportation to take to specific tourist places in Mexico city for a first-timer in the city. The food was okay and the movie was ok though I bought my own set of entertainment myself. All in all the flight and service was pretty good.

### Aeromexico customer review
DFW to Cancun Mexico with a stop in Mexico City. Boarded our flight to Mexico City from DFW at 06.50 in the morning after sitting on the tarmac for 40 minutes the pilot informed us that we would need to return to the gate. Once at the gate we sat for about an hour and reboarded and left for Mexico City. We had to catch a connecting flight to Cancun we had 30 minutes since our flight had been delayed so much they ended up moving our flight time to depart from Mexico City to Cancun 10 minutes early. Directed to the counter to get on a different flight. I was very disappointed in the airline and the staff out of the 4 flights there and back that we took I may have had 2 nice flight attendants. I had packed my bags to carry on and had made it on the 3 flights down and the one from Cancun-Mexico City without having any issues but when I went to board the flight from Mexico City to DFW they informed that I would need to check my bag because it was too big I thought nothing of it and assumed that it was just a packed flight but once we boarded the plane was practically empty with 5-7 overhead bins still open and my bag would have fit with the dimensions in all I was very disappointed with the airline.

### Aeromexico customer review
New York JFK to Bogota Colombia connecting through Mexico City. Aeromexico sold us 3 round trip tickets with one of the connections being operated by another airline (Avianca). I was traveling with my 2 small kids ages 5 and 6. At departure in JFK their system failed printing only 1 boarding pass for the connection MEX-BOG. Asked to go to the local Aeromexico ticket counter in Mexico City to pick up the missing boarding passes with the promise someone was going to have them ready. Forced to leave the connecting area at 5am (after a 5 hour flight) dragging my 2 small kids and luggage. In Mexico City at the Aeromexico ticket counter we were met by a supervisor who refused to print the missing boarding passes claiming my problem was with the second airline. I spent 45 minutes trying to find the other airline. They did not honor any of the seats booked together when the tickets were bought and separated my kids from me on one of the flights. Unfortunately they own a monopoly in Mexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flight late departing Nashville to Cancun but made good time and arrived near original time. Plane clean cabin personnel courteous almost robot-like neatly dressed. Apparently the flight time from Nashville to Cancun is not a 'meal or snack' flight. We were offered complimentary sodas juice beer mixed drinks and a small cup of mixed nuts - one time - for our 2 hour 40 minute flight at 11am. We never saw the cabin attendants again until we landed. Should have used the call button for another drink! If price is good I would fly them again but I would definitely be more prepared with a meal purchased at the airport. The return flight was the same - invisible attendants except for initial drink. The gate attendant said we would receive a snack as the flight left at 6:30pm - guess what no snack just more nuts! Cannot rate food or entertainment. Entertainment was radio only with ear plug set passed out and collected before landing.

Several Flights domestic Mexico last March. MEX-CUN MEX-GDL MEX-VER. In general good price and good product for economy. Check in process in Mexico City fast and easy. Security control always very fast also no lines. Boarding process organized. On board always free snack. Departed and arrival on time most of the time only one time 10 min late. FA always nice. Bags fast on belt. Recommended.

### Aeromexico customer review
Buenos Aires - Mexico - Las Vegas - Mexico - Buenos Aires. Most flights were on time and crew were friendly. For both long haul flights (EZE-MEX-EZE) the aircraft was a 767 without IFE. Food was quite good crew kept constantly giving out glasses of water tea or coffee even in MEX-EZE a 500ml bottle of water was on every economy class seat. If I get the chance I will fly them again.

### Aeromexico customer review
MEX-CDG-MEX. Food - awful both legs economy style (Chicken and pasta) and also overcooked. Only breakfast to CDG not so bad. Catering sequence nothing to do with Other Sky team airlines. Flight attendants do only what is necessary extras are difficult to get. Not recommended.

### Aeromexico customer review
Travelled Premier Classe from Mexico City to Paris. This is an extremely poor business class product. On entering the plane we were offered a choice of water or orange juice; on asking for a glass of champagne was told very curtly by the steward that they had not chilled any so could not offer it! No personal IFE in seat only offer of ipad type product with limited selection. Meal very mediocre - choice of wines ok. Service from cabin crew very unfriendly and desultory - they seemed to have little interest in providing much service. Seat was acceptable. But this old 767 really needs an upgrade and the cabin crew need some serious customer service training. This business class product in no way compares with Air France or KLM their Skyteam and codeshare partners.

PVR-MEX Flight AM143 February 18 2013 Boeing 737-700 seat 22A. Flight half full we sat all ready to go in the cabin without air for a good 15 minutes before we were on our way. The aircraft had slim seats which tend to be the new trend with airlines to reduce weight and give a little more leg room. Leg room was OK but comfort of the seat is poor due to the lack of padding giving you some back pain even for a flight of a little over an hour. Drink service was OK staff friendly and attentive. Arrival on time.

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico to Madrid and onward to Geneva via Air Europa. At check in they bungled up my frequent flyer number and kept telling me it was invalid. After the lousy check-in process I proceeded to the lounge at Mexico City airport terminal 2. The lounge has slow service with a poor selection of snacks and drinks. Lounge was crowded too. Inflight the seats in business were very small on this 767. The seats don't lie flat but at an angle. The best part no in-flight entertainment. The staff handed out ipads with a very limited selection of movies and TV shows. Food was awful and they did not have my option. Flight attendants could not be bothered with requests and soon disappeared after serving us our meals. Despite attempts to call them no one showed up. This is not business class but at best premium economy. Overall a very poor experience.

### Aeromexico customer review
Feb 8 2013 flight AM192 MEX-PVR Embraer 170. My first time on this type of aircraft. I liked the large windows and larger seats. One thing though leather seats tend to have you slide down and slouch. Flight was on time staff friendly bags delivered by the time I had deplaned.

### Aeromexico customer review
Will never fly with them again. We missed our Aero Mexico flight to LA through their incompetence and consequently our onward connection to Australia that evening. Ground staff were next to useless and we got the run-around for 4 hours being passed from one supervisor to another with no-one wanting to take responsibility with lots of shrugging of shoulders. We had to organise our new flights ourselves at some cost to us. Once on board the premier class is just like premium economy although its supposed to be the equivalent of business class. Food and service is basic. I believe they have plans to fly from MEX to LHR shortly. They will have to lift their game to be any competition to existing carriers on that route. We love Mexico but will use another airline in the future.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew Mexico City to New York and back in December 2012. At the time of booking was told that a baby bassinet and baby food would be provided for my infant. When I called to reconfirm the flight 2 days before travel I was told that Aeromexico did not have bassinets on a 5 hour flight from Mex to NY. Felt tricked as I was not given this information at the time of booking. In-flight entertainment non existent no personal video screens and unclean airplane on the way into JFK. Movie was shown on an overhead screen unfortunately the headphones provided were non functional. The food was horrible and neither me nor my wife ate the food no baby food provided for my infant. The only positive from the flight was that the plane was empty and we could place our baby on the seat between us. It would have been very hard to carry the baby on our lap for 5 hours without a bassinet. On the return flight check-in was a mess at JFK the staff were not efficient and when we asked if the flight was on time we were told it was. We rushed through security and when we reached the gate the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The airline staff were not competent and no one could explain the reason for the delay. Inflight food was terrible no video screens despite the plane being brand new. No baby food for the infant. Again the only positive for the return flight was that the baby had a seat between us as the flight was empty. Overall a bad experience for us and our infant.

MTY-MEX-PVG-MEX-MTY. Departed MTY Terminal B very nice fast check in. Boarded a brand new 737-800 with IFE in Biz and coach classes. In MEX went to the AM lounge - its excellent. Boarded (777-200ER) sat in Premier Class all the way to PVG. It has a tech stop over TIJ which turned out not so bad you don't even get off the plane at TIJ just crew changes and on we went to Shanghai. It was a 14.45 min flight but sleeping eating movies and great crews made my flight amazing!

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew from Madrid to Mexico City. First off my flight was delayed for reasons that none of the staff at the desk was able to explain. Check in was extremely disorganised and poorly signaled. About 1 hour into 14 hour flight I noticed that my inflight entertainment screen was still off while other passengers' screens were on. Then it turned out that 6 rows did not have working inflight entertainment screens or overhead reading lights. As soon as we let the staff know they told us they would "reset the system" and let people at the front of the plane know. About 30 minutes later nothing was working and we asked again what the status was. We were told quite rudely that they were looking into it. Needless to say this carried on for another 3 hours. It became evident that the flight attendants were avoiding our section as we could see them walking around offering water to passengers in the aisle on the other side of the plane quite often. Finally about 4.5 hours into the flight the person sitting next to me asked once more whether they'd managed to see what was wrong with our screens. The flight attendant said "well obviously it's not working. Didn't you figure that out?". I can understand that technical problems may arise but that does not mean that paying customers should be treated rudely. I was very happy to finally land in Mexico city after 14 hours of a tortuous flight. I am very hesitant to fly with Aeromexico again if this is the standard of customer service that they have.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew from Miami to Cabo through Mexico City. I was very hesitant but chose to do so as I was taking 5 people with me and it was $250.00 cheaper pp to fly Aeromexico than the other domestic airlines. My experience turned out to be a very pleasant one. Other than legroom being a little tight in economy on 2 of the 4 flights planes were clean on time staff very pleasant and flight attendants dressed well. Mexico City airport was very easy to manage. My experience was just as good if not better than any other domestic airline.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew AeroMexico for the first time in economy class from JFK to Cancun return. Aside from the legroom or lack of I can't make any negative comments. We were given a pretty good breakfast half hour into the flight nice hot coffee and flight attendents made multiple beverage runs throughout the 3.5hr flt. The return was pretty much the same except it was a dinner flight and they offered complimentary alcohol. I'd say AeroMexico is a much better airline to travel to Mexico in economy class then US carriers.

### Aeromexico customer review
JFK-CUN-JFK. Why bother asking me online what seat I want when I cant even get it when I book months in advance? Once onboard it was quite stuffy and hot. Surprisingly they did serve a meal. The return was ok but the cabin crew were pretty rude and unfriendly. I wouldn't recommend Aeromexico unless you looking for a cheap flight and have no expectation.

MEX-MIA on a Boeing 737-800. Full flight and despite this the airline manages to board everyone very quickly. The crew of Aeromexico have a very high Uniform standard and are very professional. On this 2.5 hour flight I was offered a complete breakfast drinks including alcoholic drinks newspapers and headphones. Their Hub in Mexico City is definitely the best terminal in North America.

### Aeromexico customer review
YUL-MEX one way. Aeromexico is the only airline to have a direct flight from Montreal to Mexico City. 5 hours flight very disappointed being the first time flying with them. The aircraft a 737-800 looked very tired and dirty no personal ICE what am I doing here staff food so so at least the cabin was almost empty so I was able to stretch my legs through the flight to not get bored at all. As usual some people are luckier than others in my case it turned not a nice experience. At least we arrived almost on time.

### Aeromexico customer review
Despite booking two tickets together my pregnant wife and I were given separate seats. On a return flight from Madrid to Mexico city. After asking three staff member there was nothing to do according to them. On board we had asked for special food and again no sign of it. On the way back we called in advance to have a front row seat and staff at the telephone were helpful but while checking in at the airport we found ourselves in a back seat. Again the special meal was nowhere to be seen. In the future I will try to avoid using this company.

SAT-MEX-OAX. From San Antonio to Mexico City flight was good. From Mexico City to Oaxaca we got on board on time then had to wait almost an hour and a half for 3 more passengers. 3 people making 100+ people wait. Flight back from OAX-MEX-SAT Oaxaca to Mexico was fine. From Mexico City to San Antonio we arrive at our gate at 7.13 flight was scheduled to leave at 7.10. Aeromexico representative made no effort to try and communicate our situation to the flight crew made no effort to try and help us reschedule a flight simply turned away. Had to go talk to another rep who let us know that since we booked our flight online she couldn't sell us another ticket until I got in touch with the online site and figured out their procedure. I have no phone in Mexico and no Internet which made this extremely difficult. Never flying Aeromexico again.

### Aeromexico customer review
Airport staff refused to relay flight information in English to all English speaking customers. Mexico City airport is poorly labelled and difficult to find your way around. When we asked staff for help or directions we were given different directions each time. Since we has a 12 delay due to yet another flight cancellation we tested this hypothesis on a 7 staff members. When we originally selected our flights to Costa Rica this airline offered the best route. Flight times were great no more than 2 hour layovers and we were to reach our destination in less than 9 hours. By the time this airline finished canceling and delaying all our flights it took us over 30 hours to reach our destination. Total fight time was only 6.5 hours. Plus we were given immigration documentation in Spanish only and told it didn't come in English.

GRU-MEX-LAX roundtrip. GRU-MEX on B777-200 comfortable aircraft good legroom individual but limited IFE. Offered complimentary alcoholic beverages but meals were inedible. MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle. That means if you are travelling with relatives or acquaintances boarding will have to be individual. If you consider connecting through Mexico City be aware that no matter the destination is you will have to go through immigration and customs. So think twice if your final destination is the US.

### Aeromexico customer review
Our flight was from Cancun to Mexico City then to LAX. The airport terminal was extremely warm and the flight left late. Not sure what the problem was but it was very hot on both flights. Since our flight left Cancun late we had to run from one gate to the other in order to not miss our connecting flight. So of course since we barely made our flight our bags didn't we were told our luggage would be delivered the next morning - well it is almost 8 pm and still no luggage. Not sure I would ever fly Aeromexico again.

### Aeromexico customer review
Business from TIJ-CUN with family. After the flight was delayed for 2 hrs in TIJ with no explanation the ground crew had the audacity to ask me why we were late to catch the CUN flight. Seats were very uncomfortable for Biz class no leg room and the pitch hardly had any angle. My neck was hurting after couple of hrs. Food awful. FA's couldn't care less attitude made this 6 hrs trip unbearable.

I flew to San Jose Costa Rica from SFO via Mexico City. The first leg was extremely hot as the AC was turned off. However the subsequent legs were good. Beer was free and so were the meals. Overall the service was much better than American domestic airlines.

### Aeromexico customer review
My husband and I were delayed in Guadalajara by 1.25 hours because of engine problems which meant we would miss our connection in Puerta Vallarta to Calgary with WestJet. Aeromexico ground staff in Guad made it possible for us to catch our connecting flight. We were met in P.V. on the tarmac and were personally escorted through the airport rushed through immigration phone calls were made to ensure that our luggage had been transferred and we made it onto the WestJet flight with only 5 minutes to spare. We had a hotel and rental car booked and paid for in Calgary so we had to get there and we did.

### Aeromexico customer review
LAX-MEX-GRU in Business. Very fast check-in at LAX however the lounge wasn't open which was awkward. Flight to MEX was comfortable however the flight attendant couldn't be bothered to do anything with the meal and the omelette was served cold. Club Premier lounge in DF was great with food wine and showers. Flight to Sao Paulo was average food was great however I didn't think the seat was as comfortable as LAN. All in all decent - much better than an American airline to S America.

### Aeromexico customer review
Excellent fast and efficient. Flew JFK-MEX on their red-eye flight. Did Web check-in and made a quick baggage drop. Movie and two TV episodes as inflight entertainment. A nice sandwich for midnight snack/dinner. Early Departure and early arrival to MEX. Bags were already waiting in carrousel after arrival.

### Aeromexico customer review
Booked a direct flight from Miami to Cancun 6 months in advance. Shocked to learn a week before the trip that the flight was changed to have a layover in Mexico city. Now the flight turned into a 8 hour trip. Despite never advising of the change Aeromexico had the audacity to try to charge a $150 cancellation fee. On the connecting plane I spoke to other passengers who gave similar or even worse stories. Some said the website still showed a direct flight from their destinations even though it had changed.

MEX-MAD 777 in Business Class! Fast and efficient check-in quick security checkpoint crossing and amazing VIP Lounge! Efficient Priority boarding and onboard nice big lie flat "pod" seats! Very good IFE and delicious food with nice staff. Nice quiet smooth flight with lots of entertainment.

Great service from Houston to San Pedro Sula in Honduras. Great staff friendly and helpful employees and easy to navigate Terminal 2 in Mexico City and Terminals D and E/F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico City to Merida Dec 25. Was not allowed to choose a seat when purchasing a ticket not during online check-in either and at the airport I was told the plane and seats were full. I was stuck by the window with the wall sloping inward - I am a large wide-shouldered man. Flights were torturous as was waiting on the tarmac for 30-40 minutes with no explanation as to why. No food or entertainment available.

### Aeromexico customer review
MEX-LAX Dec 2011. Business/First poor boarding seat cramped meal was a bad ham sandwich. Plane was a 737-700 that was late departing. As we approached LAX there was fog and we were told we were going to Tijuana. On arrival at Tijuana passengers told we would be flown back to Mexico City. As a few passengers complained we were eventually let off the plane but told we were 'on our own'. Airline did not care less and said they had no responsibility for the situation. Bags took 30 minutes to show up. The product was bad to start with but the whole experience was just awful. Ended up taking a taxi to San Diego and then having to drive myself to LA.

### Aeromexico customer review
I have flown 4 Aeromexico flights in the past 6 months two roundtrips from Mexico City to Chicago and all 4 flights were excellent. One flight left 30 minutes late yet managed to arrive on time. The others left on time and arrived either on time or early. Newspapers and either breakfast or a light lunch onboard. Very friendly flight crews. No problems at all.

### Aeromexico customer review
MEX-MAD. Flight left on time. Aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 in a very good condition. Cabin looked spacious and clean. Seat was ok but sleeping was not easy as it was angled. Moreover the config was 2-3-2 so if sat in the middle and pax next to you are asleep you have to jump over them. AVOD system was reliable. The food was tasty as Aeromexico have started a new collaboration with a group of chefs. There was also an express dining option for those of us who wanted to sleep. The crew were attentive and helpful with high uniform standards. They responded effectively to customer needs and were constantly through the cabin offering drinks and top ups. Two hours before landing breakfast was served. Flight landed in MAD on time. Great flight and exceeded expectations.

### Aeromexico customer review
SFO-OAX roundtrip via MEX. Outbound the 12.40 am departure time became 4.30 am due to a crew issue. The plane was an older 737. The EmPower jacks at our seats were dead and there was grime on the hard part of the seat. There was no special meal service for business class - everybody got a small ham and cheese sandwich. The front toilet quickly got foul but that didn't stop a steady stream of coach passengers coming up front for it. The FA's were nowhere to be seen. AM has no connections/transfers desks for international arriving passengers at MEX. We instead had to go out to the airport lobby and stand in line for an hour at the ticket counter for a rebooking of our missed connection to OAX. Staff working in the ticketing lobby were rude. On the return flight to SFO it was the same older plane and yes the same type of ham sandwich for dinner. Only highlight of flying AM was that we ended up spending a lot of time at the Salon Premier lounges in T2 which were nice though filled to the gills.

MAD-MEX Economy class. Check in was a bit disorganized in Terminal 1 of Madrid. Terminal was very busy due to the summer holidays no sitting at the gate Terminal 1 has very poor services for travellers. Boarding was on time and done in a very organized way. Legroom was reasonable food was very nice and service was outstanding. Cabin crews were very polite and caring. Landing on time. Baggage came with 15 mins delay due to a shortage in transporting vehicles.

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico City to Narita thru Tijuana. At check-in I requested for check-thru for my baggage but the man in the counter said it is not possible. I got alarmed when my other colleagues (we were in a group reservation) baggage were checked-thru. I had to recall from baggage and made to baggage drop for check-thru to Manila via Narita. Mexico City to Tijuana leg we were assigned a seat number - 14E which did not exist. So they found us seats on row 22. When we reached Tijuana we stayed on board and we asked if we needed to change seats as we were given boarding pass with different seat assignments. Again I was assigned seat 12A which still does not exist in the plane. We were made to sit in other seats and we had to bring our blankets and earphones because they do not issue fresh ones. We had connecting flights in Narita for our trip to Manila. When we got to Manila our baggage did not come with us. For 2 days we tracked our delayed baggage and learned they were not loaded apparently when we left Mexico.

### Aeromexico customer review
We were traveling to San Luis Potosi from Phoenix. Check in took 1.5 hours we got 5 seats two or 3 rows separated from each other (3 kids 47 and 10). We relied on the kindness of people on the plane to get all the seats together. For delays we lost the connection flight to SLP in Mexico City and we got a flight next day (18 hours later from our original). I asked for compensation for the hotel expenses We got nothing but the worst is that at the next day We just find out that local passengers got hotel expenses and we were international. I am going to use this airline.

### Aeromexico customer review
A comedy of errors! Two days after the switchover to the SABRE reservation system check-in was still delayed a lot because they never trained their staff on the new system! My SAT-MEX flight left and arrived two hours late. There was no announcement of the cause for the delay. It took the agents about 10 minutes to check a passenger. As passengers finally trickled to the gate there was no agent and no sign confirming that this was an Aeromexico departure gate - and there was no plane. On the return May 29 things were still a bit slow that's when the agent told me that she had arrived at work on May 22 to find totally new screens on which she had received no training. The system also told them (on May 29) that I hadn't paid when in fact it was a prepaid Expedia ticket. Apparently they had changed the flight number right as they were switching systems and my reservation was not transferred correctly. After my flight boarded they announced that the co-pilot hadn't arrived! Hence a half-hour delay. Totally amateurish performance throughout by this airline which I will try to avoid flying.

MIA-MEX roundtrip on Boeing 737-800 both legs. Crew professional offering drinks and refills. Hot breakfast on morning flight and full meal on afternoon flight back. I was offered a headset and newspapers. Both flights on time.

### Aeromexico customer review
LHR-CDG-MEX-MZT. Last leg AeroMexico MEX-MZT ground staff in MEX unhelpful checked in as soon as possible and still couldn't get us seats together (only two of us) for any of our connections. Trying to submit comments to their customer service afterwards gets you no where except repeated automated messages and there is no customer service number you can reach from the UK. I would never fly them again if there was an alternative.

### Aeromexico customer review
AGU-MEX-JFK E170/B737-800 in economy plus. Aeromexico had the lowest walk-up fare and still acceptable connection in Mexico City. Onboard service professional occasionally smiling and frequently offering beverages. T2 Terminal in MEX is comfortable and acceptable eating and other amenities. MEX-JFK a hot meal and beverages incl alcohol and newspapers/magazines. FAs were curt. The only downside to AM is that they are rarely competitive on fares relative to American Airlines CO and US on advance purchases.

### Aeromexico customer review
MIA-MEX on Boeing 737 and MEX-DGO on Embraer 190. Clean modern aircraft. Served breakfast and drinks by friendly flight crew. Flights on time and terminal 2 in Mexico city airport out is amazing.

### Aeromexico customer review
When I called the customer service representative to voice my displeasure with my flight the representative was rude while speaking and even hung up on me. He offered no help and even attempted to mock me. As beautiful as Cancun was I would never go back if my only option was to fly AeroMexico. Cheap flights means cheap service and even worse customer assistance.

### Aeromexico customer review
SJO-SAT. Supposed to leave SJO and be home by 3:30pm on Saturday. Did not arrive home until Monday at 3.30 pm. This airline was a joke. The first day they had us wait in the airport for 12 hours only to tell us we wouldn't be able to leave. The next day our flight was delayed due to a flight attendant not having correct documentation to leave the country. Due to the delay half the flight missed their connections in Mexico City causing another overnight stay. We were never offered a refund for the flight or any inconvenience it caused.

### Aeromexico customer review
Had difficulty finding anyone that spoke understandable English. Luggage didn't make a flight in Mexico City then was delivered to hotel in Cancun. All luggage from group of 10 traveling the same route had been completely ransacked with items stolen. On return trip Aeromexico customer service was a joke and did not tell me I should check an item in Cancun that was too large to fit in luggage. Flight attendant helped place it during the first flight. It was then confiscated in Mexico City due to different security standards there. Mexico City airport was also a nightmare.

### Aeromexico customer review
IAH-MEX-IAH economy. First leg on B738 and E190 on the way back. Comfortable flights given that I had cheapest economy ticket and got seated in premium seat in the front of the aircraft on an outbound flight. Some breakfast items on quite a short flights were a nice touch and crew were friendly. Good value for money.

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico-Lima flight was really bad and service terribles. They serve you just a meal and after the crew disappear - no movies and music program was not working well. Boeing 737-800 and for six hour flight is a narrow plane.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flight was switch around twice. First was delay the flight 7 hrs then the early fight I had at 7am was pushed back 3hrs with no phone call. Communication is important and so is time. The flight you book is tentative so don't be surprised if you book a flight and end up with a flight at a different time.

### Aeromexico customer review
Flew Aeromexico five times during a recent trip to Cuba and Mexico. All five flights had significant delays with complete abdication of responsibility by airline staff who lied to and misled passengers. flight from Havana to Mexico City was delayed by 24 hrs with the ground staff in Havana clueless on the reason for the delay for the first four hours. Shabby treatment of all passengers the next day with no water or food. Flight back to Mexico City was 2hr s45min - and we were served peanuts. Crew unfriendly do not like to smile.

### Aeromexico customer review
Cancun to Mexico City Business Class. Flight slightly delayed but compensated for by being able to check luggage to onward British Airways flight to London. Crew attentive and professional. Cold lunch very average. Easy to get to Terminal 1 using the air train and despite the information on Mexico City Airport website there were plenty of people with more than just hand luggage - they do check your e-ticket though (didn't need boarding card).

### Aeromexico customer review
Mexico City - Cancun return. Clean modern 737 aircraft that departed on time professional bi-lingual flight attendants. Inflight service consisted of just a drink service (with free booze) and a pack of peanuts. Their terminal 2 at Mexico City is a beautiful modern facility. Its just a shame they don't offer online check in or self service check in.

### Aeromexico customer review
LAX-Acapulco via MEX. We booked via Delta so expected to pay for baggage and have no meals. But Aeromexico baggage still free and nice meals on long leg of trip both ways. Drink and snack on 35 minute Acapulco-MEX leg. Staff were charming and helpful. We had a delay leaving Acapulco and the agent who checked us in for the flight came and told us that the flight was delayed leaving Mexico City. He had rebooked our flight to LAX and changed our baggage claim tags. We both had first class seats assigned. Unfortunately we both found the new first class seat design on the 737-800 torturous. The headrest appears to have been designed for crash test dummies. We had been much more comfortable in our coach seats.

### Aeromexico customer review
CDG-MEX-PVR and PVR-MEX. I was disappointed by the service from Cabin crew. On previous trips crew were friendly and talked to passenger. CDG-PVR leg operated by a reconfigured 767 with expanded Business class cabin. Flew economy - seat was ok but with no foot-rest. MEX-PVR-MEX operated by EM-145's they only had one cabin attendant. I had no real issue apart from the fact the crew were not that friendly.

### Aeromexico customer review
LAX to PVR. It's unethical to say the least. AeroMexico had a good selection of non-stop flights from LAX to PVR. Seats were more expensive than connecting flights on the U.S. based airlines. We were willing to pay extra for the non-stop flight. A week before our departure AeroMexico moved us to an indirect flight connecting through Mexico City. Our only other option was accepting a voucher from AeroMexico and rebooking on another airline at our own expense. Due to the short notice all flights (even connecting) were two to three times more expensive than they were when we had originally purchased the tickets. The annoyance doesn't end there. In Mexico City we only had one hour to change planes. Normally this would be easy. We didn't know we had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people already in line. Needless to say we missed our connection. We waited all day in the airport for another flight that had seats available.

### Aeromexico customer review
MEX-LIM. Nice and fast check-in procedures inside the beautiful Aeromexico lounge at new Terminal 2. Flight operated by a freshly re-painted B737-800 - first time I experience an almost 6 hour flight on this kind of plane but the interior was clean and confortable so this was not a big issue. The only problem was that we were at row 12 just before the emergency exit so our seats would not recline for safety reasons: I would have appreciated to be informed about that before the assignment! Meal was served very early (6pm) considering mexican habits but I did not eat so I cannot judge. Crew polite even if not very friendly. We arrived at Lima half an hour ahead of schedule. Overall a positive experience but the price could have been more competitive (we paid EUR 1.000 for two economy tickets).

### Aeromexico customer review
All planes were hot and stuffy. But their customer service is completely ridiculous. We had 2 checked bags going from Mexico City to Seattle they lost one of them. We reported it missing and then called the next day and they said they had no report and couldn't find the package. They gave us numbers to phones where no one would answer and were completely apathetic. Once they finally found the luggage they then shipped it 5 hours away from our home instead of to the Portland airport which is 15 minutes away. Then they lost the baggage in Yakima! Turns out they shipped it to Canada - still working on getting it back.
