### "The crew were awesome"
Ryanair flight operated by Lauda Europe, was on time. Leg-room wasn't great, but was only just slightly worse than the same route with Austrian Airlines. The crew were awesome - a special shout-out to the female crew member who managed the ice-in-the-cup situation for me. I would happily fly this airline again - it's about the same as Austrian Airlines, except you don't get a free (small) chocolate. Recommended!

### "worst European budget airline"
Honestly this now has to be the worst European budget airline. Actually booked with Ryanair but Lauda is the carrier. Sat on the tarmac an hour while they tried to fix a fault, then deplaned us all with a “Hope you have a nice”, and then nothing for hours - nobody to help, no explanations, no updates. Never again.

### "the crew was amazing"
Not Verified | This was an unexpected surprise due to my family thinking that we were going to fly Ryanair, however in my opinion it was a pleasant surprise. I have a really bad fear of flying so an incredibly nice cabin crew member sat next to me and told me that she loved flying and how long she had done it for and how safe it was. She also said that she really enjoyed flying and the turbulence was enjoyable. The seats were nice and the crew was amazing. I didn’t get any food but I loved this low cost airline.

### "We don't recommend Laudamotion"
Not Verified |  Malaga to Dusseldorf. Regarding our return flight with Laudamotion departing from Malaga. We tried to contact 2 days in advance with both airline and ticket provider. Both agencies did not respond by phone or mail. Wednesday morning on March 18th, we went to the airport anyway and our flight was not even mentioned on the information boards! I understand all the commotion surrounding the coronavirus, but it is shameful that customers are not informed at all and are simply left to their own fate. Ultimately, we were helped by Ryanair with a flight to Amsterdam. The next day we Picked up our car in Düsseldorf. We don't recommend Laudamotion at all!

### "hours without receiving a reply"
Malaga to Stuttgart. I would like to preface this saying that I have flown with Laudamotion in the past and have no issues with my flying experience. My review refers to the complete lack of customer support and response following the Corona-induced flight cancellations. For several days now I have been applying to receive a refund for my cancelled flight. Both the app and online refund request page have error messages and do not allow me to proceed. According to the online request page the reference number is wrong (it's the only reference number listed on my ticket confirmation). According to the app there's just a general error. I have attempted to contact Laudamotion and Ryanair via their chat option and have waited hours without receiving a reply. The phone numbers appear not to be working. While I understand that we are in a crisis situation, the airline's number one priority should be maintaining customer satisfaction. And cancelling our flights without guaranteeing us our money back completely neglects this. I will be giving a rating of 1/10 until the airline refunds me my money. I recommend that people with similar experiences do the same.

### "pay 10€ for a ticket"
Vienna to Bologna. Don´t ask for water on the plane. Horrible experience on Laudamotion, but this is what you get if you pay 10€ for a ticket. We got stuck after boarding and I was thirsty, basically I had to ask three times while stuck on the ground for a bottle of water at 7.00am, once I´ve obtained the  water I wanted to pay by card but this was not possible just in the air I would have had the chance to pay and when I handled the only cash note, a 100, it was refused by the staff and I had to wait until we took off to pay. Once we were landing, I saw that my seat was falling apart in the back. Of course, If I can last minute afford another carrier with still a cheap flight ticket, I do…

### "not to press the service button"
Dusseldorf to Alicante. Two and a half hours late due to late incoming aircraft excuse, but then we had to stand for at least three minutes in the rain on the steps to the aircraft. I ordered coffee and snacks for my group and when I tried to pay by credit card was told the the machine didn't work. Could have told me before I ordered. No milk and sugar was given, I like it black and bitter anyway, but the rest of the group asked for some. My coffee was only half full and after waiting five minutes I pressed the service button and asked for it to be filled. It was, and I was told not to press the service button again unless it was an emergency? I never heard that before. The milk and sugar for the rest of the group never came.

### "had to clean it ourselves"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Lisbon. Awful service, besides being delayed, when we found our seats, it had garbage from previous passengers. We ask the staff to clean it and they said that we had to clean it ourselves.

### "This was supposed to be a direct flight"
I travelled with Laudamotion 19th December from Tenerife to Vienna. First our flight was delayed 2 hours. We were waiting behind the passport control for 2 hours without the chance to go to the toilet and a lot of kids were traveling with us and without place to sit down so almost everyone sat down on the floor in the end. This was supposed to be a direct flight, but because they had to swap their cabin crew, right after taking off we were told of that we need to stop in Mallorca. There we were sitting on the plane for one hour. We arrived in Vienna 3.5 hours later than expected, so I missed the bus for which I bought a ticket two months ago. I struggled to get another bus home to the Czech Republic as all the tickets were already sold out. In the end I had to wait 3 hours more at the airport in Vienna. I managed to take midnight bus. Since then I have been trying to solve this with the company, but so far without a solution as no one is replying.

### "flight went smoothly up to Oslo"
We had an early flight out of Vienna, we bought fast track, cause we were not sure about how long the lines were, and there were a lot of departures. We arrived into the airport, and long lines in front of security. An officer opened up fast track for everybody, but we were pretty lucky, only around 10 people in front of us. We left on time, and the flight went smoothly up to Oslo Torp. What i do not understand is why the crew is not interested in selling their products. They said something about offers, we did not hear, and they went through the isle, with their trolley. We asked to buy a whiskey, they had only brought perfume and cosmetics with them, they said they should come back to us, which they did not. We asked him another time later, and he said ,oh yes, then still nothing, and we landed without any whiskey. We could not see they had not sold anything on their way down the isle.

### "arrived almost three hours late"
Friday afternoon flight from Sandefjord Torp to Vienna. Very few people in lines before security, so we went through in a couple of minutes. We sat there waiting, and then plane delayed. One and a half hour delay. The plane came and the boarding took time cause every passenger shall stow away two or three pieces of luggage, plus jackets, caps, scarfs etc. We bought priority boarding, but that is a joke, we all stood in the same line for boarding, you can bring an extra bag though. The plane had to deice, so that delayed the flight further. After takeoff, the crew turn up the temperature in the cabin, so they can work in short arm shirts. All the passengers had to take off the pullovers in the narrow cabin. We arrived in Vienna almost three hours late.

### "do not recommend this airline"
I flew yesterday with my wife and my children from Skavsta to Düsseldorf with Laudamotion OE195 and it all started with it being only 1h 30min late when the flight that was to arrive landed late. We boarded and were already tired and annoyed by the long wait and it was late at night. The personnel on the plane were unpleasant and foolish from the start, and had no respect. When I then sat in my seat and when the plane started to lift, I wanted to sleep for a while before serving began. I then wanted to buy something to drink and asked about it to the flight attendant but she replied unpleasantly that there were many who had ordered the same drink and that there might not be. She then ignored to check if there were and continued with her advertising for the other products they sell onboard. I then pressed the button that calls for staff because I fly often and know that you can press it if you want something and then a flight attendant came who took my order and would come with it immediately. Then the female flight attendant came from earlier and scolded me for pushing the button and that it is forbidden and a big problem to press it and that I had already talked to her about the drink I wanted. I didn't know that you can't press the button and it says nowhere about it either, but I apologized for it and just wanted something to drink. They were already delayed with the flight and then they were unpleasant onboard and it was really unruly and poor customer service. This is the first and last time I fly with Laudamotion and I really do not recommend this airline to anyone. Really bad and worst airline due to staff. But want to point out that the pilot did an incredibly good job and was impressively good at landing that you barely noticed it. Jag flög igår med min fru och mina barn från skavsta till düsseldorf med Laudamotion OE195 och det hela började med att den var först 1h 30min försenad då flyget som skulle ankomma landade sent. Vi steg ombord och var redan trötta och irriterad över den långa väntetiden och det var sent på kvällen. Personalen på planet var otrevlig och taskiga redan från start mot alla och hade ingen respekt. När jag sedan satt på min plats och när planet började lyfta så ville jag sova en stund innan serveringen började. Jag ville sedan köpa något att dricka och frågade om det till flygvärdinnan men hon svarade otrevligt med att det var många som hade beställt samma dricka och att det kanske inte finns. Hon sedan struntade i att kolla om det fanns och fortsatte med sin reklam för dom andra produkter dom säljer onbord. Jag tryckte sedan på knappen som kallar på personal för jag flyger ofta och vet att man kan trycka på den om man vill ha något och då kom en flygvärd som tog min beställning och skulle komma med det strax. Då kom den kvinnliga flygvärdinnan från tidigare och skällde ut mig för jag tryckte på knappen och att det är förbjudet samt ett stort problem att man trycker på den och att jag redan hade pratat med henne om drickan jag ville ha. Jag visste inte att man inte får trycka på knappen och det står ingenstans om det heller men jag bad om ursäkt för det och ville bara ha något att dricka. Dom vart redan försenade med flyget och sen är dom otrevliga onbord och det var verkligen oproffsigt och dålig kundservice. Detta är första och sista gången jag flyger med Laudamotion och jag rekommenderar verkligen inte detta flygbolag till någon. Verkligen dåligt och sämsta flygbolaget pågrund av personalen. Men vill påpeka att piloten gjorde ett otroligt bra jobb och var imponerande duktig på att landa att man knappt märkte det.

### "an absolute ordeal"
Vienna to Edinburgh with Laudamotion. This airline and its parent Ryanair is disgraceful. I understand that cheap flights are cheap for a reason, but I find it unacceptable to list 1 price on the flight comparison platforms and leave the extra fees hidden somewhere in the airline's Ts&Cs. First of all you need to pay at least 7-9€ if you want to reserve a seat anywhere apart from the middle section, or get "randomly allocated" next to the toilet. Then, you are only allowed to bring a handbag on board, unless you pay 14€ to take an extra bag to store in the overhead bins, which other airlines don't charge for. Of course, if you forget to read what the airline defines as "a small bag" you can cough up 25€ at the gate. Also, if you wait to purchase the additional baggage option until check-in for the return flight, be prepared to pay 20€ for 10kg of checked baggage because they carry on option is "sold out". Adding everything up, you most likely end up spending more than sticking to one of the established players. Now to the experience itself. First of all, priority boarding that is kindly added to the extra carry on baggage option meant that passengers were allowed to wait for 30 minutes in the bus without any explanation or apology. Of course, the seats are about as comfortable as a wooden board and are made to fit half an anorexic teenager. Also, forget getting any rest as you are reminded on a half-hourly basis to purchase overprized perfume and lottery tickets. All they do is force decent airlines to move into higher price segments to cater to business customers, while affordable flying is turning into an absolute ordeal. Nobody should have to pay to suffer through this kind of experience and get ripped off every which way possible

### "Bad experience"
Seville to Vienna. I was “lucky” enough to fly with Lauda two times. Firstly it was delayed with 45 minutes than at the way to home more than 70 minutes. Also, with the extra charges of the bags (if you do not buy extra luggage it is only allowed to bring a small cabin bag) it became almost the same as Ryanair. Bad experience I do not recommend it. But, at least the staff is friendly.

### "no customer service"
Not Verified | Vienna to Dublin. Where shall I start! Sat in seat 30D, waited over 1.5 hours to get inflight food, was last to be served because of the seat. Ordered a meal deal and waited and waited at least 20 minutes no sign of it. We were descending at this point asked the very rude hostess where my meal was and she said she would check. Once again 10 minutes went be no dinner €10.00 paid at this stage had a packet of crisps and a 7 up unopened. Requested a refund as we were about to land told could not be done and she said to bring it with you! Requested supervisor told too busy to speak with me and given a €6.00 refund after paying €10.00 ! The cabin crew have to be among the rudest, unprofessional people I have ever dealt with on a flight and certainly no customer service lot of work to be done to retrain. I do expect a reply to this as to the reasons for such incompetence.

### "staff are really friendly"
Vienna to Stuttgart. I fly regularly with Laudamotion, about two times a month. I never had any problems either with the ground staff nor the air hostesses. You have to be sure about their bag policies, otherwise you have to pay high charges. I never had any problems. The Online check-in via the Laudamotion app always works well. You have to be sure that you're going to be charged for anything extra than the personal item and the seat, but if you don't need a lot it's a really good and cheap option (especially if you book in advance). The staff are really friendly. In my opinion it's equal to other low cost airlines like Eurowings.

### "always a hidden fee"
Vienna to Oslo. There is always a hidden fee with this company. Stay away at all costs! 55 Euro for them to print your boarding card. The card did not work at the gate, and they were unwilling to help me get through as the barcode did not work.

### "charged extra for cabin bag"
Not Verified |  Eindhoven to Vienna. Was charged extra for cabin bag. It fit all the usual requirements (dimensions, weight) but the staff at the gate insisted that 1 small bag is something smaller. Rather than missing my flight I just paid the extra. Than my cabin bag was to be put in the storage so I only had what could fit in my hands with me. Quite a way to end a holiday. Never flying Laudamotion again.

### "treatment I received was not appropriate"
Stuttgart to Milan with Laudamotion. They charged me for my hand luggage in spite of showing it fitted in the measuring box. They said I had two bags (the second one was bought in the airport). Besides, the 25 euros were not written anywhere and my flight ticket said I could take this size in. If over luggage I should have paid 50 not 25 (according to my ticket). That's to say they did nothing alike the boarding pass. I asked to pay by card and they insisted on cash. I could not get any receipt. They said I would have it on my email. I m still waiting but payments do not work like that in any case. The treatment I received was not appropiate for a traveller and client. I was treated as if I was trying to avoid the rules when I think they made them up!

### "Absolutely no legroom"
Vienna to Dublin return. To put the positive points in the first place, the planes on both flights were very clean and on board staff very friendly and professional. On the outbound flight, just a couple of weeks after booking, we were informed it would depart 6 hrs later than initially foreseen. without any reason being given for that. However, we decided to stay booked on that flight, as we had hotels etc. already booked. On the day of the flight itself in the end the flight was delayed another 1:45 hrs, again with no reason given at the gate (which was btw. very cramped, had no airconditioning and no seating available). At the return flight, check-in was with Ryanair and very chaotic with no staff available to assist. Absolutely no legroom on both flights.

### "flight was great"
Stuttgart to Split. The flight was great. We did the Check In online so when we arrived at the airport we immediately went thru the security check and then to the gate. Boarding went smoothly and the seats were okay, the same as Eurowings. We had a delay because of the Thunderstorm but that was ok. We didn't pay much money for the tickets about 60€. The crew was nice. I flew with my hand luggage because I heard many people had problems with their suitcases with Laudamotion so I would recommend flying with only hand luggage.

### "very disappointed with LaudaMotion"
Copenhagen to Vienna. I am very disappointed with LaudaMotion. Round trip (2 adults, 4 children). Online Check In did not work (the app did not accept my passport number anyway, so the check in could not be completed). Check-in at the airport was then only possible with enormous additional costs! Airplane, especially the toilets, dirty. I'm sure not going to travel with LaudaMotion anymore. Ich bin sehr enttäuscht von LaudaMotion. Rundreise (2 Erwachsene, 4 Kinder). Online Check In funktionierte nicht (die App akzeptierte warum auch immer??? meine Reisepassnummer nicht und so konnte der Check In nicht abgeschlossen werden). Check-in am Flughafen war dann nur mehr mit enormen Mehrkosten möglich! Flugzeug, vor allem die Toiletten, schmutzig. Werde mit Sicherheit nicht mehr mit LaudaMotion reisen.

### "disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Vienna. First time I took Laudamotion and the inflight service from the start is the worst. From not able to accept debit cards, to local Romanian currency to zero smile from the inflight crew, this airline takes the first place in lousy service. While the ground crew were brilliant and extraordinarily helpful, the inflight crew seems to consist of staff who lack even the basic courtesy of airline greetings. Well, laudamotion is all about being economical- including customer service. An absolutely disappointing experience.

### "the absolute worst flight company"
I am flying 2-8 times a month regularly and this is the absolute worst flight company I have ever travelled with. Almost all other flight companies have online check-in until 2 hours before flight, I have arrived later than this without checking in many times with many different airlines and I have never had any issues. Almost all other airlines send emails reminding you to check in online if it’s imporant, Laudamotion sends no email and there is no information in my travel itinerary that I need to check in 3 hours before online and that there is no possibility to check in at the airport. Arriving at the airport there is no information about where to go, what to do, where to pay. I was advised to go stand in one line, was waiting a long time, turns out I should have been in a completely different line (in a place where Laudamotion wasn’t even mentioned?). A googling gave me no information from the company itself but I found out through other people who had suffered the same that the check in fee at the airport was 55€! I was prepared to pay the extra fee (even though I find it ridiculous) but in the end I ended up missing my flight because of these lines and the bad directions of where to go.

### "cabin was very dirty"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Dublin. Flying with Laudamotion means low comfort, you cannot expect a lot. At least I would be happy if the staff would be friendly, the cabin clean and the overall onboard-experience would be good. The staff was very unmotivated and not really friendly. The cabin was very dirty, sticky seats and broken tables. Food and drinks had to be purchased which is okay, but the service was very inefficient and slow. Boarding was slow and chaotic - long waiting times at the gate, in the stairhouse, outside the building and again in front of the stairs of the aircraft.

### "Had a bad experience"
Bucharest to Vienna. Had a bad experience flying with this airline a month or two ago, but gave LM another chance. The dirt cheap tickets were a factor. Flight started boarding 45mins late, now stuck on the tarmac for 50 mins. On the flight to Bucharest the electronic booking system shut down. They had to check in everybody manually, which took ages. This airline is a joke.

### "it is superb value for money"
Very nice flight with Laudamotion from Dublin to Vienna. Flight left on time, the seat was comfy, even though the plane was showing it's age a bit. Boarding was on time, funnily, the priority line, (which lets you take two bags rather than one) was a lot longer than the standard line. I just found this funny. The crew were very kind and friendly. I have only one complaint, and that is that Debit cards are not excepted, and I only had one of these cards, and no cash. But the flight attendant was very kind, and offered to get me some water. Overall, friendly service, nice flight, efficient and friendly, and for only £32, it is superb value for money.

### "Another great flight"
Another great flight with Laudamotion from Budapest to Stuttgart. I have very low expectations for these flights, as they are so cheap. This one cost me just £11, which is superb value. The flight crew were kind, I purchased some wine onboard for a very reasonable price. Crew were friendly and professional. I really enjoyed it, cheap and cheerful, very friendly crew, and a nice ride.

### "they have been most unhelpful"
I purchased an extra leg-room seat for my flight as my knee doesn't handle being bent for long periods of time well (but this does not affect my movement levels nor is it visible). I was shocked to note that the seat I was shown as extra leg-room during check-in was not in fact one. I was told nothing could be done on the flight and that I should contact customer support for a refund. I have done so but in the month that has passed since my first contact they have been most unhelpful, first responding with reasons for my seat allocation that were simply untrue and then requesting that I provide them with my boarding pass I cannot access anymore. The service overall is awful and I would not recommend it to anyone.

### "Lousy customer service"
Not Verified |  Copenhagen to Vienna. Not a good experience. Lousy customer service with several changes of conditions in the time between reservation and flight, leaving the burden with the customer. I had booked a flight from Copenhagen to Vienna (with Laudamotion) and went from there on to Innsbruck (with Austrian Airlines). In the time span between buying the tickets and the actual trip the airline changed the departure time twice, so what was supposed to be an early evening flight ended up being an afternoon flight. The main problem, however, was that they suddenly changed their baggage policy, not allowing customers to bring their hand baggage onboard but requiring check-in - and, what is worse, making it necessary to collecting the cabin luggage from the carousel at the destination airport. The consequences were: 1) Many customers had not heard about the policy change, so people unaware of the new policy queued up at the gate, causing frustration, time pressure and an overall unpleasant atmosphere. 2) For people like me - with continued flights with a different airline - the new policy meant I had to run to collect my bag from the carousel (which meant leaving the transfer area and going to the exit area - which is far away), go through another security check and then run all the way back to my terminal. I was also told I would have to check in my baggage once more for the next flight. Which, btw, was the wrong information. Luckily I did not believe them - it turned out that Austrian Airlines still allowed customers to bring their cabin bags. Had I believed them, I would have spent extra time checking in my bag once more. Laudamotion's sudden change of baggage policy means that I would never have made it to my next flight - the whole procedure of collecting the baggage, checking in once more and getting back to the terminal takes A lot of time. What saved me was that Laudamotion had changed the departure time a few times - otherwise I would have missed my flight. I would not even have had a chance. I will definitely stay clear of Laudamotion in the future and can only recommend others to do the same.

### "Crew were horrific"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Vienna. The plane was very comfortable, and thankfully we had a great flight round trip. The Crew on the other hand were horrific. Languages, although the flight was from Barcelona they did not speak Spanish. My friend made the mistake of speaking to the stewardess in Spanish, and she got scolded to speak English! Since my friend didn't speak English, and it is my first language I translated for her. The stewardess that demanded to be spoken to in English had a below average level of it. I would recommend they improve their English, or find new employees. The same stewardess started moving and arranging bags and coats without letting the owner of the things she was moving were she was moving it to. When we arrived in Vienna people were looking for their belongings. On our way back, I asked a stewardess if she could put my coat in the overhead bin after everyone was on the plane; since I was sitting on a window seat, and didn't want to take up space. She grabbed my folded coat, than stuffed it like a rag in the overhead, The same stewardess sold me a chocolate croissant and made me get it warm or she wouldn't sell it to me. When I got it after paying 2.50 euros, it tasted like a soggy piece of bread with chocolate.

### "need to do online check-in"
Paris Beauvais to Vienna. They have a deadline before flight when you need to do online check-in, otherwise, you have to pay 55€ extra for each passenger. Flight delayed 2 hours. Seats were uncomfortable,. Really dont recommend to fly with Laudamotion.

### "put my luggage under the seat"
Not Verified |  I want to complain about our Flight from Wien to Amman which was late about 30 minutes, but that wasn't that bad. But my main complain is about our flight from Amman do Wien from 23.2.19 departing time at 17:25. This plane was late almost 2 hours. When we boarded I didn't have place where to place my luggage because people placed small bags in storage place where big luggage should go. After we tried to talk to the crew to help us with that, and where we should give our luggage. She just said "I don't know, give it wherever you want. It's her job to help with that! I had to put my luggage under the seat. I don't expect them to serve champagne or something, but basic services like assisting when experiencing problems onboard should be standard!

### "fair for the price"
Vienna to Palma. Laudamotion is vary fair for the price. Each time I flew I had no issues. Flew on time - plane fleet despite the age looks fresh - crew was friendly - check in and boarding smooth. No issues at all. I have no negative experience at all, so I definitely recommend!

### "lost us as customers"
Berlin Tegel to Rijeka. We feel like we got scammed. We tried to check in online but the website said that my partner would need to visit the checking desk because she is not an EU citizen. We decided to get to the airport 3 and a half hours early to leave plenty of time for this. When we tried to check in we were told we had to wait. We waited until it was 2 hours before departure but were then told we would have to pay 110euro checking fee and that we could no longer check in online. This is more than the cost of our flights. We tried phoning customer service, but it costs money every minute, and there is a long waiting time before you can speak to someone. The people at the airport were no help and we ended up having to pay it. We feel like this system is predatory and they have now lost us as customers.

### "staff were not friendly"
Düsseldorf to Málaga. Our flight was operated by Ryanair, but at least the legroom was good. The crew and boarding staff were not friendly and did not smile for a second. We also couldn't put the back of our seats back.
