### "Everything worked out well"
The usual service everything ok. Lounge at Madrid airport is just great. Late boarding and late departure due to traffic control, arrived 15 min late. On board crew is just great, as usual, very attentive, full lunch served with open bar. Seat comfort nothing special but fine for a 3hr flight. Everything worked out well, they need to pay attention to punctuality.

### "rudest most unhelpful person"
I flew PMI - MAD today I2 1656 the check in woman was the rudest most unhelpful person I have encountered ever at a check in desk. She was insistent that I provide proof of residency in Mallorca, my resident card showing my address was insufficient. She said the confirmation email told me to bring this proof to the airport, it didn't! She refused to look at email, she refused to ask a manager to attend. Finally I was able to get an email sent to me by Calvia Town Hall which was sufficient. We very nearly missed our flight because of this awful woman. She seemed delighted to have a little bit of power. She is a disgrace and tarnishes the good name of your airline!

### "Crew really nice and worked hard"
MAD-TFN. Departed a bit late due to chaotic boarding process. But arrived on time due to shorter flight time than usual. Except for that issue, fligth went well. Crew really nice and worked hard. Seat ok, just economy with a bit recline and comfortable. They served a full warm breakfast. On board IFE available to use on you personal device, nice choice of movies/shows. Good service for the Iberia low cost carrier.

### "said that the case was closed"
We booked a flight from Porto back to the USA, with Air Europe from Porto to Madrid. It was a combo with American Airlines and Iberia. They cancel the flight when we were at the gate. We had to retrieve our suitcase from the baggage claim and stand for hours in line trying to get alternative flights. Customer service was horrible. They refused to rebook us, refuse our requests for Hotel and food vouchers and send us back with a letter that promises to cover our expenses until our flight back. We spent the night on the phone with American Airlines and Iberia where they both claimed it's the other airline responsibility to rebook the ticket. Finally, with the intervention of American Airlines, Iberia agreed to rebook our ticket. They told us that we will have to wait two additional days to get a flight back. We had to book hotel room for two nights, rent a car and spend money on food. The flight back was a nightmare as well. They made us stand in line outside the plane for a very long time. Upon our returns, I gather all the receipts and started a claim to get reimbursement for our expenses. I spent hours talking on the phone with representatives that barely spoke English, and the best offer I received after many phone calls and emails was for 10% of my total expenses. The money never came to my account, and yesterday when I spoke to Iberia representative she said that the case was closed. I asked to speak to a manager and she informed me that the manager will call me back today. No one calls me back, no money for my expenses.

### “Crew are the best”
Absolute and stunning perfection in everything. Crew are the best, wonderful and polite people who are there to make your journey a great part of your day. Please treat your crew nicely, they are literally one of the best, and I fly a lot (5-10 times a month).

### “No communication, rude customer service”
Not Verified | 2 flights cancelled and more than 24 hours late. No communication, rude customer service telephone line and pathetic attempt at compensation. Don't use this airline.

### "I recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   During the check-in, we paid a lot for having a few kilos over the weight limit. This was dissatisfying. The take-off and landing were on time. Boarding the plane was easy because it was done based on groups. Extremely skilled pilot who took off and landed very safely. We barely felt anything when the plane touched the ground. Seats were very comfortable and the AC was strong. Meals were alright given the trip's short time. I liked the entertainment system, but was disappointed to see the WIFI was only limited to it. You can't use WhatsApp for example. Overrall, my experience with Iberia Express was very positive and I recommend this airlineaw2 for a budget flight.

### "Service on board is really good"
I fly with IB express a few times a month. Usually on time or even ahead of schedule. Service on board is really good. Welcome drink, online entertainment, full meal service with really nice food. Drinks available during all flight. I truly recommend them. Only issue: the comfort of the seat. If you fly the old 320 seat comfort nonexistent, no headrest no recline. If you fly the new A321neo, seats are comfy for a 2hr flight to the Canary Islands, they do recline and have headrest. Good service for a low cost airline.

### "every week I get no answer"
Not Verified | I bought a flight in February from Madrid to London, the company canceled the flight, more than 4 months later they still have not refunded my money despite having sent emails, filing the corresponding claim and providing all the documentation that the company has requested. I call every week and every week I get no answer. | Compré un vuelo en febrero Madrid Londres, la compañía canceló el vuelo, más de 4 meses después siguen sin devolverme el dinero a pesar de haber enviado emails, poner la reclamación correspondiente y aportar toda la documentación que la compañía ha pedido. Llamo cada semana y cada semana no obtengo respuesta.

### "could not take my hand luggage on board"
Not Verified |   Because ticket had been chosen by travel agent I could not take my hand luggage on board. Traveling with laptop in my hands, as I had to collect item from hand luggage is kind of joke. Iberia most likely wish not to have passengers on board at all.

### “A fantastic experience”
A fantastic experience (and somewhat unexpected for European flights): brandnew, tidy plane, decent leg space, resaonably priced meals and punctual departure. Most strinking were the cheerful staff and a really entertaining pilot. The 3 hours flight was a breeze and a perfect start of a long weekend break. The fare (off season) was unbeatable. I would certainly fly Iberia Express again.

### “nothing good about IB express”
Worst airline in Europe! Business class on I2 (IB Express) is terrible, surly crew who were more interested in applying make up than attending passengers, 1 meal choice (in business class!) food was disgusting fish slop, my dog would have said no! Literally nothing good about IB express, in contrast my flights with Iberia mainline are fantastic, professional crew, great entertainment and restaurant Quality food. IB express should be shut down it’s a national disgrace to Spain! La peor aerolínea de Europa! La clase ejecutiva en I2 (IB Express) es terrible, tripulación hosca que estaba más interesada en maquillarse que en atender a los pasajeros, 1 opción de comida (en clase ejecutiva) la comida era un desperdicio de pescado asqueroso, mi perro habría dicho que no ! Literalmente, no hay nada bueno en IB Express; en contraste, mis vuelos con la línea principal de Iberia son fantásticos, tripulación profesional, excelente entretenimiento y restaurante. Comida de calidad. ¡IB Express debería cerrarse, es una vergüenza nacional para España!

### “Every aspect was a pleasure”
Iberia Express offered a most pleasing and efficient experience on a domestic flight between Madrid and Seville in early January 2024. Every aspect of the experience was a pleasure from the efficient website and updates via text message to the friendly check-in and boarding process and of course the inflight experience. The flight was operated on an A321 Neo. The flight was just under 1 hour and left punctually and arrived on-time. The cabin crew were friendly and very professional and operated to a clearly high level of team-work and pride in their company. I found the seats comfortable for a short flight and would certainly consider using this airline again in the future.

### "Total disgrace"
Absolute rip off - arrogant company. Flight was announced to be cancelled while everybody was in the airplane and waiting for take off. All passengers were asked to leave the plane. Further no info, nothing. We were left in the middle of the airport in the middle of the night in Amsterdam for Madrid flight. Next morning accidentally have seen same flight on the board at 10.00 am, 11 hrs after all passengers were discharged from the airplane without any further info or a contact person. No luggage was delivered. After two months of submitting complaint, airline has denied refund or compensation. As if they are 16th century pirates. Total disgrace.

### "airline is the least comfortable"
This airline is the least comfortable I have ever flown on. Seat pitch is so low I could not comfortably for my legs in any way.

### "Overall a pleasant experience"
Short 1h domestic hop from PMI-MAD on a very new Airbus A321NEO. As with most other narrowbody flights in Europe, Business Class is merely seats with more legroom and the middle seat blocked off. Yet we decided to pay for it as it was only about 50% more than regular economy and included refreshments and checked baggage, unlike international routes where the pricing premium for Business Class can be 600% (6x). Even though the plane arrived at the terminal about 30 minutes late, the crew were very efficient in getting in prepped and turned around in double-quick time. Once we were airborne, a decently-sized refreshment was served together with drinks. Flight attendants were warm and cheerful and checked bags didn’t go missing. Overall a pleasant experience.

### "Very disappointed with the customer service"
Not Verified |  Rubbish airlines which change out the flight without calling. Last minute reschedule and cock up the itinerary of people. Suggest not to book. Not really responsible. Tried to fly to Spain today for a important meeting up but unfortunately not able to make it due to last minute changes. Very disappointed with the customer service in CDG airport. Too rude.

### "delay of 45 minutes at first"
While there would be a delay of 45 minutes at first, we were still not on board after 1.15 am. We have a connection in Madrid with an originally 80-minute transfer. As it stands, we're not going to make it. I hope they have a good solution for this. | Terwijl er eerst 45 minuten vertraging zou zijn, waren we na 1.15 uur nog steeds niet aan boord. Wij hebben een aansluiting in Madrid met oorspronkelijk 80 minuten overstap. Zoals het er nu uitziet gaan we dit niet halen. Ik hoop dat ze hiervoor een goede oplossing hebben.

### "such a poor service"
My flight was supposed to depart from Madrid Barajas at 17.40pm and arrive at Gatwick at 7pm, but it was delayed by 1 hour and 50 minutes. I never received a text or an email to let me know there was going to be a delay. The crew didn't apologise on the behalf of the airline. I received a text a few hours before the flight was due to let me know the plane was going to be full and I was invited to register my cabin luggage for free which I did. Once I arrived to Gatwick, I went to the conveyor belt and waited for more than 30 minutes and unfortunately my luggage wasn't there. I had to submit a PIR. I did not choose to pay for this checked in luggage service, this is a service they offered and failed at delivering. They've not only failed at delivery my luggage, they also damaged my luggage. My suitcase has been delivered after 24h and has been damaged It was the first and last time I am using Iberia express, this has been such a poor service.

### "have my hand luggage checked"
The worst company ever! They forced me to have my hand luggage checked last moment because they lacked of space under the seats and once I arrived to my destination I had to wait at least 70 minutes to the stroller and hope I will get my luggage so I lost my airport bus to my city.

### "flight left without our bags"
The flight left without our bags. Customer service have done nothing for us. We are now in Spain for 6 days with a baby and no bags have arrived. They lie and do not stick to the customer contracts. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I am emerald on oneworld (Iberia is part of the alliance) and the experience was worse than anything I have experienced. Upon boarding the flight attendants watch you like a hawk to make sure you are not one KG over the limit or that your bag is not too large. They count how many bags you put in the overhead bin and come running down the isle on boarding if they see you put more than one bag in the overhead. They also asked how much the bag weighed. Granted we are first on board due to status. They changed the seats on every reservation the day of check in from the exit row to the last row of the aircraft and they split our seats up. Never will I fly them again. The only nice thing was being able to use the lounge. Other than that they are bad.

### "Service is very basic"
Madrid to Tenerife Norte. The experience was of such a kind that next time I will take another company to reach Tenerife and very willing to do the transfer to North Tenerife by car to avoid Iberia Express by flying to South. Service is very basic: no choice for the meal and it was fish - not pleasant for some people - lukewarm white wine and gin tonic out of a can premixed. FA aattitude could be best described as "ok we have to serve you". One bag was missing and for the people handling at the airport, it seems nearly like a crime that I was not speaking Spanish. My bag was delivered a day later and I did not even start a claim to get the payment of some essential items like socks, and shaving items.

### "call center is terrible"
Not Verified | Madrid to Lanzarote. Their customer service call center is terrible. It's a scam. They will put you on hold for more than an hour. After one hour they tell you that their system is not working and that you have to call back later. They probably work remote with nobody supervising them and put the customers on hold while they go out shopping. I will never fly with them again.

### "completely disappointing experience with this airline!"
Not Verified |  My first time flying Iberia Express and it was terrible. Check in complete chaos, unorganized and I waited nearly an hour and only had hand luggage. Seats very small and no leg room. My flight took off 1 hour late which caused me to miss my connection in Madrid. Customer service at airport rude and didn’t explain anything, just handed me a ticket for the next day! When I said I can see online that business seats are open on a later flight (same day) I was told it isn’t possible to put me in business class. Overall completely disappointing experience with this airline!

### "Overall a very nice flight"
Flew them before and despite low cost, business class is a joy. I booked economy but on check in I was able to purchase an upgrade for a really small fee which included lounge access and pre-boarding. Seats are a bit cramped for someone over 1.90 meters, but with an empty middle seat, not an issue. Service was great: staff was very attentive, though not fluent in English, they cared for their passengers. A really nice warm lunch was provided with beverages. Spanish products are served and I like this pride for their county. Wifi was available for a small fee. Overall a very nice flight (2.15 h) and perfectly on time.

### "Absolutely unacceptable customer service"
When flying intra Europe there is not much to review abot the services in the air, nowadays not so much difference anymore. More important is the difference on the ground. Let me tell you my experience with IB Express. Check in Sevilla: 5 IB counters open, 2 for eco class to MAD, 1 for biz class to MAD, to for other flights. Long queue on eco class while staff in other counters have not helped me out. It took me longer than the flight to get checked in even though I had done online check in, but no special counter for that. Transfer Madrid: There have been two boarding gates beside each other, both have been used for two different flights which depart at the same time. It was not clear for what flight the announcements have been, also the English has been very bad and was not really understandable. Hamburg: Luggage did not make it to Hamburg. The counter for filing the problem was not staffed till one hour after landing. Then two staff appear and when seeing around 10 people queuing there one said "Everyday same problem". Wow!! There have been 10 people waiting, one staff left and let the other one doing the work, it took him 10 minutes per person to file the claims. Fortunately I was number 3 in the queue so I was able to leave the airport 2 hours after landing. Absolutely unacceptable customer service and the reaction of the staff clearly shows that situation seems to be normal and not an exception. One airline more on my blacklist.

### "staff were very cautious about mask wearing"
No frills flight in a high density A321, mainly used between continental Spain and islands. Boarding was well organized to maintain social distancing and staff were very cautious about mask wearing. Luggage was delivered immediately.

### "did not let us board the flight"
While boarding a plane to Santorini and despite of having all required covid related documents, Iberia Express did not let us board the flight. Further, they did not take our bags off the airplane. Since we did not make the flight to Greece, we stayed in Spain without our luggage and had to buy the essentials to last few days. We are back in USA now and still don't have our bags and it's been 5 days. Iberia customer service is terrible, their luggage tracing system is a complete mess, rude uncaring staff on the phone and in airport unwilling to help.

### "a nice experience"
Not Verified | Stuttgart to Las Palmas via Madrid. Before the flight, I needed to contact their hotline. The German hotline is a total disaster. Even after having tries it for more than 20 times it was impossible to reach someone. You are redirected from one announcement to another and at the end you get kicked out. Unacceptable and unprofessional. Finally I called Iberia in Spain and - to my surprise - not only did I reach someone just after three attempts. My problem was solve immediately by a friendly and competent employee. Due to the bad experience with the German hotline, we had very limited expectations regarding the flights. But - to our surprise again - all flights were quite enjoyable. Nice staff, good food, decent space. And all flights were on time. It is not a real business class but very good value for money. Overall, a nice experience and nothing to complain about. But Iberia badly needs to improve their German service hotline.

### "your staff were simply disgusting in their attitude"
Not Verified |  I have just missed a flight with your airline through no fault of my own. I arrived at Palma, Mallorca airport with more than enough time to board the domestic flight I was meant to board. Having talked with a few others who were in line with me, we were becoming worried we’d miss the flight. Someone went to check and was told the check in gate was opened now, there were absolutely no over head speaker announcements for passengers for flight IB3923 at 11.20 Palma to Madrid on 25/7/21 to come forward ahead of the line to board immediately. We all missed our flight. To my amazement your staff were simply disgusting in their attitude towards what had gone on, there was absolutely no remorse from either of them and I was simply told to book another flight as if it was just another normal thing and we’ve all got the financial capacity to afford it. This is the worst experience I’ve had with a company in my life let alone an airline company and you should be appalled and ashamed of your staff member attitudes and inadequacy in processing a larger number of passengers wanting to check into there respective flights. I can safely say having had the worst customer service I’ve ever received I will never recommend you to anyone.

### "No refund given from Iberia"
Not Verified |  No refund given from Iberia, after 20 emails and several phone call attempts to recover my fee, still no refund issued to me after they cancelled the flight due to covid. They refuse to give me back my money without supplying any flight, unprofessional and terrible customer service. I will never use Iberia again.

### "Two weeks later I'm still waiting"
They cancelled 2 of my flights due to the coronavirus. For the first flight, I stupidly accepted a voucher, only to find out that they've trebled the prices of flights next year. I decided to ask for a refund for my second flight. Their cancellation form only gives options for voucher, rebooking and 'other'. Their facebook people told me to select 'other'. I did this and got an email a day later telling me that their customer services would be in touch in 'a few days'. Two weeks later I'm still waiting. I don't mind waiting for a refund, but waiting just to apply for a refund is disgraceful.

### "Great job for a low-cost"
Gran Canaria to Madrid. Great job for a low-cost airline. Punctual, and excellent onboard entertainment system. Maybe the seats are a little bit cramped, but it is low cost.

### "Iberia's low cost subsidiary"
Madrid to Copenhagen. While the flight was on time I find both the quality of the plane and the service at the airport under standard of what to be expected from a flag carrier. Even though it this is Iberia's low cost subsidiary this plane was about 20 years old and it showed. Their on demand service with movies worked so slowly that it close to pointless. I generally had the feeling that I had payed a heavy overprise so I expected much and got a service like a low cost airline. The only choice from Copenhagen to Madrid is Iberia Express if not wanting to support Ryanair.

### "unsatisfied and disappointed"
Beirut to Tenerife via Madrid. Yesterday (November the 16th), I took a flight from Beirut to Tenerife with a stop in Madrid to my surprise once I reached my final destination my luggage never arrived. (and I still haven't received it). After 40 minutes of waiting for it at the luggage conveyor belt, I realized it wasn’t there. I tried asking around and found an Iberia desk with an agent who reassured me by telling me that the luggage had arrived and that it was located in the floor downstairs, so naturally, I went to that floor and searched for around 15 minutes but it wasn't there. So, I went back to the agent to let him know that I still did not find my luggage and he told me that he would check again by himself. After having disappeared for over 20 minutes, he informed me that it was still in Madrid. So I had just lost 1 hour searching for something that wasn’t even there (after having flown for over 6 hours, with an 8-hour layover so you can imagine how tired I was) I started wondering: Why did he tell me before to search for it elsewhere? Did he even check and track my luggage when I first mentioned it wasn't there? Anyway, the agent took some information in order to send me luggage on the next day (today, November the 17th) and guaranteed that it will definitely arrive on a plane coming from Madrid to Tenerife. I got reassured as I saw a flyer mentioning an award Iberia (the airline I had just taken) received for its lost baggage's management. However, no one contacted me and I didn’t get any information on my missing luggage! Therefore, I called Iberia's office located at Tenerife’s Airport through several numbers and no one ever answered (one phone number wasn’t even working). I even called Iberia's headquarters office in England and was given another number to call. I had again wasted 1 hour between unanswered calls and automated answering machines for this same matter. Until I finally got my answer and to my surprise, my luggage was still in Madrid even though the airport agent assured me I was going to get it by today! I realize now how inconsistent this airport agent is, and how unprofessional and terrible Iberia's lost and found service is. The worst part is that Iberia is supposedly awarded for lost luggage management? All full of lies!! We live in a century where time is money. I already wasted a considerable amount of time on this matter and I can’t afford wasting more of it to get respected and have my luggage back! I am a very unsatisfied and disappointed customer, especially that it’s my first day at work tomorrow and don’t have a decent piece of clothes! I will make sure to never take this airline again if given the choice and would certainly never recommend it.

### "service is extremely limited"
Tenerife to Madrid. The plane was not cleaned very well, the service is extremely limited a small hot dish with some rice and pork and a miniscule cake. A small glass of orange juice as welcome, only one service of drinks FA were closing the curtain very often. Long waiting in Madrid before the gate was open.

### "it was a decent flight"
Tenerife to Madrid and it was a decent flight, actually the ground staff was very polite because they also changed my seat as I asked for it. I was feeling a bit sick and very weak during the flight so before taking off I´ve asked for a blanket and a pillow and the lady brought it to me. The seats are not too bad if you are in not seating in the middle, where I was located, although the airplane was not clean, which I think it´s a shame.

### "doesn't offer a little snack"
Madrid to Tenerife. I was booked on this flight as connecting from Venice, and this was operated by Iberia Express. I went to the counter as I wanted to change seat, if possible, as my friends had another seat assigned. When I went to the counter there were two people sitting there, one lady which was the first one I went to, which asked me to wait, as she was on her phone, I was upset so I just went to the other hostess which was very kind and bit sarcastic,  and he helped me out with the tickets. Once at the gate my friends which were coming from another connecting flight, had a big delay which was almost overlapping with our next flight to Tenerife. I was afraid that they would have missed their flight. When I talked to the hostess, she was looking like she was not caring. When they started to understand what the issue was, they tried to make sure that they could make it, as it was just a little overlapping delay than. Luckily, we made it to the flight and before taking off the flight attendant came to all the passengers to offer some water. Iberia doesn´t offer a little snack, which I could almost understand on a 45 minutes flight, but that flight was 2/2.5h long. The flight was basically a night flight, so everything went smooth until we reached the destination.

### "refund of the airport taxes"
Berlin to Madrid. For personal reasons I couldn't travel. The website is not accessible for complaints or doubts. After looking in Intenet, I found a telephone where you can call them and ask. Once I got in touch I asked for a refund of the airport taxes. It is true that they return them, but they charge a management fee higher than the fees, so they do not return anything. From the consumer's point of view, we are unprotected.

### "they refused to return it"
I had a flight Tenerife - Madrid - Paris on 7th on June. Customer service told me I can buy additional baggage during online check-in. I did it once which cost me 40 euro. But baggage wasn't added. Okay, I called customer service again and asked why. They advised me to try again, 40 euros were withdrawn from my bank account. After that there were still no baggage in my order. I had to drive to the airport the day before my flight to buy baggage manually from the Iberia desk. Everything went good, and I finally got my baggage. But they still couldn't see two of my other attempts to buy it. So I tried to return money with the help of bank. After two months they refused to return it as they see the service as it was provided.

### "I had been placed on standby"
Madrid to Fuerteventura. I tried before I departed to check in but the site kept crashing so had no choice to wait till Madrid. Got to the check in counter to find that I had been placed on standby as they claimed to the flight was over booked. Went to the gate as instructed, the attendant there was very unhelpful and said wait till everyone has boarded to see if there is a seat available. So I waited with 10 others in the same situation. Lucky was able to get a seat, in fact all waiting people got a seat. Boarded the plane and found someone in my allocated seat. Asked them about it and she said the stewardess said she could sit there as it was a spare seat. Ok if it was a known spare seat why was I waitlisted? In fact after all the 10 of us who were standby boarded tgete were a couple of empty seats left. Also the ticket clearly said snack included in the flight but you had to pay for them. Arrived at the destination and went to collect bags. After all the bags had been off loaded almost half of the planes passengers bags had not arrived. Mine was still in Madrid with the rest of the passengers bags. How can an Airline forget half of the bags?

### "did not receive a refund"
I booked a flight to Madrid from Dusseldorf for 09.07.2019. The flight was cancelled last minute after midnight and we were just informed via email about an alternative flight which includes a stopover London and which required 3 times more time to reach. And even we didn't approve this change they don't refund the ticket's cost or any other action. We did not get on the alternative flight we did not opt for. After attempting to reach customer services via telephone they wanted us to open a ticket because they cannot see the incident in their system. And after opening a ticket and waiting for 5 more days we did not receive a refund but a joke: Dear Customer, we apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incident on your flight I23137 dated 9/07/2019. In order to carry out our daily operation, we depend on external factors that are beyond our scope of control and before which we have no possibility of action. Our main objective is to offer a better service to our customers every day and reduce the impact of these factors on their experience. Unfortunately, and despite our efforts, in this case, we were not been able to prevent our customers from being affected. We thank you for your understanding and reiterate our apologies for not having fulfilled your expectations. We hope your next flights are satisfactory. Thank you for continuing trust in Iberia. Kind regards, Iberia Express Customer Services

### "unpleasant and unfriendly staff"
Madrid to Santa Cruz de La Palma with Iberia Express. Too small space for legs if you are over 180 cm, quite unpleasant and unfriendly staff (like most Iberia staff) with very limited knowledge of English.

### "Horrible customer support"
Amsterdam to Porto via Madrid. My experience with Iberia is quite upsetting, it pretty much started even before I got into the plane. I ordered my ticket a while before the flight was supposed to happen and 2 days before takeoff I went over to the website to select my seats and do my online check-in, however, when I tried to do so I was met with a fee for each seat. Due to the fact that I went from the Netherlands to Portugal via Spain, I had to pay for 4 seats, each seat was at least €8 and at most €14, which came down to an additional €32 at the very least just to be able to sit. This was the first time ever I ordered tickets with Iberia as normally I fly via other companies and I was never asked to pay for my seats before unless they provided me with extra space for my legs or other luxury benefits. I called Iberia and was met with an extremely rude customer service person who barely spoke any English. I told him that I couldn't pay for the seats as the only payment method they offered was via credit card, which I don't have; He said: "If you don't want to pay you can just go and pay at the airport" to which I replied: Well, I am currently in the payment screen for a reason, it's just impossible to pay like this. His response remained the same, giving me a feeling like I was being cheap. Once I finally boarded the first plane everything was alright, of course, food and drinks were overpriced by a lot but I was actually quite thirsty and bought myself a coke, then some turbulence happened, the plane started to shake and a moment later I found myself, my seat and the ground below me covered in coke, the flight attendants looked at me with a rather unamused face and threw me some wipes to clean myself and my seat while speaking to me in Spanish, when I said I don't speak nor understand Spanish she shrugged and walked off. Horrible customer support, flight attendants don't care and aren't helpful, due to not being able to choose my own seats I had some horrible experiences with other customers on the plane which I didn't describe.

### "Overall bad service"
Madrid to Florence. Do not fly this airline, it is not worth the risk of ruining your trip. We were flying from Amsterdam with a final destination of Florence. We checked two bags. First leg of the flight was Amsterdam to Madrid, which was fine. Second flight from Madrid to Florence: no AC on the airplane, it was uncomfortable and warm the entire 2.5 hour flight. To make matters worse, half an hour before landing we were told due to some conditions we would need to land at the Pisa airport, not Florence. Please keep in mind Pisa is an hour and a half from Florence. We get to Pisa, our bags are not here. We have to call Iberia (because they do not have a counter at the Pisa airport) who tell us our luggage will not arrive in Florence until tomorrow. We are only in Florence for one day, on top of that the person tells me I can’t even open up a claim with him over the phone, I have to go to an Iberia counter. He was not apologetic at all. And why would they have a system where you can’t open a lost baggage claim over the phone? Not efficient. The airline did provide a bus for passengers to go from the Pisa airport to Florence airport, but we had to wait an entire hour for it. Overall bad service and seriously not worth your risk of ruining your trip. Don’t fly this airline.

### "smallest space between seats"
Not Verified |  Paris to Madrid. This airline has the smallest space between seats, I can't even open a notebook to work during the flight. I avoid this airline just because of that - their competitors (low-budgets) have more space. So if you fly for business and you hope to work during the flight, then choose any other airline.

### "give me this stupid connection"
Gran Canaria to Zürich via Madrid. They give me this stupid connection and when my plane landed they did not wait for me. Only 5 mins late, but of course it was not my fault. My other connection had delay like always. Have to wait 4 hours for the next plane.On my way back i also had more than 3 hours delay. I paid 500CHF and its a horrible company and you have to pay everything in the plane. Not even a glass of water they offer you for free. Never again will i fly with Iberia.

### "missed my connection in Paris"
My flight was originally on Delta from Salt Lake City to Madrid for both business and pleasure. Due to Delta leaving 3.5 hours late I missed my connection in Paris and as all the Delta Partner flights were booked going down to Madrid that evening they put me on an Iberia flight. This gave me a 4 hour layover or so in Paris so you would think my luggage would have arrived. It didn't. I figured it would show up a day or so later because how do you lose luggage for longer than that and I made the mistake of only making only one pair of underclothes and two shirts in my backpack. As the days progressed with no luggage I was told by Iberia to hold onto my receipts for reimbursement as I had to by clothes I could wear for my conference, makeup and some clothes for the vacation portion of my trip. I didn't go wild. Finally, on the 9th day of no luggage they contacted me to say it was found and now in Madrid. That didn't help as I was in Barcelona. I instructed them to send it to my home in Utah to which they told me they would send me the shipping information. They never did. Three days later there was a knock at my door at 4:50 a.m. that freaked me out because I wasn't expecting anyone. It ended up being my luggage. Luckily, it was all there. Unfortunately, the story doesn't end there. When the Iberia representative told me to hang onto my receipts he gave me an email address to send all my documentation. I did so knowing that reimbursement could take up to 30 days. After 3 weeks of radio silence from Iberia I contacted them to check the status and they said they never received my paperwork! They gave me a new email address and I resubmitted again. This time I saw emails from them saying they were processing and I could expect a check in approximately 30 days. Fast forward to this week. At day 36 I called them and was told that they couldn't help me. That I would need to lodge a complaint through their website. I immediately did and received an email that said it could take up to 21 days to respond. When I got home that day there was a check in the mail for less than half of the amount submitted. I've since contacted them without response. The customer service of this airline is unbelievably horrible! As Iberia was the airline I last flew with when the luggage went missing, according to airline regulations they are responsible for whatever happens to it.

### "missed our connecting flight"
On 14 May 2018, my wife and I were booked on Iberia Express flight No 12 3877 from Santiago de Compostela to Madrid. The flight was scheduled to leave Santiago de Compostela at 9.15 am but due to a fault with the de-icing mechanism on the port engine of the aircraft, the flight was delayed and eventually took off from Santiago at 11.26 am, landing at Madrid at 12.20 pm. As a result of the delayed flight, we missed our connecting flight, from Madrid to Bucharest which departed at 12.15 pm. The Iberia staff at Madrid airport were most unhelpful in solving our problem and were rude and dismissive. A large number of passengers on the flight lost connections. The attitude and service was appalling. To add insult to injury, our baggage and 21 other passengers’ baggage did not arrive in Madrid with our flight. We put in a baggage claim and our two bags eventually arrived late afternoon at Terminal 4 which I had to go searching for and which I found going around and around on a carousel all on their own and which could have been taken by any other passenger. The Iberia baggage claim staff had promised that they would keep the bags for us in their office once they arrived from Santiago, but this was not done. This is shocking service. In the meantime, we had to travel back and forth from Terminal 4 to Terminal 1 on two occasions in search of our baggage. As a result of the delayed Santiago - Madrid flight, we had to purchase two new airline tickets with another airline because we were a “no show” for the Tarom flight to Bucharest. I phoned Iberia Express in Madrid from Romania on many occasions and at great expense in order to investigate lodging a claim for compensation under the EU Regulations. I was told to lodge a claim online which I tried on numerous occasions but each time I tried to submit the claim, the message I received we that the Santiago flight number does not correspond to any Iberia or Iberia Express flight number. I phoned Madrid again and one of the customer service people said that she could not understand why the website is rejecting my application because the flight number I put into the system was correct. She then told me to send my claim by email to which I did but received a reply that the email address is for “internal use only”. I once again phoned Iberia in Madrid and the customer service person promised to investigate the problem and get back to me but I have never received a call back from her or anyone else. I have tried on 23 occasions to submit my claim online with the same result, the online system keeps telling me that the flight number does not correspond to and Iberia or Iberia Express flight number. In desperation, I wrote a letter to the CEO of Iberia and sent the letter by email and mailed it to him on 28 June 2018. I have not had the courtesy of a response from him our his staff.

### "Totally appalling experience"
I flew Business Class to Las Palmas from Cardiff. Flights excellent and on-time, I couldn't fault their performance. What overshadowed the whole trip was the way in which I was treated in Madrid Airport by a gate clerk. I entered the wrong line for priority boarding and eventually was able to join the correct line. For some reason this angered the woman at the gate who decided to explode with anger at me for no reason about why I was in the wrong queue etc. I was so shocked by her behaviour. When I told her off for speaking to me in such an aggressive way and I took back my passport with a curt "thank you" she ran down the jetty (leaving her desk and other passengers) to verbally abuse me more. I have never experienced anything quite like it in 15 years of flying Iberia. I put in a complaint about her behviour but heard nothing back. Totally appalling experience and never again.

### "easy departure and punctuality"
Stuttgart to Madrid. Cabin crew friendlier than customers. Wifi to see movies on the cellphone, easy departure and punctuality. Finger use in airports, never had to use a bus to get to the plane. It does not seem a low-cost airline at all and I try to use it whenever I can. The only "but" is that the cabin crew are too permissive with customers leaving their backpacks in the trolley-cabins. If you get late to the plane you might not have space because of this.

### "a miserable experience"
Marrakesh to Malta via Madrid. Most disorganized airline I have had the misfortune of flying!! Our complaint with Iberia airlines began when we were stuck waiting to board at the rear doors of the aircraft on the steps in the hot Moroccan sun for 20 minutes, only to be told they needed to close the rear door so we would have to walk to the front. My mother, with her bad knee, and I walked back to the front doors of the aircraft where we were the last ones on board. At the top of the steps a man begins putting tags on our hand luggage without saying a word to us. I ask if this means they will have to be checked and he just says “No space” and gestures inside. I understand we are the last ones on the plane (not intentionally) so there is no space left but they could at least tell us what was happening with our bags instead of taking our luggage without a word. Inside the plane, there is no soap in the toilets which we realized after another passenger spilt Coca Cola on top of my mother wearing all white. Now the belt is ruined, shirt stained, and my mother is completely sticky. On arrival in Madrid, we wait to collect our bags next to the plane as the agent in Marrakech had instructed us. One of the flight attendants informed us that our bags were “probably” en route to the final destination of Malta. We replied that there was no information given, as to our final destination, so we deduced that the bags must be in Madrid. We are then told that “most likely” our bags were in Madrid but we would have to go outside security to collect them and then come back. After waiting at the baggage claim the bags finally arrived. We narrowly made our next flight and were one of the last on this flight as well. On our next flight we were lied to by two agents saying there was absolutely no space for our bags but once we were inside we found at least 10 empty spaces (as well as numerous empty seats) that we could have used rather than leaving our bags to get lost again. Overall a miserable experience flying with Iberia, I would recommend flying any of the low-cost airlines who have a better standard of service than this. I would have rather swam through the med than gone through this. My mother might not have many trips left and this company certainly ruined one of them.

### "a pleasant experience"
Madrid to Gatwick. Flight was on time. At first it looks like the seat pitch is fine. This has been achieved by removing the seat pocket one normally finds below the tray table. However, once person in front declined their seat it became very unpleasant. The tray table came close to my stomach and it would have been very difficult to use the table. Fortunately there was an empty row across and one was able to move seats. The WiFi worked but it only allows you to watch information and movies on Iberia Express page and you are unable to surf the net or send emails, go on Facebook etc. The movie and TV selection was quite good but as there is no seat charger I didn't want to lose my charge so did not use it in the end. The crew were largely absent but drinks and food menu (all charged) was very adequate for short haul budget flight. All in all a pleasant experience bar the ridiculous seats.

### " I really recommend it"
I flew from Berlin Tegel to Madrid on February 18, the flight was on time and we arrived to Madrid before the set time. Check in was fast too. Nice flight, kind cabin crew, good service and also confortable seats with spacious legroom. I really recommend it.

### "ground staff were really forceful"
Flew Madrid to London Gatwick. There is very minimal leg room on these planes. I'm not tall (165cm or around 5'5) and I felt cramped in. It's fine for a short flight, but 2.5 hours to London is pushing it. Beware that they will try to force you to check in your luggage, even though there is a lot of space in the cabin. The ground staff were really forceful that the overhead lockers were full, but they were half empty when I got on the plane - whole overhead lockers of empty space. They may claim to be the most punctual airline in the world, but they have downright dishonest ways of doing it. This isn't the first time it's happened to me on this airline. Staff are very much "that's not my job" kind of people. There is absolutely no difference between these flights and the other low cost airlines, except, and I never though I'd say this, the staff on other low cost airlines are a lot better at their jobs. I will be avoiding Iberia Express in future. Unfortunately they do some routes that no one else does, but for those flights I guess I'll just have to accept that there's no way I can be in a rush.

### "Not a comfortable experience"
Gran Canaria to Madrid. From start to finish I felt like there was so many problems. Firstly I arrived at the airport early so I didn't have to leave my baggage in the hold. However everyone who was priority was allowed on before. They put people into groups so I was group 3 the last even though I was the first near the gate. After that my luggage was put into hold. Once on the flight the staff seemed disconnected and also flustered themselves, I suppose because things don't run smooth. The back of my seat was broken so I had to be transferred next to a mother and small baby crying, at this point I just wanted to rest. The food and drinks were overpriced and I had to pay £2.50 for a tea which was that bad I had to ask for it to be changed. The hot water was not warm enough to brew the tea so it ended up looking like dirty dishes water. At the other end of the flight I waited over 20 mins to get off the plane and then a further half an hour to get my bag which was only very small. Not a comfortable experience in total and wouldn't think of flying again with them. easyJet is a much better option for low cost.

### "seat comes with a charging point "
Madrid to Nice. Check-in at Terminal 4 Madrid airport was fairly easy where there are many self service kiosks available. After obtaining a boarding pass from the self service kiosk, I had to drop my check-in baggage at designated counters a short walk away. A staff member checked to ensure that the baggage tag is tagged on correctly before accepting the baggage. The boarding gate was a good 20-25mins walk away. Boarding was orderly. The flight was over 90% full and overhead cabin space was quite limited. Seats in economy cannot recline but it was not a problem. There is no inflight entertainment. Each seat comes with a charging point located below the seat so it takes a bit of a search to be able to locate it.

### "bumping people off"
Madrid to Amsterdam. Overbooking the flight and bumping people off when everyone shows up. We are requested to spend the night at the airport and take the flight the next day (not just a few hours later, but the next day). It is scandalous you pay for a ticket but apparently don't have a guaranteed seat. They assured us that it was the company's policy and it was written in small letters on the terms and conditions of the tickets.

### "half hearted business class "
Madrid to Dublin August 31st. Have flown with these before found them ok, I needed to booked a changeable ticket and as there was very little difference in the full economy fare and businesses class. Check in, lounge, fast-track all fine, boarding was fine too ( usual haul to gate 4 at the very end of Terminal 4) I was in front row and to be honest the seat was not the most comfortable it's the usual standard 3 seats layout with middle seat left free which in theory only gives you more arm room. Cabin crew were nice but very distant and almost came acrosss as Robotic like they were programmed . Inflight meal was omelette, fruit, crossaint (breakfast) I wasn't offered a 2nd cup of coffee and I had to press bell to get a Fanta - my previous flights with Iberia Express found the crew very attentive. The Immfky.com wifi wasn't working and the crew didn't know a lot about it. Overall not bad but, it's a half hearted business class in comparison to others. I would still fly with them.

### "staff were very nice and helpful"
Flew Iberia Express from Madrid to Rennes. Very good punctuality, we arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled time. The Immfly WiFi connection works very well. Great variety of content like films, series, TV programs for flights of less than three hours. The staff were very nice and helpful.

### "Value for money too"
Short hop from London Gatwick to Madrid. First time on Iberia Express. Check-in was chaos and was told I was lucky to have a seat as flight was over booked by 10 people. Not good. BA codeshare flight, however you cannot check in at BA static machines to check-in. Manual check in only. Flight was crowded and a bit cramped. But showed all the traits of low-cost (which it is) and a legacy airline for back-up. Crew actually friendly and worked hard which is not always the Iberia way given my previous poor long-haul experiences on Iberia - this point was refreshing today!. Value for money too and would use again. Did not purchase anything but prices looked reasonable.

### "because the system failed"
Madrid to Amsterdam. We checked in a day before leaving. They charged us 30 euro for our luggage. The day of leaving we had to pay again 60 euro for our luggage. Otherwise our luggage would be hold in Madrid. By reclamation on the general desk they told us it was because the system failed and we had to deal with it. Although it was the mistake of Iberia. By entering the plane all storage cabin were full. For our handluggage there was no space. The stewardess told us to keep our handluggage under our seats - most of the passenger took 2 pieces of handluggage with them. Some of them 3 pieces! So we had to pay double and other paasenger could take all there luggage with them in the cabin.

### "not worth the upgrade"
Madrid to Krakow. Poor business class service for the money paid. I upgraded to business class cabin on my flight to get more comfort and more space. The boarding service in Madrid was confusing with various lines. Upon boarding  I was offered an orange juice.The seat is not very comfortable and did not recline. The meal was bad - I received cheese, crackers, Oliver, piece of chorizo, some potatoes and grapefruit. For a business class experience this was below par. The flight attendant was nice and was the best part of the trip. She returned the bag I left on the aircraft and ran after me to give it back. Very nice. The toilet was quite dirty and there was no soap left. All in all not worth the upgrade, food needs improvement and the cleanliness levels need to get better.

### "crew appeared disinterested"
Santiago to Madrid. Cabin crew appeared disinterested and would not make eye contact with me when pushing the trolley. The first time was when I wanted to purchase drinking water. After the trolley was pushed two seats behind me I had to turn round & get the attention of passengers. The second time was when Cabin Crew were doing a rubbish run, this time the flight attendant was looking the other way as I tried to get her attention. I was in the middle seat & found it difficult to move in the cramped seating because of the sleeping passenger in the aisle seat. It appeared to me that the quicker the trolley was pushed down the aisle the less work the hostess had to do.

### "the worst experience I have had"
Flew London Gatwick to Madrid with Iberia Express. This was perhaps the worst experience I have had in a long time, this brings budget to a new meaning and is even more frustrating considering I booked via British Airways. This is perhaps the worst economy that I have ever experienced in my life, the seats are the most cramped that I have ever come across and are worse that other budget airlines. I don't wish this airline on anyone.

### "a great low cost experience"
Berlin to Madrid with Iberia Express. Very efficient boarding, the crew were making space in the overhead stowage and accompanying passengers to their seats which is very rare in Europe. The flight left Berlin late on a Friday evening most of the passenger were grumpy but the cabin crews have been smiling throughout the flight paying attention to small details. Definitely a great low cost experience.

### "quality of the food was horrible"
Madrid to Dublin with Iberia Express. The trip was terrible, I travelled alongside my boyfriend. The plane departed 30 minutes late which honestly could of been more toleratable if we hadn't been put onto the plane like a herd of sheep. After take off we realised that all around us there were babies, not just one but 4. Every single child was screaming at the same time and they were uncontrolable. I am just wondering, how is a person supposed to "relax and enjoy their journey" when nobody seems to give a damn about the other passangers. The staff were just as frustrated as the other passangers who had to sit through a 2.5 hour flight but did not assist. Also I would like to mention that I ordered a Carbonara pasta and what I was given was a pot full of water and powder. The quality of the food was horrible, and was definitely not worth the price. Definetly not choosing this airline ever again.

### "blacklisted from the airline"
Dublin to Madrid. Awful service. They couldn't find one of our tickets on their system in Dublin, then argued with us and told us it was our fault. The check-in agent told us we were then 'blacklisted from the airline'. A week after our flight the airline took EUR56.42 from my account without my knowledge. I've asked for a reason and they won't tell me why or give a refund of the money. Terrible service.

### "penny pinching rip off"
Madrid to Manchester with Iberia Express, and paid 350 euros one way to have a little extra space and a simple hot meal usually provided on this route. The meal has been substituted now with snacks such as olives in a sealed bag and a powder cup soup. But they have the nerve to display a soup bowl on their brochure. Iberia, has become a penny pinching rip off.

### "pretty poor service"
We were booked on Iberia Express IB3718 from Madrid to Gatwick - confirmed ticket and Eticket. Got to Madrid Airport and flight not on overhead noticeboard. Went to Iberia to enquire. Oh Yes your flight has been cancelled - hasnt anyone told you?? Well no they hadnt. On the plus side we were offered an alternative flight leaving in 30 mins. Fantastic. Ran to Gate only to find flight was going to Heathrow not Gatwick -so no option but to get on. Got a National Express Coach from Heathrow to Gatwick at £50. Emailed my complaint to Iberia Express asking for a refund of our coach ticket and got following email back "Changes occur to our flight schedules every change of season and on certain holiday dates. The changes depend on demand and the availability of landing and take-off operations at airports. When this happens, we advised you via your e-mail address or by telephone" Well no one told us and they refused to pay the £50 costs we incurred to get from Heathrow to Gatwick. Pretty poor service in this so called age of customer service and satisfaction.

### "the seats are terrible"
London Heathrow to Tenerife. Terrible flight. For a journey of 5 hrs despite of delays, the aircraft is so compact and one of the oldest ones I say. Iberia Express, for the price they are charging, the seats are terrible - no space and extremly small. That lowers the standard of BA by sharing code with Iberia Express. Meals are paid on top and no entertainment at all.

### "like Ryanair without the competence"
I bought a Business Class ticket between Madrid and Paris CDG on Iberia and was never told that the flight was operated by their low cost subsidiary Iberia Express. There is nothing wrong wih some Iberia affiliates: Air Nostrum for instance provides one of the best regional onboard services in the world. Not so wih Iberia Express. Business Class consists of the first three rows in the A320 cabin, but at a markedly reduced seat pitch compared to the main airline. The middle seat is left empty. As usual in Madrid, passengers are kept waiting in the glass jetways which are absolute ovens in Spain's weather. This was however the first time that upon boarding and getting in my seat 2A, I was denied a glass of water by a FA who was herself drinking mineral water and replenishing her own glass, while explaining to me that she could not serve anything before take-off. First row passengers were never told to stow their hand baggage which happily remained unsecured in the middle seat. The main Iberia Business class cabin service is plain at best but its "Express" brand is several notches lower, performed by completely uninterested FAs who literally throw flimsy trays at you. One of them missed and actually fell in the aisle where it remained for over 10 minutes. It was eventually footballed away by the young lady's shoe. Finally, the worst is that Iberia Express arrives at CDG T3, the charter terminal, with bus transfers, long baggage waits and a trek of probably 900 meters to finally reach a smelly automatic shuttle which, 5 minutes later, brings you to the civilized part of the airport. This felt like Ryanair without the competence. My ticket was anything but low cost. I was not amused. Why have a Business Class those flights at all? Avoid.

### "seats were extremely tight"
I flew with Iberia express LGW to MAD and back. Check-in was speedy at LGW (staffed) and MAD (Self baggage tag). Aircraft were old and dirty. On the outbound flight, there was old boarding passes of some other passengers in the backseat pocket. Cabin crew was alright, but one was weirdly strict regarding on cabin bag - only big items could be allowed to place in the overhead compartment, even though there was lots of space in the compartments. Seats were extremely tight, and I felt it tighter than on Easyjet. I didn't feel confortable in either flight taken. Iberia express flights had a special wifi which allowed passengers to browse certain materials provided, which was quite nice. All in all I would not mind taking it again, but I would choose another airlines if the prices are similar.

### "good and friendly service"
The flight from Madrid to Santiago de Compostela was on time on a busy friday afternoon, the cabin was very clean, good and friendly service provided by the cabin crey. Iberia Express provides a very good inflight entertainment system for this short-haul flight of about one hour. Seating comfort is standard but nothing special.

### "seat given to someone else"
Gran Canaria to Heathrow. My prebooked exit row seat was given to someone else on a full flight. I was allocated another seat where the legroom was woefully tight. I can't remember feeling so uncomfortable especially as I was 18 euros poorer for having prebooked 14A and being allocated 23A. I was asked by a young couple to give up my window seat so I had an aisle seat which wasn't much better as the movement of people up and down to the toilets encroached upon my comfort. On the plus side, the flight was ahead of schedule and the cabin crew were again most charming and efficient. I would willingly have paid a bit extra if they had taken a few rows of seats out but would only fly this airline again if my seat requests (at extra cost) had been honoured.

### "a positive experience"
London Heathrow to Gran Canaria was booked through British Airways and operated by Iberia Express. Terminal 5 is fine, the information / check in lady was charming. I had pre booked an exit row seat and this was fine apart from being a bit on the firm side. Three hours into the flight found me struggling to get comfortable. Aircraft was new looking, bright and cheery with good music. Cabin crew were very smart young ladies who seemed to enjoy their work. The flight landed 25 minutes ahead of schedule which saved the day a bit comfort wise. There was no catering supplied unlike BA who offer a drink and a snack on their services. You could buy refreshments but I didn't bother as I had eaten at Heathroiw and was going to drive when I got to Gran Canaria. A positive experience - baggage reclaim and car hire went very smoothly.

### "ripped off I feel"
Horrible experience. Although we paid in advance for our luggage, I just had to repay for it at the airport in Madrid! No one of their staff had a clue - however some lady at the luggage counter finally found our reservation and proof of original payment, but was unable to reimburse me! Ripped off I feel.

### "crew were mediocre"
Terrible experience with Iberia Express from Copenhagen to Madrid. Rubbish seat selection - a middle seat. Crew were mediocre at best, and that is being more generous than merited. The air hostess tore my carry-on bag out of my hand at shoved it into a random compartment without even bothering to tell me where it was. I had to wait for the rest of the passengers to alight before being able to find it. They had the nerve to charge 2 euros for a drink of water on a three-hour flight.

### "meal was ok, very basic"
Pre-boarded Iberia Express aircraft flying from Las Palmas to Madrid and took up our seats in 1D and 1F bulk head. Very good space, middle seat left empty as per other European Carriers, which gave a good level of space. Newspapers were offered before take off. Crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Drinks offered just after take off, and breakfast was served just after. The meal was ok, very basic, with cold toasted bread with a tomato salsa and olive oil, fruit yoghurt and coffee. Departed on time and landed ahead of schedule.

### "Iberia Express don't care"
Iberia Express don't care about passengers. Flight delayed 40 minutes by a chaotic boarding process, passengers divided among 6 or 7 groups but it was not clear who had to board first. As a result passengers from all rows were boarding at once making the process very slow. They had allocated children emergency exit seats so flight attendants had to shuffle passengers around. Plane has tiny seats, poor legroom, no refreshments. There wasn't any entertainment nor screens with flight route.

### "haven't heard anything from them."
I am very frustrated with the experience I had last Friday using Iberia Express service. I had a connecting flight Dublin-Madrid-Valencia. The plane was supposed to leave at 18.05, but it left around 20.30, which made me miss my connecting flight to Valencia. I had to stay the night in Madrid and spend the money on hotel and train ticket to Valencia on Saturday. What is even more frustrating that I got the email that I can take the next flight to Valencia at 6.36am - but this email was sent to me at 6.36am? I have emailed to their customer service the second I got back, but I haven't heard anything back from them. Worst experience!

### Iberia Express customer review
Iberia Express TFN to LHR on A320. Good points: Convenient route and flight times. Spacious and quiet lounge with good selection of refreshments at TFN. Orderly and efficient early boarding with early departure. Lovely flight crew - friendly and attentive. We had the two rows of the business cabin to ourselves. Newly refurbished Iberia Express slim seats - more space than previous configuration (and quite comfortable) which allows you to stretch out your legs as long as you aren't in row 1 - row 1 is perfectly fine but restricted because of bulkhead. Even though the flight was scheduled to leave at 11:20, we were served 'breakfast', which turned out to be a better offering than the lunch we were served on the outbound sector. Plenty of food and drinks. Arrived early at LHR T5, and straight through passport control. Bags arrived a few minutes after us. Not so good points: On-line check in not possible. Wifi not worth bothering with as so slow.
