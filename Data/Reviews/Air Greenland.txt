### "both cases were damaged"
The product offered by Air Greenland is vastly different between their A330 jet service from Copenhagen and their propeller Dash 8 flights within Greenland. My overall rating covers my entire experience. The A330 to and from Copenhagen was actually very good. Nice modern aircraft, very friendly crew, decent cold meal service and 2 drink services. Seat back entertainment but no headphones provided or sold so remember to take your own standard headphones with a small jack connection. I'd rate that part as 4 stars out of 5. The internal Air Greenland Dash 8 planes were basic and tired inside, no entertainment and only a drink offered. Tighter seating but friendly staff, I'd rate that as 3 star. The onboard experience all in all was ok but its the behind the scenes I have issue with. Firstly with the 4 flights we had, I had around 10 schedule changes before departure between 15 mins and a few hours, so really need to keep an eye on them. My biggest annoyance was both cases were damaged but as it was the zipper lock mechanism smashed it was deemed the wrong type of damage for them to offer any assistance. Both cases are unusable without repair but Air Greenland aren't interested at the airport or at their customer relations centre. So taking that into account I rate as 2 out of 5 overall.

### "Would fly again"
No issues. Decent meal. Good entertainment. The domestic flights inside of Greenland don’t have any food or entertainment, but this one long haul route does. Would fly again.

### "never travel with them again"
Not Verified |  First of they attributed to me and my husband 2 seat, each one at the opposite of the plane. We had to wait plenty of time for luggage drop. I am traveling all over the world with my camera and lenses in my backpack and a trolley containing all important stuff like medicines and so. Especially in these times when luggage are more than sometimes lost. Today was the first time they ask money to send my trolley.... I really hope it will land with me. Also the staff even didn't try to help or to be comprehensive. And of course there was no responsible person to talk to. And no time was left. So we had to pay. I think it is unacceptable. Even the Stewardess was not a nice person. When the company is not positive, everything is bad. I will never travel with them again.

### "they will not rebook/refund"
I booked my ticket at Air Greenland's website in Dec 2019 for a planned holiday in Sept 2020. Small planes and infrequent flights, thought I'd better book early. So much has happened since then with Covid. I'm trying to refund or rebook this expensive ticket - they point-blank refused. First they said they were not processing any ticket changed dated after 31 Aug, and asked me to contact them again in mid Aug. Now they said since my ticket was not bought after Apr 2020, they will not rebook/refund! I am not even allowed in Denmark, how am I supposed to take the flights? Most airlines offer free refund or rebooking of international flight tickets. Not Air Greenland!

### "Way too expensive"
Nuuk to Copenhagen. Just a short comment. Way too expensive, for obviously no other reason but pure arrogance because they are the only company flying into or out of Greenland and they think they can do whatever they want. Nonstop technical errors, and constant danger of missing other flights because of them. If there were ANY other options to fly in or out of Greenland i would choose it over Air Greenland. I feel robbed and furious every time i have to give them my money.

### "bad customer service"
Copenhagen to Maniitsoq. One of the worst airlines. Very bad customer service both on board and at the airports. They don't take of you or your luggage and they don't take responsibility for anything - it is always the others responsibility.

### "off-hand attitude among the staff"
Flew Air Greenland from Copenhagen to Ilulissat via Kangerlussuaq. Way too expensive in relation to the journey length. Long queue on check-in at Copenhagen Airport. Seems to lack any service minded and professional customer service skills. Using terminal 3 for check-in would be preferable than terminal 2. The A330 was old and indeed outdated, a new interior or replacement of the transatlantic aircraft is needed. There is no Wi-Fi onboard, quality of the food was bad, very poor and old in-flight entertainment. 1 movie was shown and a few playlists were on, there were problems with their entertainment system, it to be reset some times before it worked. There is a very off-hand attitude among the staff, not least on board the transatlantic flight. Seriously, they don't seem to care about their customers! Though the short flight on the small Dash 8, was better. Arriving Copenhagen Airport, the waiting time for your luggage can be very long, this can take as long as up to 1 hour after arrival. Overall I would not fly this airline again if there was other alternatives.

### "I was told I had no seat"
Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq. I purchased a Business Class ticket over 9 months in advance. It was confirmed and I was assigned a seat. I even got Boarding Passes the day before the flight for my wife and I. But on the day of the flight I was told I had no seat while my wife did. Air Greenland overbooked and to solve the problem they did not select someone who bought last, but the one who paid more. Odd and unique logic as the person who bumped me bought a Flexible ticket because there were no Restricted Tickets left. So the highest bidder gets the seat. I had my Travel agent inquire as to whether I would be bumped again on the return and she got no reply. I was not bumped as the person who got my seat returned on a private jet as he met a friend on his travels. He had purchased long after me and had no seat assignments. Kangerlussuaq airport is small, overcrowded and chaotic. You get to go downstairs to get your bags and drag them back upstairs.

### "a satisfactory experience"
Flew Copenhagen to Maniitsoq via Kangerlussuaq. Air Greenland appears to be an airline of two parts: long range A330 to Denmark and Dash 8s on internal flights plus helicopters. A hot meal was served on the long flights with soft drinks, beer and wine and the outward flight was comfortable enough. The Dash 8 was awaiting our arrival for its 40 minute flight. On the return Maniitsoq airport only opened at noon due to weather problems [not uncommon] and they tried to combine two flights, but we were over-weight, so 8 passengers had to be left behind, for 2 days for the next flight. We were lucky and flew but were about 2 hours arriving for the Copenhagen flight. However it was running late already, they held it for a further 20 minutes so we could make the connection. So a satisfactory experience, and one appreciated the hostile environment for flying.

### Air Greenland customer review
Me and my wife flew up from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and back again. The food was perfect. The seats where okay but you couldn't lower it to a bed. There was no AVOD system but the pre selected movies were great directly from the cinema.

### Air Greenland customer review
I flew to Kangerlussuaq (A330) a couple days later to Nuuk (Dash7) then Ilulissat- Kangerlussuaq-Copenhagen (Dash7 + A330). The flights were pleasant on time and meals onboard were delicious Greenlandic products (fish shrimp). Considering Air Greenland has more or less a monopoly on travel to/in Greenland the service was excellent. On the Kangerlussuaq-Nuuk leg we turned back 3 minutes before landing in Nuuk due to sudden fog upon landing in Kangerlussuaq we were given lunch vouchers worth 100 DKK and clear information on when we could attempt to fly again. Visitors must keep in mind that weather is very erratic and unpredicatable in Greenland so you need to factor possible delays not under the control of the airline. The safety card in the seat pocket had interesting information on how to use the seat upholstery to keep your feet warm in case of an emergency landing in arctic weather most unusual !

### Air Greenland customer review
Copenhagen - Sønderstrømfjord - Asiaat and return. Airbus A330-200 very comfortable. Everyone on economy had their own 7" LCD Screen variety of film rather poor. The food was excellent! The DASH7 to Asiaat was rather cramped and noisy and we only got two cookies and a glass of juice / Coffee. But what can you expect for a 45 min flight?

### Air Greenland customer review
I used Air Greenland on a trip from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq on to Aasiaat Ummanaq Ilulissat then back to Kangerlussuaq and Copenhagen. The flights from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and return were on modern A330s. I flew business class which was excellent for an average flight time of 4.5 hours. The transatlantic flights were smooth crew efficient and friendly seats comfortable and equipped with video monitors and the aircraft clean. Domestic flights were flown on Dash 7 rather old but clean and a reliable aircraft. All flights on time. On the downside any flight that has an intermediate stopover requires one to deplane and wait in the boarding lounge. At markedly cold temperatures walking on the tarmac to the terminal is not necessarily the most enjoyable experience. Overall though this is a very good airline and I do not hesitate recommending them.

### Air Greenland customer review
I used Air Greenland beginning of August 2006 from Copenhagen to Narsarsuaq together with a group of 30 spanish people for tourism. Our fly was delayed at first 24h due to "weather conditions" and then was re-scheduled 3 days after. This obviously affected our planned journey within Greenland. The information received from Air Greenland was poor and inconsistent; even though they admitted the cancellation was due to a failure in the aircraft they said this was beyond the control of Air Greenland. Who is supposed to take care of Air Greenland's aircrafts but them? At the end there was no compensation and 3 days lost. They do not even have a claiming form. This is an example of how a monopolistic business can reduce client's service.

### Air Greenland customer review
Flew Air Greenland on a business trip from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq. The best part of the flight was getting to fly on that awesome red beauty of theirs. The service was good. Nothing spectacular. Friendly crew and there if you need something. The food was okay. I've had much better on other airlines (Air France Lufthansa SAS) but Air Greenland is the only airline that flies this route so I can't complain too much. The price of the flight was kind of expensive for a 4.5-5 hour flight (it cost around 800Euro) - but other than that left on time arrived 30 minutes early friendly crew onboard and on the ground and wonderful scenery on approach to Sondre Stromfjord. Overall good experience. Will definitely fly with them again.

### Air Greenland customer review
I used Greenlandair (now Air Greenland) on the Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen route twice. The flight was nice and on time. The Boeing 757-200 (which will now be changed to an Airbus A330 model) was very clean. I've also taken SAS Scandinavian Airlines on this flight and Air Greenland had a more "traditional" feeling to it probably because it is Greenlandic. I will definitely use them again on this route.
