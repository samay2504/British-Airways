### "They don’t even deserve 1 point."
Not Verified | I will never ever fly again with this airline. How they make you pay extra money and how they treat you is terrible. They don’t even deserve 1 point out of 10.

### "Will not recommend"
Not Verified | We (3 members family) flew from Tbilisi to Kuwait (J9 612) which was supposed to depart at 3 pm on 4th Jan 2024. The flight was delayed for take-off by around 3- ½ hours due to a technical fault. The cabin crew allowed some passengers to deboard while the others were forced to sit inside the cabin. The cabin crew did not provide us with any complimentary refreshments (as per aviation policy) and was very rude to us. However, they did provide complimentary food to a few passengers. There was discrimination all over starting from allowing few passengers to deboard and providing complimentary meals to some. Overall, our experience was terrible and traumatic. Given the ordeal we went through, I contacted Jazeera Airways for compensation, and they promised to give discounted ticket prices. However, when I asked for a discount while booking a ticket, they did not honor their promise saying that the ticket price was already low and asked me to wait for the next opportunity. Not only do they mistreat passengers onboard, but they also refuse to give any sort of compensation. Will not recommend.

### "Worst ever flight service"
Not Verified | One of the worst ever flightS. I strongly recommend not to travel this airline. Customer service, timing, food, caring, irresponsible, crew one of the worst ever I see. Worst ever flight service.

### "Really very disappointing"
One of the worst airlines I have ever travelled. This was my 1st time travelling with this airlines and this will be the last as well. Mine was Madinah to Bangalore connecting via Kuwait on 25th/26th October 2023, in Kuwait we had to sit in flight and wait for 2 hours to take-off for no reason and then when we arrived in Bangalore, total of 110 baggage went missing. Jazeera Staff promised and committed to get all of those delivered to our home addresses immediately the next day and 2 days later, they call us and tell us to come collect it from airport which is almost 200kms away from my home. Really very disappointing.

### "Avoid this airline if possible"
Avoid this airline if possible. Especially avoid booking directly with the airline website. I live in the UK. They cancelled the flights I had booked from Luxor  to Amman. They sent an email with text pretending to be a schedule change. It was not clear that they had cancelled the flight from Luxor and the moved us to the next flight 5 days after our original departure date. That email mentioned nothing about my options to cancel and get a refund. Emailing them did not help. I never got any replies. I went to their website, where I was given an option to cancel flight and get full refund. I clicked on that but nothing happened. Later on I was not even presented with this option. I tried to use their WhatsApp chat service (using two different WhatsApp accounts). Their chat bot would never let me connect to a human to discuss my issue. In one conversation their chat bot cancelled my tickets with a penalty even though I had never agreed to such a cancellation. Calling their Kuwait-based call centre also did not help. International Call lasted 30min but the person on the other side advised me to wait for a response. This response never came. Further emails also did not get any response from the airline. A month later I was in Egypt for my 7 day trip. To resolve this issue, I had to go to the Jazeera Airways office in Luxor in person and spend hours of my time that otherwise would have been spent on tourism. Only after visiting their office in person and taking video evidence of the complaint that I got my money back! Given all this delay, I also lost money due to changes in the exchange rate (roughly 2 months between booking and the refund) Previously, I have flown from London to India when they flew to the UK. Their cabin was very uncomfortable for such a long-haul flight with a connection in Kuwait.

### "flight staff is very nice and helpful"
The flight staff is very nice and helpful, airplane is pretty clean. Barely any delays. Very cheap. They need to improve their online Customer service. (I called them and messaged them on WhatsApp many times in a week but they only attended my call once at the very end. International calling wasted a lot of my money) Their part of the Kuwait airport is very claustrophobic. It’s very boring because it was very limited on stores. And snacks and fast food was very expensive. - they don’t serve snacks( I shouldn’t complain about this because the flight being cheap makes up for it). You have to order food for the flight 24 hours before the flight with money. They have something called Jazeerascreens which is a flight entertainment website that you can access with their on plane wifi. Awesome replacement to save money, but it only works on phones and didn’t work on my laptop.

### "Worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever, cancelled flight after waiting for 6 7 hours at airport. Instead of arranging another flight they just add credits to account and ask to book another jazeera flight which is 5 days later. No other option given nor any refund. Don't waste your money on this.

### "No one picks up the phone"
A piece of advice, NEVER opt for Jazeera Airways even if your life is at stake. I booked a flight for 15 June which, a few days later, was cancelled without anyone speaking with me. I tried to cancel the flight and request a refund and that refund went to credit which is only usable through their customer care. THERE CUSTOMER CARE IS NONEXISTENT. No local office in Riyadh, No one picks up the phone, the phone numbers on their website don't work, and no one replies on their official WhatsApp. Close your business Jazeera, you cant operate this at all.

### "Please avoid this airline"
This is the worst airline I've ever travelled with. They cancelled our flight without providing us an alternative connection or refund. They were not reachable through any attempts of contacting them (phone, email, social media). We had to personally go to the local office in Nepal to get a hold of them and get a new connection. This new connection had a layover for four hours in Kuwait, where there was no possibility to smoke, leave the terminal with very limited options or rest comfortably. When we talked to the terminal manager he referred us to the Jazeera Airways team who couldn't help us with any of our concerns. Very disappointing. Will never fly again. Please avoid this airline!

### "Poor service at airport and onboard"
Poor service at airport and onboard, improper communication, poor welfare facilities. I don't know how they running flight service like this. Worse than a busy meat market

### "Never flying on Jazeera again"
Worst airline, worst crew, worst airport and worst experience. The flight was delayed for 3 hours and a half, staff is unprofessional and rude. Aircraft is old and uncomfortable. Never flying on Jazeera again.

### "never on time"
The worst airline. Always always late and never on time. A 5 hour layover is now delayed to a 9 hour layover. Also the lounge, it’s like 4 tables and doesn’t even have a bathroom.

### "not knowing my flight was cancelled"
They cancelled my flight and sent me one email with "flight change" instead of flight cancellation. Usually, a change is a departure time change on less than an hour this was a full three-day change or original departure date cancellation. I arrived at IST to check in not knowing my flight was cancelled from Jan 10 to Jan 13. One email, with another dozen soliciting me for upgrades and other fee-based items. And a three-day difference is a Jan 10 cancellation. This caused all kinds of issues downstream with my hotels, had to book another flight, and so on.

### "very bad experience"
Not Verified |  Very worst airport staff, cabin staff, very unclean, very bad experience, no punctuality, no manners to senior citizen, please don't prefer or use this airlines.

### "Worst airline I’ve ever come across"
Baggage allowance scam. Worst airline I’ve ever come across. The seats, food, airline service, support & information transparency are all subpar. The baggage allowance info wasn’t clear on their website or any site I visited. I believe that’s a strategy to scam travelers into paying extra when they check baggages. I ended up paying as much as the ticket price for my checked baggage overage as they charge 38 USD per extra Kg. I only got to know at the counter that the total allowance is 30KG in total. They checked my first bag quickly so I couldn’t move around stuff from 1st bag.

### "worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience and they are so late they made us wait for 3 hours going and coming. There’s no respect to the elderly and everyone is complaining about the delay and that’s a shame for Kuwait! It’s my first and last time traveling with Jazeera airways, the worst customer service ever.

### "lack of customer care"
If you are keen to lose your baggage and being treated as cattle go fo it! The airline managed to load my bag to Pakistan (as it turned out eventually), although I was going to Kuwait. Contact with customer care was only possible via expensive international phone call number. Lost and found did not work at all! I was only able to get my luggage back with the help of the baggage handling service at the airport of departure upon my return. It took 19 days to retrieve my luggage and the airline wasn´t even willing to return it to my home! Cabin was smelly and uncomfortable, Cabin Crew unfriendly! A smile would have done it, really! The most disappointing is the lack of customer care! If something goes wrong, be sure, they WILL let you down!! !

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Most pathetic airline ever. My flight was from Dammam to Lahore via Kuwait. My flight got delayed 5hrs and when I reach Kuwait, they told me that there is no flight from Kuwait to Lahore. I am stuck at airport and don't know what to do - they are giving lame excuses.

### "my first and last flight with them"
If you ever wanted to feel like a sardine then this is surely the airline for you. They have sunk so low in the low cost airline industry. The tickets weren't even cheap,  its my first and last flight with them. For your own sanity do not book with this airline the stress of airline travel plus covid is not worth it. I should also mention their airport is beyond pathetic and also crammed, and they have one bathroom in the arrival section for hundreds of people.

### "refused me check in for a PCR test"
Worst airways ever, after booked I called them they said don't need PCR test for Dhaka to London. So I went for check in,  gave them my vaccine certificate and locator form but they refused me check in for a PCR test. Tried to call customer service but they were closed that time. Later contacted them by phone and email,  sent them all proof but now they saying I went there without a vaccine certificate and locator form which is not true. I had a print copy and digital copy too.

### "forced me to pay for PCR on the arrival"
On the day of departure the check in staff forced me to pay for PCR on the arrival at Kuwait International airport. This was not Kuwait Government requirement for entry at all. After long discussion and argument I decided to pay. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Kuwait International PCR test clinic at T5 surprisingly told I need to pay to have my PCR done. Despite of showing them all the receipts still refused as they said I did not pay. So I paid again. Then I started to contact Aljazeera Airways for my refund which is until the time of writing this review I haven't heard anything from them.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline I have ever encountered in my life. We went to go check-in the bags onto the aircraft. When we were asked by the check-in attendant if we had any liquids in our bags that we are checking into the aircraft (NOT carry-on bags). We told him we have a bottle of zam zam water (less than 5L). He told us to take it out and it’s not allowed to take it into the aircraft, so we explained to him that we have travelled onto many flights around the world and that it’s allowed to take liquids into your check-in bags and not the carry-on. In which he rudely replied and said zam zam water isn’t allowed to leave the country. In which I replied to him and told him to look directly behind him because the rule board is literally hanged right behind him, and it states that over 10L isn’t allowed, but up to 5L is allowed to take in check in bags. He said he won’t give us our passports back and said that he will cancel our boarding passes to deny us from flying. Arguments started to happen and many of the other workers started to get involved and at this point we were being deliberately delayed from our air flight and a lot of yelling was directed towards us. I asked the check-in attendant to talk to his manager in which he replied that he doesn’t have a boss, and I will only speak to him. He did in fact cancel our boarding passes even though he isn’t allowed to, and we had to involve airport security to re-activate our boarding passes just 5 minutes before the flight took off (we almost missed it). I will only give 1 stars because I can’t give 0. I truly do not recommend this horrible airline.

### "letting its customer struggle"
Hyderabad to Istanbul via Kuwait. Connecting airport closed due to coronavirus, and I flew back to my home country already, and so there's no possible way for me to make the trip. The problem: I cancelled my ticket, and Jazeera did not acknowledge it. There were no cancellation emails, no indication to customer support, and no refunds from the cancellation, which is completely out of my control. These are trying times for everybody, but Jazeera is letting its customer struggle even more. As a student, the cost of the ticket I bought is quite high, and I needed it to transit home. Not refunding this ticket will cost me many work weeks.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Doha to Dubai via Kuwait. The most horrible customer service and airline ever. It is a scam. I purchased the ticket from Expedia and I didn't realize that no baggage was allowed (my fault). I would have never imagined that no baggage was allowed because of the high price. They forced me to pay QR 140 for the extra baggage and QR 50 per kg each way. When you calculate the cost of the flight plus the the extra baggage it ends up a lot more expensive than a prime 5 star airline. Instead I got this cheap airline for a lot more.

### "No problem at all"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Kathmandu to Gatwick via Kuwait was fantastic, no delay in fact we reached half hour earlier than scheduled time. Cabin crew were very helpful. You need to buy food in the plane and it’s not expensive. Seat were very comfortable. Staff on the security checking in Kuwait were friendly. No problem at all.

### "smallest and worst terminal"
Not Verified |  The Jazeera terminal is the smallest and worst terminal. I had a 7 hour stay to catch my flight to Jeddah from Kuwait. There are not enough chairs to sit. I had 2 children with me who couldn't sleep anywhere. The business lounge has no facility to take rest/sleep like Flat Chairs.

### "this 2 hours we were in stress"
Kochi to Kuwait. I had a bad experience from the Jazeera airways on 23/11/19. My mother who is 64 years and going to Kuwait, while check in from the counter they said her to wait as they found some issues in ticket payment. I was there outside and I am the one did online payment. Every one knows that they will issue ticket only after the payment confirmation (money also withdrawn from my account). So i really don't know that why they waited my mother and me more than 2 hours .. she was very anxious too. I don't want to see my mother in that stage so i spoke to them that i am ready to pay the cash again but still they not agreed and told me to wait. Then they took from me debit and credit card to confirm it. Its ok for me as i was available there, otherwise it will be again a problem. After 2 hours of waiting they said everything is clear. But this 2 hours we were in stress.

### "not refunded a single penny"
Kuwait to Beirut. I booked for Jazeera Airways and reached the airport 2:30 hrs prior to departure there was a lot of rush in the airport and when my turn reached to check in 40 minutes prior to departure the counter was closed for me and 2 other passengers and not allowing us to check in or at least for me get my bags dropped only as I checked in online. Tried hard for getting into the plane but no luck, when returning back to home they started calling my name to go to the counter and board the plane again went to there but nobody was there and paid more than the ticket price to fly with another carrier. I was not refunded a single penny of the 122 KWD (400 USD). BTW they say a light meal or a snack is included on the plane didn't got even a cup of water unless I paid for it.

### "The worst ever experience"
Doha to Amman via Kuwait. The worst ever experience with international flight. Delays from the beginning to the end of the whole trip. Small transit halls limited to the gates some times. Delays vary from 3 hours to more than one day if the connection flight is missed due to the delay. Have to argue with company representatives to solve the rescheduling the missing flight. Keep on insisting on the partial refund which were not enough to cover a replacement flight.

### "I'll never fly them again"
Flight to Cairo yesterday was delayed by 5 hours. Flight to Kuwait today was delayed by 6 hours. They never inform you of the delays, despite having my email and mobile. Flew one leg with my mother, who is 90. They made me pay for a wheelchair for her, and then I had to push it myself because their employee never showed up. My business class seat was broken and wouldn't recline. My attempts to express my concerns to the airline officials fell on deaf ears, they simply couldn't care less. Based on my first hand experience, I would advise any self respecting traveller to avoid this airline. I'll never fly them again.

### "so much disregard to customers"
Kuwait City to Dubai with Jazeera Airways. 12 hours before the flight and they have already delayed it twice. For such a short flight, it’s really bad. Customer service told me this always happens. Based on other reviews - it seems like it. Stay away. Whoever owns this airline seems really keen on running the business to the ground. So much disregard to customers!

### "worst airline experience"
Dubai to Kuwait. The worst airline experienced. I will never ever fly again with Jazeera. Original flight should be 2am but move to 4:30 then move to 6:30. I ask why they have change the schedules and the lady in the counter didn’t give any answer. I will never recommend this Jazeera to all my colleagues.

### "worst international flight"
Dubai to Ahmadabad via Kuwait. The worst international flight i ever had. The cabin crew didn't even welcomed us well on board. My flight got delayed for 3 hours. I already did web check in the morning and they call me in noon saying that my flight is canceled. They were fooling me! Anyhow i asked to manager and got a flight 2 hours prior which led me to long layover in Kuwait. When i entered the flight the attendants didn't welcome us warmly as they were busy in their "own work". After on boarding they dont even ask for a packed water bottle. For the whole flight i was hungry and even tough it was an international flight, i didn't got a meal though tickets says they will offer me. The floor was messy of flight and the seats were not comfortable. really dint prefer or recommend anyone to fly with Jazeera. Worst Flight!

### "Worst service ever"
Jeddah to Mumbai via Kuwait. Not recommended if travelling with children. Worst service ever experienced by airline and in-flight staff. No declaration of meal included or not included on ticket. Also no information on baggage check-in counter staff. Restrictions for entry to duty free at Kuwait airport. No support from ground staff at Kuwait airport.

### "block access to duty free"
Kuwait to Dubai. I have always used Jazeera and was satisfied except when they introduced this new terminal and block the access to duty free, it feels like you are in temporary jail and forbidden from all other services such as lounge  etc. I will never use Jazeera again unless they allow access between terminals - this too bad

### "I will never use it again"
Doha to Alexandria via Kuwait. I had two flights which were both delayed. No notice was given you get notified when you are at the counter. We landed in Kuwait and were not allowed to enter the airport and remained literally imprisoned in the new terminal. 7 hours where there is no food or water or any kind of drink. All vending machines require local currency and are not working. We were forced to fast for 7 hours with no options to buy anything. No one available from Jazeera Airways to talk to. Honestly worst ever. No respect, no customer service. I will never use it again and I would rather go through the inconvenience of using multiple airlines than to get on board with them again

### "Absolutely disgusting Jazeera"
Amman to Doha via Kuwait. Worst airline I have ever been on. On the way to my destination the first plane was delayed by over an hour, resulting in me missing the second plane, as the transit time is 55 minutes, enough if both flights are on time. Instead of reaching my destination at 10.10am, I reached there at 9.30pm that night! Again on the way back, this time it was even worse, at least before the transit desk in Kuwait had an idea there was a delay and arranged for the 17 passengers, families with young children included to be transported to a hotel in less than a few hours. On the way back to my original destination, the flight was delayed by 2 hours! The ground staff had no idea when the flight was coming, finally they gave us info of the delay. I approached one of the Jazeera ground staff in Amman, who assured me the airline is aware there is a delay and of the connecting flight to Doha, and once I arrive in Kuwait, they will transfer me to the next available flight to Doha on any airline because they have newly made agreements with other airlines to ensure passengers get to their in a timely manner, as this has been happening regularly with the airline. So when I arrived to Kuwait airport, no one knew of my issue, the transit desk told me someone from Jazeera has to give them authority to do anything and they kept calling a ground staff member, but the phones were off, they directed me to the gate where the ground staff would be, when I went there, no one had a clue and redirected me back to the transit desk. For over 2 hours, the transit desk staff were calling Jazeera ground staff and they kept saying they're coming. I was also trying to contact them through their WhatsApp customer service group. and told them my issue, only for them to forward me customer call centre number, which I couldn't even call as I do not have an international line. Finally after 3 hours, some one shows up to inform me and the other passengers who were connecting to Doha, that there is no other airline flight (so the guy in Amman lied!) and our only option is to catch the next day's flight in 14 hours and go to the hotel for now. Absolutely disgusting Jazeera! I won't be travelling with you again and I will warn all friends and family to stay away! If I could rate you 0 star I would.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Kuwait to Mashhad in April 2015, A320 aircraft. Flight on time, seat was comfortable. No personal screens onboard this aircraft. Food was good for 2hrs flight. Return flight was similar standard.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
I flew on Jazeera Airways on 22nd December 2013 it was a short flight from Kuwait to Jeddah international airport. The service in Kuwait airport was excellent the staff at the airport were really helpful and kind. Takeoff and landing was on time. The food was delicious! Leg room in economy class comfortable - great value for money!

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Jeddah-Kuwait A320 economy. Flight on time check in very fast and easy. Boarding by bus (as usual in Jeddah). On board service was great for 2 hr flight. FA very nice. No IFE on this rout but airshow all times on screen. Arrival prior to schedule. Bags on track on arrival. Very nice experience.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
DOH-KWI with 2 friends and enjoyed the flight. Check in great - staff friendly. Checked bag 2kg over and they didn't ask for extra payment. Boarding via bus and organized. Flight was maybe 40% full so had a full row to myself. Seats comfortable (more space than other LCC in Europe) flight attendants friendly and smiling. Bathrooms kept clean. Would fly them again - great value for the money.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
I have flown with Jazeera many times. The seats are comfortable and staff usually polite. I have not had problems with an delays except once on a Bahrain-Kuwait flight (1 hour). Flight prices are good value for money if booked early. Prices for food/drink on board are acceptable.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
I have travelled with Jazeera Airways on many occasions from Kuwait to Larnaca Bahrain Beirut etc. Generally the service is good for the money however if you do not book early the fares can be very high. Destinations are removed without informing customers and you never know when they will be resumed and when you contact customer services they give you some silly answer like "We dont have any information" which is why I though they were called customer services. I have always found the flights good FA polite and on time. The ground staff could do with some training in customer relations etc.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Whatever you do do not subscribe to the Al Jazeera Airways newsletter. It is impossible to unsubscribe. I would not travel with an airline that cannot comply with standard legislation around the word on email marketing.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Beirut - Kuwait (Jazeera Plus cabin). Ground-staff rude and inefficient. My luggage arrived as one of the last pieces in Kuwait Airport rather than first off! Cabin crew friendly and attentive food free Jazeera Plus cabin is comfortable. Toilets were clean and food tasty.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
DXB-KWI-DXB Economy Class. Jazeera is clean relatively spacious and on-time even if there are no complimentary meals or many other frills. The staff are not terribly friendly but not rude either. The female flight attendants seemed warmer than the male ones. My only issue with the service was the check-in at Dubai. It was just ridiculous. I was the second person in the line when I arrived but it still took 20 minutes for the check-in agent to sort out the family in front of me and 10 minutes to serve me. No apology no smile. Also there didn't seem to be any information during my original booking that the service was making a stopover in Bahrain and on the day of my return flight I received an SMS to indicate that my flight had been moved forward 1.5 hours then another SMS to apologise and indicate that the flight was actually on time...! Quite strange. In my opinion Jazeera is satisfactory.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
DXB-KWI-SAW (Istanbul Sabiha Goken Airport) return. For a low cost airline I was impressed with the online booking system inflight comfort (leather seats good legroom free IFE (bring your own headset or buy one on board) and connecting flight service. The shows/movies were a mix of Arabic and English as was the audio channels (x2 English only). All flights left and arrived on time. The area I found a bit inconsistent was the cabin crew. On some flights the crew were attentive and knew what they were doing. By contrast on other sectors the cabin crew had an "I don't know" attitude. Of particular concern was on the flight out of SAW whereby the safety demonstration was still being played on the IFE as the plane took off! Can't blame the pilots here but begs the question as to what an Earth the cabin crew were doing! For a young airline they have an excellent product but need to make their service a bit more consistent. The product comfort in terms of seats and IFE are amongst the best I've seen on any narrow body aircraft and provided they keep the prices low I'd highly recommend them.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
I've flown Jazeera on 7 return flights. Mostly KWI-BEY-KWI and KWI-DXB-KWI. It doesn't compare to EK for sure but it's better than Kuwait Airways. Value for money is good if you have time to hunt the special offers and hot deals - something that happens very frequently. Food quality and variety are terrible staff are not friendly at all. They make you feel as if you flying for free (which is true when you pay KD1 for the ticket w/o taxes of course). However punctuality is something to be praised. All flights I've been on-board operated on time.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Booked a ticket from Cochin to Dubai on 15th Feb 2008. Reached the airport the flight didn't operate - staff said technical problem. They said the ticket will be refunded or one year open ticket in return Just contact the given e-mail. Booked another costly ticket to Dubai and since then was trying to send mail after mail to them. No reply from Jazeera Airways.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
DXB-KWI-DXB on new A320 outbound; slightly older A320 inbound. On time departure both ways. On outbound bus journey to remote parking bay took over 20 minutes - a typical DXB problem. Less than 30% occupancy outbound; around 70% inbound. IFE (on flip-down LCD screens one per every three rows) pretty useless/boring. Efficient LCC which does get you from A to B with minimum fuss.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
I booked a ticket from Kuwait to Alexandria on the flight scheduled noontime on 9th January 2008. On arrival to the airport we were told the flight was cancelled. As if the disappointment of losing the travel day was not enough no apology was provided and passengers were simply told to return home and show up at the airport at 4:30 am the next day to join the next flight. There was no contact to save passengers the trip to the airport. There was no apology whether on arrival to the airport to find the flight was cancelled neither the next day oral or by email. The flight the next day was on time seats clean but the inconvenience of having my first choice cancelled and having to get up so early plus missing on a whole day dampened the whole travel experience. I would say it's good value for money but cancellation is a serious issue which should not be taken lightly by any airline

### Jazeera Airways customer review
KWI-LCA-KWI: Paid extra for "Jazeera Plus" but not worth it: it is better to buy the basic product and then take advantage of the upgrade offered on-board at KD25: however although the only supposed advantage here is that whereas with "Jazeera Plus" the middle seat is blocked-off if the upgrade is taken the middle seat is used. Quite who collects the upgrade fees is unclear - it looks like it is shared amongst the FA's. Aircraft a newish Airbus A320: flight deck crew an international mixture with almost unintelligible announcements but good at their jobs: FA's on outward flight bored and uninterested but more professional on the return flight. Seats leather- covered in light grey and reasonably comfortable: in-flight snacks paid-for but reasonable in quantity and quality. On-time departure both ways. Generally a good performance for a "low-cost" airline and gives the local legacy carriers pause for thought regarding their fares and services in the regional market.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Kuwait - Dubai - Kuwait. Taking advantage of special offer due to early booking and Jazeera beginning to hub flights through Dubai. As they are now offering flights with multiple destations through Dubai (our flight went on to Cochin India) the flight out of Kuwait to Dubai was not full I would estimate about 50% occupancy as the majority of passengers were joining the flight from Dubai. Whilst the aircraft are quite new they are already beginning to show signs of wear and tear the armrest on my return flight had been damaged and repaired by way of what appeared to be adhesive aluminium tape this would not have been noticable had I not lifted the arm up to take advantage of the middle seat being empty to get more seat-room. Other than that I do consider Jazeera to be a pretty good airline they do have a reasonable on-time performance rating but they could improve on this by closing the gate on time rather than waiting for late-comers (they were still boarding the Dubai-Kuwait flight some 15 minutes after scheduled departure time. However when you're only paying KWD 49 (USD 170) for 2 adult return flights KWI-DXB-KWI I guess that you can't complain too much.

### Jazeera Airways customer review
Kuwait - Beirut return with my family. Brand new aeroplanes with leather seats. Excellent service with comprehensive menu where you can order food drinks and snacks (cold food only). No alcohol airline. As a low cost carrier you pay for the food but the prices are reasonable. Return fare only KWD82 compared to KWD165 on MEA (both including taxes). No discount for children. Excellent on-time performance and no luggage problems. Highly recommended as a value for money carrier.
