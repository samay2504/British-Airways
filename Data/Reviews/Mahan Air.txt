### "Felt like flying in the old days"
Felt like flying in the old days. Flew this one hour flight from Kerman to Tehran in a packed sold out flight operating by an old Airbus A310 which was refurbished immaculately and very clean. The flight attendants were nicely dressed and friendly. It was rather hot at Kerman and I was surprised to find a cold bottle of water on seat back pocket for every passenger on this massive jet. They a light dinner (free of charge ). Over all it was the best domestic flight I have ever taken.

### "The service and amenities were unbelievable for such a short flight"
Not Verified |  The Tehran lounge was really good, free high-speed WiFi, plenty of comfortable seating and endless snacks and food options which is really impressive considering that Mehrabad is a small, 90 year-old airport mainly used for domestic flights, despite being international. The A310 aircraft was really old but well maintained, seats were very comfortable and featured a whopping 1.5m of legroom. The interior was definitely upgraded from the original aircraft as things like touchscreens were non-existent at the time the aircraft was built. Bathroom was also clean and spacious. A small amenity kit was provided along with some masks and a hand sanitizing gel. A non alcoholic pre-departure drink was served along with warm nuts. The cabin crew were super warm and friendly, a warm breakfast was served which was magnificent. The service and amenities were unbelievable for such a short flight. Though no WiFi was available on board and the IFE needed some serious improvement. Also some snacks and refreshments were served before landing but I was too full to eat or drink so I just went for some water. We departed on time but arrived 20 minutes early and like all flights with Iranian pilots, the landing was butter smooth. It costed 120$ for a round trip in business class. Overall really good flight and I would definitely fly Mahan Air again.

### "efficient, helpful and friendly"
Shanghai to Barcelona via Tehran with Mahan Air business class round trip. The ground service is efficient and decent. The aircraft was kept in very good condition and the seating is very comfortable. Crew members are highly efficient, helpful and friendly in all four segments. Food and beverage is great with starter, three main course choices and desert, which is comparable to any international flights. Menu is written clearly. The airline provide everything they should for a business product (even a limousine at PVG from gate to aircraft) except entertainment (all PTVs are switched off maybe sanctions?) Mahan Air's lounges in IKA is excellent with nice sofa, Wifi connection and food selections. Ticket price 1100 dollars which is in really great value. Will fly them again!

### "best airline in Iran"
Tehran to Dubai. Mahan Air is the best airline in Iran. The business class is convenient with a variety of dishes. The quality of food in this airline is great. Stewardess are very affable and responsible In the long-term flights, the amenity kit will be given to you. Generally, the flight will be satisfied.

### Mahan Air customer review
Barcelona to Bangkok via Tehran. Cabin attendant spills by accident a cup of coffee over my legs causing me minor burns and stains on my trousers and shirt. Purser writes a report and apologized. This caused great inconvenience because It happened on the first leg of the flight and could not change until arrival in Bangkok where I had a business meeting. I made a formal complain to Mahan Air customer services and do not even answer. They should compensate this inconvenience. Terrible customer service that do not answer any complains.

### "the seating was very impressive"
Short flight to Shiraz from Tehran. Mahan Air already has a reputation of being an airline of choice for travelling within Iran (for both safety and service) and I could see why. While the type of plane is old (an A300) it was well maintained and clean. The seating was very impressive - definitely the widest and the most legroom I have had in a long time in both long and short-haul flights. For a 1.5 hour flight, I was surprised to be served a substantial (cold) meal. Non-alcoholic beverages are served on the flight. The service was courteous and efficient but not warm. We landed 20 minutes early. The airfare was dirt cheap ($60 one way at last minute), You can't book directly on their website with an international card but can certainly book through third-party sites, but check-in is available online.

### "consider to fly this airline again "
Tehran to Copenhagen. Excellent value For money. Traveling alone with a baby can be challenging but I found Check in and boarding procedures smooth and without delays. The flight attendants were young and very nice to us. A340 with smart and clean cabin. Food and non-alcoholic beverages was plentiful as a hot breakfast was served at the beginning of flight and a cold refreshment before landing in Copenhagen. This was a 5 hour flight and I did not expect that. Inflight entertainment could be improved. This was a great flight and I would consider to fly with this airline again in the future.

### "seats large and comfortable"
Copenhagen to Tehran with Mahan Air. I used to travel with low cost carries like Pegasus and Norwegian and Air Asia. I'm a small size person but still had problem with the seats as they are very closed and small. The trip with Mahan Air from Copenhagen to Tehran was a great experience. The seats are very large and comfortable and the distance between seats are also good enough to be comfortable during long distance flights. Also, my one year old girl had bassinet which made the flight very nice.

### "service friendly and efficient"
Flew Mahan Air economy class from Dubai to Tehran (IKA) with Mahan Air. A340 felt safe, the aircraft was clean and comfortable. Cabin crew service was friendly and efficient. Quality of food and beverages (non alocholic) were of good standard. Would recommend this airline to everyone.

### "overall a good flight"
Mahan Air from Kuala Lumpur to Tehran. Check in was fast and friendly. The signage to find the premier lounge in Kuala Lumpur airport was almost non-existent and took me a while to locate the lounge which offered minimum amenities. Boarding was efficient and the A340-600 was packed for this flight. The aircraft interior was new and clean with smiling crew. The flat bed was great and plenty of food was offered for this 8 hour flight. Perhaps the refreshment (pizza and a burrito) at the end of the flight was a bit too much. Only negative thing I can think of was not much entertainment and it was limited to public LCD’s . Considering the business class fare was almost 40% cheaper than other airlines which operated indirect service, it was a good buy. I was especially impressed by the very attentive flight attendants. Overall a good flight.

### Mahan Air customer review
Business class on one hour flight to Tehran. Check in and boarding organized. The flight was via Airbus A310 with clean interior. Full hot meal was served which I consider unusual for such a short flight. The cabin crew were friendly and around to assist passengers. I found the business class fare rather low  and I probably will use them again.

### Mahan Air customer review
Flew on a very large A340-600 in business class. The check-in was organized and the fast track provided was helpful in bypassing the very long immigration/security lines. They used the Thai Airways lounge which was fantastic. Boarding was via a bus and despite the airlines effort was not too comfortable. I found the flight attendants to be attentive and polite. Plenty of food and non-alcoholic drinks and natural juices. The on board lounge was a nice experience and I enjoyed the Iranian treats. The business class seat was full flat with mattress and a nice blanket which improved the sleep quality when compared with other aircraft I have flown. A nice snack before our early morning arrival into Tehran. Overall a pleasant flight.

Outbound 11 March Dubai to Tehran and return on 13 March. I always select Mahan for my Dubai - Tehran trips. Its a budget airline but the food service and staff hospitality are on par with any top airlines of the world. Seats are comfortable enough leg room delicious food. Very smooth take off and landing.

Tehran - Ankara - Tehran just for $148. The aircraft was a new Airbus 300. Excellent flight experience friendly cabin crew and of course good food! Would recommend Mahan Air.

### Mahan Air customer review
Flew domestic Mehrabad - Mashhad - Mehrabad a few weeks ago. The lounge at THR is professional and maintained served and supplied with food and beverages. Food was served even in economy on a short flight and it was good according to time of the day. Service next to none really!

### Mahan Air customer review
Flew with them in both international business (BKK-IKA-BKK) and domestic business and economy (THR- MHD-THR) and was extremely pleased with everything. Seats (same as Lufthansa's long haul) food (excellent choice of both Iranian and international food 4-5 courses in business) and service by attentive flight attendants. Special credit goes to their business class lounges in both Tehran airport - full service and food/beverages free wifi etc. I was also told they are now installing flat beds in the business class which will be excellent!

### Mahan Air customer review
Tehran Iran to Almaty Kazakhstan on a relatively clean Airbus A310. The flight was delayed due to airport closure in Almaty nevertheless the lounge at IKA was well equipped. Onboard the food was superb and the crew were very polite and friendly. IFE definitely needs improvement. The inflight magazine was more like a classifieds section out of a newspaper with full pages of advertisements and not enough reading material. All in all it was a very good experience.

### Mahan Air customer review
IKA-PVG business class. Check-in fast and efficient. Flight attendants friendly. Two choices of food for each course with plenty of hot and cold drinks. Breakfast served before arrival at Shanghai. Transferred to terminal by bus my luggage was the last one on carrousel - obviously no priority for business class pax.

### Mahan Air customer review
THR-DXB. Airbus 300-600 flying regularly and without delay airport services good with nice hospitality. Onboard cabin was clean good quality food beverages and hospitality professionals in the service of passengers. Airplane toilets were clean and tidy. No inflight entertainment which was frustrating and boring.

### Mahan Air customer review
B'ham to Amritsar return. The flight was on time. Flight crew were friendly and there was a good level of inflight service in terms of meals however the food was not of a very high quality. We did get some vouchers for food when we stopped over in Tehran both times and I was surprised at the amount of food you get with these vouchers. There is no inflight entertainment apart from a screen showing the flight map. B'ham to Tehran does stop for refuelling in Germany but the flight I was on stopped in Turkey. The stopover in Tehran is way too long : 3-4 hours just seems far to long. You get new boarding passes in Tehran and this leads to confusion as you end up sitting all over the plane. There is no point in families getting seating together in B'ham or Amritsar becasue when you get to Tehran they just do not care. What Mahan Air lacks is basic customer care and they really need to consider decent inflight entertainment.

### Mahan Air customer review
Birmingham to Amritsar with stopover at Tehran. Inadequate baggage allowance resulting in passengers having to drag heavy hand luggage around. Flight from Birmingham queuing very disorganised. Departure 1hour late from Birmingham return flight from Amritsar over 3 hours late. Stopover at Dusseldorf came as surprise. Quick connecting flight from Tehran to onward destination. Old plane very noisy. Food onboard good quality constant supply of drinks. Male crew seemed to have a problem with passengers moving for comfort to section of cabin with several rows of empty seats. Female crew very polite and helpful but spoke limited english. No immediate access to qualified medic/first aid at Tehran airport for passengers in need. General cleanliness within plane reasonable same cannot be said for toilets! Very expensive flight all things considered.

### Mahan Air customer review
THR-KIH on a 32 year old A300. Although the plane was old the cabin looked quite new and toilets were clean. The flight was very cheap (50USD one way).

### Mahan Air customer review
THR-MHD-THR. Excellent service on A300-600. Well-stocked lounge in Tehran and business class check-in done by Mahan Air. Onboard 60-inch seat pitch and offered drinks and hot/cold towels. Both ways there a choice of delicious meal. Also very cheap at only £110 return in business.

### Mahan Air customer review
Mashhad to Bangkok vice versa clean A310-300 they are old airplanes with average age of 20 years. No entertainment one way but from Bangkok it had. Friendly cabin crew good cabin services and food.

### Mahan Air customer review
Birmingham - Bangkok via stopover in Tehran. Fairly basic service but courteous and attentive staff; check-in good both ways. No PTV entertainment in economy just one large screen showing various poor quality Iranian films and documentaries. Food questionable quality but plenty of non-alcoholic drinks. Most passengers appeared to be travelling either to Iran or onwards to India and similar; think we were the only Europeans going to Bangkok. Stopover in Tehran was fine -; staff helpful business lounge not bad at all. Women must wear headscarves though and cover bare arms/shoulders. Mahan provided garments gratis for this purpose.

### Mahan Air customer review
Tehran to Kerman. Iran domestic flight. Cant say I was looking forward to this flight as Iranian airlines have a chequered history. The check in was very fast despite the disorganised queuing arrangements. One female agent checked in the whole flight herself. The aircraft (A300) was very old and it showed. Very shabby inside. The 8am flight was full and the air con was not very efficient so everyone was overheating. Seat pitch standard for short haul economy. Safety announcements in English and Farsi on overhead monitors. Interestingly just before take off the video showed soothing images accompanied by what I presume was religious texts read by a comforting voice. It had a nice calming effect. Live camera in the nose gave us a captains view of take off and landing. Breakfast was ok - usual pastries juice and jam. Tea was very nice. 90 minute flight touched down on time. Most of my fellow travellers seemed to be business men but some families also. The mostly female cabin crew worked hard and were very pleasant even though their khaki green uniforms were not the most attractive. Overall I was glad when we landed. Safe and on time. Not an airline I would recommend but this was a basic domestic service and its an airline I had to use as its the only one on this route. The aircraft on the return journey was in far better condition.

### Mahan Air customer review
Teheran to Duesseldorf Economy class. 20 yr old A300-600. Check-in and smooth boarding on time. Nearly full mainly Iranians. Friendly attentive staff some with excellent most with not good English language skills. Food either beef or chicken Persian style was so-so. No alcoholic beverages. Light breakfast (tasteless egg-omelet rolls and canned fruit salad). Toilets dirty. Don’t expect too much budget carrier.

### Mahan Air customer review
DUS-IKA-BKK Economy class aged A310. DUS departure delayed by more than one hour. Attentive and polite cabin staff spoke limited English. Persian food (one main course one snack) of average quality; main course choice between beef or chicken. No alcoholic beverages. Forget the inflight entertainment. Toilets sometimes occupied by smokers. IKA airport has slightly improved during the last year but for an international airport facilities are still poor toilets are rotten. IKA to BKK Economy tired B747. Attentive and polite Cabin staff spoke limited English. Persian food (one main course one snack) of lower quality poor in-flight entertainment. Budget flight; you’ll get what your paid for. Tried to contact Mahan Office in Bangkok for reconfirmation of flight but any phone number given on Mahan Website or received from travel agents where unanswered.

### Mahan Air customer review
Birmingham to Amritsar. The flight was delayed taking off transit from Tehran also late taking off. The issue of boarding passes at Tehran took over three hours. Most passengers were in the plane waiting for the last of the transit passengers to get their boarding passes so were sitting in the plane for nearly 2 hours before take off. Food is okay no entertainment to pass the time. Friendly crew but the overall service must improve.

### Mahan Air customer review
Dusseldorf-Teheran-Bangkok return. Dusseldorf Check-in took less than 5 minutes including waiting in line. The flight between Dusseldorf and Teheran was on time flight attendants very polite and helpful. The food quality is medium as most airlines they seem to save money on food cost. The food quantity is still more than enough. The 3 hour transfer in Teheran is just long enough to stretch the legs and enjoy the voucher to buy some cake or sandwich in the coffee shop. Tax free shopping is limited so it is easier to resist the temptation to spend money - extra bonus is the free Wireless Internet in the terminal. Unfortunately the Iranian internet is censored but normal surfing and email works well. Teheran to Bangkok had about 3 hours delay. The majority of travellers were Iranians and they all stayed calm and nobody complained or started to ask question. The flight was a Boeing 747 and was fully packed. The food quality was the same as in the first leg not premium quality but the quantity is OK. Bangkok to Teheran. I was shocked when I arrived at the check-in at the airport. I have never seen such a long line waiting. Fortunately the passengers with final destination Dusseldorf had a separate check-in desk so had to wait less than 10 mins. The flight was good food as before staff friendly and helpful. A 3 hour stopover in Teheran.Teheran to Dusseldorf was on time food and crew at the same level as other flights. Mahan Air tickets are cheap I paid just 468 Euro for a roundtrip to Thailand and that is a bargain. As people say you get what you pay for and this is true for Mahan air. The planes are old there is almost no inflight entertainment but they try to do a lot with little money. The positive side is the friendly crew very calm and polite passengers a lot of food. When you are travelling on a budget and when you don't care the lack of fancy things than Mahan Air is the airline for you.
