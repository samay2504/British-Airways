### "flight to Bishkek was nice and safe"
Purchased a cheap ticket and the baggage was included. Flight was delayed by two hours, which was not what we expected, but the almost 5 hour flight to Bishkek was nice and safe. There is no entertainment, but the sandwich we got was very tasty. Drinks only water and tea, but ok. The plane was clean, the flight safe, the crew was professional but did not look very happy. All in all, recommended, but as it seems they have a record of delays, perhaps if using them one needs a plan B in case the flight is late.

### "Avoid this airline!"
Moscow to Bishkek. Avoid this airline! Our flight was delayed and moved from one airport to another. No explanation or compensation for transportation. The staff attitude was absolutely terrible. The flight we took was postponed three times and finally took off after 6-8 hours of waiting. And while we were waiting, we saw on the panel that every flight from Ural was delayed for at least 3-4 hours, and every delayed flight was from Ural. Please avoid

### "no one would help us"
Not Verified |  Simferopol to Moscow with Ural Airlines. Shocking. Without warning we were told our flight had been delayed until 01.15 the next day, and no one at the check-in desk would help us. They continually redirected us to others on the desk who ignored us completely. Then we were told to come back in an hour in the hope of being put on a flight scheduled to leave at our original leaving time, but when we got back the head check-in official, not only ignored us and the three others he told that to, but he refused to talk to us at all then. We eventually found the separate ticket desk by ourselves but all they did was give us a piece of paper to write a complaint on without any indication of who would read it or to what effect. Our compensation for the delay? A free bottle of water which was not in stock where indicated. Their excuse? They “flew out the wrong plane which had fewer seats on,” which meant we had to suffer for three hours because of their clumsiness. There was no text message warning or internet update which would have meant we could have changed our arrival to the airport plans! Finally, our flight out had less legroom as they had squeezed the row of seats in front of the emergency exit closer to the row in front. Appalling! Does this company remember that we paid real money for a service?

### "sandwich for a 5 hours flight"
Moscow to Barcelona. Airconditioner was not working. They serve you a small sandwich for a 5 hours flight and there is only Tea. No Coffee! Nobody spoke English or Spanish. Even the emergency instructions are in Russian. There was 2 hours delay to take off. I took 2 flights and both were the same.

### "attitude is very unprofessional"
I bought this tickets flight for me and my wife from Paris to Moscow. When I tried to make on-line booking on June 4th I was informed that flight was canceled. I had to make alternative arrangements and instead going directly from Paris to Moscow I had to go through Riga on a much more expensive flight which took additional 5 hours to reach Moscow. Since then I am trying to get refund for my tickets with no luck so far. After few exchanged e-mails with [email protected] they stop responding and I am losing any hope that I can get reimbursement from Ural Airlines. In my opinion their attitude is very unprofessional and I would recommend everybody to avoid using their services. I know I will.

### "avoid it in the future"
Direct flight Moscow Zhukovsky to Prague was cancelled and rerouted as Zhukovsky to Prague via Kaliningrad (formally two connected flights but in fact just a stop in KGD) with departure 3,5 hours later without any warning. The representative of the airline appeared in the airport half an hour after scheduled departure and was quite unfriendly, no explanations, no excuses. All compensation for a long delay (arrival to PRG about 6 hours after schedule) was a bottle of water (well we're entitled for a ridiculous compensation of some €0.30 per hour by Russian law but it is not worth claiming). Not even any help with sitting places in pathetic departure hall of ZIA. From passengers' reports on the Net I learned that rerouting of this flight this way is UA's common practice. On board, very short legroom, no food even for money except for a few paid snacks. The cheapest option on PRG-MOW route but will do my best to avoid it in the future.

### "no announcement on any delay"
Moscow to Simferopol with Ural Airlines. Flight was at 17.00. Till 17.00 no announcement on any delay, no representative of airline available for information. The hotline of call center does not answer, the airport airline office does not answer.

### "there are disadvantages"
Not Verified |  Moscow to Barcelona. The airline is not bad, but there are disadvantages. Hand baggage allowance - the main disadvantage. Once when I was flying from Samara (Russia) to St. Petersburg (Russia) we were on the bus with the doors open at -20 °, everyone was waiting for the late passenger when he approached it turned out that he had problems with the size of hand luggage, and we continued to stand and freeze. Only after our disturbances, we were able to persuade the representatives of Ural Airlines and go to the plane.

### "average level of service"
Sochi to Moscow-Domodedovo. To be honest, was a bit worried about flying Ural Airlines. When I looked at the flight statistics for the past 30 days, they had more than 1000 flight cancellations -- far above any other airline in Europe -- and over 2000 delays. As expected, the flight boarded late and we departed 20 minutes behind schedule. The plane was full. Unlike other airlines, they limit carry-on baggage to 5 kg (instead of 10 kg), but I don't know if this is strictly enforced. (My bag was just over 10 kg, so I checked it.) That said, it seemed that the in-cabin overhead storage was less full then typical, so maybe this restriction has a positive effect by reducing in-cabin baggage and, by doing so it quickens boarding time. The plane was a not new but did not have signs of excessive wear. The seat was cramped, and my knees we pushing into the back of the passenger in front of me, especially when he decided to recline. Not very pleasant. The meal served was a bland, chicken sandwich with mayonnaise, cheese, lettuce, and the standard slices of cucumber that one typically gets on all Russian airlines. The flight attendants were polite and business-like. After arriving at Moscow-Domodedovo, the wait at baggage claim seemed long, with a big time gap between the first wave of bags and the second. Of course, I had to wait for the second. In summary, it was an uneventful flight with the average level of service that one would expect for a mid-size air carrier.

### "Avoid like the plague"
Yekaterinburg to St. Petersburg. Absolute junk. Flight was delayed by about 10 hours without explanation, in spite of very good weather. Boarding process was utter chaos. Zero communication. No one spoke English, which caused problems for some Chinese passengers who didn't understand the luggage weight limits and held everyone else up as a result. Not professional; I get the feeling the staff don't care if we get there at all. Avoid like the plague.

### "I am so disappointed!"
Moscow Zhukovsky to Tel Aviv. We booked the tickets for 27 August 2018 and have just received an email saying that the flight was cancelled and out trip postponed for 24 hours. That is unacceptable. Nobody is answering my email while calling the airlines is quite difficult due to time difference. I am so disappointed!

### "The seat was comfortable"
Kazan to St. Petersburg. At the airport we checked in. The staff was not so friendly they forgot to print our boarding pass. The boarding procedure was quick and organized. The purser welcomed us on board polite and professional. The seat was comfortable with much legroom. We got a blanket and a pillow on a 2h flight! Wow! When we reached the cruising altitude we got a sandwich wich smells very good. On time we arrived at our destination. All in all it was a amazing flight.

### "love to fly again with them"
St Petersburg to Moscow Domodedovo. The flight was suprisingly really great. Since it is only a 1,5h journey I didn't expect much from this flight. The flight attendents were very friendly and also spoke perfect english. They served a muffin alongside with tee or coffee and a drink (water, juice or a soda). The plane was very clean and tidy and the legroom was also pretty good. Even though the flight was fully booked there was enough space in the overhead compartments. The flight took off 5 minutes ahead of schedule and landed 20min early in Moscow. The online check-in worked perfectly and even though I booked a promo fare there was a checked baggage included. Overall a very pleansant and cheap flight with nice staff and a great on-time performance. Would love to fly again with them.

### "good service we felt"
St Petersburg to Moscow. Our flight with MOD was canceled and we had to navigate virtually on our own through the Airport. Little support, but once we found Ural Airlines they were good. We had to pay for another bag, annoying, but still composed. Check in twice because of ext bag staff helpful and cheery, departure through gates fine. Good flight, with on board snack and coffee not expected. English instructions on board, good service we felt.

### "crew were polite"
Yekaterinburg to Novosibirsk with Ural Airlines. They made me check my carry on bag for no reason as aircraft was half empty. This caused a 30 minute wait in OVB in a terrible bggage area (no WC, crowded). The flight boarded on time, but we sat 30 minutes past departure time without any explanation. A minute before we finally pushed back, the pilot said something in Russian, I understood one word "cargo" so the delay was probably related to that. However no English version for the reason. After takeoff we were served a sandwich with drinks which was OK. Crew were polite, and spoke English. NO IFE of any sort - seems to be the norm in Russia. I'm flying Aeroflot tomorrow, and hoping for a surprise with the IFE. Bussed from aircraft to terminal in freezing cold (-20c), while many jetways stood empty, but they must had their operational reasons.

### "they are not bad at all"
I flew with Ural Airlines not very long time ago, and for a regional airline they are not bad at all. The aircraft seemed to be a second-hand one, watching at the seats of different textile, but it was clean, and without any tapes around the windows. The food was good enough, the only thing angried me, that there were no fizzy drinks available, compared to the last year's flight, but crisis, what can we do. The cabin crew seemed tired, but I could see passion in helping people, I saw how the cabin crew attendant helped one person to eat, who's hands did not work properly. This is actually the best thing I can mention in the cabin crew. The flight was straight away on time. Of course it is slightly worse than Aeroflot or S7 Airlines.

### Ural Airlines customer review
PEK-SVX. Check-in was fine with minimal fuss. Extremely annoyed at the near 3 hr delay for take off with no explanation offered. Plane was an older A320 but in ok condition. Once onboard I was again disappointed to find most padding missing from seat and a lump under my leg that made the flight nearly intolerable. Luckily my wife was able to swap to a spare seat in another row and made some extra room for my son to sleep. The cabin crew were polite and quite attentive responding quickly to calls. The meal was not great but acceptable although strange that you had a choice of wine but no soft drink choices other than water or juice. I would definitely not recommend Ural Airlines to anyone unless you like airline lounges. I am writing this at SVX waiting for my return flight to PEK the delay on this flight just passed the 3hr mark. I wonder how long this one will be.

### Ural Airlines customer review
DME-SVX . Check in quick at Moscow although I did arrive early and was surprised to find the check-in already open. Pleasantly surprised to find we were flying on a Boeing 737 rather than an old Russian aircraft. Service and aircrew nothing out of the ordinary but polite and courteous. Cold Meal provided even though the flight is only 2 hours - again a typical Eastern European meal not to everybody's liking but filled a hole when arriving late at night.

### Ural Airlines customer review
DME-SVX. Arrived two hours before for our flight for Ekaterinburg to discover they had merged it with another to Chita leaving us stuck there for an extra three hours. When I finally found the Urals desk after 30 minutes of searching I asked why they had merged the flights. Well everyone does it why have an empty plane to Chita when we can have full one to Ekaterinburg. Makes sense so why have it on the timetable at all. Everyone does it she insisted. When I asked what we were supposed to do for three hours she shrugged her shoulders said 'Do what you want I don't care' When we started boarding they had put everyone onto a Il-86 and from there the service improved. The plane which was a bit worn but well looked after was big enough to accommodate our stroller in its cargo hold rather than the luggage hold and the cabin staff made an effort to be friendly and helpful. The food was superb and had a well thought out meal. There was plenty of reading material and if it wasn't for the attitude on the ground this would be a glowing review but the unannounced merging of flights the rudeness of the desk staff as well as getting into Ekaterinburg 4 hours later than planned spoilt an otherwise excellent flight.
