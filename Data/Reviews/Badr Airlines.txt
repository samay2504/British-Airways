### "great flight and experience"
Khartoum to El Fashir, the capital of North Darfur in the Sudan, the 1hr 20 minute flight departed and arrived on time. Polite crew who patiently showed people to their seats. Two bread rolls (one with cheese the other with chicken), a cake, water, soft drink followed by tea and coffee was provided. This is more than BA can provide on their domestic or European routes so if Badr airlines can provide it in Sudan on a domestic flight to Darfur why can't BA? Overall a great flight and experience.
