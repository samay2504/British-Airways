### "rude and disrespectful staff"
I have booked the seats for me and my daughter and the staff changed the seats which made me 36 and my daughter 15. When I asked the staff to keep our seats she said it’s system and when I asked at least put my daughter next to me she said it’s not my job. The surprise that the seat next to me in 36 was empty. Really rude and disrespectful staff

### "worst airline experience"
Not Verified |   The worst airline experience of my life. The staff are incompetent, unprofessional and unhelpful. They refused to let us board our connecting flight (despite a delay on their end), made us wait for over two hours to rebook us, only for us to find out (by checking the airport screen) that our flight was anyway delayed by 4 hours!

### "a greedy company to be avoided"
Not Verified | This airline has been Ajet and now the service is horrible. Very greedy and unprofessional. I cancelled my flight due to illness and they had to refund according to terms but they haven’t. Horrible service, selling even water after paying hundreds of pounds for ticket. Such a greedy company to be avoided!

### "chaotic circus—door-to-door"
Not Verified |  Anadolu Jet has launched AJET, I had a flight with them with a route from Dubai to Izmir. From ground services to their timings, it was a chaotic circus—door-to-door max. The 7-hour journey is now in its 17th hour, and they are unable to find the luggage of only four people in Izmir. Everything that can happen wrong, from not being able to print boarding passes to delaying every connected flight and sending luggage to the wrong destination happened.

### "wasn’t a good experience"
Not Verified |   This trip wasn’t a good experience. The staff was very blunt and rude. The staff on Sabiha international airport is even worse. It was my first time at this airport and even the way they check for security is extremely uncomfortable, the body check for females is done openly and in the most obscene manner with staff shouting at you. I am not generally the kind to complain and leave a review, but if anyone here reads my review and is able to avoid this unpleasant experience then at least I’ve done my job by helping you. Please avoid this airline and avoid traveling via this airport.

### “unpleasant cabin crew”
Never again! The worst airline ever, horrible ground staff at SAW airport, unpleasant cabin crew, delays of a few hours, not speaking English, announcements in Turkish only! Lost baggage, stress and inconveniences with no compensation. I flew from SJJ to DXB over SAW to and back, both times delays, drama and no one was responsible. Avoid.

### "I would avoid like the plague"
Not Verified |  Avoid, especially if expecting to join a connecting flight as they will be at least an hour late arriving. Used several times on this route and they have never once been on time. Also to bear in mind, unless booked well in advance they are not much cheaper than alternatives from the larger and better airports. Turkish Airlines have systemically withdrawn services from Istanbul Sabhia making it next to useless as a transit hub. Stansted is just too small and they expect you to walk to the aircraft in the rain and luggage is always late arriving from the aircraft and also left in the rain. AnadoluJet has removed almost every element of usefulness from their aircraft and kept it very basic, limited leg room, uncomfortable seats. (Thin cushions), No charging points even tho you need your iPad or phone for entertainment as there are no on board options. No wifi of course. Food is a really dreadful roll with no choice options. Drink choice is orange juice tea or coffee or water. Both thrust at you 20 minutes after seatbelt signa go off, so that the crew can go and sit down and ignore you for the next 3 hours. No communication whatsoever regarding delays and of course no apology for missed connections etc. I would avoid like the plague and as TA have done, remove anadolujet or AJet as they will become shortly, from any travel options you are presented with. Without redeeming features and not recommended.

### "treated us really good"
The flight from Astana to Ankara was delayed on December 31, because of bad weather. Anadolujet treated us really good, information was given, a bus came to take us to Marriott which is a 5 star hotel, we were given individual rooms, meals and spa. And the next day we were able to fly to Ankara to catch the new year . I almost became happy the flight was delayed.

### "customer care service is terrible"
I had a skateboard with me in a separate bag. At check-in they inspected it, put stickers on it and told me to take it with me on board the plane. I asked if it was extra luggage for me, I was ready to pay for it. The girl at the check-in replied that no. I asked again, is it sure to take it with me on board the airplane? The check-in girl said yes. I don't fly much, especially as I thought the staff should know better, so I listened. All in all, when checking my hand luggage, the skateboard was taken away from me by the airport staff. They didn't explain anything, just said "Problem", and the most I got: they took me to the AnadoluJet window. Actually, everything could have been solved at this point. After all, the flight was 2 hours away. Check-in was still open, a representative of the company could have taken the skateboard from security and handed it over to the luggage compartment at check-in. But alas! The man from Anadolu Jet without asking took away passports and tickets from everyone who was near the window. When I tried to explain my situation, I got only a dry nod in response, nobody listened to me. Then he explained something to the passengers for a long time in Turkish. Finally he said that we had to go with a man to get our luggage and then we would have our tickets changed if we didn't make the flight. He was asked, "Will your company exchange the tickets for free?". He said: "Yes. In the baggage area, no one spoke English from the staff (in an international airport on an international flight). I waited a very long time for my luggage, they didn't bring the longboard even though they promised. I had to walk around and communicate with airport security myself to have it returned. Next is the most interesting part. I go to the AnadoluJet window and ask to exchange the ticket. I am told the cost of the ticket is 16524 lira (about 550 euros)! I tried to find out why, in the end I got the employee's answer: "You are late, it's your fault it was canceled". Such a confident answer, although she didn't even know what the reason for the cancellation was. I tried to explain that it wasn't my fault that it was canceled, that at check-in their employee told me to take my skateboard on board, even though it was not allowed. And that another employee of their company said that the ticket exchange would be free. But the customer care service didn't care about that. The customer care service is terrible! In the end I took a ticket from another company, which cost 200 euros instead of 550 and there was no problem with the skateboard at all!

### "chaotic and unhelpful airline"
My flight from Stansted to Istanbul was delayed for no good reason and with no explanation from the crew at the airport and inside the plane. The crew inside reassured me I would not miss my connection to Tbilisi. However, we arrived about 20-30 minutes late and upon arrival, airport staff told me to go pick up my luggage (which took 1 hour to turn up) and head to Turkish Airlines' hotel desk. They put me up in a hotel and told me they'd rebooked on the same flight - 24 hours later! I arrived at my destination 24 hours late and AnadoluJet  are now denying me compensation on the basis that the delay was beyond their control - they are unsurprisingly doing everything they can to avoid providing me with evidence of that. It's worth noting the exact same thing happened on my way back though that time, I ended up spending 12 hours in the airport as they did not offer me a hotel room. Once again, they denied me compensation on the basis that the delay was beyond their control and continue ignoring my requests for evidence. Their customer service team is helpless and doing everything they can to avoid providing me with the information I requested. They are the most chaotic and unhelpful airline I've ever had to deal with and I do not recommend flying with them. I went to Tbilisi to attend a conference and several people who flew with Turkish Airlines faced similar issues.

### "An exhausting and stressful trip"
If I could choose 0/10 I would. An exhausting and stressful trip. Simply do not book with AnadoluJet (blue logo) especially if you have more than one flight on the same day, go with Turkish Airlines (red logo) instead even if the price is higher you still get your money’s worth with TA and you save yourself time, stress and exhaustion. I had a flight from Amman Jordan to Munich Germany via Ankara Esenboga airport and Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen airport. The flight from Amman to Ankara was delayed 45 minutes and everyone missed their second flight to Istanbul. I reached out to Turkish Airlines care point office in the Ankara Esenboga airport and they changed the booking to Istanbul international airport and from there to Munich, so customer service with TA is great but I had to wait 7 hours till my flight from Ankara to Istanbul and then another wait around 4 hours from Istanbul to Munich. Turkish Airlines airplanes are way more comfortable and more spacious. Take off and landing is smoother as well. Ankara Esenboga airport lacks informative staff, we landed late and no one was waiting for us and no one helped us we basically navigated our own way, the airport is almost empty. Please note that Turkish Airlines transits take place at the Istanbul international airport, which is always full of helpful and informative staff. AnadoluJet is a trademark of Turkish airlines (partners). Be careful when you book your flight, make sure it is not with AnadoluJet. TA flights are with the red logo, while AnadoluJet flights are with the blue logo.

### "the service was simply rubbish"
I think most of UK customers’ review does not properly catch the issue as most of the people return with many problems. First of all, it is not fair to sell tickets to customers via Turkish Airlines website without mentioning that the flight will be carried out by AnadoluJet. On a long flight for over £500 GBP, the service was simply rubbish. It was a connect flight from Antalya to Istanbul and then from Istanbul to London. The flight took off with delay from Antalya. The flight cannot even provide blanket and pillow on long flights. The cabin crew’s attitude was as if I came to their home without invitation. It was disgusting. The plane was not ready for a flight and refreshed. The seat in front of me was not properly cleaned and the crew expects customers to clean it for them. I give them an overall -0.001 and would love the UK Civil Aviation stop their flights to UK until important issues are rectified. I would love to petition this and see the government takes a step in changing this.

### " the service is so unreliable"
I never took a single flight operated by this line that took off at the scheduled time. The shortest delay was 2 hours even on national flights of 40 minutes. Support is completely absent and staff doesn’t even speak a second language. The money you save doesn’t really matter when the service is so unreliable

### "Extremely tight seats"
Extremely tight seats. I am 185 cm high and my knees are always touching the front seat with quite high pressure. I cannot imagine how people higher than me can fit in this seat. Flying like this for 4 hours is a torture. And you understand that for airline it's just matter of putting one row more or one row less.

### "No excuse, no sorry, just late"
Not Verified |  Being late 3 hours. People told me that this is quite normal with this airlines. 3 flights departed while we were waiting. No excuse, no sorry, just late.

### "Very disappointing"
I had three flights in a week with this airline, all three were delayed. Minimum delay 30 mins, maximum 1.5 hrs. Very disappointing and I mistakenly considered as Turkish Airlines via my flights agent. Never taking this airline again.

### "Very disappointing service"
Very disappointing service from the airline staff. Seats are very small and not comfortable, specially when flights for like 5 hours. There were no proper service on board. My personal opinion as compared to other low cost carrier this was my worst experience.

### "seats are really tight and bad"
Worst trip ever. For each extra kg you pay 12 euros, if you don't have pre-ordered luggage then a 25kg will cost around 300 euros. The seats are really tight and bad, I cant even fit regularly there (190cm height). Don't recommend to anyone at all, fly with other companies

### "not have a good experience"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed by an hour, no apology explanation or update, just left us waiting. Air hostess was rude for no reason. Did not have a good experience and will not use again

### "no free luggage to check-in"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience. We booked on Turkish Airline t0 find ourselves flying on AnadoluJet with no free luggage to check-in. So we had to pay to check-in our luggage. The staff were not helpful and not professional in dealing with customers especially the staff at the gate. The plane has no entertainment whatsoever. Not even outlet to charge mobiles.

### "the worst airline I’ve used"
This was a very quiet flight with lots of spare seats. However I was shocked how bad the staff where towards passengers. This was by far the worst airline I’ve used and made the customer feel really uncomfortable. Staff asleep across seats and the others had no interest and  looked disinterested. This was the easy stuff to get right. Early in the flight we were given a cheese roll and a drink, but after that not even offered a drink to buy, Tea, coffee, cold drinks nothing. For a 4.5hr flight this can’t be right or even allowed.

### "this was my worst flight ever"
My departure time was on 23.15 from SAW airport. I went to the check-in counter at around 20.30. As the counter was assigned to literally all of the AnadoluJet flights, I had to wait in the line for more than an hour and a half. When I finally reached the counter, I noticed that the staff cannot speak English effectively. In fact, they pronounced "kg" as "Kee Zhee". On top of that great experience so far, there still was a surprise awaiting me. Right at the counter, I realized that the baggage allowance for this flight is 20 Kg, not 25 Kg, and not 30 Kg. That, of course, was my own fault. My baggage was 7 Kg overweight and I was willing to pay for that extra weight. You may not believe it, but that simple process took almost an hour because it was so hard for them to accept USD instead of YTL or EUROs. Finally, after a long wait in the final passport control gate, I ran from there to the flight gate and reached there at around 23.05. But, it was not the end of that terrible experience. When I got onboard, I realized that the passengers are arranged as if there has never been a COVID 19 pandemic. Everyone was sitting in the closest possible distance from the next person and meanwhile there was no passenger in almost 1/5 of the plane. In addition to that, when I found my seat, I noticed that there is no room for my hand bag in the compartment above my head. When I asked the flight attendant for help, he, again with the most possibly basic English, responded that he cannot do anything because he does not know whose belongings are occupying the compartment. Finally, I should add that, I am from Iran and my country is not known for its high quality airlines, but even so, this was my worst flight ever.

### "The seat was the worst part of the flight!"
I bought this flight under Turkish Airlines name and I was totally disappointed when I saw the Anadolujet sign at the check-in desk. First of all, a delay without any updates: I had to check FR24 for updates. The seat was the worst part of the flight! I had a back pain right after the flight. Catering was awful. Lots and lots of unnecessary announcements made the flight even worse! They were not letting the passengers sleep at 5am due to their long and annoying announcements. Not recommended at all.

### "Very pleasant service onboard"
Not Verified |  Totally fully flight, Smooth and very friendly check in, clean aircraft & Very pleasant service onboard. Flight left and arrived on time with regular pilot updates. Must mention and thank Mr Metin whom I believe to be the station manger at stansted airport for going out of his way, helping my old Mother & carrying one of our bags down the stairs as the escalator was inoperable even we did not ask for help.

### "service provided by the staff was friendly"
A low cost sister company of Turkish airlines offering domestic and international flights in the European area. The flight wasn't bad at all, service provided by the staff was friendly, attentive and correct. We received a lunch package consisting of a bottle of water, fruit juice, chocolate cake and cheese sandwich. Not bad for a budget airline. Seat pitch was incredibly tight and anyone over 1.85m won't fit in. There's no in-flight entertainment or Wi-Fi whatsoever. We arrived in time in Istanbul.

### "letdown is the high density seating"
Not Verified |  A very good flight, the aircraft left a couple of minutes early but we landed 20 minutes early in Izmir, perfect. Again, like the outbound flight in the morning, a quick snack and water, coffee/tea service offered. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. A very smooth flight. The only letdown is the high density seating, but no problem for such a short flight.

### "I would use again"
Not Verified |  Izmir to Ankara. High density seating, a little cramped, but ok for a flight lasting a little over 1 hour. The flight left on time, a quick snack, i.e. cake, given with water and tea/coffee service. The flight attendants were attentive. A smooth flight, it landed a couple of minutes early. No complaints, I would use again.

### "more than 5 months to get my money back"
Istanbul to Diyarbakir. Anadolujet canceled my flight with no reason. It took more than 5 months to get my money back. There were 3 passengers in a PNR which I paid all of them by myself. They gave 3 different return codes and told me that each passenger has to go to the ticket office individually to be able to get the money back.

### "Definitely recommended"
Ankara to Antalya. The plane was relatively new with a nice interior. Coffee/tea and a sandwich/cake were coplimentary on a 50m domestic flight. I was really impressed. The seat was very comfortable and the cabin crew friendly. All these for less than 20 euros with a 15kg luggage included in the price. Definitely recommended!

### "Nice staff, Good coffee"
It was a connecting flight from İzmir to Ankara and Ankara to Ordu-Giresun with AnadoluJet. There was absolutely no delay. Flight was smooth like there was no transfer. Nice staff, Good coffee.

### "plane was really old!
I have flown from Diyarbakır to Çanakkale via Ankara with one day delay because Ankara flight delayed one hour. Ground service staff was bad in giving correct information, really slow in handling passengers with transfer flights. No guidance at the airport. Accomodation was acceptable but really short (10 hours) for one day delay. One meal ticket they have provided for waiting at the airport for 12 hour was not enough. Plane was really old. Seats dirty with past eaten food crumbs. My height is 1.76 meters. Area between seats were too small for me. Sandwich and tea they gave at the flight was ok. If possible I will not choose AnadoluJet again.

### "will try to avoid AnadoluJet"
We booked Turkish Airlines but this leg of our journey went with AnadoluJet. Worst plane I have r been in. Very little space. Everything was dirty. The passenger next to me found a used napkin in his fold up table. Flight was on time. Staff was okay, but i will try to avoid AnadoluJet.

### "always at least 1 hour delay"
I fly by AnadoluJet  8-10 times in a year. There is always at least 1 hour delay. Also don't trust their website, because on their website it shows as no delay, but at the airport there are delays. The seabus from Yenikapi/Istanbul to Bandirma will be much quicker, comfortable and cheaper than AnadoluJet.

### AnadoluJet customer review
Antalya-Ankara direct flights of Turkish Airlines are operated by Anadolu Jet that is a trademark of Turkish Airlines. Anadolu Jet has no Business Class Service and you are obligated to a low profile service as long as you don't transfer through Istanbul. For the CIP Lounge you have to pay an additional fee that doesn't fit with Gold Card holders. No options is a severe pain.

### AnadoluJet customer review
TK7087 16th Feb. Flew VAN to Ankara on 737. Flight delayed due to bad weather in VAN and because 2 passengers wanted to disembark after the final door was closed (which then meant everyone had to grab their hand luggage and the overhead bins had to be checked). The flight itself was pleasant with a small snack on the short flight. The crew were very friendly too.

### AnadoluJet customer review
Flight Antalya to Ankara flight on time pleasant air crew passenger given snacks and drinks unfortunately wanted tea but the crew did not have any milk which was disappointing as I have used Pegasus and they always have milk for tea.

### AnadoluJet customer review
Istanbul-Stansted return by Anadolu Jet- low cost carrier of Turkish Airlines. Both flights were on time. Plane was a tired 738 but for the money I paid for ( 250 Euros) during Eid it really didn't matter. Leg space is narrow but if you get front seats you could get a few extra inches. Complimentary food and snacks were served during the flight which is a plus since low cost carriers hardly do that anymore. Crew were friendly and pilots kept us informed. No inflight entertainment but again for the value of the ticket it didn't matter that much.
