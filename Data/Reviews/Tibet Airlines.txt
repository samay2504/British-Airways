### "would recommend Tibet Airlines"
Tibet Airlines offered great service and comfortable seating with ample legroom. Chengdu to Lijiang is a relatively short flight of 1 hour but crew were very accommodating. They had inflight entertainment showing on screens in both English and Chinese. Water only served on this flight, but would recommend Tibet Airlines.
