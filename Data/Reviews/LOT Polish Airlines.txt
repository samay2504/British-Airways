### "lack of information is rude"
No updates at the gate or on the plane; however, well over an hour late and sitting on the plane with no passenger information. Simply put, the lack of information is rude and unprofessional.

### "consider using this airline again"
Split to London Heathrow via Warsaw on 16th April 2025. Firstly, at Split airport, one has to check-in at the counter rather than online. This was absolutely fine and I was dealt with in a most professional and friendly manner by a member of the Split Airport staff, the young lady in question was both professional and friendly and a created a great impression of her company. Boarding was efficiently managed at Split airport and the aircraft used for the flight to Warsaw Chopin airport was an Embraer 190. The cabin-crew took security very seriously and made sure passengers complied. I saw cabin crew proactively checking the areas under seats and making sure baggage was stored away correctly. Transfer at Warsaw airport was efficient, LOT staff were on-hand to help passengers and alas my onward flight was delayed. However, they kept passengers well informed with text messages and announcements. The flight to London was on an immaculate Boeing 737max, the staff were exceptionally professional. A snack and coffee was offered. It is a shame there was no route map. I will certainly consider using this airline again should the opportunity arise.

### "I am impressed"
London Heathrow to Split via Warsaw and I am impressed. The website was user-friendly and online check-in worked well and the airline kept me updated with text messages. I found this efficient and practical. My one gripe was a very rude woman on the check-in / bag drop. The flight check-in / bag drop off was very early in the morning. The woman in question was very abrupt towards an elderly couple ahead of me in the queue. When it came to my turn the uniformed staff member raised her voice in an unseemly manner and shouted at me to remove my printed boarding pass from the A4 plastic sleeve I had placed it in. I made it clear that her manner was not acceptable. The agent continued a private conversation with one of her colleagues and literally clicked her fingers at another customer. The woman could not communicate in a civil manner. Setting the above aside, departure from London was prompt on a clean Boeing 737-Max. Although there was no inflight entertainment, the staff worked hard, were polite, professional and multi-lingual. They served complimentary tea / coffee and a snack consisting of a bun as well as the option to purchase other items. Disembarkation and transfer at Warsaw Airport was efficient. My second flight to Split was on an Embraer 190, again the staff were superb. The flight to Split was punctual and the captain bid farewell to the passengers as they disembarked. That was a nice touch.

### "return flight was a nightmare"
I was quite impressed by the flight from Istanbul to Krakow, I found the plane comfortable with an adequate service and I couldn’t imagine that my return flight was a nightmare and probably the worst in my life. We arrived at Krakow airport and we found that our flight to Istanbul was just “cancelled” no information was provided- We went to LOT customer service that informed us that our flight departure was changed to Warsaw and that a bus was waiting for us to take us to the Chopina airport in 3 hours. The trip lasted almost 5 hrs and no information was provided. We headed to the check-in and we learned that they couldn’t find the luggage and the meal we ordered and paid for online so we were sent to the ticket office at 8:00 and our flight was supposed to depart around 8:30. The ticket office also informed us that there was no luggage and meal included and we had to pay for that. It took a while to convince the ticket office that we paid and there was no need to be double charged and then finally they found it. No information was given to us about the departure time and we started rushing to catch the flight. During our marathon to the gate, we learned that boarding was delayed. We got onboard and we were informed that on the flight, we were not allowed the pork sandwiches we ordered, that the electric sockets behind the seats were not working. I am surprised to see the poor management of this common situation due to bad weather in Krakow. I think it’s not unusual to find such a situation and that the airline should be already prepared for this. During this 7 hours not even a glass of water was provided to us . Today we received an email that the airline cannot refund the meals that I paid for and were not served during the flight

### "beyond disappointing"
Our recent experience flying with LOT Airlines from Vilnius to Miami via Warsaw was beyond disappointing. What was supposed to be a smooth and well-planned journey turned into a frustrating and stressful ordeal due to the mismanagement and complete lack of customer care. We booked three seats, two for my husband, one for myself, an additional seat was added to ensure a comfortable journey for us and our pet. Everything seemed fine during online check-in for the first leg of our flight. However, at the airport, LOT’s staff only issued us two boarding passes and assured us that the third seat was reserved. When we boarded the plane in Warsaw, we were shocked to find that the seat we had paid for was given to another passenger. LOT’s mistake not only caused us significant discomfort but also resulted in our booking being falsely marked as a "no-show. The most frustrating part wasn’t just the mistake, it was how LOT handled it. Despite having clear proof of payment and check-in, we received no meaningful support or apology. To make matters worse, the cabin crew, while technically following procedures, lacked the most basic empathy or communication skills. No one acknowledged our distress, offered any kind of solution, or even apologized. Imagine being on a long-haul flight, having paid extra for comfort, and being completely ignored when that service was not provided. LOT Airlines may offer pet-friendly travel, but our experience proves that when things go wrong, they do not take responsibility. If you have an option to fly with another airline, take it—you’ll save yourself a lot of stress and disappointment.

### “do not care about customer satisfaction”
I had a terrible experience with LOT Polish Airlines regarding my refund. I paid extra for a cancellation flexibility fee, which was supposed to allow me to cancel my flight and receive a refund. However, after canceling, LOT only refunded the taxes and completely ignored the extra fee I paid for flexibility. Despite multiple attempts to contact customer service and providing all necessary documents, they refused to return the money they owe me. Their responses were vague, unhelpful, and avoided addressing the issue directly. It feels like they are just keeping my money unfairly. I expected better from a major airline, but this experience has shown me they do not care about customer satisfaction. If you're considering flying with LOT, be very careful with their refund policies—you might end up losing your money like I did. I will not be flying with them again.

### "110€ to check in another bag"
Not Verified |  We flew to Delhi and only on the way back they asked us to weigh our backpacks. Apparently backpacks can only weigh 2 kg. Not only is this weight rather unreasonable, the policy of weighing backpacks is completely ridiculous. It allowed them to have us pay an additional 110€ to check in another bag. They should have at least allowed people on a return ticket to fly back the same way they came. But it’s obviously a great way to make extra money which is earning them customers who will not take more flights with them. Additionally the food is abysmal, they don’t let you choose veg or non-veg and they served us a full-on dinner at 9:30 in the morning. The second meal was a tiny hot pocket. The toilets also became incredibly disgusting after a few hours with paper running out etc.

### “The seats were horrible”
Not Verified | I am so disappointed in the LOT Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft after this flight I just had. This was probably the most uncomfortable international flight I have ever experienced with the most uncomfortable economy seats I have ever purchased. I usually never upgrade to premium economy because so far had great experiences with basic economy with other airlines, until now. The seats were horrible. The space between the arm rest and window is merely a couple centimetres. The seats have no cushioning they are very hard, not easily reclinable. It was brutal for a 9 hour flight and I've flown 12 hours to Dubai previously in economy with amazing comfort. I always take a window seat due to my anxiety and the freedom to look out the window. I did not like the feature of the windows dimming and sealing on their own. Part of being in the window seat is to have control over the window shades for some people with anxiety to ease their comfort, and control the window shade. At some point I felt very nervous because we have no control, the cabin controls the windows on their own. Pitch black could not even see the blinking lights on the wing to ease my mind. Absolutely no wifi or no wifi feature, how suffocating it is to not have wifi and/or option to peek outside the window? How is this flying in 2024? My TV monitor was broken completely. The calibration on the monitor was not working correctly, so it was not allowing me to use the touch screen and I could not enjoy any movies entertainment or even the interactive map! Seemed so outdated and I'm disappointed I spent so much money on this flight. I would've paid almost half for other European airlines. I haven't flown with LOT in over 10 years, usually Lufthansa and I have it another chance. I frequently visit family in Poland every year, this was disappointing with Polish airlines being more expensive than Lufthansa and the experiences I had. Small detail coffee was cold and watery, fighting with bathroom doors to open correctly, but my main focus is the big details I mentioned above, this was not a comfortable flight. Very very disappointed and will never recommend.

### “Avoid them at all costs”
Not Verified | Flight was delayed with no explanations, couldn’t make the connection in Warsaw! They also change rules on the spot about luggages and staff are rude! Avoid them at all costs!

### "not fly with them again"
First and last time traveling with them. The crew looked miserable. My 70 year old mother was sitting in the aisle seat and they kept running into her seat with the cart and no apology. Her seat couldnt even recline. The food trays were very slippery and multiple people around us ended up spilling food. On board entertainment is bad. The seats are so so uncomfortable, there is no room. Overall just dissapointed. By the time the food was delivered to our section there was only one option. Will not fly with them again.

### "Very nice and smiling crew"
Was surprised how good it was. Very nice and smiling crew, bed quite comfortable, good choice of drinks. Did not really like the gluten free option as I got the same meal twice. Ground service was a disaster!

### “seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw”
TOKYO/NRT to WAW with LO80 on 17 AUG and back with LO79 on 29 AUG, in Business Class for both legs. I took the LOT flight for the first time in 4 and a half years. Before boarding, I knew LOT’s long-haul business class seat remains unchanged from my previous flight. That was why I thought I could get a tight sleep on a fully lie-flat bed despite no privacy around it. Something strange happened, however. The story is as follows. LO80 departs from NRT at 22:50. After taking off, I reclined my seat to the lie-flat position and fell asleep. In a couple of hours, I woke up. Surprisingly, I found my cell phone missing. I searched for it for 15 minutes but in vain. A neighbor advised me to ask for some help from a flight attendant and I followed her advice. In the meantime he came. He adjusted back my seat to the original position and took off the seat cushion deftly. I felt relieved that he had salvaged it from deep inside. It fell through a gap produced while I was reclining it. I aver this kind of happening is not rare because my neighboring passenger on the returning flight suffered from the same situation. Needless to say, I suggested that he ask for a flight attendant. I learned that those seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw, that is, almost no storage room. As far as an in-flight meal goes, I propose that Japanese meal be avoided. I also remember that a female attendant looked a little puzzled when I requested an individual dinner the trouble mentioned above. They may not be accustomed to taking individual care of business class passengers. No Wi-Fi service is available, on the other hand, the in-flight entertainment is limited. That said, LOT is still attractive in that they have the extensive network in Central and Eastern Europe whose hub is Warsaw Chopin Airport and the round-trip business class fare presented by LOT between Japan and Europe is two-thirds of ones by JAL and ANA.

### "Avoid LOT at all cost"
The staff at the boarding gate communicated with people as if they were soldiers, and we were second class citizens. No politeness, no style, no elegance, only rudeness. Basically they were giving orders as you would do with animals. Then later on I decided to add an extra checked in luggage online for the return flight but their website did not work, and I could not do that. I started a WhatsApp chat with their Customer service at 15:46 yesterday, and they answered at 9:57 am the next day. The customer agent was like a parrot, kept ignoring my questions, and kept repeating the same questions over and over rather annoyingly. Generally they are angry by default, with a lot of passive aggression. Avoid LOT at all cost.

### "refrain from flying with LOT"
Delayed 2.5 hours from London Heathrow to Warsaw. Useless announcements at the gate why it's delayed - due to late arrival then for operational reasons then we don't know yet then boarding in the next 10-15 minutes then in the next 15-20 minutes then in the next 20-25 minutes then unscheduled maintenance then departure rescheduled at 14.00 then changed to 12.20. They have no clue what they were talking about. In the plane crew announced completely different reasons. Rubbish service. On board crew didn't approach to take the order from SkyBar menu. Even after pressing attendant button, no one approached until the plane landed. Useless crew, useless attention, useless service, useless communication. Going to refrain from flying with LOT.

### "Extremely disappointed"
Extremely disappointed. First trip ever with lot, and definitely the last trip. I flew with my family (total of 5). The airline is not organized at all, and their agents do not care as they always replied with "I don't know"! They even skipped us while serving the drinks, then they stated it was by mistake. No tv screens on the flight. They cancelled the return flight and told us to arrange a way home. This cost me an additional large amount of money. Their airport in Warsaw is very small and boring. I returned home on Emirates.

### “everything against customers”
Not Verified | Horrible service information and disinformation, staff not following their own recommendations, everything against customers to charge more to give less.

### "experienced significant challenges"
I have experienced significant challenges with LOT Polish Airlines, as my flight was canceled three times in July 2024. I would advise potential travelers to consider their options carefully. It is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger care to maintain their reputation. I kindly urge you to take responsibility regarding the handling of my flights.

### "run in with one flight attendant"
The food is barely edible as it is, it is what it is. I have flown Lot since 1987 and for most part they have excellent pilots that provide a very comfortable flight. However their ground crew at check in is awful. I also had a run in with one flight attendant that wouldn't allow my carry on in the over head compartment and wanted it on my lap for a 10 hour flight. No reason, she just wanted it her way. Luckily another passenger stepped in and took my side. For the rest of the flight she was giving me dirty looks. Extremely unprofessional. On my most recent flight after check in and security, and everything cleared, I was also stopped by a LOT check in clerk that wouldn't allow me to bring folding fishing poles on board. She even called in airport security. I asked for a manager since I cleared it with LOT office before even bringing them. Turned out, The flight crew was lovely and gracious and basically told that clerk to sit down. But to be this hostile to a customer was just terrible.

### "fly LOT and have a LOT of problems"
As some will say, fly with LOT and you will have a LOT of problems. Even simple tasks like adding second baggage online are complicated. Originally, I booked a flight with one piece of baggage. Then I realized I will need one more. So, I pay online for the second one. My CC payment was accepted. Then when I arrived at the airport, a surprise. I was told that online payment is for 1pcs baggage but is valid for return Flight? And to check-in my second baggage I must pay almost double, 140.00 USD in cash only! Credit Card terminal is not working! Imagine this, major international airport and LOT is unable to accept Credit Cards payments?! What a Shame. Next, I ask to apply amount I already paid towards second baggage payment, since I never intended to carry any baggage on return Flight. Nope, this cannot be done. OK, I shelled out $140 cash and asked to refund my payment to CC. Nope this cannot be done either. I can only get a voucher for a similar service on the same route and must use it within 2 years. Thanks, but no thanks. I want my money back. The LOT representative was no help, supervisor was unavailable. I disputed this charge with CC. And guess what? LOT claim, that I have check-in baggage on return flight! No refund. Fortunately, I found a return flight Boarding Pass. And it is back on white - 0 Pices of baggage - 0Kg. What a LOT of robbers. Take my advice if you can consider choice of alternative airlines.

### "a journey I’d rather forget"
Not Verified | I had an incredibly frustrating experience with LOT Polish that I hope no one else has to endure. Red eye flight was canceled, leaving families with kids stranded without any sort of communication. Refunds are NON EXISTANT. You have to call a certain number that is auto-recorded! It was a journey I’d rather forget. I would strongly advise considering other airlines if you value comfort and reliability.

### “just a big scam organization”
Our flight was canceled due to problems at the airport, we had to buy new tickets at the airport (cash only because they said the system was down) for which we would receive the invoice later on by e-mail. Obviously this did not happen, LOT claimed that it was done through an agency at the airport, but they are also not prepared to provide information from the agency. This is just a big scam organization.

### “customer service is incredibly unhelpful”
Not Verified | Title: Terrible Customer Service - Refused Refund Despite Legal Cancellation Rights. I recently booked two flights with LOT Airlines but had to cancel the booking within 30 minutes of purchase due to a change in plans. According to consumer protection laws, I should have had 24 hours to cancel for a full refund, but LOT Airlines has refused to honor this. Their customer service has been incredibly unhelpful, and they seem to be ignoring their legal obligations. I've tried multiple times to resolve this issue, but each attempt has been met with resistance and dismissive responses. I would strongly advise against booking with LOT Airlines, as they clearly have no respect for their customers or the laws designed to protect them. I’m now left disputing the charges with my credit card company, which is an unnecessary hassle. Save yourself the trouble and choose a more reputable airline. LOT Airlines is not worth the risk.

### "worst customer service"
The worst customer service. Very rude people. They cancelled my ticket. This is my first flight and feel like this is a scam.

### "never fly this airline"
Not Verified | Most of the premium seats are in terrible condition and broken. Was offered a replacement that was a less broken seat, and the crew ended up giving the seat to someone to another passenger and that passenger decided to start an argument with me and crew decided to go along with it. I was told this is not America, these are Polish rules. I told the staff that I was going to email corporate, but they stated they don't care. What an unbelievable experience. By FAR the worst in my entire life and I travel a lot. I sent an email to corporate, but they gave a scripted response that was terrible and basically stated that we are not responsible for our bad behavior passengers. That wasn't the point. What about the premium seats that work broken? I listed three times in the email but they didn't respond or care about it and it make the situation even more comical, the seats on the return flight also broken! Please, never fly this airline and avoid at all costs.

### "tv screen was not working"
My tv screen was not working. I keep on asking crew about it they told me that after giving drinks service they will look into it. After 1.30 min I told them that they must do something about it. Crew told me tat they have tried but they are sorry they cant do anything about it. They offer me a small shot of polish vodka free of cost from skybar as they feel sorry about my trouble. Mine was a 6 hour flight my seat number was 12 b. I have spend 6 hours without any entertainment. I keep on trying to on the tv screen. In the end I just gave up. I feel if I have taken Qatar Airways in place of LOT maybe I will be better. On our LOT flight beer was finished and there was no alcoholic drinks served. Food was very normal and the crew simply does not care about passengers. They keep on doing there meal service & they will come back to you when they are free. Overall if you have choice of airlines then don't go for lot. One more thing the line at Warsaw Airport for passport holders was too long it take 1 hour for us to get a stamp. Honestly that's a very slow service.

### "Really bad experience"
LOT has cancelled my connecting flight to from Krakow to Warsaw at the last minute. I had to pay over $300.00 to get from Krakow to Warsaw by Taxi to make the return flight to Newark, USA. LOT refunded me $62.00 for the cancelation with no option to question or contest the amount. Really bad experience. Don't bother with this airline. Use other airlines to travel to Poland.

### "don't want to refund the full amount"
Last year, I flew LOT, and was stuck in the airport in LAX for 1,5 days. LOT kept on delaying and canceling the flight. Finally they got us home. This was due to technical issues. Today I am supposed to fly to Miami, but yesterday at 1715, they canceled the flight. I spend 6 hours on the phone trying to get through to them and finding a solution. All they would offer is a flight in 3 days from now. And to wait 2 days I Warzaw. I wanted to cancel the ticket and get my money back, but they don't want to refund the full amount because they offered me a flight in 3 days. I can only say. Don't fly with them. They call themselves an airline, but in reality they don't fly anywhere. I ended up buying new tickets with a real airline, and I do go today as planned. But to a different destination and at a higher cost plus LOT don't even want to refund my money. This airline is one big scam. Steal your money and never flies you anywhere, and if you want your money back from the flight they never did, then they also steal a part of that. If you want to fly anywhere, don't use LOT.

### “a great flight with LOT”
This was not my first time flying with LOT, and any previous flights with them has been quite good. This one was no exception, I therefore wanted to write this review. To give them a little credit. Firstly, the booking site has gone through some upgrades since last time, something that I was very happy to see. The ticket price was also not that bad (for a legacy airline), and cheaper than KLM or Lufthansa I could have flown on this route. As far as I am concerned you can find affordable prices on LOT even a few days prior to departure. The price you pay and the value you get on board LOT is also comparable, and in my opinion much better than other large European legacy carriers. For example: - I was offered to check in my carry-on baggage free of charge at the check-in counter, something that was a pleasant surprise - You actually get a decent onboard complimentary service, even on the domestic part of the journey, with several drinks for you to choose, and a savoury or sweet bun. - Comfortable and spacious seat with power outlets and a decent recline but I have to admit that there were things that could be better: - We had a bus-boarding in both Wroclaw and in Warsaw. That is of course nothing special, especially in the rush-hours at polish airports. However, all the passengers from an Embraer was squished into a small bus, something that wasn’t exactly comfortable in 30*C. I would have expected that on Ryanair or Wizzair, but I have to admit that I was a little surprised that this was a normal procedure at LOT too. And of course, I can’t wait for LOT to get their new planes, as they really could need a little upgrade to make the overall experience even better. All in all, a great flight with LOT, highly recommended.

### “the price is reasonable”
It was really nice. The flight attendants were kind and welcomed with laughter. The AVOD was great. I remember that the in-flight meal was really delicious and the snack bar later served Shin Ramen for free. Most of all, I want to compliment LOT Polish Airlines because the price is reasonable. At that time, I was going to Budapest, Warsaw, and Incheon, and the price of Korean Air's flight ticket was 3 million won, while LOT was 1.5 million won, half of that.

### “Poor and rude customer service”
Firstly, they cancelled our flight and gave a new date almost a week later. And on day of my flight it got delayed for more than 4 hours and when I reached Poland for my connecting flight, they said now we have to wait for more 24 hours for next flight. Poor and rude customer service. And they havent provided any accomodation , no food.

### "An efficient airline"
First flight departed on time despite late arrival from previous destination. Boarding fast and efficient. Seats with enough leg space (no emergency exit seats on this small aircraft). Cabin crew polite, they served snack and water or tea. Short connection in Warsaw, but they managed to transfer the luggage as well. The second leg departed on time, same seats, same service. An efficient airline.

### "frustrating and unacceptable"
Our flight has been delayed by over an hour. No reason or apology provided to the passengers. This is really very frustrating and unacceptable - I will not be recommending the airline.

### "Cabin crew polite and friendly"
Boarding in Bucharest by bus, flight in time. Aircraft with new-ish look, 2-2 seat arrangement. Cabin crew polite and friendly, served a snack and water/coffee during the flight. No charging facilities, no WiFi. Arrived ahead of schedule. A nice surprise from LOT.

### "The staff are so rude"
1 star is too much for this company! All the flights are delayed, the luggage are also delaying! A lot of people waiting and complaining. We miss our connection flight because the first flight delayed 5 hours. The staff are so rude, they offer solutions for the next 24 hour or 2 days to wait for a flight. And they rudely say "that's what we have, you can take your passport and leave".

### "not recommend to travel with LOT"
LO190 morning flight Tashkent to Warsaw on May 6th 2024. Economy class. No online check-in available ( local regulation). Boarding extremely slow and badly organised by airport staff. We spent 40 minutes in a bus (no AC, outside temperature 28 C) waiting. Finally we reached the plane - Boeing 737 Max. The temperature inside the plane was also very high. After another 25 minutes spent in a plane - still no air condition - some passengers started to complain on shortness of breath. Cabin crew offered them water. Departure was delayed approximately 20 minutes. Aircraft in a very basic version, typical for low cost carriers. No entertainment system, no WiFi. Uncomfortable narrow seats, very small, dirty, sticky table. After take off a modest breakfast was served on a tray. Beef goulash or chicken cutlet - quite strange choice for breakfast? The meal was followed by tea, coffee, drinks, red and white wine (cheap house option). Other alcoholic beverages were available for sale. There was one toilet in front of the plane for 6 premium class passengers and two toilets in the back for 180 economy passengers. The flight was 6 hours 20 minutes. Can you imagine this queue to economy toilets? Ladies from cabin crew were focused on safety belts and their make up mainly, incidentally were really rude to some customers. Before landing in Warsaw a mystery pie and drinks were offered. The pie was covered with foil with no description. Arrival at destination airport was 25 minutes delayed. In summary, I would not recommend to travel with LOT on this route unless you want to spend more than 6 hours in a queue to toilet, without any entertainment system, having bad food served by unpleasant staff.

### "experience slightly painful"
Night flight LO189 from Warsaw to Tashkent on April 30th, 2024. Duration 5 h 40 minutes. Economy class. Pretty new Boeing 737 max in a very basic version. Tight, narrow legroom, seats not really comfortable. No entertainment system!! Departure/arrival on time. After take off a modest hot dinner has been served ( choice of vegetarian lasagna and beef goulash) followed by small cake and drinks. Red and white wine offered free of charge other alcohol beverages available for purchased. Snacks and water available at the galley during the whole flight. Before landing sweet cake and tea or coffee have been distributed. Crew members - five young women - were fast and effective but strangely gloomy - they smiled a little bit (artificially) in a premium class only. There is no business class on this flight - first rows are called premium ( middle seat left empty, alcoholic beverages for free). In summary, the flight was just ok. Lack of any entertainment system and tight seats on nearly 6 hours flight make this experience slightly painful.

### "flight wasn't memorable"
I flew from Warsaw to Seoul and back. Before the first flight, boarding was performed by bus to very remote location. Cabin was cramped (poor legroom) and a bit worn but still pleasant. Appreciate snack & drink service before lunch with free beer or wine. Lunch so-so in terms of quality and quantity. Fortunately there were free snacks in the galley. On the way back there was significant delay. IFE system was to some degree broken (but content was quite good) and food was mediocre. I don't like that they dim the cabin automatically (B787 feature) even during day flights. Cabin crew was quite polite and helpful. Summarizing the flight wasn't memorable but also not very bad. I recommend only if found good offer for reasonable price.

### "worst airline I ever flew"
The worst airline I ever flew with. When I was buying tickets, it said that with Miles&More program I get free 23kg check baggage. Even on their page they mention it. However, during check-in they force me to buy baggage. When I wrote to support, they have response time 30 days. Really terrible service. Worse than budget airlines.

### “far away from business class”
April 21st, 20024. Night flight from Chicago to Cracow. Check -in really crowded, long queue and slow service. As business class guests we got invitations do Executive Lounge managed by SAS. Surprise, surprise... the lounge was closed. They work till 8pm only. Check - in staff was not too concerned. Happens!! Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner in old, basic version. Fully flat seats in a configuration of 2-2-2. Departure / arrival on time. Regular updates from cockpit. Right after departure drinks have been offered. From menu we selected corn soup and pasta. Soup was not available - only shrimps for starter, no other choice. Pasta was terrible. Duck was just eatable as we heard from other passengers. Quite decent selection of wines and other alcoholic beverages, cakes and cheese for dessert. The service was pretty fast - then lights have been switch off and passengers were left alone. Poor old - fashioned entertainment system, Quite limited number of movies and music options. Before landing we got another meal - no selection this time. To sum up, quite good premium economy, but far away from business class.

### “terrible customer service”
The flight LO003 from Warsaw to Chicago scheduled for April 18th, 2024 has been canceled 8 days before departure. LOT offered seats one day earlier/later or refund. No option to free rebooking to other Star Alliance airlines on the same day. After long and unpleasant discussions with customer service we finally decided to travel on April 17th, 2024. The aircraft was Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner - oldest version, quite cheap and tired. Six full flat seats in a row in business class. Not extremely comfortable, but fine. Departure 50 minutes delayed. Onboard service started with drinks, then dinner was served - 3 options (different than mentioned in menu) - fish, chicken, pasta. Food just ok, nothing to remember. Nice way of serving dessert on a moving trolley - cakes, cheese, sweets, liqueurs. Decent coffee. Entertainment system quite old-fashioned, rather poor. Second meal before landing - no choice this time. Modest snacks and drinks offered between meals. Staff in business class relatively nice and helpful. In conclusion, service onboard quite fine, terrible customer service, all together slightly below the standard

### "cabin service was excellent"
London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita via Warsaw Chopin return - 737-8 MAX London-Warsaw-London, 787-9 Dreamliner Warsaw-Tokyo-Warsaw. Family trip for wedding for three people (but not my wife)* - very cheap in my view at about £900 return each considering about half is tax. At this price you do have to pay extra for checked bags (we bought one). There is little wait at Warsaw both ways, which is one reason I booked this route, and also the starting flights are in the evening so no silly early starts. Outbound they waved us through a doorway at Warsaw Chopin to go directly to the long-haul gate and looking at flight times it seems they hold the flight if the incoming connection is late. Chopin is a modern airport that seems a less stressful place to change planes. You are asked to pay for assigned seats but I didn't waste money on this and on three flights we were given seats together anyway even though flights pretty full. On the other flight we were next to each other behind or across an aisle. Flights mostly smooth, planes clean and modern, and cabin service was excellent with skilled and patient aircrew. But the food is Polish-oriented and rather stodgy in economy but plentiful, and if you're coming back from Tokyo - home of superb food - this is a bit of an expected let down. If you like alternative/European movies there are Polish and some other arthouse productions well worth watching. The return from Narita-Warsaw routed via near the North Pole and was more than 1 hour ahead of schedule. Legroom on the Boeing 787 is rather cramped in economy and two of us are over 6 feet. Check in at Narita is tedious and be aware that if you need to buy another checked bag as we did LOT's online system didn't let us, and chatting online they only told us at the last minute we could pay for it at Narita (about £60 but ensure they bill it to one of the passengers without a checked bag otherwise you get overcharged as they did with us first). *I know you are wondering about wife - she went business class on China Airlines so we made use of her huge bag allowance!

### "not ready to deliver a pleasant service"
I bought a business class ticket for this route about 2 months ago. 2 weeks before flying LOT informed me that they no longer offer business but only premium economy. I asked then to pay me back the difference for this downgrade which they said they will not as they have sent me a 'voucher' instead. The experience on the Tashkent - Warsaw leg was absolutely horrible. The compartments where you put your hand luggage were full of crew luggage and blankets etc. The tray table were so uneven that a glass of water fell on my pants... food un eatable ( dry burnt chicken )... the staff tried their best but honestly LOT is not ready to deliver a pleasant service on this route! The charger for the phones do not work and a crew member told me this is always like that.

### "one of the poorer low-cost airlines"
Only two flights, but very likely to be the last ones with LOT. First a bit more than an hour then around 4 more on a tiny airplane, which really surprised me from WAW to CAI. But what surprised me even more was the service on board. From BUD to WAW it was an apple pie with water - not even a coffee, but okay, 75 minutes, I can survive. But then on the other flight, I felt like taking one of the poorer low-cost airlines. Seriously, nothing normal for a 4-hr flight? I remember taking Malév from Budapest to Krakow, maybe 20-25 minutes, with a lot better service. And zero in flight entertainment, of course. Anyway, what was even worse, the attitude of the flight attendants, the way the checked on the belt (that was in fact fastened), the way they suspected, I was not in airplane mode or the tone they told me they don't have blankets on this flight, which another flight attendant was later on handing out on the same class, so of course, I asked her afterwards. She was the only exception.

### "received a top notch service"
I have flown with LOT about 10 times by now and not had an unpleasant flight. This time, on flight LO234 on the 2nd of March, i opted for their business class product and received a top notch service. The cabin chief was extremely courteous, the catering of high quality and the presentation impeccable. Very smooth flight , that departed and arrived earlier. I feel safe and very well taken care of with LOT.

### “Really pleasant flights”
Not Verified | Never travelled with lot before, and after reading bad reviews, feared worst. But surprised. Got LO286 0630 LHR to Warsaw on Fri 1 March and back 1530 on 3rd. Really pleasant flights, Free Tea coffee Water, a snack (Apple pie etc) & chocolate bar, More than get from most airlines. Return seemed bit confusing when boarding, right before departure everyone had to tag up smaller cabin bags and told put under seats, cases above, Then human nature once onboard every bag goes everywhere (Smaller stuff in racks etc) and there was still space. This probably delayed departure by few minutes. Opposite way from LHR non of it and left on time. Flights great, Aircraft clean. Thank you LOT.

### "think twice before choosing this airline"
We recently had the worst experience with LOT, an experience that left us utterly frustrated and disappointed due to their abysmal mishandling of baggage. The representatives were unhelpful, providing vague and inconsistent information, leaving us in the dark with our damaged baggage. The lack of communication and transparency is nothing short of appalling. It is disheartening to see a company that seemingly prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction. The stress and inconvenience caused by the mishandling of our baggage during what should have been a straightforward journey is unacceptable. In addition to the emotional distress, the financial burden incurred is something I did not anticipate when choosing this airline. They have the worst customer service ever. That was our worst business class experience. They mishandled our luggage and they did not even want to be held responsible. I strongly advise potential passengers to think twice before choosing this airline, as the risk of losing your belongings and enduring a lackluster response from the airline's customer service is not worth the potential savings in ticket prices. Choose an airline that values its customers and can be trusted to handle baggage with the care and attention it deserves.

### "Buy onboard food is available"
Had 5 flights within 2 days on LOT. Still serve free food and water. Buy onboard food is available. Booking process, rebooking process etc. easy. Lounge is nice. During Covid a meal was served. Better than the normal buffet which is back. Staff from very friendly to I do my job. Ground staff can be hit and miss. Maybe I am lucky but using LOT always had good experience with their call center. Like the old C seats as space for feet.

### "do not recommend this airline"
I have the worst experience ever flying with Lot Airline. They lost my luggage and I wasn’t the only one. Now after almost six months sending a number of emails back and forth with all the information we’ve been told to send, I have never received anything. They kept saying that my luggage was not found and they transferred me to the compensation department with no one answering my request or even bothering to help. I have been travelling for so long with a different airlines but I never had the same bad experience. I do not recommend this airline to anyone. It is the worst ever!

### "impossible to change seats"
LOT is ok but it is impossible to change seats. Ended up squeezed to the window. I prefer aisle and also willing to pay for it. No luck with LOT. I was lucky to have business from Cairo to Warsaw. That was pleasant although the standard economy seats. The economy flight to Oslo was less comfortable.

### “It was horrible”
We made it safe and sound to our destination so that is good. There were 2 key areas of horrible service: 1) The boarding process on both flights was a zoo. There seemed to be no real process, everyone was pushing and shoving, no leadership or communication from the gate staff. It was horrible. 2) Upon arriving at our destination in JFK, it took a full 2 hours to receive our checked luggage. Some bags came out in a timely manner but 2 of our 6 bags were held up somewhere. There was a group of about 40 people stuck waiting for the remaining luggage. After 2 full hours the luggage was finally delivered. There was no help available from LOT and no announcements at all. We were just stuck waiting. Luckily I did not have a connection to get to but I am guessing some of the others did and might have missed their connection. Upon contacting LOT to discuss the horrible service and see if there was any compensaion, I was informed that they are not legally obligated according to some Montreal Convention to provide any compensation unless I incurred some out of pocket expenses. They did not care about my concerns nor my impression of LOT Polish Airlines. As such, I will be avoiding LOT if at all possible for future travel and I recommend you avoid them as well.

### "very disappointed passenger"
Not Verified |  Reservation is the worst I ever seen. We were flying in two groups, leaving on different dates and coming back on the same flight. The LOT reservation system is made that way that if you try to check prices for the same flight two or three times in the row on one login the prices are going up and up. For every check. Now we decided on flight and selected the flight. during the check out procedure (we even gotten the temp reservation number) lets say tickers were 860.00USD each way. During the checkout screen refreshed itself and we got bumped to the selection again. Guess what, the prices were 860.00 one way and 1400.00 return. The rest of the group were doing the reservation for the same flight with out issue. One person forgot to select the seats and meals and during the checkout got "kicked out" and when she returned back the prices were 1400 USD one way. So if your take your time to think, LOT kicks you out, or kicks you out if you check the same date and the same flight multiple time from the same computer. Its called "cookies". They track you and adjust the price while you are there. Premium seats with leg room come at a price of 70USD, 20USD and 16USD, depends on how much leg room you are willing to pay for. I flew with LOT 3 times in the row and each time with multiple members of my family. Each time premium economy. But after what they did to me today with price switching right from under my nose. I don't think I will use LOT again. Last thing, on the flight from JFK to WAW cabin crew instructed us to use the bathrooms on the end of the plane. With long lines. On the way back they let us use the lavatory in the galley between business and premium class. It seams that they do what ever they want or who they like. There are excellent stewards/pursers and on the other hand not so much. If you like LOT and you are willing to pay for everything we warned. The 2024 is my last flight with LOT, part of my group purchased tickets and I got stuck with high prices. That is a shame. I am very disappointed passenger.

### "never recommend this airline"
I booked round trip for Toronto-Warsaw-Mumbai-Ahmedabad. Departure flight because Warsaw to Mumbai flight was delayed by 5 hours 30 minutes I missed my connection flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, for that they did nothing, they told us that you have to go by yourself, we can’t do anything. I emailed them about that flight claim but they didn’t reply. Same thing for my return flight, they have changed my flight and given me another option I was ready for that but again they emailed me that that flight was cancelled by airline. What nonsense is this they are just wasting my time and money and doing nothing. I contacted my travel agency with screenshot of email from lot airline about delayed flight for claim for Mumbai to Ahmedabad flight but airline rejected that claim. I would never recommend this airline to anyone I’m just frustrated with them.

### "very professional"
Not Verified |  Our flights were disrupted due to snow bound and we missed the connection flight. When we arrived at Warsaw the team had all the documents and tickets ready for hotel, taxi transfers, breakfast and dinner included. All the process took less than 10 minutes without any fuss and extremely organised. No Faults, very professional.

### "Very old business class with zero privacy"
Very old business class with zero privacy. Food edible, but nothing special. Before takeoff my wife and son were showered with champagne, orange juice and water, so the clothes and seat were all wet. Got the half-hearted apology for this inconvenience and nothing else. Purser was defensive and said she had no authority to compensate for anything. I will make a complaint on website, but from previous experiences I know, it is useless procedure getting zero answers. Will try to avoid LOT in future.

### "incredible service"
Not Verified | I would like to express my gratitude to LOT Polish airlines. Thank you very much for your incredible service! It was my best easy  going flight! The pilots are excellent at smooth climbs and descent. I really appreciate the service of the flight attendants! I had a transit flight from Toronto. My luggage safely arrived in both distances. Guys, you are the best!

### "LOT should not be in Star Alliance"
This was an award ticket issued by Star Alliance. What a disaster LOT is, firstly changed flights 3 times outward journey, then ANA did not confirm ticket, so was changed again at arrival at Heathrow, and put on Lufthansa. LOT did nothing, the booking was in their website. Then the return flight cancelled on 22/12 for a flight on the 29/12 and offered 1/1/2024 flight. With visa issues, again ANA came to the rescue and changed flight back to Lufthansa. LOT should not be in Star Alliance, a total disgrace!

### "very questionable company policy"
Flight from Hamburg to Warsaw was delayed, my luggage did not reach the connecting flight to Belgrade in time. It only arrived on the day of my departure (i.e. two days later) so that I had to collect it myself from the lost luggage counter right before checking in for the return flight. I had to purchase toiletries and clothing for business meetings I had (trousers, shirt, underwear etc.). The airline offered a refund of max. 100 € only. How would anybody be able to find a full set of clothing and toiletries for such a ridiculously small amount? Also, when I finally got my suitcase, I found the zipper was broken. The refund offered by the airline was as low as 30 €! On top of this annoying situation it was absolutely impossible to reach anybody at the airline personally or by phone to assist. Any e-mail from the airline cannot be responded to directly. You are always requested to go via the airline website where you finally get lost and give up (the "customer feedback form" is absolutely untraceable). Conclusion: Absolutely awful and unsatisfying customer service! No noticeable intention to help or assist. A very questionable company policy regarding refunding!

### “Another smooth flight”
Another smooth flight on board LOT Polish Airlines—comfortable seats and reasonable legroom. Before take-off, the cabin crew handed out refreshing wipes. After take-off, there was complimentary in-flight service with water, tea, coffee, and sweet/salty snacks. Before the approach, we also received chocolate wafers and nuts, all free of charge, which is sadly not a standard among Star Alliance Airlines nowadays. This is a real advantage of LOT because you can feel a sense of hospitality on board. Alcoholic beverages were available through paid in-flight service at super-low prices. I am looking forward for my next journey with LOT Polish Airlines. See you soon!

### “such a poor service”
Not Verified |  Yesterday my wife with 2 small children were supposed to fly direct from Rome to Radom at 10am. The flight was cancelled, postponed till 7pm and redirect to Warsaw. She arrived in Radom at 2am. It is unheard of such a poor service and you should be ashamed. Not only we won't travel with you anymore but we will advise people to not do so!

### "Unprofessional customer service"
Not Verified | Worst airlines ever! They are changing dates whenever they want. They are cancelling flight whenever they want. Unprofessional customer service.

### “Inflight service very pleasant”
Another enjoyable flight with LOT. I like using Warsaw Airport for several reasons, Warsaw is not one of Europe's superhubs and the flights I have traveled on have arrived and departed with minimal delay. The embraer aircraft are very comfortable and LOT's inflight snack is sufficient for the length of the flight and very tasty. Inflight service very pleasant and crew grooming impeccable. I was offered the option of an upgrade to Business Class but, honestly couldn't justify the extra expense as the seats are the same only difference would be a slight better meal. Anyway, I will certainly be flying LOT again!

### "Do not ever use this airline"
Multiple things went wrong with my flight. Baggage size allowance is very small and I had to pay $68 extra to check 1 (my first) bag, and the staff did not weigh much larger heavier bags at all (other passengers). Boarding was delayed 45 minutes at the gate because of staff incompetence. They went around manually asking everyone in a large unorganized crowd if they had special needs. Then called row #s and did not enforce the rows so everyone boarded randomly. Because of the 45min delay the gate right next to my flight, on Air Lingus, also started boarding at the same exact time. So two crowds, one managed and one mismanaged (LOT), some going into the wrong line. Then we take off, 8 hour flight. They feed us asap. Then we get one cup of water and hour after and then almost five hours of no beverage service. The air-conditioning was non existent and cabin was 85+ degrees. I press the call service button, two other people do as well. Multiple flight attendants walk by and ignore the big blue assistance needed lights. Half hour later I go in the back and five 20 something attendants are standing around chatting. No water service for five hours? I ask them why didn't they respond to the assistance lights? Some people push it by accident" they tell me - so what, you never check any assistance buttons because sometimes someone presses it accidentally? There were three of us waiting. The I say "multiple attendants passed by my row, some of them the same guy three times without checking.". Oh they tell me "then you should have stopped us. Then they start beverage service a few min after I get back to my seat. Then one of them ignores me during beverage service. Petty incompetence. Do not ever use this airline. Expensive asf too.

### “Highly recommend Premium Economy”
Brilliant Premium Economy flight. It was a return flight from Tokyo so decided to upgrade to premium economy and I have to say the quality of the service exceeded my expectations. During check in I was able to avail of the business and premium check in desk as well as fast track security, same happened during boarding. After entering aircraft I was welcomed with a drink. The seats were very comfortable I have to say, had a very good sleep compared to the standard economy class. Very nice amenity kit provided as well as blanket and pillow. Food I have to say was unreal. At first glance the food looked different from normal food but it tasted very nice as I never imagined eating such combinations and was pleasantly surprised. There was a very pleasant cabin crew lady assigned just for the PE class, very nice and helpful lady, good variety of drinks available on request. One of my best flight experiences so far, despite very long fight, the pleasantness of this service made it feel very short and comfortable. Highly recommend the Premium Economy class on this route and will use it again on my next trips between Japan and Poland.

### “left alone and stuck in a foreign country”
Not Verified | Be prepared for the worst flying experience you could ever have in your life! The airport staff and flight attendants are rude and refuse to answer any simple question or give any directions in English. They seem to be constantly angry and frustrated. So very strange for an international company! And don't even think that if you call Customer Service anything will be done to help you or give you a decent alternative. Customer service agents do not have a respectful or professional approach to people. They just inform you that it's none of their business if you run into problems, that you should have read their "terms and policies" before you even consider booking a flight with them, and, in conclusion, that it's just your responsibility to find a solution. They assertively say, in a repetitive manner, that your problem is none of their business! With "the help" of Lot Polish Airline, I was left alone and stuck in a foreign country airport that doesn't care about people, unable to continue my journey or return to my country. This company is a real nightmare!

### "Avoid traveling with this company"
Not Verified |  Avoid traveling with this company. Awful experience! They canceled the reservation without any notification. You may find out with less 36 hours before your flight when you will try to do the online check in. Also their website does not offer any info regarding the issue in these situations based on your booking reference. You need to contact them on phone an they will pass you from one operator to another and even finish the call during this. If you get the chance to talk to somebody entitled to give you any info they just tell that it has been canceled and try to sell you an overpriced ticket (ex. 700 euros for a 100 euros flight). Even low cost companies act more in favor of their clients. Anyway just choose a serious airline, not LOT. It will cost you more than you think eventually due to their lack of customer care.

### "The nightmare isn't worth it"
LOT Polish Airlines shouldn't be in business because they are incapable of doing their job. I regret booking our vacation up using this sorry joke of an airline. This was supposed to be multiple destination trip. LA to NYC with 4 nights stay and NYC to Moldova for 4 days as well to visit family. October 9th through 19th. We booked weeks in advance. A week before the trip we received an email saying that our return flight has been canceled and we fly back on the 22nd. No options offered or apologies. As if this is acceptable. People chose certain dates because they have to go back to work! We tried calling them and Expedia. Expedia couldn't do anything so we had to deal with LOT. They didn't accommodate us to return on the day we were supposed to. Not even the day before. It was the 17th of October they offered instead of 19th and we have to spend a night in Warsaw. Before we had a good connection. So we lost 2 days of the trip already.. Now to make it worse when we arrived to JFK on the 13th for our flight to Moldova our plane was broken and they failed to fix it for nearly 5 hours. Needless to say we missed our connection and had to stay in Warsaw yet again! That's another day taken out of my time with family. Absolutely unacceptable. We were supposed to have 4 days in Chisinau and ended up with 1 and a half. They do give you vouchers for hotels, meals and taxi. But that hotel is a whole review on its own and not a good one. They turned our vacation into a trip from hell. I will never fly with them again.. What a joke. Please don't use them no matter how budget friendly the fares are. The nightmare isn't worth it!

### "Rude, unpleasant and impolite"
Rude, unpleasant and impolite ground staff. Even at the business check-in counters at their main airport in Warsaw. Terrible customer service. They have an attitude of bush people. LOT is also Poland’s national carrier. What sort of reputation and impression do you think it will give LOT as brand and Poland as a country? Management deserves to be sacked.

### "I will never fly with LOT"
The flight was canceled only one night before departure! They arranged another transfer flight with more than one day delay for us via Frankfurt. They declined my claim without any compensation. I will never fly with LOT.

### "a tremendous experience for a budget airline"
I am very satisfied with the flight itself and the onboard service. Everything went seamless and I honestly enjoyed the experience. The LOT staff on arrival, in the Warsaw airport, were very friendly and helped me with the transfer directions so I managed to reach my gate very quickly. Then the staff which onboarded us were also of big help since I wasn't sure my luggage would fit in the plane so they proposed to handle my baggage without any additional costs. It was probably my best experience with a budget/low-cost airline so far. The previous flight from KIV to WAW > HAM was also fine and it was my first life experience with transfer flights. It's nearly impossible to get lost in that airport, especially with so many crew members around, you can always find someone to ask for help. (even the stewardess dropping some sparkling water on me during the flight to HAM wasn't an issue). The only negative would be maybe the luggage space in the aircraft and the relative small space for your feet between seats (I'm 190 cm high). Overall a tremendous experience for a budget airline, I will definitely travel more with them to Europe, Warsaw being first in my list (and not as a transfer point this time).

### "Definitely my last flight"
Not Verified | I took business class from Tbilisi to Warsaw and they have broken my suitcase (zipper as shown on the picture). Although it had TSA approved lock. So in case of inspection they should have opened it by that special lock - but no they broke it. Instead of refunding the suitcase costs that started to offer zipper replacement cost refund (so they broke the suitcase which had a TSA approved lock, I should have spent time to replace the zipper / which is in any case cannot be replaced and they would only pay few pennies). Definitely my last flight. Turkish, Lufthansa and all others are much more responsible on their mistakes and there is almost no difference in price (but in quality a huge one!)

### "Very comfortable flight"
Very comfortable flight with comfy seats. Cabin crew were helpful and professional. It is really great that there still traditional airlines such as LOT Polish Airlines that offers complimentary drinks&snacks through-out the flight. On domestic flight they handed-out sweet buns & on the flight within Europe they offered sweet&salty snacks, and of course some drinks, such as tea, coffee or water. Flying with LOT Polish Airlines is always a pleasure. Really appreciate.

### "staff behaviour was very unfriendly"
Not Verified |  Pathetic experience. Flight got delayed 3 hours. Departure time was 0800am but still standing at IGI, New Delhi. No Air condition. Crew behaviour very rude and no contact with passengers apart providing water. Moreover, staff behaviour was very unfriendly. I would recommend that it's better to choose some other airline if you can. Passengers are sitting in the plane from 0800am onwards and it is 10:20 am but no strong response when it departure. Please please avoid booking LOT if you have other options.

### "fly on more reliable airlines"
We supposed to fly from Chicago to Warsaw on June 9th. The flight was canceled 8 hrs later. We spent the night at the airport and then got rebooked to the next day. When we showed up the for the next day, we were told that they rebooked us on stand-by and there were 20 people ahead of us. We got rebooked again. Two days later we made it to Poland. We got $12 voucher for the entire night and horrible hotel for the first night. Nothing for the second night, no transportation refunds, etc. I requested the 600 EUR compensation. It took them 30 days to look into it. Then I had to fill out a form with my bank information for the transfer. 30 days later I still didn't get the funds. When I called the first time, (28 days after the form was submitted) they told me that it hasn't been 30 days. When I called 43 days later they told that the money was send a month ago and since I haven't received it, I can fill out another form. I was told that I can't talk to a manager and the person I talked to refused to give me their full name. Honestly, I can't imagine worse service. We decided to buy the tickets because they were cheaper. They are reasons why they are cheaper. I highly recommend paying little bit more and fly on more reliable airlines.

### "worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever with this airline. They cancelled my flight and when I asked to rebook for another one (the closest one), they said no tickets. Also, I confirmed that the next day I had 2 flights in Canada, Calgary and another city, but they just said it was not their fault. Also, I found that the Twitter site was available tickets for morning flights but they continue to say that they have only evening or the next day. The employee didn't know any info. After they sent us to some hotel when surprise no my name and 5 other people on the list. We waited another 1 hour at the reception. In the end I bought tickets with Wizz Air and came to Paris through Rome. Too much time, too much headache. Never newer again business with LOT!

### "very disappointed with the experience"
Not Verified |  Where do I begin? First off LOT decided to charge us for our baggage, when it was included. Charged it as excess when it was all under 23kg and 1 per person. Never heard of it using third party than baggage is not included in a international flight. Next food was very gross and poorly done. Not edible. The stewardesses are so rude and honestly I was shocked at how bad the interaction was. Like do not ask for anything. My 11month old fell asleep on me and they decided to have a full blown loud conversation about selling on board with another passenger in front of me. Of course woke up the baby. I have not flown in 10 years and was very disappointed with the experience. Fly any company besides LOT! All this on top of an hour and half delay because of plane problems. Normally wouldn't be an issue if you don't have a 11month old, 4 and 6 year old with you. This review included to my destination and coming back.

### "worst airline I have ever travelled on"
The worst airline I have ever travelled on. They cancelled my connecting flight and refused to give an alternative flight for over 20 hrs. No compensation or hotel will be provided to you in case of cancellation. I had to sleep in the airport for 2 days as I wasn’t leaving the airport due to the situation.

### "Extremely disappointed"
One of the worst business class services I have ever experienced. Don't waste your money, fly another airline! They are not helpful at all and they behave like they're doing you a favour by doing their job. Extremely disappointed, never again.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. I couldn't board my outbound flight due to recent changes in visa requirements. They said it was my responsibility, though I would appreciate a note about the change instead of 5 emails try to sell me an upgrade. Whatever I bought new tickets. The worst part is, they cancelled and resold my return ticket without any notification and refused any sort of refund. Never again will I be dealing with them.

### "they refused any compensation"
I am moving and was on a tight deadline and budget, yet my flight got cancelled and they refused any compensation, alternatives, or assistance to begin with! I spent all night alone at the airport, no “information” people available, though it is literally their job. Now, they lost my luggage too and are literally pretending to not know anything about it. No willingness to cooperate or communicate in any way by anyone. The worst flight of my life, because this flight literally ruined my life.

### "LOT cancelled my flight"
I followed the order of flights Gdansk Warsaw Vilnius. I was late just for the one of the flights Warsaw to Vilnius and I agree that Gdansk-Vilnius route was my fault. But now I speak about the return flight Vilnius to Gdansk via Warsaw 30 days later. LOT cancelled my flight from Vilnius to Gdansk and did not inform me with email. I did not miss the second leg. Lot cancelled it with no sense. It is needed to change such rules.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
I had a horrible experience with LOT Polish Airlines, it is the worst airline I have ever used. Despite booking economy standard tickets through Expedia (which did not indicate that it was a saver ticket), we were charged for our luggage. According to your website, we are entitled to luggage: https://www.lot.com/gb/en/journey/baggage/short-haul-baggage The check-in process was disorganized and chaotic. The flight was overbooked and my partner’s seat was taken by someone else. We were separated on the flight. The flight was delayed and the layover in Warsaw was so short that we did not receive our luggage in Beirut. The luggage was delayed 24 hours, which meant that we had to manage without our belongings for an entire day. We had to go to the airport again the next day early in the morning to pick up our luggage. On our return today (the 12th of August), we had to pay for the luggage again which is unfair. There was delay again and we did not receive the luggage as well. I raised a complaint and demanded a refund of the luggage payments and compensation for all the damage done. LOT did not even bother to respond to me. It is a horrible airline, I would never use again and recommend it to be avoided at any cost.

### "Worst experience I ever had"
Worst experience I ever had. The air hostess were not polite  and were unprofessional The meals were not good and my luggage was not handled properly, it was in very bad condition when I found it. The airline doesn’t take it seriously and don’t even had a look into my luggage or compensate me.

### "they are so unprofessional"
Not Verified |  We left Beirut to Warsaw then our final destination was Paris. Our flight from Beirut to Warsaw was delayed. So we missed our flight to Paris. We were routed to Amsterdam then to Paris. We arrived to Paris without our 5 baggage and without our baby stroller. We have a 2 years child and an elderly woman who accompanied us so we were left without their medications and without a milk formula and the stroller of our child. We were obliged to buy all new items again and we couldn't buy the medications without a doctor prescription. We have filled several forms and claims but they are so unprofessional and do not help or reply. We've been in France for more than 1 week and we are still waiting for 3 baggage and for the stroller. Worst company ever i do not recommend it at all

### "I will have no issue flying LOT"
Flew out of Krakow July 29. Checked in with baggage. Courteous and professional desk staff, airplane crews and gate agents. Never flown on an Embraer and was impressed with the leg room and cabin comfort. Departed on time and arrived on time. Baggage made it to Warsaw and then Heathrow with no issues. Understanding the past issues with the MAX, I have to say that this plane was still a disappointment. Not impressed at all with the features of the aircraft. Warm ventilated overhead air, curve of the window seat seems excessive, etc. This plane type is overrated in my opinion. However, the staff and punctuality of the flights overcame those issues. I will have no issue flying LOT over the low cost carriers in Central Europe if needed. Legacy airlines may cost a little more, but thats made up by the positive experience of the flights you take with them.

### "very stressful situation"
My 15 years old son was traveling solo, so he had "Unaccompanied Minor-Request for Carriage" forms with him as requested by LOT (on all flights). 1. Nobody requested these forms at all, he was allowed to leave the terminal without LOT staff checking who is picking him up. Makes that form sort of useless, so I wonder why is it required in the first place. 2. On his return flight from Katowice to Gdansk, he was supposed to transfer in Warsaw. Katowice flight was delayed 15 min. and as a result he BARELY made the Gdansk flight-meaning that the gate was being closed when he made it. My question is, since I bought this ticket as one purchase (not separate flight Katowice-Warsaw, Warsaw-Gdansk) shouldn't LOT consider that earlier flight is late and wait 5 min for him? Especially that he is a MINOR? This was very stressful situation for us and him. Wonder what would have happened to him had he missed that flight?

### "a refund for 37$ out of $650"
This company is very sketchy and has deceiving practices! Once they took your money - you lost it no matter what. Beware: don't request your refund to be processed through online- there is a trick they don't tell to people about - under "terms and conditions" in fine print it states that you grant them "full amount" and you agree to that. I called their customer service to book a ticket in April 2023 for my 75 y.o. mother and I asked them about refund policy - customer service rep. guided me to the web page and confirmed there is $200 penalty for international flights - economy class. I purchased a ticket for my mother amount of $650 in April 2023. Flight was for June 3 2023. April 30th my mother got into the hospital and May 1st I immediately called Polish airlines to cancel ticket I booked for June 3 2023. LOT Polish Airline agent said I need to go online and complete refund form - which I did. In 10 days I received a refund for 37$ out of $650. It was ridiculous and I called them multiple times, they laughed at me saying that there is nothing they can do and won't even give me a voucher!

### "Wonderful, friendly and attentive staff"
Not Verified | I really don't know how or why they got these terrible reviews, I fly domestically in the US on mostly discount airlines and have not flown to Europe since the commies ran the show. I hate to spend more than I have to and I got a great price, then my wife read these reviews the day before we left and terrified both of us. Here is what I experienced. Wonderful, friendly and attentive staff. As soon as we were up flying, they were on their feet getting drinks, towels, ear buds, and food service going. Also came through the cabin several times with water and snacks. I paid the extra $75 for the bulkhead seats, worth every penny. I stand 6'3" and weigh close to 300lbs. They could have been wider, but due to the bulkhead, that had to have the hard, not movable dividers. The space was sufficient. Food was pretty good, this is an airplane, not Morton's steakhouse. Some peoples expectations are ridiculous. Helpful staff jumped to clean, pick up, wipe down and help passengers at every turn, even saw one flight attendant sit down and chat with a young child while her mother was in the restroom. When mom was out, she was back on her feet working. The plan was spotless, with pillows and blankets neatly placed, it was a fairly new plane, left on time, arrived on time. Down side, No WiFi, with no explanation, Movie and TV selection was mediocre at best BUT it is 2023, so download what you want to watch and you will be fine.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
LOT is the worst airline I have ever used in my life. They called me 2 days before the flight and forced me to reschedule it for a second time in two weeks. Suddenly they could not accommodate my paid dog and did not call me back despite my cooperation and giving them a choice of days to fly in and out. Representatives are not trained to the level where they understand questions and procedures or they do not know the company’s rules. They cannot escalate any question to anybody who may solve the problem; it is restricted by their rules. So, the person you are talking to every time is new with limited understanding and abilities to solve a problem. They do not keep logs of conversations with customers and cannot forward info to the upper management team. Customer support looks like it is a third-world company. I warn you not to use LOT!

### "Their staff do not care about you"
I had a round flight from Toronto to Yerevan by LOT. They were carrying tires with travelers' baggage. Once I get to Yerevan and was waiting for my baggage, I saw more than 30 tires came out on the surface in between of our baggage. My baggage was broken badly. When I sent a complain via form, they sent me an email that because you passed 7 days you are not eligible for complain. Their staff do not care about you and no one passes the aisles during the flight and literally you cannot find anyone to request something! That was the most terrible experience I have had ever!

### "experienced my worst airline"
I have been flying for 50 years and experienced my worst airline episode in May on LOT Polish Airlines. On check-in I had seats 2AC and the young lady changed to 2DF, I complained and she called over a supervisor who said I booked on United.com and she could not change. I showed the email with seats from LOT and no help. Then I go the boarding pass with TSA precheck. I could see fast track on it. I asked at security and they said fast track not recognized here needs to say TSA precheck so strike 2 as I got into the much longer line. Next, I get to the gate and no markings anywhere on business class. So I ask and they say over there somewhere so when we line up all econ jump in front #3. False alarm as now will be 45 minutes late boarding late arrival. After that another 45 minutes wait on maintenance. That passes and no announcement. After people complain then another hour delay. This went on for 5 hours with little communication, strike 4. I had a 4 hour connection so went to the counter and waited an hour for them to tell me they can’t change as I booked on United.com. Strike 5. Finally the say they can’t fix it and to go get your bags back and come back tomorrow and give the wrong directions and carousel number strike 5. I canceled my ticket at that point. But United customer service agents had to insist with a LOT supervisor to get that done strike 6. United agents were great. It turns out the incompetent ground staff work for a LAX contractor not LOT. Btw the plane was scheduled for noon the next day and took off 6 hours late.

### "expensive with minimal service"
Not Verified |  VERY expensive with minimal service. For price to fly to the USA - 800$ for 4 hours flight - with NO seats, NO luggage, NO meal Terrible offer! I just had to take them due to schedule

### "I will not fly LOT again"
A very nondescript airline, colorless, tasteless and forgettable. The cabin crew were busy with themselves mostly, didn't care for the passengers. Entertainment was outdated and had a very limited selection (mostly cheap and popular shows and movies). Food was an outrage, heavy on potato salads and fatty beef with gravy. Timetables seemed to be superfluous and delays were rife. I will not fly LOT again.

### "do my best to never book LOT again!
I was traveling with my wife and 1.5-year-old baby. They delayed our flight by 30-minute increments, and never gave us a reason why. The original departure was supposed to be 4:30PM. At 9 PM, after 10 delays and 5 hours of waiting at the gate, they told us the plane would only leave the next day at noon / 12PM. We didn't stand in line for the complimentary hotel because we could stay at our friends close to the airport, but the people told us next day that it took 3+ hours, or until midnight. The following day at 9AM when we checked in they gave us food vouchers but none of the restaurants accepted it. We never asked for food vouchers so this seemed like such a strange thing to make us even more irritated. The plane was set to leave at noon / 12PM but they kept delaying the flight again by 30-minute increments and we were close to rebooking to another flight (where the customer service rep said that they probably won't reimburse us for), but then they finally announced at 4PM that we're ready to board. After sitting for an extra 2 hours on the plane, we finally departed at 6PM. We arrived at our destination 24 hours late. A minor irritant: We asked to have our carry-on baggage checked in because we were with a baby and it's easier to traverse the airport without having to tow that around. The first day they said they won't because the plane isn't full. At the check-in gate an hour later I asked if the plane isn't full could they perhaps secure a whole row (3 seats) for my family so the baby could possibly sleep between us. There they said the plane is full. The following day when we checked in again we asked if they could check in our carry-ons as well and they did so, no questions asked. So the first day someone was either lying or just not willing to even try to help out. I called customer service when we got in to see if we could have our return flight changed to a week later and they said that they can only change it to a day later per policy, because that's how much the plane was delayed. But, the day later date had a 16-hour layover vs our original 2-hour layover so they offered to shorten our trip by a day if we'd like. And to make matters even more mind-boggling I checked online and the 1-day later flight was actually more expensive then the 1-week later flight. They'd give me a more expensive return flight because their policy doesn't let them give me a flight that's further out than the delay we experienced. Other irritant: None of the tv remotes worked on the transatlantic flight, so I couldn't even turn on the light or do anything with it really. Final irritant: The seat I sat in reclined but didn't stay there. So every time I leaned forward to get my book or grab a drink, it came with me, and then I had to recline it again, irritating the person sitting behind me. All of this with a baby in tow. He was surprisingly patient though, more patient than a lot of the other travelers, also slept through the whole flight in the end! So anyway, worst trip ever on LOT's part. And then customer service couldn't even give me a different return flight (apart from one with a 16 hour layover instead of our original 2 hour) after a 24 hour delay. All this for $2,700 USD. I'll do my best to never book LOT again.

### "Not all they say they are"
We paid for two business class seats so we could have a bassinet for our newborn. Once on the flight we noticed no spot for a bassinet. We asked and we were told our seats were changed. Horrible experience with LOT. Not all they say they are. Not worth the money needed to fly and use a bassinet. Their reviews are grossly incorrect.

### "Very disorderly boarding"
Very disorderly boarding at Warsaw, and instead of ensuring a timely and smooth boarding process, unfriendly ground staff started measuring and weighing hand luggage just at boarding time. Pieces above 8 kg were forcibly checked into the hold, allegedly to save space in the cabin, and were not delivered at the aircraft but via baggage reclaim. I certainly won't pay (solidly) and fly an airline again whose ground staff bully their customers. Cabin crew were fine on both legs, friendly and attentive.

### "It was a torture"
The economy seats on such a long flight (more than 8hrs) are very narrow. I was seating at the emergency row, but this didn't help to achieve some level of comfort. I am only 58kg women with super lean body shape and practically didn't have any space to move. When meals were served I could use my utensils and stand up to eat. Men next to me spilled his drink, as he hit my elbow. I never flew a plane with such narrow seats. Some people were standing most of the flight. It was a torture and it is completely unacceptable.

### "appalling customer service"
I'd flown with LOT before so I already knew they were bargain basement, but sometimes given the combinations of schedule and cost, they are unavoidable. This was especially the case when flying in 2021 from New York to Europe for the Euros that had been delayed due to the pandemic. We had booked our flights and were all set when a week before our trip and completely by accident we noticed that unlike most other European cities, Poland wasn't even allowing transit passengers within their country. LOT's response of course was to blame it on us, as opposed to the fact they are Poland's national airline and at the time this information was very hard to get. We had to scramble and book an alternative flight, and after much chasing down they begrudgingly gave us each a voucher to use valid for one year. Of course, traveling from New York to Europe via the routes they fly isn't easy, so a few weeks ago we decided to give the vouchers to our friends who could use them before expiration. Upon trying to book the flight we were suddenly told that the vouchers were non transferable and non-combinable. The vouchers say nothing of the kind about any of these restrictions, and neither does their website. In fact, their website specifically says vouchers are transferable, but when pointing that out we were told these were a different class of voucher which just so happens not to be documented anywhere. We contacted LOT by every channel, and every channel just regurgitated the same response without being able to explain why none of these restrictions are documented in our voucher. Simply appalling customer service.

### "very comfortable seats"
Very nice trip,  clean plane, very comfortable seats. I was offered tea, coffee or water as well as a pastry. First flight was boarded by the bus which wasn't problem as weather was good and it went smooth enough, the next in the jetbridge. Overall recommend as they were comfortable and smooth flights.

### "I had the worst experience"
I flew with Polish Airlines for the first time and for sure the last time. I had the worst experience of my life. Stewards were rude and not knowing English.

### "do not follow their own policies"
On March 13 2023 I bought the tickets and within 3 hours after purchase I filled the refund form on their official website. After 8 days (21st of March) I received an email confirmation of my refund request which would be processed within 14 days. As per their official website, they have a policy called Procedure 24H, which allows clients to get full refund for tickets if request is filed within 24 hours after purchase and the ticket number begins with 080. My ticket matched both of these criteria as I filed request form within 3 hours after purchase. But on 21st of March I received a refund of 68$ which is not even half of what I paid for tickets (419$). Their support team takes ages to reply, both on Facebook messenger and Whatsapp. They do not follow their own policies, just trying to rip off.

### "I had the worst experience of my life"
I flew business class with Polish Airlines for the first time and I had the worst experience of my life, paid $2700 for one of the worst airlines. Their seats were torn. Stewards were rude and the food was very standard! I was drinking Irish cream liquor and after two drinks when I asked for the third one they said they don’t have it anymore. While I was just having my desserts they switched of the cabin lights for everyone and the passenger next to me too couldn’t even finish her dinner.

### "waiting for our luggage for almost 2 hours"
Not Verified |  We had never flown LOT before, and since the cost of the flight was less than our usual United flights, we opted for it. Before you do the same, ask yourself what your time is worth. After a 4.5 hour flight from Cairo to Warsaw, (our connection flight), the bus transporting us from the plane to the airport were 15 minutes late, and then a number of security checks, we barely made our connection (1.5 hours isn’t enough time). Then after our 10+ hour flight to Chicago, we arrived and sat and stood waiting for our luggage for almost 2 hours (with the rest of the passengers). Many missed connections waiting for luggage. No announcements were made as to what was going on. I spoke to a customs person, and he told me this happens very routinely with LOT. They are notorious for this. So beware if you fly LOT. Manage your expectations.

### "a poor product for business"
Warsaw to Baku. Such a poor product for business class. This is a 4 hours flight and no hot meal at all was served (just cold cuts basically) - even Lufthansa does better than this. Selection of wine and beverages is very limited, no champagne or prosecco of any kind, but a rather cheap Polish sparkling wine. The service is not polished and not very friendly. Seat is stone hard. No Wi-Fi on board and of course no IFE or overhead screens: the selection of movies streamed on-board is ridiculous in terms of quantity and quality. No in-flight map. The positives: the 737-8 Max used was very clean (and quiet) and the price was half compared to Lufthansa. Never again.

### "tired of airlines not really caring"
On staff at counter for check in, no information on gate, no information on boarding, boarding late, no explanation, airlines seem to for get the hundreds of people time, is not there time, this flight had no reason to not board on time aircraft has been at gate for hours. Really tired of airlines not really caring.

### "positive about the whole flight"
Very positive about the whole flight. Still they served a glass of water and cup of tea or coffee plus a small snack. I have read many negative reports about LOT, but this time I had the impression flying with a premium airline, giving a reasonable service on a short haul flight.

### "I missed the flight"
Worse airline ever with no care about the passengers! I had a ticket with this airline, I missed the flight and I didn't fly with this flight, however I was just there 3, 4 minutes far from the gate. The corresponding people didn't call my name, I didn't hear anything, otherwise I could just run to arrive to the gate for boarding, and even when I arrived there they didn't say anything, so I just thought the flight has delay. Then I asked people standing at the gate myself and they said boarding is closed now. I asked them for a help or rebooking the flight or even giving me a phone number to call the airline, they didn't help at all. Then I found a number myself and called LOT customer service, they also didn't help me at all. They could rebook the flight for the same day or even another day which is the least that every airline does that for their passengers but LOT customer service didn't do that. I had to spend a lot of money and time that day at the airport because of this. This airline has no customer service to help passengers and they actually don't care about the passengers and their money and time at all. I will never buy a ticket from this airline.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Worst airline I have flown with: they lost one luggage on the departure flight Dec 30, 2022 and did not provide any information about its whereabouts until the date of the return flight (8 days later). On the return flight we have spent the transit in Warsaw going from one LOT office to another without being able to get any information about the missing luggage. Also Warsaw airport services are very poor - security check operates with poor technology - passengers are asked to take off their shoes (never seen in European airports for quite a number of years now), passport control officers are unprofessional.

### "nobody wanted to reschedule our still valid tickets"
Not Verified |  We flew several years with LOT. There was nothing special, a lot of small delays caused by the not optimal organisation at Warsaw Airport (for example only 1 stairs instead of 2, which results in longer boarding & deboarding). Problems started as we had 4 tickets for us and other family members in 2021, as LOT Polish Airlines cancelled the connection. We were promised by the call centre agent of LOT that we can use these tickets when LOT starts to fly this route again, instead of refund. LOT was very happy that we didn´t want our money back due to the financial situation in Covid times. As they started to fly again in August 2022 nobody wanted to reschedule our still valid tickets. Surprising was the attitude, how call agents treat customers: arrogantly and dismissive. At first they wanted the conversation log, but as we gave them all this details, they suddenly stopped answering. We had a nice employee, who understood our feelings and wanted to help, promised a call back, but he never called again. We booked our tickets via online travel service so LOT refuses to pay as the amount back. But: due to EU Commission regulations LOT has to refund the full amount, independently of the place of purchase. Finally the situation is as follows: The online agency charges per person 40 Euro while refund = 80 Euro per ticket = 160 Euro per 2 tickets. Why should we pay for the cancellation by the airline?

### "flight was delayed for 1h55m"
Not Verified | I was on a flight from Korea to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. A few hours before departure, I received a text message saying that the flight was delayed for 1 hour and 55 minutes, and as a result, I missed my second flight and ended up spending more than 8 hours in Warsaw. My fellow passengers and I were disabled people who use wheelchair services and suffered a lot.

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
This was the worst airline I have ever flown with, the staff were miserable and not particularly friendly. They don't allow enough time between their own connecting flights and blame you for delaying the next flight when their first flight showed up late. On our flight our luggage also never made it to our final destination and LOT never took any action. They told us that we need to speak to the baggage handler and not them. The baggage handler told us to contact LOT and after hours on hold at our own cost since they only have polish numbers to call, they just tell us there is nothing they can do and that we should wait. Well 4 months later and we still haven't received our bag and there hasn't even been an acknowledgement or apology from the airline. When you call the call centre they say, they have no way of checking the status and you should send them an email. I have sent 5 emails with no response to any of them over a 4 month period and every time the customer support staff say they will tell the email support to respond and of course there is no change. We were also told to call Warsaw lost and found who again say to speak to LOT as it's their responsibility. We will never fly LOT again and would strongly encourage anyone else considering it to avoid at all costs.

### "service was horrendous and atrocious"
They cancelled our flight 2 weeks after booking without any notice, 4 months later we anticipated to take the flight and because we didn't know about the cancellation until the day before, we had to take a 23 hour flight (original was 12 hours) which included 2 layovers and overnight. 3 months later we have not received any communication about a refund for the expenses incurred during this long flight. Customer service was horrendous and atrocious, they hung up on me and gave us awful options for the flight. Wouldn't even give us a free seat.

### "no update nor refund for a claim"
After denying my wife from flying, due to a change of the airplane, they didn't propose her some alternative nor give her refund for her flight nor compensation as per the EU Regulation (EC) No 261/2004. We wrote to customer service , to claim department, but no update nor refund for a claim since 15.10.2022.

### "It was a nightmare"
Not Verified |  It was terrible. I have taken this airline which is YYZ to WAW (LO046). It was a night flight and I was taking window seat (J29). It was terrible flight ever to me. I was so uncomfortable and so mad while the flying. After finished meal service, almost lights in passengers’ area were turned off for making passengers feel comfortable to fall asleep. In the situation, I needed water and have pushed calling crew button. However, any crew didn’t come and check me. It has been turned crew calling light on more than 30 minutes. (The calling crew light was bright on still.) Actually, I could see crews’ area from my seat. Even though passenger is calling crew, they were just talking each other and never check passengers’ area. That seems they just enjoy the quiet time. I know I could visit crews’ area and ask them to give me a cup of water. However, other passenger was sleeping on my next seat. I didn’t want to wake him wake up. Therefore I was just waiting for the crew comes to me and help. After 30 minutes, this plane faced to turbulence and seat belts sign were on. Finally, crew came out from crews’ area. It was just for locking toilet. When the crew was going back, I said “Excuse me” loudly for calling her. She didn’t check me, even though some passengers woke up because of my loud voice. Therefore I shout “Excuse me” little bit more loudly again. Then, she came to me and asked to help. I was so mad in that time. It was a nightmare.

### "impossible to get hold of anyone"
Within 15 hours after booking, I had to cancel (ie well within the 24 hour cancellation window). First of all, virtually impossible to get hold of anyone. Eventually tried Facebook Messenger, as recommended on th LOT website. Took almost an hour to cancel the ticket, after which I was informed that it would tale up to 47 working days to receive the refund. Never ever experienced a similar lack of service level. This was without any doubt the first and last time I considered flying with LOT.

### "better timewise compared to the train"
I picked this as I needed to be in Warsaw early in the morning and this was the earlier flight of the day, way better timewise compared to the train and price wise I paid similar to the train ride with way less time spend to travel. We boarded the plane in the tunnel rather than the outdoor stairs which was good as it was very cold outside that morning. As I was asleep for most of the flight I missed out on the complimentary pastry and water but coming to landing as I woke up the cabin crew offered me the pastry and water which I took.

### "it was relatively cheap"
Most convenient connection between the two cities.As I needed to go from Bydgoszcz to Warsaw in certain time frame I found this connection to be more convenient than railway as it was way shorter but only small bit more expensive but for time concious people like me it was best connection between two towns. As Bydgoszcz is a small airport we boarded by stairs and had to walk only a small bit to the aircraft but weather was not bad so it was not an issue, again as on every LOT flight as we enter we get a sanitizing wipes, which was good. The flight was very short under 40 mins the cabin crew did a very good job providing complimentary pastry and cup of water. In my opinion one of the best LOT domestic connection as it was relatively cheap and the good service despite very short flight but makes it very fast journey between cities, would highly recommend anyone traveling between Bydgoszcz and Warsaw to consider this connection.

### "Never had any troubles on LOT"
Another flight on LOT Polish Airlines, very pleasant experience from the start as I boarded plane via the tunnel rather than outside and through stairs which was good in the cold weather outside. When boarding we received the sanitizing wipes too. The seats were very comfortable as they had adjustable head rest as well as possibility of reclining seat a little. Mid flight we recieved a free sweet pastry and cup of water. I flown with them before multiple times and as always they very good, the flight was short enough under 1 hour on domestic flight so price wise too for this trip it was good deal and very fast trip from Warsaw to Gdańsk. Never had any troubles on LOT.

### "Worst experience with airline"
This airline delayed my suitcase for 2 weeks and shuffled through my suitcase for personal items. After they return it 2 weeks later they don’t even bother to reimburse me for any cost to replace items that were missing. Beware traveling with this carrier as they will not reimburse you as any other airline does. Worst experience with airline

### "by far the worst long haul flight I've ever had"
Not Verified |  I flew with LOT on a flight from Poland to South Korea. TLDR - Don't fly with them if you have better options. This was by far the worst long haul flight I've ever had. I'm vegetarian so I require a special meal on flights. Updating my meal preference using the 'Manage booking' section in LOT's website was not an option for some reason, so I contacted there customer service. I stressed that the veg meal is only for me and not for the partner traveling with me, but when I checked in the day of the flight I found out both of us got the veg meals and that it can't be changed (according to customer's service, they could only change all meals). Annoying but manageable. However during the flight I found out there was actually no meal for me and I had to eat some scraps they had onboard. In addition, the stewardesses were not very helpful and one of them was very rude and kept hitting everyone with the service cart as she walked the aisle. On the return flight, there were no vegetarian between meals options. While everyone had cup of noodles for free or the option of purchasing sandwiches, there was nothing vegetarian except for chips and chocolate. So basically I didn't eat anything for about 8 hours during the flight, except for some snacks. To top it all off, they have the most outdated entertainment system I saw on an airplane and they also control brightening and darkening of the windows so you can't really control it yourself from a certain point in the flight. I wanted to write this review on their Facebook page but they blocked this option. After experiencing several flights with them, I'm not surprised.

### "never dealt with such a bad airline"
I have never dealt with such a bad airline. I boarded my flight to find out that my seat in business class is unserviceable, doesn’t recline or move at all from a bad position it was stuck in. How they can allow a passenger to board and travel a 8 hour night flight like this is beyond me. On all of the legs of my journey they have forgotten my dietary meals, they serve no vegetarian food, There is no internet on Lot flights either.

### "didn't fill out the Air Sudhiva form"
I purchased a round trip ticket from Los Angeles to New Delhi, India from LOT airlines via the Travelcation website. It only cost $685 for the trip. Paid an extra $200-$300 for some extra legroom seats. I took my pre travel PCR covid test, got all my documents in order and flew to Warsaw, Poland for my layover. When it was time to board for the flight to New Delhi, the flight crew wouldn't let me on the plane. They said i didn't fill out the Air Sudhiva form. I looked it up and it was just your standard "I'm vaccinated, here's the date i tested negative, here is where i will be staying etc. entry form. I didn't know it was required on top of the visa. I couldn't do it while waiting to board because the Indian Govt asked travelers to upload files in pdf format to their site. I could only take jpegs with my phone. My entire trip was canceled. Not rescheduled, not delayed. I stayed in a hotel, got my family to complete my Air Sudhiva Form and they bought me a new flight. It cost $700 for a one way trip to India. Warsaw Airport then asked me to retake a COVID test since 3 days had passed after my last PCR. I didn't have 3 days to wait again so i had to pay $200 for a rapid test. I did that too. I got on my flight, got to India and then paid $1000 a few weeks later just to get back to Los Angeles. I then started the arduous process of trying to get a refund for my canceled flights. LOT told me it wasn't their fault since i didn't buy the ticket from them. Talk to the issuer of the ticket" was their reply. I talked to Travelcation and they said "we didn't cancel the ticket so you have to get a refund from LOT". Back and forth, until 4 months later LOT finally gave me a decision: "We looked into it, it's your fault you didn't fill out the form. Talk to the ticket issuer". I forwarded this to Travelcation, they said "we're trying to get your money back". They said this for more than a week. Travelcation then gave me back $201.91 from LOT and said "Thank you for choosing Travelcation". Stay away from Travelcation and stay away from LOT airlines.

### "this airline is the worst experience I have ever had"
Not Verified |  I paid for a round ticket around $810. From Skopje to Miami I had 16hr layover in Warsaw. For my return ticket, they kept changing the date and finally they canceled it. I asked for a refund and I got only $200 back. I have been trying to contact the airline and they have been unresponsive and are saying that they are not required to refund you the money. I recommend never choosing this company as they have the worst service and they cancel/delay their flight all the time. I have been flying for a long time and this airline is the worst experience I have ever had.

### "Not a pleasant experience at all"
My 14 years old daughter was traveling from Poland to USA in August of 2022. She had economy ticket purchased at least 6 months in advance. Child arrived at the Chopin airport 4 hours prior to her flight departing and was told that she has a stand by ticket and she doesn’t have a guaranteed seat on the plane. Long story short flight was overbooked and agents used easy targets such as my daughter who is a minor, and to that polite one, and wouldn’t stand up for herself or doesn’t quite know her rights. After numerous phone calls to the airlines they did put her on the flight right before it had taken off. Not a pleasant experience at all. Lots of stress - unnecessary stress. 3 months later after numerous complaints of wrong doing, we have gotten an apology. Avoid at all cost, spend your money else where !

### "flight has been rescheduled without informing me"
Not Verified | My flight Skopje-Warsaw has been rescheduled for the next day without informing me (literally no email, sms nor information in the passenger space). Now I learn about this on the day of the flight. I was supposed to take another flight Warsaw-Paris tomorrow few. Now, with the hour you are suggesting, I won't make it for this flight. According to their webpage I am entitled to change the flight route but the staff tell me I can't.

### "I will never travel again with LOT"
On both trips the lost my baggage, on the way to Tirana they brought the baggage 4 days later. On the way back to Toronto i haven't received it yet. Very unorganized airline, service at best is mediocre. I will never travel again with LOT.

### "I'd definitely go with them again"
The flight attendants were all nice and even though I hadn't ordered vegetarian food in advance, it's what I ended up getting anyway. The food was good and after the long flight from Los Angeles to Warsaw, I took a much smaller plane from Warsaw to Paris. Even though this flight was only a couple of hours, they gave us snacks and drinks. And again, they were super nice and the service was great. My only complaints are that the seats were a bit hard (so bringing a cushion or using an extra blanket would help) and on the long flight, I couldn't charge my phone with the outlet on the seat. But these things were minor and I'd definitely go with them again.

### "a delightful experience"
Not Verified |  We have had nothing but a delightful experience, despite a missed connection in Warsaw. In flight, staff were professional and friendly. Food was good to very good and excellent beverage selection. Terrific coffee. The cabin was very comfortable. Our flight attendants knew we missed our connection and went out of their way to make sure we knew where to go once we got off the plane. The transfer desk staff were overwhelmed when we arrived so we went to the business lounge. The attendant there confirmed that we had been rerouted to Istanbul then to Tbilisi. We asked if we could instead spend the night in Warsaw and fly direct to Tbilisi the next day. We were surprised to be accommodated especially as we were given a voucher for a great hotel and meal vouchers there. We would happily have paid our own way. We then asked if it was possible to retrieve our checked luggage and were directed to LOT’s office in the baggage area. Staff there also proved to be helpful and pleasant. While I expected to wait an hour for our luggage to be retrieved, we were out in 10 minutes with our bags. I should add that you might not want to believe everything you read about Warsaw Chopin either. From security to passport control to random employees from whom we asked for directions, we were met with kindness and professionalism. I would definitely fly LOT again.

### "a pleasant, comfortable experience"
Not Verified |  After the disappointing reviews about LOT, we lowered our expectations to a minimum. As it turns out, it was a pleasant, comfortable experience from start to finish. The flight was slightly delayed by 45 minutes of which 25 minutes were made up en route. The service was impeccable. The seats are one or two generations back, reminding us of 777 biz class seating 5 years ago but clean. The food was fine, not great but not bad. Another delightful surprise awaited us at Warsaw airport. We had read about lines for immigration to get to connecting flights but were amazed to exit our gate, turn left, walk a couple of hundred meters and find ourselves at our next gate! All In all, a good experience.

### "The worst experience of my life"
The worst experience of my life. Delays on all four of my flights. They lost my luggage on the way to my destination and back again. I was without luggage for over a week. No response to emails or claims. No compensation. I was sitting away from my husband who was on the same booking! Outrageous service both on board of the plane and online. They are one big scam and waste of money, time and health.

### "worst experience I have ever had"
The worst experience I have ever had. They lost my baggage during my transfer in Warsaw and destroyed it. There was a lot of expensive stuff inside, and nothing perishable as they claimed. I will never use this airline again, even if I have to pay several times more for a ticket.

### "received seats in 3 different rows"
This was my last flight with this airline. One reservation ID with 3 people there (under 1 last name) and we received seats in 3 different rows. Of course you can choose seats by paying extra money in advance but if you don't do this you will be seated in different parts of the plane. Even contact with customer care did not help. And what's more: we were not the only ones impacted by this "algorithm". Even children with parents had seats not close to each other. This was 9 hours flight.

### "No proper customer care"
Berlin to Warsaw via Delhi. Try to avoid this airline as much as possible. No proper customer care, rude staff at airport. Denied boarding at Berlin airport because of delayed check-in process (received boarding pass 40 mins before flying) and delayed security check even we arrived 3 hrs advance to the airport, due to this we missed our connecting flight to Delhi and whole booking was cancelled including return ticket. When I asked your customer support team (after 50 mins waiting time), they're simply saying just book another ticket as LOT Polish Airlines will take 7 to 30 days (sometimes much more time) to respond to customer complaints. No staff at airport to respond to customer complaints, you need to reach out to their customer service, which will take ages to connect. I never had such kind of experience with any other airlines. Sorry to say that LOT Polish Airlines is having the poor customer support/service. One of the worst airlines I ever travelled.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Not Verified | Tirana to Toronto via Warsaw. LOT is the worst company I have ever dealt with, here’s why: 1. I was planning my trip back to Ukraine from Tirana to see my parents, it takes me 40 minutes to get to the airport from the other city by taxi, which I paid 40€ for. Once the check in started and it was my turn, I was told, that they will NOT board me on the flight. Mind you, no emails were sent whatsoever. I was told to call LOT for further info, their office never answers, anytime you call you minimum will be the 45th in the queue. I had my whole route planned, my second flight from Warsaw was departing 2 hours later, my bus reservations made from Poland to Ukraine, one after another. As a compensation they gave me the worst hotel room possible, very dirty and old, and also I was called from an anonymous number and told I can pick up 250€ in their office, which I did. 2. I decided to ask about my trip with them for later on This month to Canada from Albania, I have a cat I’m taking with me, which I couldn’t register through their website, their form just doesn’t go through. It happened once before once I used their company, but I ended up just paying for my cat in their office on the day of the flight with absolutely no issue. I told them I wanted to register my cat right now (this is occurring 4 weeks before the flight, I purchased the ticket a month prior to the flight), which they told me they DONT HAVE ANY PLACES FOR ANIMALS ON BOARD ANYMORE. Despite me pleading and saying that they can take their compensation back but just let me take my cat because an extra 4 kg will not harm them, and just make an exception for me, because they completely destroyed my trip, it was pointless, and no other option was offered other than paying an extra of 600$ to upgrade to business class so I can take my cat (apparently there are places for animals there), they claimed they didn’t have any places for animals on flights till the very end of the month, and even first days of October, so no other option was available. After me saying that the form on their website doesn’t work so I couldn’t have possibly registered my cat, I was told that they have a claim section on their website I can go to… I was in total shock because so much was happening already with my trip being messed up and me having to rebook everything, (still haven’t gotten my refund for buses I canceled and had to buy new ones), and now they told me I can’t take my cat! I understand that the people working there are robots, because they deal with customers, but you have to be completely heartless if I’m saying I can’t leave my cat because there’s nobody in that country that I know and just crying because of how helpless and lost I felt. 3.I filed for a refund and landed money to buy another ticket from another company immediately, because the later it gets the more expensive are the tickets. ONE WEEK IN NO EMAIL was sent to me confirming they have received my claim, (and their website says you can’t file more than once, or they won’t look into your claim at all). I Was told that it’s not 100% that my ticket is refundable, depending on the type of the ticket I purchased, gladly it was the refundable one but still!!! How is it possible you have tickets that are non refundable if I want to return them almost a month before the flight??? It IS MY MONEY. And the amount was 600$+. I came down their office once again to ask about my refund and when I’ll be receiving it, they told me 60 days, SIXTY!!!!! !

### "I wouldn't book again"
I was required to go to the checkin counter to get paper boarding passes even though I was not checking bags. After waiting over an hour, I learned that the line was so long because they were telling everyone that they could not have a carryon and a personal item (they claimed that this was the airline's policy, not because the plane was full). I showed them where it said it was allowed on the website and they ignored me. We then had to repack our personal item in order to check our carryons. This was why the line was taking so long, everyone has to do this. This whole process took over an hour and a half and I got through security just before our flight started boarding (I arrived 3 hours in advance). On the first flight (Tel Aviv to Warsaw on 737-800), the cabin crew were not so nice, and for a 3.5 hour flight, they gave out options for water, sparkling water, tea, and coffee. They also gave out a large snack but didn't have a kosher option even though I ordered a kosher meal with my reservation. They then sold other products like Pepsi and potato chips that would be free on most airlines. The in flight wifi to watch movies with that could be used instead of an IFE screen (this plane did not have screens) stopped working after we pushed back from the gate. The in flight PAs were not very understandable in English. We had to wait about half an hour after we parked when we landed in order for busses to come and pick us up. Connecting through Warsaw: airport doesn't have a lot of outlets or comfy seating and you have to go through security and/or passport control. On the second flight (Warsaw to New York JFK on Boeing 787-9), the cabin crew (or at least the flight attendant primarily serving my area of the plane) was really nice. The drinks selection was again poor, but this time included a few juices and sodas, but didn't have anything like coke or sprite. The kosher meals provided were good, but there were no kosher snacks given throughout the flight. The flight attendants we're constantly offering water which was really nice, but I would've liked it if they collected garbage a bit more often because that's difficult to deal with as a window seat passenger like I was. The IFE on this flight was amazing (compared to every other IFE I've seen in my life). It was super responsive and had a large selection of movies. The TV selections were slim (for example there were some shows that they only had 4 episodes of) but I enjoyed it and didn't find it frustrating to use. Probably the most annoying thing about this flight was that they made an announcement telling us how we could buy all this duty free stuff on the plane, but the announcement took like 10 minutes and it paused our IFE screens (and we had to listen to it in Polish and English). The seat comfort was reasonable for long haul economy. Two other things to note about this flight was that the cabin crew set the windows to 50% brightness (you couldn't make it go higher) even though it was a day flight, and the USB port I used to charge my phone kept turning off for fractions of a second at a time, which was fine for me but I could see would get annoying for someone with a phone that vibrates and/or makes a sound when it starts charging. Once we arrived at the airport, the bags took around 45 minutes to show up on the baggage claim. All in all, for long haul flights, once you're on the plane it's good, but I wouldn't book again unless I'm saving thousands of dollars.

### "Cabin was not cleaned"
Flights delay, bag destroyed, poor entertainment system quality, poor selection and availability of food on board and grumpy crew. Cabin was not cleaned after each service. The cabin was completely dark even when it was a morning flight. Horrible English PAs.

### "unfriendly and not very nice crew"
Even though the Polish are generally hospitable, the cabin crew should keep that standard in mind when serving passengers. Being niece and empathetic, making sure that passengers are comfortable is part of the job. I was on a 9 hour long flight from Warsaw to JFK, they served drinks (non alcoholic) twice. The products do not need to be rationed. The quality of service should match the price of the tickets (not so cheap). Additionally, the tables were dirty. Overall, unfriendly and not very nice crew. The airport crew in Warsaw - fabulous though!

### "Very poor service"
The agent provided the worst service on August 21, at Warsaw airport, Tirana Flight LO597. My carry on was overweight. She laughed, invited her coworkers to see the weight and took a picture of our luggage. They laughed at us saying it was the record, and were extremely condescending to us. Very poor service. Flew business from JFK to WAW. Informed Gabriela of my business ticket. She said you are in economy now. I hope they do better next time.

### "refuse to pay compensation for the delay"
Not Verified |  Due to delay at the departure airport I missed my connecting flight. After 3 hours in line to speak to the customer service, I was told that there were no flights within next two days that they could offer me. They advised that my best option was to make alternative travel arrangements by myself. I decided to take the train to reach my destination. The airline refuse to pay compensation for the delay or take any liability for the cost of alternative form of transport.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service! No way to reach them to reschedule a flight! I had a family emergency and needed to reschedule a flight. I called the airport in the country that I was visiting (Macedonia) and the local LOT representative told me that they didn't see any available tickets while I was seeing them online. I called their customer service number and it transferred me to the Polish number where it told me that I am number 80 in line. I called multiple times and the same; I waited for over an hour and I didn't even get to number 70. All of this while paying international tariff for calls! I emailed them, no response. I sent a Facebook message, no response. I called the airport in my home country, O'Hare in Chicago USA and they said there is no local representative, so they transferred me to the same Polish customer service number, clearly the same one for the whole world! Good luck getting through and ever rescheduling a flight! Good that I scheduled the flight through my bank, so my bank Chase was very helpful and able to reschedule the flight for me, otherwise I would have completely missed it (and never get my money back). I paid only $200 difference in price for the ticket (which was good for a busy period and last-minute rescheduling). Then I called the local LOT representative in the country I was visiting (Macedonia) just to check what they will say for this same ticket and they told me to pay $750 extra for the same flight (now all of a sudden they started seeing the flight in the system, but they weren't when I initially called) and asked me to pay in person which is 2 hours away from where I live and they were closing in 45 min. Bogus! Then, the flight was delayed for an hour and my connecting flight in Warsaw had only one hour layover. Good that they waited on us. Then it was chaos in the plane because they gave separate seats to couples and families although they purchased the tickets together. Lastly, I was thirsty for the most of the flight. I wasn't offered water few times like usually on flights.

### "don’t ever fly LOT Polish Airlines"
Please save yourself and don’t ever fly LOT Polish Airlines. They have the worst customer service. My round trip to Europe started and ended in a horrible way because of them. I am used to delays and realize certain things are out of their control but the way they handle them is unacceptable. My flight out of Chicago was delayed over 6hrs and they didn’t have a gate agent there until halfway through delay to provide any info and help with re-booking, even when she came she was useless. Didn’t provide any water or snacks either and most airports concessions were closed. Same for customer service on phone, you wait 2hrs to talk to someone and when you do they are not helpful and even yell at you. Coming back to Chicago same experience, waited for baggage for 3 hours after an almost 10 hour flight with a little one and when it did not show up, can’t find any of their representatives to help out with filing a claim and tracking where it is. Also their food is in-edible and they had no regards of my sons allergies. I had called to let them know he’s allergic to tree nuts and sesame and they bring me a peanut free meal which is not helpful and they don’t even apologize or try to offer solution.

### "Very rude service"
Very rude service. I had to ask for the basinet 4 times and was given it in a very rude way. My seat was not the one where infants on basinets seat. The family who was seated in the basinet carrier spot were very kind and exchanged seat with me, I am very grateful to them. Lost connection due to Airline delay. Treated as a criminal in the airport even though I was travelling with an infant and an 8 year old. Left at the airport overnight. I kept asking for a supervisor but no one came to see me. The only human thing that was done for me was to take me to my suitcase let me get the baby formula to feed my baby overnight.

### "Impossible to reach customer service"
Impossible to reach customer service. I’ve called, left messages on their fb page, WhatsApp and no response. Also, while I purchased Economy ticket (and not Economy saver) and had a checked in bag included from Sarajevo to JFK, on my way back from JFK to Sarajevo I was told I had to pay extra for my bag. This has never happened before. No transparency at all.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline, late from Chicago 3 hours, missed connecting flight in Warsaw, the stuff are so rude. After staying in line at info desk for 2 hours we lost chance to take late connecting flight they are so unprofessional. This is first and last time to fly with them. We had to spend night at some motel, coming back month later flying back to USA flight was late again 2 hours. They are so unprofessional I would not recommend LOT Polish Airlines. They don’t keep family to seat together, we were all over plane seated with strangers so be prepared for that. They want you to pay each flight each way $75 extra per seat.

### "I don’t recommend LOT"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my flight gave me a replacement flight over a month later and because of their travel policy you need to pay the difference between the new and old ticket if it’s one month after your original date! I needed to pay 350€ for getting my flight rescheduled. You can’t get a hold of them over phone, fb, Instagram, email.. yeah anywhere.. I don’t recommend LOT.

### "This hotline is a joke"
I am trying to change the flight date. Their Hotline has no German speaking staff, their English speaking Hotline took 59 minutes to connect me to a 1st tier person who could not help me and forwarded me to a "cashier" which put me in a new loop for another 50 minutes. There is no other way to change flights, their "chat bot" refers one to the same hotline. Making a hotline available that is actually useful is a primary service for any airline. This hotline is a joke.

### "I lost all my money"
My flights were cancelled. I tried to call both London UK and Toronto Canada Contact Centre and was unsuccessful. I tried many times in different times of the day, even at midnight. It was just a long wait on the phone. I got a queue number when I first connected (like queue number 65) and then no more indication or update of the status for how long one has to wait. I spent more than 30 mins each call but never get through to speak to someone. I wrote to different channels of LOT but none is helpful. I don’t know why they issued voucher currency that even their own shopping cart does not accept. I asked them to change voucher currency into their shopping cart currency, they said not possible. Their canned answer is book through contact centre only. Day after day's call and write to LOT until my vouchers expired. I lost all my money. How can they issue vouchers in currency that their shopping cart not accept? How can they honour their vouchers when their contact centre so inaccessible?

### "upset and stressed by LOT Polish attitude"
Not Verified |  Please read this before booking a flight with LOT Polish. My family and I were booked on a flight from Heathrow for the 27th July. This flight was cancelled, so Lot changed our flight to 28th July, but the whole could not be booked on the same flight. Some going in am the rest pm. The am flight was cancelled yesterday. The earliest flight they offered was the 2nd Aug, the day before they were returning. We have spent a total on 10 hours on the phone dealing with cancelled flight. Staff have unhelpful and twice hanging the phone up. Taking advice we asked Lot to find flights with other airline, they said they couldn't do this. They offered a refund less the 45.00 × 4 for baggage. They said this was non refundable. They offered a voucher that we would have to use within 2 years. As if I would ever fly with Lot again. We asked about cancelling the two flights that were leaving on the afternoon, this is the flight that they arranged from previous cancelled flight. We were informed that we would only get 30.00 back for these two flights. If I accept this I would lose 500.00. The purpose of our family trip was to see family who were not able to travel to our daughters funeral when she died tragically, last year. They were not able to travel because of covid. I have not asked for any extra compensation from Lot, only what I paid out. I have been left both upset and stressed by LOT Polish attitude.

### "friendly service"
Swift and friendly check-in at Warsaw Airport, flight on time on a spacious and clean Embraer 170, friendly service with a drink and a snack. Flight on time. Recommended.

### "The flight was nice"
At the start the flight was delayed by nearly an hour, we were given water before departure. The flight was nice with free drink and snack included and very nice cabin crew. Despite being over an hour late in Warsaw passengers having connecting flights were told the connecting planes will be waiting for passengers.

### "recommend airline on this route"
Very nice and pleasant flight with LOT on this route, comfortable seats. Flight took 40 mins, the boarding was fast. Was given a free drink and snack despite the very short flight. Overall highly recommend this airline on this route

### "had a very unpleasant trip"
I’ve Been travelling for the first time with Lot polish airlines and I had a very unpleasant trip. One of the flight attendants was very rude for no reason. I’ve been in the flight with my toddler who is 2 years old and he was a very good boy all the flight, sleeping. Ive been going to ask nice for some water so I can add in to the baby bottle and she looks very disturbed and just pointed me where the water was sitting without saying anything or trying to offer to help me. After this, I was just having my shoulder a little out of the chair and she came and screamed at me in polish, I looked at her and I said, “sorry I don’t speak polish, what is happening” and she started to yell at me “ oh, of course, you speak English I remember”. All I answered her back was to tell “you can ask me nice, not screaming or being mad.

### "rude ground handling"
Warsaw to Zurich. Incompetent and rude ground handling in Warsaw (LS AIRPORT SERVICES) crew lost our bags on a direct flight and found it and sent in to Zurich when we were on our way back so our bags stayed in Zurich. Ground Handling in Zurich (AAS airline assistance Switzerland) a bit overworked but still doing their best for passengers even in critical situations (lost luggage in WAW) On board, no complains everybody professional, polite end smiling great experience during the flight even in very stormy conditions.

### "worst experience ever with an airline"
My LOT Warsaw-Milan flight was overbooked, so I was left on the ground along with dozens of other passengers. We queued for 5 hours to get information from the LOT transfer center. They distributed water only after passengers protested. They found me another flight only after two days and they forgot to check in the extra luggage I had already paid for: this mistake cost me another two hours of queuing and discussions. My Whatsapp requests were never answered. By far my worst experience ever with an airline.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I flew out of Copenhagen (CPH) to get back to Toronto on June 23rd, Thursday. My connecting flight was delayed, which happens. I arrived in Warsaw from CPH, and because of a tight connection my baggage did not make it to Toronto. There was another flight arriving 2 hours later to Toronto, so I wasn't too worried about my baggage, especially that I flew business class. But, long story short, my baggage did not arrive, has not arrived, and I have had no news, and no way of contacting anyone. They only provide you with a fax number to connect for lost baggage! When you look up lost luggage, there is a website where you enter your lost luggage reference number, but it just says "still tracing". I know there are staff shortages, but this lack of communication is unacceptable. It has been 5days, and no word! I don't think I will ever fly LOT again. I do not recommend this airline to anyone after my experience.

### "Absolutely horrible service"
Absolutely horrible service, cabin crew doesn’t speak English, they are rude and not friendly especially if you ask them to speak in English. Very uncomfortable seats, dirty cabin, average food and no wifi at all, not even an option to pay for it, it doesn’t exist! When I asked if my connected flight was waiting because the original flight was delayed, they were rude and not helpful at all! Entertainment below average, earphones that are not working, usb plug can’t be used to charge your phone, no power coming out of it. Blankets and pillows smell bad and don’t look clean at all even though they were packed in a bag. Absolutely horrible! I would never use their services again!

### "not received my ticket money back"
Back in December 2021 my flight with LOT was cancelled. Until this day (June 2022) I have not received my ticket money back, not even mentioning the compensation. Moreover they refuse to give me my money back for service that was not provided. I definitely do not recommend LOT, worst experience ever!

### "disappointing memories"
Not Verified | Tel Aviv to Warsaw. We used service of LOT twice and never will do this mistake again. Lowest loyalty to the customer, chasing for money that’s all. Please safe your money. Finally you will pay more and stay with disappointing memories.

### "crew were distracted and disrespectful"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible service. Flights were delayed on multiple occasions. Check in took in excess of an hour due to staff disorganization. Airline crew were distracted and disrespectful. Possibly the worst flight and airline I have ever been on.

### "could be better, but it's not that bad"
Not Verified |  Checking in for the Budapest - Warszawa flight at Budapest Airport was really slow. Then we departed with almost 30min delay. So I had short time to catch the connecting plane to Vilnius. But the flight was pleasant, served some treats (apple buns) on both plane. At the Vilnius Airport I realized, my luggage was missing, at the luggage office they told me, it was on the next plane. Waiting a few hours doesn't hurt me that much. On my way back from Vilnius to Budapest went everything good. Overall, LOT could be better, but it's not that bad.

### "it charged me for the seats?"
Not Verified |  I tried booking Economy class I went through all the steps and when I came to the seat selection it charged me for the seats? Few weeks ago they changed their policy from 2 check in bags to 1 check in bag. I picked my seats and when I was about to pay the website cancelled my selection and took me to the first page when I tried booking ticket again the price went up by mora than $300.

### "wait for 6 hours at the airport"
After missing my flights because of repeated delays, today morning and having to wait for 6 hours at the airport, the next flight has been delayed for another 40 minutes! Can you even spell nightmare airlines !

### "First and last time with LOT"
A minimum of 30 minutes delay each time. No staff available at the gate at boarding time, no information about the delay. On the way back to Zurich, the flight was delayed 40 minutes! Took them another 10 minutes to open the aircraft gate and then transfer us with a bus to the transit gates. There was only 1 line for controlling the only 20 our luggage. I arrived on time and the gate was already closed. I had to change my flight and wait 6 hours at the airport. First and last time with LOT!

### "I wouldn't trust them"
We checked into our flight Prague to Tallin with a layover in Warsaw. When we arrived to the airport in Prague, we had our tickets printed and saw that we were on standby from Warsaw to Tallin but had seats since early morning for Prague to Warsaw. We we're not okay with this because as it is, we would into Tallin at 11:30pm with a flight to NY at 7am the next morning but then to also be put on standby? When we asked the attendants at the check in, they told us that the flight was overbooked and that we'd have to wait to speak to the LOT transfer desk in Warsaw. While we weren't happy, it was our own fault (I guess; still unsure how we were able to check in fine for Prague to Warsaw but not the end destination from Warsaw) for not paying for selected seats. I called the customer support line to try to upgrade. There are no upgrades available that I have to see the LOT transfer desk in Warsaw. I try to ask the woman at the gate if we can upgrade as well on the off chance maybe the previous agent was wrong. She says no, so I asked if she could tell us how full the plane was, she tells us not full but close to full. This at least gave me hope, though I still didn't understand why we didn't have a seat assignment at check in if the plane wasn't full. But anyway, we get to Warsaw, I go to the transfer desk where there is a huge line and my boyfriend heads to the gate in case someone is there with a shorter line. He comes back because of course no one is at the gate yet, we wait in line at the transfer desk for 35 minutes only to be told that they can't help us. Only agents at the gate. By this point I'm so frustrated because we were told by two different people to go the transfer desk just to be turned away. We run to the gate to be told we have to wait for everyone to board before getting a seat assignment. So we stay standing next to the gate until the agent tells us to sit and we will get a seat after boarding. He was right. But what I do not understand is, the flight was half empty. LOT was telling us that the flight was mostly full, even though it was not even close. We were told some people canceled, but not before leaving Prague. So you mean to tell me 50% of the booked tickets canceled their seats in the 1 hour we were in the air from Prague to Warsaw? Hard to believe. Not to mention the inflight service is laughable. Someone in first class was given a glass of white wine (we were in the row behind first class) but when the person sitting behind me (so 2 rows behind 1st class) was told they don't have white wine on the flight. Which was a clear lie. They caused us so much stress and so much anxiety. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them. They clearly like to lie to their customers about services on board as well as seat availability. I even purchased a new ticket for my boyfriend and I with Ryanair to Stockholm thinking we could catch our connecting flight to NY that way. So now I'm also out $175 because they caused me so much panic, for literally no reason. They are miserable, and not willing to help at all. They tell you to go to different places to seek help just to be told they can't help you and to go somewhere else. I have no clue how they are a star alliance member when this is how they operate. They could have told us it was half full and we would have felt fine and I wouldn't be out the extra money. Instead they caused unnecessary stress.

### "The worst flight of my life"
The worst flight of my life. I had my daughter and cat with me. I tried to book him a seat on the plane three times: by phone a week before the flight, on Saturday before departure in person at the airport in Wroclaw (all the time they said that there was some kind of error in the system and they could not tell me the ticket number for the flight from Istanbul - Dalaman), and on Monday at the airport in Warsaw. In Warsaw, they assured me that everything was fine and I could fly. Arriving in Istanbul, it turned out that the cat’s place was not booked, and my ticket (and my baby too) was generally with error and I couldn’t fly further. It was noted in the system that my ticket was used and I was flying, although the flight had not even started yet. Me, the cat and my little daughter were not allowed on the plane. I went to your help center, but it was closed. I was in despair, my daughter was very tired. My suitcases were sent to lost, because in the system they were listed as abandoned/lost. I spent 6 or 7 hours at the airport with a hungry child and a cat, booked a hotel (asked a friend to do it for me) and went there. The next day I bought another ticket and flew away. I want a refund of all my money but the form they sent me to fill out doesn't work (constant error) and now they don't even answer me.

### "The cabin crew were courteous and helpful"
Not Verified |  I always look forward to flying LOT Polish Airlines. I know I can count on the great service. Food is always tasty as well. My last experience was as expected, great. From the time we stepped on the plane to the moment we stepped off. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful. They were patient and ready to offer assistance to all passengers. It was another great experience. Thank you LOT for providing great service and taking care of your internal and external customers.

### "Such a disappointing airline"
Not Verified |  Cancelled on us at the last minute and ruined our holiday. Will not use again. Have asked for a refund but still haven't received any money back. Such a disappointing airline that can take and laugh as they screw you over. Would be nice to see them lose money each time. Sure things would change then.

### "This flight lacked professionalism"
I boarded the flight from New Delhi To Warsaw. I had a heavy carry on luggage. I wanted help to put in the cabin on top. The airhostess didn't understand and asked me repeatedly to pick it up. I told her I will need help from a guy, I didn't want her to struggle. But she sarcastically said she is a girl and can't lift it. First of all, she didn't listen and couldn't help but make fun of it. Didn't even call the man to help me, everyone was listening to this, at last an old man help me and picked it up. If this was not enough she skipped my seat while serving snacks and drinks. I had to ask her. It was very embarrassing. Other bad memories would be when LOT charged me 13k inr fr 3kg luggage, it was way too much, food was served a lot bt very salty, tasteless and water tasted salty n horrible. The flight was delayed by 1 hr. This flight lacked professionalism.

### "It was a total nightmare!"
The aircraft had electrical, engine problems while we were on board so it was delayed over 3 hours from the original flight time. It was a total nightmare! The seats was so cramped, no leg room, very old aircraft that makes a squeaky noise every time someone makes small movements in their seats. It was full when we are still in this covid situation. Terrible experience! I will never ever use this airline again.

### "helpful young men helped me with the issue"
I flew from Düsseldorf to Warsaw. Through several phone calls with Trip.com, with whom I booked, it wasn't possible to fix the problem Trip.com made themselves. Gladly at the check-in counter a very helpful young men helped me with the issue by calling his colleagues, without any additional costs. Last time I booked with Trip.com, next time will order my ticket directly with LOT airlines.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever, on 9.5 hour flight from Warsaw to Chicago noone bothered to check if the screens provided to each passenger worked, and once in the air the plane was stuck with no movies, no music, not even route tracking for 9.5 hour flight. Travelling with kids the crew provided nothing for such a long flight. The captain only announced where we were once per request of very upset passenger. Completely unacceptable. The airline also declined to provide any sort of compensation for such 9.5 hour inconvenience. Save your money for airlines that value their customers.

### "has to be my worst experience"
I have been flying a lot lately and flew with several airlines. This has to be my worst experience. The flight schedule got changed twice and now I have to stay in a hotel with my own charges. I was also ok with that but even minimum options like special meals is charged. I would like to give 0/10 for this airline. They do not respond at all in case you would like to reschedule the flight due to emergency. I later was forced due to time to book Emirates just for one way.

### "no LOT employee on site"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed for several hours, no LOT employee on site /designated transfer desk, no way to contact, no info on missed connection. Will not fly again.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience from start to finish. Customer service on the phone is non existent. Customer service for check in or in flight from the stewardesses is absolutely horrible. I am sure they do not know how to treat their customers or how to provide a good service. Do not fly this airline.

### "employee didn’t accept her luggage"
My wife evacuated from Ukraine yesterday. Today at 7 a.m. on registration, LOT employee didn’t accept her luggage, 33 kg, when she was allowed to bring 2 x 32 kg. She was exhausted and stressed and you made her reorganize her luggage because of 1kg? Are we talking about business class service? Other companies can let you in even with +2-4 kg.

### "never flying with them again"
Not Verified |  I flew with them from Istanbul to Gothenburg via Warsaw, and the cabin crew  were really rude, barely welcomed us, and just didn't look so thrilled to be there. Another thing that bothered me was that there were no pictures/videos allowed. I don't know if it's a rule/policy in the airline LOT, but for some reason you are not allowed to take pictures or film the cabin crew or the plane in general. They got really defensive when they saw someone filming and came right at them and told them to delete it immediately. And not in a nice way. When i landed in Warsaw i had a flight the next hour to Gothenburg, and i had to hurry. When we got there, the ground crew sent many people back to take a COVID- test, it didn't matter if you we're vaccinated or not. We tried to tell them that our flight was going in 30 minutes, but they didn't care and only responded with 'that's not my problem'. There was a massive line and our flight was now in a tight schedule, soon to takeoff. We skipped the line as well as some other people that had the same flight as us. The covid test didn't take long and the results came in about 5-10 minutes. Until then our flight was in 15 minutes, and we had to stress through security and the airport to go to our gate. Horrible experience and never flying with them again.

### "very unprofessional employees"
Not Verified | The staff during my trip was nice and helpful. I fly by myself with my 8 month old baby. But the connected flight I went through the hell. Airport in Warsaw the worst airport ever, the employees are so rude and very unprofessional. They speak only Polish and who cares that they work in airport. We needed to run like crazy to catch connected flight, no one helped me to take the stroller to the planed ,I needed to go through the stair with baby and the stroller. They also do another check in and the gentleman spins only Polish language and it took us so much time to pass control because he could barely talk. Horrible airport, horrible transfer, very unprofessional employees, rude staff in the airport.

### "an excellent combination of professionalism and sincerity, warmth"
Not Verified |  I had a flight on January 10 2022, Vilnius - Warsaw - New York. Want to thank the nice team of flight attendants who assisted our side. It was an excellent combination of professionalism and sincerity, warmth. I'm sure the rest of big team share the same qualities. After Finnair cancelled a flight day before these wonderful ladies make my trip less tense. Big thanks to the young lady and the young man at the service desk who assisted me with my personal request at the departing gate and make my flight comfortable. I don't have high expectations for food on the plane - surprise - dinner was fresh and tasted nice.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever, the flight from Munich to Warsaw was average, nothing special, but the 'fun' started with the flight from Warsaw to Lviv. The flight was delayed by 1 hour and during that delay the gates were changed 3 times. We were behind schedule by about 1h30m when we finally took off, but it seemed that the captain decided to catch up a schedule and the flight took about 45m instead of 1h10m. The crew almost ran and pelted the passengers with snacks because they couldn't keep up.

### "not very positive anymore on LOT"
The flight from Amsterdam to Chisinau went very good no remarks. The return flight which was scheduled for 6th January 2022 gave lots of problems, When arriving (21 December 2021) at Chisinau airport I received an email from LOT that my return flight was cancelled and that I had to contact LOT. So I did and was invited to change the date of my return flight. I changed to 7th January 2022 same flight (LOT514) but I was unable to check-in online. I got the answer that LOT had no booking of me and my wife. So the flight to WAW is scheduled to leave at 2.35 PM today and I am still not sure that we have a seat on this flight. I tried for hours to contact LOT but to no avail. I really don't know wat to do. So we are stuck in Moldova for the moment and we are not very positive anymore on LOT Polish Airlines.

### "It was my first and last time flying LOT"
I am appalled by how poor the customer service was with this airline. Poor communication and attitude by staff. A few observations during my round trip travel from NY to Hamburg. Hardly any of the staff initiated a smile or smiled back - I did not once hear staff say “you’re welcome”. I consistently said “thank you” with each helpful interaction, and it’s lovely and polite to return with “you’re welcome” -staff looked inconvenienced when you asked for help - no communication on boarding process. People were crowding around the gate and when I did not follow the expectations on how to board (which was not communicated), the gate agent literally yelled at me in front of other passengers. It was embarrassing. It was my first and last time flying LOT. I would recommend paying more to fly with an airline that values customer service.

### "Worst possible customer service"
The worst company. Canceled the original flight. And then after I hot tested positive for Covid and was refused refund. Worst possible customer service, awful flight. The flight attendants are rude. The company employees are all incompetent.

### "Seat comfort excellent"
Very good covid measurements. Seat comfort excellent, newer planes than western airlines. Food and drinks are reasonable. Approximately 50% fare savings in comparison with other airlines. The only issue is that Warsaw airport weather can cause delays: 1h delay on the second flight. The airport has a very well structured covid border control and easy transit.

### "Very Good airline"
Very Good airline, professional cabin crew. Very good service and punctual. Excellent covid measurements .

### "Will definitely fly them again"
Much better than other airlines, especially western European ones. I was very worried reading skytrax reviews before flying LOT, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service, flight, on-time arrival and overall experience. Amazing value for money that saves at least 50% comparable to other airlines fares. Price includes 2 carry-ons: regular cabin trolley and accessory which can even be a backpack. No weigh-in or measurement at the gate, extremely friendly ground service. On-board service similar to other airlines: free snack, water, coffee and tea. No free alcohol or soft drinks, so overall a much healthier choice. Staff are extremely polite and friendly, one of the best in Europe, I don't understand the unfair hate they get. Excellent covid measurements: sanitary wipes, disinfected seats, table and toilets. Smooth flight, excellent pilots. Planes are quite new compared to other airlines. Will definitely fly them again.

### "made me miss my connecting flight"
Never again. They delayed our flight for an hour and a half. This made me miss my connecting flight by 15 minutes. Then we waited for another 30 minutes to deplane. Extremely poorly organized. The connecting flight left half empty. Now direct flight that was supposed to last 1.5 hrs, will have yet another layover and will last 6 hours. Warsaw airport matches their airline. Staff is very unprofessional in terms of never looking at customers and never apologizing to any of us. But before we even get to talk to staff, we waited in line for an hour while staff chatted with each other. It's not like they had 8 hours in flight time plus 1.5 hours deleted time to figure this all out You have a long way to go LOT.

### "guaranteed 100% disappointment"
Not Verified | This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with. My first flight was severely delayed, and the second flight decided not to wait for the transit passengers. I managed to make it onto the second flight, my luggage did not. After repeatedly calling Lot to sort out my luggage, I was met with the most rude and disrespectful staff ever. Also, I had to pay an extra 180 USD to come pick up my own luggage at the airport after cancelled flights and severe delays. Food in business was mediocre at best, and staff is generally rude. Worst airline in existence, if you wish to have an experience from hell, by all means book this airline. You will be guaranteed 100% disappointment and your anger will be tested to its limit. Currently waiting at the airport to receive my luggage, jet lagged and about to pass out.

### "not enforcing Covid face mask mandate"
Cabin crew not enforcing Covid face mask mandate at all. Passengers are not wearing their mask, the passenger sitting directly behind me is frequently not wearing his mask and even coughing. Covid test results are not checked at all before boarding. First and last time. Should have chosen Lufthansa.

### "This company is not to be trusted"
I recently had to fly to Poland to assist my mom in an emergency medical situation. She needed lifesaving surgery and the health care system in Poland was unable to provide it. I arranged an emergency visa for her to fly to the US (where I reside) to receive the medical care. LOT airlines insisted that my mom buy a round trip ticket. I consented since we didn’t have the time to argue the point. I purchased round trip BUSINESS FULL FLEX round trip (which assures rebooking free of charge and refund free of charge!). My mom received the surgery but due to overwhelming complications she passed away. I contacted LOT and explained the situation and as requested I provided the corroborating documents even to the headquarters in Poland! After a reasonable period having received no credit refund I called them and was assured the refund was forthcoming. It is now 4 months later and I have received no refund for more than $2,500 and not even a call/email back! Not only must I deal with the painful loss of my mother but now I have to deal with their incompetence. They agreed to the refund they just failed to make it. This company is not to be trusted. I will never fly the airline again!

### "no one at check it in Kiev"
There was no one at check it in Kiev. I couldnt check in and I missed the flight! I asked the passenger handling at the airport and they did nothing! Never fly with them!

### "told me that I'll get a full refund"
I had a planned flight from Kyiv to Miami through Warsaw in August 2021. I went to the airport and there I was immediately cancelled due to a closed air connection between Europe and USA. So the point is that I've bought their tickets, and they told me that I'll get a full refund of the ticket due to COVID restrictions, but they refunded only 100 bucks out of 520. Their representatives in Kyiv told me, that I was going to get a full refund and didn't worry about that, so I thought that money was already coming on my account. But that was not the case.

### "incompetent and unprofessional"
I was extremely shocked and disgusted at the way the staff at the LOT check in desk at Toronto Pearson airport welcomed and dealt with us at the counter. Firstly, my husband and I were travelling for the first time with Polish airlines with our 6 month old infant daughter. Our trip started off uneasy as we had to wait 45 minutes at Gothenburg airport because of issues checking us in. However, what truly upset me was the way the LOT staff treated us on our return flight from Toronto to Warsaw at check in. Initially we thought we were in a priority line considering we had a stroller and baby, but upon arriving at the counter, the lady at the front desk rudely said this line up was for business class only. We stated we were not aware and apologized. There were no signs indicating such. Next, without hesitation or a second look, she said our daughter was not on our reservation and that we need to book a ticket for her. We told her that we booked it from LOT’s website and had all the required documents stating our daughters name on the reservation. She denied and refused to look at anything and had a terrible attitude problem. She picked up her personal phone calls right in front of us on her mobile. She then referred us to her colleague beside her in order for her to figure out the issue with our baby. Frustrated at this point, we waited in line to speak to her colleague. Upon arrival at the counter again, the Lady looked at our ticket again and asked if we had altered our flight from November 2 to November 4th, and we said yes. Immediately she said we are not even booked for this flight and said our travel agent screwed up. At this point she was almost yelling at us. We told her that what she is stating is impossible because we already had our boarding passes. She looked again and was able to find our reservation. Next, we had purchased baggage online the day before and showed the lady our receipt. She said she had no idea what she was looking at and said she could not find our baggage purchase on her system. Eventually she found it. This group of two ladies at the counter were extremely incompetent and unprofessional. I have never dealt with any airline in such an unpleasant manner. They said things without looking twice, made mistakes and simply did not know what they were doing. A third lady came and helped us out which is how these situations were resolved. I’m appalled.

### "I missed my flight"
After missing my flight due staying in the security line for more than 1:30 hours, I missed my flight, despite the fact they told us the plane would wait. I was presented by an unfriendly women which firstly accused me being responsible for this conundrum, after making my situation clear for her, she told me to call and rebook my flight. I immediately tried to rebook my flight for the next day. Getting through the line, I was confronted by the most unpolite women I ever spoke to, which told it wouldn't be possible to rebook, the only option would be to write a complain, which would've been dealt after 1 month. So I had to buy another ticket. Regarding my first ticket I booked it 1 month ahead so the price would be cheaper(112€). But the ticket for the next day cost me 380€. In the following days I tried to phone the customer service over and over again where they always referred me back to the ticket provider (fluege.com) and they referred me to LOT, where I was treated unfriendly and incompetently with a huge arrogance. At the end they told me, they could give 1,63€ but I need to innitiate it by paying 12€, which is the worst insolence I ever been put through. Not only to speak about how they responded to my very friendly and formal request for help, which was more than 2 pages long, they responded 1 minute directly after I send the complain, in which they said it was my fault and they are sorry.

### "recommend avoid using them"
Bad company policy in terms of what they call ticket refund. I filled the Contact form, with the request of my tickets refund (20 min after reservation, week before the flight). Basically company did a cancellation of my flight (no money were refunded) without my confirmation or without any additional contact. They didn't event sent me a cancellation email about them doing so. Basically I found out about it on the flight day during check-in. Customer service is of very poor quality. Would recommend avoid using them if you have a chance to use another company. Company keep using trick forms on their web-site where refund - means flight cancelation. Poor Customer service.

### "Flights on time, professional crew"
Due to no direct flights from BEY to ARN after the summer I ended up booking LOT for the second time and it turned out to be as good as the first time. Flights on time, professional crew, food plus hot beverages. Even though there was no IFE onboard and the connection in WAW can be a bit tricky with no clear transfer signs and additional security checkpoints (that always takes time), I still appreciate LOT being an airline with smaller airplanes so you skip the crowded chaos checking in at the airport and onboard the flight. The ticket was way more cheaper than all the other airlines.

### "everything looked low-budget"
We had a rather horrible experience with LOT airlines. We had a transfer flight via Warsaw and this was the worst experience with the connecting flight I have ever had in my life. First, there was no specifically designated passage for transfer passengers at the airport. Second, we had to undergo the airport security check again. Seriously? For connecting flight passengers? That went well beyond a joke. To add insult to injury, there was a big queue and we had to rush like there is no tomorrow to get on board in time. The flight entertainment was non-existent so was the service from flight attendants. I started coughing because of my reflux and called for an attendant to ask for a glass of water. No one attended. Ten minutes later I had to catch one passing by and was told she was busy with something else and that someone else would attend me later. I gave up any hope after that. Luckily, I felt okay in the end. The seats were uncomfortable similar to the ones that low-budget airlines like RyanAir or EasyJet use. The choice of food was mediocre, just a tiny packet of peanuts and an apple tart. No hot drinks at all just still water! I mean come on, how much would it cost LOT to add up tea and/or coffee to their menus? Overall, everything looked low-budget and of inferior quality that shouldn't be the case as our tickets weren't the cheapest ones. I do not recommend LOT and will not travel with them. Never ever again!

### "will go with LOT again"
Very good journey from Warsaw to Dublin, ability to get a paper ticket for free from LOT check in office in Warsaw airport with very little queue. The plane was connected to gate via tunnel so it was more comfortable than the bus, we were welcomed by really friendly and nice staff that were really helpful during the flight. Free snacks and water provided, the seats were very comfortable, highly recommended and will go with LOT again.

### "they would not refund me"
My experience with LOT Polish Airline has been the worst experience I ever had with any company or service. The check-in agent mistakenly denied my boarding from Paris to Seoul through Warsaw because they were not competent enough to understand IATA regulation on country entry restrictions and argued that I would be refused upon arrival in Korea even if I was holding a valid visa and passport. Agents are likely not trained enough so they mixed up 'visa exemption' and 'visa' resulting in my boarding denial. Because of their mistake, I had to urgently buy another flight on the same day with Air France to arrive in Korea on time, and I was of course accepted, because I had all the documents necessary to be accepted. The agent did not refund me at the boarding desk, they asked me to go to the sales desk, where another agent told me that he would not refund me, asking me to make an online request for refund. I then received a call several hours later by an agent who told me they would not refund me because I did 'not show at the airport', after explaining my case the agent asked me to fill an online complaint and would get a response within 30 days (despite the fact that the law oblige the airline to refund and compensate you within 7 days). After waiting 30 days, they still refused to refund me telling me that the documents I showed did not allow me to fly, which was wrong because I got accepted by the Korean government to enter Korea (knowing that the reason of the denial was that my entry would be refused). I made an appeal, showing more evidence that I had the right to fly. They again did not take my evidence into account and repeated their position, which was against the law.

### "should be shut down completely"
Not Verified |  We had a flight from Warsaw to Chicago that was overbooked so they told us that we not allowed on the flight. They book us a new flight for the next day but refused to give us a check of 600euros that we are entitled to by the law. They dragged me, my husband and a year and a half old baby for 5 hours until they finally booked us with a hotel for a night. When we got to the Chicago airport the next day we were looking for our luggage and they kept lying to us for 2 hours. They have the rudest crew, nobody wants to listen to you they just keep talking as you are talking. My baby has a lot of food allergies and requires special food that I brought but just not enough because I didn’t expect to travel five days from Montenegro to Alaska because of how unprofessional and rude LOT airlines is. It’s a shame it exists and should be shut down completely.

### "customer service is horrible and offered no help"
From the flight from Warsaw to Podgorica all five pieces of luggage were lost. Flight from Warsaw to Chicago was delayed two hours which led to missing a connecting flight to Detroit. The customer service is horrible and offered no help.

### "Very pleasantly surprised and highly recommend"
Both flights are bang on time. Check in staff in Paris competent and courteous. Boarding perfectly ordered on both flights. Planes tidy, legroom great. Crew courteous and know what they do. The even manage to serve small snack on every short flight (for free!). Didn’t use toilets, so no opinion on that. Didn’t check bags, but cabin allowance is quite generous. Very pleasantly surprised and highly recommend.

### "wasn't even a single bit of extra leg room"
Not Verified |  Paid extra to book a seat in advance, because being over 2m I value every inch of leg room I can get. However, unlike specified during the booking procedure, there wasn't even a single bit of extra leg room. Same goes for return flight. I spent 50€ extra for nothing.

### "LOT needs to do better"
Not Verified | Warsaw to New York. Service was good with friendly staff. However the food option was only limited to pork and pork alone, even the sandwiches towards the end of our flight were ham and cheese options. I find it extremely sad and inconsiderate that in today's day and age that an international airline does not have more than one option for a 7/8 hour flight. I am not saying there need to be 3/4 food options but having two options that accommodate all types of people is ideal; Not all people eat pork due to religious or personal choices, so to only have that one option is a lack of consideration for the population of those who don't. LOT needs to do better, offer at least two options especially when tickets are above $800 round trip per person, I'm sure they can invest in upgrading meal options.

### "I was positively surprised"
This was my first flight with LOT and I have to admit I was positively surprised. The plane is tidy, the crew is very professional and friendly. The flight was accurate. The crew were very friendly.

### "Everything was correct on this flight"
Everything was correct on this flight. What I am really happy about is at last I have found a company with a comfortable seat. I have a bony bum so every flight seems to be meant for larger people. I ordered an inflight meal from WAW-BER for 13€ and it was just okay. I would think that it would come with something to drink. Disappointed with the airport in Warsaw though: only 1/3 elevators worked and 0/4 moving sidewalks were switched on, and it's a long walk from customers (45" wait until I walked into the EC lane and got through right away).

### "not be able to reach anyone"
If you have any issues at all, they will be of no service to you and you will not be able to reach anyone. I understand there are delays with reaching service members due to COVID but I already dealt with other airlines that actually took telephone calls and resolved my issues, yet LOT has still to respond - after 4 hours of being on hold. This is so disgusting on their end it feels that they are scamming people out of their money because of the pandemic.

### "their service is the worst"
Not Verified |  This is literally the worst airline, their service is the worst! I have tried several times to change the tickets and it is not possible, I sent in a request form weeks ago and never got a reply. Then now I tried to call them, and after waiting for 30 mins in line, they just disconnected me! So then I thought, okay, I´ll buy a new ticket, and now it won't let me do that either, and I have tried with several cards (which definitely had enough on them), so I am practically stuck now, thanks to LOT.

### "Don't believe them"
Airline advertises free and easy changes and or refunds to bookings. Don't believe them. I have spent 5 days and over 10hrs on hold using their advertised customer support line. You cannot get through to their contact center's because after 30minutes on hold they automatically disconnect the line, trust me i have tried 20 times! Lodged the online request form as per website instructions well before my flight departed, it was acknowledged as received but has never been actioned. The email address used for the acknowledgement is a "No Reply" email address. No outcome or communications received has yet been received. Was contacted by someone on sms and was eventually told they couldn't assist with the change of date and that i had to call the contact centre. The internet is full of the same reviews for the same problem.

### "ground service was not that nice"
I flew to Geneva on the E175, which is nothing great. Milo surprised I was with the plane service (nice and knowledgeable). Unfortunately, the ground service was not that nice anymore. It is different at the airport in Warsaw. The seat on the plane did not knock you on your knees, but I do not pick on it, because it is a short cruise, the seats were comfortable. Meal on board was not a meal. Lubie z różnych względów latać LOTem. Tym razem do Genewy leciałem E175, który nie jest niczym rewelacyjnym . Milo zaskoczony byłem obsługą w samolocie (milo i kompetentnie). Niestety obsługa naziemna juz nie była tak miła. Na lotnisku w Warszawie różnie z tym bywa. Miejsce w samolocie nie powalało na kolana, ale nie czepiam się, bo to krotki rejs, fotele były wygodne. Posiłek na pokładzie...to nie posiłek:) .

### "Worst airline and Customer Service"
Not Verified |  Worst airline and Customer Service I have ever experienced. Due to Covid restrictions in Poland I was not able to fly from NY to Warsaw. Attempted to contact LOT for Days, hours and hours on hold to only be disconnected and then trying their contact form which is a joke. Finally they ignored me long enough that I requested a refund which was denied because it was past the flight date which is comical because they were impossible to get in touch with. I can not imagine a more dishonest company exists in the airline industry.

### "refused to give the refund"
Terrible airline and awful customer support. I would strongly advise people to book with any other airline before booking with them. I tried to rate them 0, but apparently 1 is the minimum! In spite of not being able to legally take the flight due to COVID-19 Lockdown in the UK, this airline still refused to give the refund which the Competition and Markets Authority stipulates that they are obliged to do. We have been left in the dark for about 8 months now and are still waiting for the matter to get resolved.

### "service on 3 hrs plus flight was none"
Except of the ticket price this has been difficult to see any difference between LOT vs. any low cost company. The service on 3 hrs plus flight was none, ex. a small piece of small sandwich. They did not serve even a glass of water. I was ready to pay for a cup of coffee, but no luck. Not available. Leg room was very small, did not look like 32" which they advertise. Also not audio as they advertise. Low-cost airlines flying to Tbilisi doing a better job and are more customer friendly.

### "crew members were really sweet and cheerful"
Not Verified |  I've never felt the urge to review an airline before, but I thought LOT Airlines deserved an extra pat on the back for the really kind service. The crew members were really sweet and cheerful, and even on one of the 1.5 hour flights, we were given snacks and beverages which I don't think I've ever received on short flights before. And trust me, it was super appreciated. My only complaint was the bad quality of the headphones given for watching movies on their flight, but I guess that's hard to avoid on any flight. Anyway, really sweet people!

### "No customer service"
Here is a list of the reasons why I don’t suggest LOT Polish Airlines: No customer service. Arrogant ladies at the desk. Cancelling flights 3 times in a month. No money back, trying to get your money with fake excuses. Expensive flights, bad service and finding reasons to make you pay for luggage at the airport (never happened to me).

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. My flight was cancelled over and over and over again due to the pandemic situation. I tried contacting them through phone, email and even through facebook without success. Nobody ever answers. How can a company operate without communicating with their customers?!? Absolutely horrible customer service. Worse I've ever seen.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, employees are not aware of airline policies. In my case, the airline canceled my trip in October 2020. The second time I was unable to travel, there were no flights available to my destination on the dates I could fly. On the third occasion they gave me a date to change my flight and when I called, my flight was canceled 7 hours before because I called in US time and not in Polish time. I bought the flight in the US, so New York time must apply. I was never informed about this rule. Now my fourth problem is the refund, the travel agency LBF Travel and LOT Polish Airline are not doing anything to speed up my refund.

### "The worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my flight and gave me a voucher. But this voucher cannot be used anywhere - not on their website, not via email or any other form of communication. The only way to use it is via phone which is always busy and they never answer me until my voucher expires. The worst experience ever, I have lost 680 EUR and will never use their airlines again and I don't recommend anyone to buy tickets from them as they are a scam.

### "have such a bad website in 2021"
Not Verified |  First of all, I don't know how it's possible to have such a bad website in 2021, it always crash, it always has some problem and it's so slow and uncomfortable. The second ridiculous thing is customer service, you write on your website that you are available on WhatsApp 24/7 but the truth is that they never answer there! They write that you can speak in 8 languages but people that speak a different language than Polish and English are never available, and for these 2 languages you have to wait like 1 hour on the phone to can talk.

### "I was really impressed by the standard of service"
The plane was very clean and well maintained. The cabin crew was very helpful and nice. After take-off, they handled out disinfection wipes, a bottle of water, a sweet roll with blueberries from the local bakery, peanuts, and jelly beans - everything on such a short flight during the crisis. I was really impressed by the standard of service. Everything was more than we can expect on such a short flight. LOT Polish Airlines is obviously one of the best traditional airlines in Europe and underrated as well. The prices were very attractive. I highly recommend LOT!

### "Unprofessional, humiliating, biased"
Do not have any business with Lot. Unprofessional, humiliating, biased behavior of the company's representatives. My elderly parents had a trip from Minsk, Belarus to New York (layover in Warsaw, Poland). The company cancelled the flight numerous times (but that's OK - we all know about pandemic). My parents made COVID tests in advance. On the day of the flight, while check-in registration in Minsk, the company's representative mislead my parents assuring that they had right COVID-test (otherwise they could conduct the new test directly at the airport in Minsk). However, while landing a plane during the layover in Warsaw, my parents were shocked by another Lot representative who did not let them in. As it appeared, my parents' COVID tests were not OK. My parents were stuck in Warsaw airport. They had to sit there for 2 days without food and water. My parents could not leave the airport because they did not have a Schengen visa. Lot employees rejected any communication simply by saying that they do not speak my parents' language (even though the Belarusian and the Polish are very familiar languages). I contacted Minsk, Warsaw and New York Lot offices. Minsk and Warsaw offices did not pick up the phone. Lot employee in New York did not want to listen to me. I just wanted to ask for advice on how to help my parents. But all the time she had the same answer that she had nothing to do with my parents' problem and they had to check all the requirements beforehand (and they did; they made COVID tests prior to the trip, and Lot representative checked all the paperwork and assured that my parents' documents, including testing, were OK). This is not how a respected company should deal with its clients' problems. My parents are elderly people.

### "avoid LOT as much as possible"
Not Verified |  I've used LOT a few times before and I'd say that it is not on my list of decent airlines. I only took their flights because nothing else was available routing/time wise. First of all, they don't have a first class so I will write about their economy class and their business class, which I have been on both. On either classes their service is pretty poor. I've traveled some and used several different airlines and I can definitely say that they are not the good. Their manner of service is not up to the standards to other airlines and in general I don't think they are trained that well. I took a long haul flight from Warsaw to Boston in December. I was sleeping and the plane was preparing to land (my chair was already upright, table stowed away, etc.) and I was using their blanket. While I was sleeping, a flight attendant yanked the blanket off of me without saying a word. I woke up immediately and showed a face of unhappiness and the flight attendant just barked "we're landing". I usually use the airline blankets on the plane and I've never had a flight attendant yank the blanket off of me because the plane was landing... I was pretty surprised to say the least. Food is not tasty at all so don't expect anything decent. Even in business class you don't get a menu, you just get "beef or chicken? and they don't even lay out a tablecloth like in other airline companies. They don't smile much. Also, I didn't really get the vibe that they want to improve themselves much. On a different flight using Swiss air, in business class, the chief flight attendant went around individually talking to each passenger with a smile, had a conversation, and asked if there was anything they can do to make the flight more comfortable (as they do in most good companies), but nothing in LOT business class. Conclusion: I try to avoid LOT as much as possible.

### "not willing to refund the money"
Please do not waste your money and time on LOT Polish Airlines. They canceled our flight several times and are not willing to refund the money. They tell you to do the paperwork, only to notify (months later) they will not be able to do it. As to their customer service, it’s not just 0, it’s really non-existent; rude, unknowledgeable, with no empathy due to the current situation whatsoever. They keep pushing you to get a voucher although I told them I don’t want to deal with them anymore.

### "Did not get refund for cancelled flight"
Did not get refund for cancelled flight, only promises, unfriendly staff on telephone. My colleagues who supposed to fly with me already received the money, it is not clear which criteria company is using for giving or not giving refund

### "Extremely unpleasant experience"
Extremely unpleasant experience with this airline. My flights got canceled without any particular reason. After having to search for their refund form on their website for 15 Minutes (it was well hidden), the only language available was polish. I did manage to fill out the form, and now, 5 months later, after multiple calls with their agents, I still haven't gotten a cent back, because my payment "is being processed". It is unheard of to have to wait that long for the money I've given for a service which in the end wasn't executed. Never flying with them again!

### "there was a good legroom"
Smooth flight, on time and big surprise was free refreshment for this less than hour local flight. Crew was nice. And there was a good legroom.

### "I will never again fly LOT"
Not Verified |  I purchased ticket to Toronto for October 2020. Firstly LOT Polish Airlines changed my itinerary twice and this was ok with LOT then I missed first leg flight (my fault, no taxi) from Poznan to Warsaw. I took a train as the second leg flight was 12 hours later but when I got there I had to pay 2850 PLN over and above the amount of 2100 PLN, just to reinstate my ticket. So, I end up paying 4950PLN. It looks that LOT is making sales by ripping people off. I queried that charge with LOT as it doesn't make sense to pay so much just for 10 min work reinstating my ticket, yet the plane was half empty. I will never again fly LOT. No customer service nor understanding especially during Covid-19.

### "asking when I will get my money back"
My flight got cancelled by LOT Polish airlines on 24.06.20 and I requested full refund on 25.06.20. I got confirmation latter on Polish language! Which informed me that My request was accepted and I must be patient! I had been calling and asking when I will get my money back and never got answer. Be patient and because of CoVID 19 it’s can take up to 3 months! Today is 27.10.20. Tried to call couple of times, stayed on the line and then call been dropped! When I finally got to talk to someone and asked about the policy and Terms about REFUND I got the same answer “be patient, we don’t know any dates when you will get your money back! Then just hang up! So now I am going to ask the same question but just written on papir “when do I get my money back if I send request on it 25.06.20? What is your policy and Terms about refund?

### "not been refunded 6 month later"
Not Verified |  The service is terrible. Flight was cancelled due to Covid 19. Lot can off course not be blamed for this. However refund of tickets for flight in april 2020 has not been refunded 6 month later. It is not possible to get hold of them on phone and their reply on email is vague. They will not give me a specific timeline on when i can expect a refund. This is simply not good enough. I highly recommend people considering using LOT to chose other options if at all possible. Other airlines manage to arrange refund in less than half the time I have been waiting for my refund from LOT.

### "Seats were clean and comfortable enough"
We had originally booked to fly to Warsaw with another carrier. However, because of the pandemic, our original flights were cancelled so we rebooked with LOT. Having travelled with LOT before, this was not a problem. Our early morning departure was cancelled though, so we requested rebooking on LO282. It took a couple of days for LOT to confirm this but thankfully they did so. The original aircraft was supposed to be a B737-800 but this was later changed to an Embraer E175 probably due to the low passenger numbers. Online check in was straightforward. We arrived at the gate as soon as it was announced. Boarding was very quick and we were moved up from row 20 to row 8. Seats were clean and comfortable enough for this length of journey. Only a couple of changes compared to the previous LOT flights we have taken. First is the requirement to wear a mask throughout the flight (apart from when eating/drinking). Speaking of which, the onboard catering options have changed. In the past, economy passengers would get a chocolate and a choice of tea, coffee or water. Now, every passenger in economy was given a bottle of water, the choice between a savoury (spinach) or sweet (blueberry) roll, and a small bag of pretzels or nuts. Finally, every passenger was required to complete two forms for track and trace purposes. These were collected by the cabin crew prior to landing. The flight was smooth and we arrived in Warsaw slightly ahead of schedule.

### "Refund request still not processed"
Not Verified |  Flights cancelled by LOT in early June as London CIty Airport was closed due to Covid. Refund request still not processed, they advise patience ... mine has now worn thin. Can't get through on phone lines, can't get a refund or proper estimate when they might pay out. Never again !

### "really appreciated the on-board service"
I flew one way from Warszaw Chopin Airport to Gdańsk - short, domestic hop taking ca 40 minutes. The flight was on time, nevertheless the departure time had been changed - my original flight got probably canceled. In my case this was not a problem though. The cabin was a bit tight but comfy, pleasant and clean. I really appreciated the on-board service which happens rarely nowadays: the staff seemed to be enjoying their work, they were attentive and nice. Complimentary snacks and water were distributed - very nice accent. The inflight magazine was available as well. Unfortunately no jet-bridges used this time and the boarding a bit rash.

### "receive a refund after 2 months"
Not Verified |  A friend flew in March to New York in March and got stuck in New York because of Covid-19. She was to return in April. Getting to customer service was extremely easy at first but then it got to long waits to move our return ticket. After 5 tries and cancelations we had to change our flight with a different airline that allows travel back to Serbia because she is a cancer patient. When she got back we wrote to get the help with a refund for the second flight and got no help and even got emails in Polish. We did receive a refund after 2 months and we are now happy. Considering the circumstances I cannot blame the airline but we needed to get her back for treatment.

### "Customer service is so bad"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Poznan. Customer service is so bad and people working there are borderline incompetent! Firstly, it is impossible to reach them. Once you do, they are rude and give you partial information. Once I got on the plane I was also not greeted with a smile. Flights are not cheap, and I am 1000% more happy with everything that WizzAir offers than LOT for triple the price.

### "you pay extra £30 Admin fee"
Don't use myTrip.com to book flights. It looks like they're playing games. Discrepancies between MyTrip and LOT. You end up receiving cancellations if not by MyTrip then the Airline etc. The worst part is that you pay extra £30 Admin fee each time your flight is cancelled, even if you purchase a flexible ticket.

### "LOT does nothing to help"
On the day of my departure, Prague was placed on the blacklist for exceeding the number of Corona cases for safe travel. I had to make a decision about my trip and decided to travel just to Warsaw instead. LOT claims that they do anything possible to help pax in times like this. Contacting LOT by phone isn’t possible as I’ve been place in the loop for more than an hour. At the airport I was presented after about 40 minutes of calculation, with a bill for axing two of the four flights, which exceeded the original ticket price. When asking how this could happen, I was told that I have been give a discount already. So please be aware that LOT does nothing to help in a situation like this, they just try to Anke extra bucks. Never again!

### "excellent customer service"
The service quality is really good even in such torrid times. I had an excellent customer service. My flight in August 12/09/2020 and return 15/09/2020 was excellent,on time, reasonable price. The customer service guy was very kind and helpful. Free water and snacks during the flight. I would high recommend them.

### "4 month delay in receiving a refund"
Really bad customer service! I understand the challenges EU airlines have had with the changing COVID rules but I do not understand why LOT continues to take reservations even though they are uncertain if they are going to fly. I bought tickets at the end of April for a mid-June flight. That flight was canceled so i rescheduled for July 1. That flight was canceled. Rescheduled for July 5. That flight was canceled. On 24 June 2020, after talking with customer service to rearrange our itinerary, we scheduled our flight for July 27th leaving out of Washington DC... this cost me $400 more because it was at a different than Chicago. After being reassured by LOT customer service that this flight would go, I purchased two more tickets for family members. Three hours later on June 24th I received four emails stating the flight out of DC had been canceled. I requested a refund but, like some else said on this site, there is up to a 4 month delay in receiving a refund... so now I have a $4000+ investment in LOT airline. LOT can not tell me what refund-request date is currently being processed, how many refunds have been requested nor how many have been processed already. Contact by phone takes hours of wait time and there is a two day delay using FB Messenger, snarky answers always.

### "4 month wait for a refund"
Tblisi to Chicago via Warsaw. I booked with this airline and 2 days later my reservation was cancelled (they were still accepting reservations). After contacting lot I was informed that there would be a 4 month wait for a refund. This seems more like a scam than anything else.

### "very comfy flights"
Both flights arrived ahead of time, very comfy flights on the wonderfully spacious ERJ170. Good service with a bottle a water, sandwich and a piece of chocolate on this 1hr flight; highly recommended

### "Very disappointed with the airline"
Not Verified | Avoid by any means! We have asked for a refund because our flight was cancelled more than a month ago and we haven’t got any response. Customer service can be contacted via phone only but noone picked up even though we tried 3x and waited for an hour on the line. Very disappointed with the airline.

### "Don’t buy from LOT Airlines"
Not Verified | For the past few months, I have had nothing but problems. There is no way to efficiently communicate with a representative because all lines are cut and no one answers any emails/messages. Many people are looking for refunds and rebooking, but instead of handling problems, LOT looks for new customers and attempts to sell new tickets (that will also be cancelled and not refunded). I have been trying for months at reaching LOT with no luck. I need to rebook the flight I paid for. Don’t buy from LOT Airlines. Also when flying with LOT, be prepared for horrible treatment. I had to fly from Warsaw to Chicago in April (beginning of COVID in Poland). I was stuffed into a small shuttle bus with approximately 50 other people of all ages. We had to sit in the bus for 20-30 minutes without any air circulation. Completely ridiculous and scary. The driver and employees ignored us. We were literally shoulder to shoulder. This shouldn’t be acceptable under any circumstances.

### "Stay away using them"
I’m writing this review due to my flight was canceled due to COVID pandemic in March with a hope given that I will get my refund in 10-14 business day. My flight was around trip from Miami to Budapest. I never get an email or any type of communication from LOT airline and when I called each time on hold for 1-3 hrs just to tell me once picked up that “ wait patiently, we don’t know when refund send out and our supervisor doesn’t know anything different so She is not taking your call”. LOT airline rated by me -1 not even 0/10. Horrible communication skills and not trustworthy company. I would never fly with them. Stay away using them.

### "Service on board was good"
Warsaw to Toronto was on B787 to Toronto was nice and uneventful. Service on board was good flight attendants were very helpful, polite, and accommodating. The crew  were speaking good English. I can't say anything negative about this flight as everything the airline did in my opinion was good.

### "never book with them again"
I purchased a flight to return home during the pandemic. I called less than 24 hours later and was told I would be given a refund asap. It has been almost 3 months. I’ve called LOT twice and have been told I have to wait. I cannot wait when there is an almost $900 charge on my credit card. It’s ruining my credit score and causing great anxiety. I will never book with them again as other airlines would have made better by now.

### "Complete failure as an airline"
Refunds for canceled flights take a long time. Managers barely answer in social networks. On the phone they hang up. No one can name at least the approximate terms of return. They say the same thing - wait. The administration responds selectively. Complete failure as an airline that is part of Star Alliance. I think that it is possible to use the services of LOT only as a last resort - if there are alternatives - I’d better use them.

### "Terrible service"
Budapest to Krakow with LOT Polish Airlines. Terrible service. Flight canceled due to Covid. Online form filled for refund. 2 months later, nothing. When contacting them, they just say "you must wait". The friends I would have met there all received their refunds in days from other airlines.

### "can’t describe how bad it was"
Zurich to Colombo via Warsaw. I can’t describe how bad it was. I have flown countless of time in many business class cabins around the globe, but first time with Lot Polish long haul flight. From short leg, Zurich to Warsaw, and I didn’t expect much, but even for that short leg they come only to bring the food and to take food. That’s all. No smile, offer, kindness, asking me for some other drink. Long haul flight they bring food, take it, and during flight I barely could see them. Even when crew pass by, they intentionally ignore to see you. Any time they didn’t offer anything to passengers. You have to press the button and then someone with ‘what do you want’ face would come. And main meal - worst ever. Had some kind of beef that wasn’t eatable. Worst meal ever in any cabin class. I complain that this wasn’t good and I cannot eat, I asked for some other meal option and crew member offered me to check only if there any leftover in economy class. Can you believe? The crew was completely not interested in working and serving passengers. They just don’t want to care and obviously this was normal attitude to them. I would avoid them always!

### "worst trip I've ever endured"
I've flown cross Atlantic plenty of times, but this was by the worst trip I've ever endured. We get on the plane, and it might as well be a Frontier (bargain flyer) plane. The seats are tiny and hard, not enough room for two grown adults to sit comfortably next to one another. I sat next to my dad and our arms were overlapping almost the entire time. If you're on the aisle you get a little more room, but in turn every single person walking by bumps into you. And the seats recline maybe one inch? I ended up contorting my body to get any sleep: kneeling on the floor, legs tucked under the seat in front of me and head on the seat. These are the conditions you'd expect from a 2 hour flight you got for super cheap, not a 9 hour flight you paid over $1000 for. Food was mediocre, even for a plane. Portions seemed smaller than ever, selection was pretty minimal. Oh, and of course the flights both ways were delayed. We missed our connecting flight in Warsaw and had to get rebooked, then on the flight back the plane was something like an hour and a half late to take off. The staff was fine, but they too weren't pleased with the accommodations. It was also ridiculously expensive. If you need to fly to Poland, do yourself a favor and fly to a major hub like London or Frankfort first, then book a RyanAir to Poland. Even with paying extra for luggage, it will still cost you less and the flight will be so much more enjoyable.

### "This was my worst trip!"
Kraków to Chicago. Horrible horrible horrible. This was my worst trip! Expect much delays, end up on some old airplane, tighter than sardines. You pay 300-400 more for a premium airline to get some cruddy plane. On top of it 50 pieces of luggage left behind! It was a direct flight and they ran out of room. Choose a different airline and steer clear!

### "This time was a mistake"
New York to Warsaw. I chose polish airlines because last time I felt so comfy and impressed. This time was a mistake. They changed our plane from Boeing 787 to an old Air Belgium A340. Screen didn't even respond, no movies to watch actually. Stains on chair. One flight attendant was rude. I did not like it at all. Worst flight I've had... next time I will choose Delta&Air France.

### "entitled to a partial refund"
Tel Aviv to Chicago via Warsaw. The WWarsaw to Chicago flight was delayed several hours because of an issue with the engines that had been delaying flights for days. The airline, despite knowing about the issue and the need to switch aircraft in advance, did not notify customers ahead of time. Flying business from WAW to ORD in their replacement aircraft, there were a number of things not working — the overhead reading lights did not work, the headphone jacks with the headsets provided, the touchscreens for the entertainment systems, etc. The delay information was communicated poorly and sporadically. I followed up with the airline on 28 December since the delay had been over three hours and I was entitled to a partial refund under EU law. I received a confirmation email on 8 January confirming that I was due this money and would receive it within four weeks. That time came and went. I followed up through the form on their website they direct you to, with their chat representatives on Facebook messenger (who gave me conflicting and sometimes inaccurate information about my claim status), and emailed an address those reps gave me via FB. It has been days and there is not a single response about the airline's failure to provide the required compensation within the guaranteed time frame.

### "LOT Polish Airlines lie to us"
LOT Polish Airlines lie to us. Boeing 787 that supposed to fly, don't. Night before or even same day, we find out some other carrier will fly. I had purchased exit row seats on a round trip Warsaw to Chicago. Same day found out LOT took my seat  they had rights according to what LOT rep told me. I was forced to purchase business class seat for $1000 one way. On the way back, night before, I was informed EuroAtlantic Airways will fly, plane from the hell. Very narrow uncomfy seats, everybody was complaining. One of the arm rests was pinching my hip, still have a bruise. Flight attendant offered me middle row seat, I took it, arm rest was in a normal position. Flight attendants mentioned to us, those seats are for a short flights, up to 2 hours. Our duration of flight was 10.5 hours, with additional one hour delay. Movies were from 1970's, Seat belts were dirty. I have been supported LOT for 35 years, but this was my last flight.

### "absolutely the worse airline"
Newark to Warsaw. Avoid this company, absolutely the worse airline. 9 out of 10 times your flight will be canceled or delayed - speaking from my own experience and my friends. Unfortunately i had no other choice but to use LOT’s services as they are the only ones flying straight to Poland, and my mom due to health reasons (Time, distance to be walked etc) is not able to take layover flights, since they take way too big toll on her health. Todays departing; flight was of course, as expected; delayed over 4hours leaving from Newark. This completely ruined all the transportation arrangements we had made at our destination. Again do not use their services, they are by far the worse in class, I will be looking to obtain a refund for their terrible, not worth the money services. Use Lufthansa whenever possible, never had issues.

### "missed my connecting flight"
Beirut to Amsterdam via Warsaw. The plane from Beirut to Warsaw got delayed a little. So I missed my connecting flight from Warsaw to Amsterdam. Now I am sitting in Warsaw airport waiting for another five hours for another flight to take me to Amsterdam. Oh and they gave me a voucher for a free meal.

### "Food was very poor"
Kiev to Singapore via Warsaw. I bought tickets under promotion. Tickets are cheap. Definitely they cut down on cost. Food was very poor. Rice with chicken was main dish. Rice with ham was as a supplement. Stewards did their job good.

### "a journey from hell"
Not Verified | Yerevan to London via Warsaw. We had a journey from hell. Our flight was delayed from Yerevan by over an hour, no explanation was given at the time. Upon arrival in Warsaw, there wasn't a single person to direct or support the passengers who were running around the airport trying to find out what to do next. The airline employees didn't seem to have a clue about anything, I was given free food vouchers and told that I can use them at any airport during my journey which turned out not to be true. The staff at the airport were incredibly rude and unfriendly, pushing passengers around and shouting at them. After I arrived in the UK, I contacted the airline at least 5 times and finally, I received their response after 4 months. They said the delay was due to a passenger becoming unwell on the flight to Yerevan, with no apology or acceptance of any responsibility for lack customer care at the Warsaw airport. This has been the worst airline I have ever travelled with, and wouldn't recommend it. Overall rating is 0, but sadly I can't pick that number.

### "steer clear of LOT Polish Airlines"
Chicago to Skopje via Warsaw. Traveling a long haul flight I thought my kids will be the reason I will be exhausted, but  they slept and were perfectly behaved both ways to and from Europe. On our way to Skopje the flight was delayed making us miss our connection and they had us have an additional connection (no one was willing to help or even show us where to go to figure everything out, I even asked one of the flight attendants where the transfer center was and he yelled at me: “Not on this airplane” in a condescending voice, while I just wanted to know if anyone would point us to it, since we were already late for our second flight) With kids it wasn’t easy, but the flights themselves were horror. The flight Chicago-Warsaw they brought the bassinet for my infant about 4 hours into the flight, so I was holding her the whole time everyone was eating, I asked for it many times and I was answered later they would give me food and bassinet and I was left hungry. I was never offered water, let alone food. Even while trying to put my carry on and my baby who just started getting up, fell on the floor and me trying to get one of the flight attendants to help (and I’m not saying I’m entitled to special treatment because I travel with children) they still ignored me. The highlight of the whole way to Skopje was Austrian airlines impromptu connection, they were amazing with me and the kids and very accommodating. On our way back to Chicago surprise, surprise the plane was late, yet again. The flight crew was as rude as ever. Some of the flight attendants that belonged to Belgium Airways were nice, but still, the LOT flight attendants looked as if it was a punishment to even be on that flight, as if someone was holding them against their will. I even asked one of the flight attendants if they would hold my infant daughter so I could go to the bathroom, which I was encouraged to do, before boarding, they promised as if they were incredibly kid friendly. Well, I was scolded as a child by a LOT flight attendant that they shouldn’t be doing this and they are not going to help me. He yelled at me as if I offended him. I asked very nicely if he would please or anyone on the flight crew if they were comfortable holding children help me out (one of the Belgium Airlines FA ladies did play and hold my daughter just prior in the flight, and the reason why I felt it would be ok to even ask for this). I am beyond baffled by my experience. Especially because I traveled with United before coming to Chicago and was treated with such dignity and respect, I expected to be treated the same. I honestly thought I never asked for any special treatment, but I literally received no treatment, no respect. The flight crew avoided me like the plague because I had children with me. If you are a family or just a person that feels like you have dignity, steer clear of LOT Polish Airlines.

### "we will look at other options in future"
Flying from JFK to Budapest and then to Kraków. The flight was good. Stewardess and Steward were very good. The weather in Budapest was bad so we flew around for an hour and then had to detour to Warsaw, which was okay safety first. But when we arrived at Warsaw they had tickets for a connection to Kraków. We ran to the terminal and the gate was closed. Did forget to mention that we were with someone that worked with LOT Polish Airlines. The airplane was there but would not let us board. So then we run to the customer service desk, to find a cheese sandwich and another 3 hour wait. We usually fly LOT Polish Airlines but the lack of empathy means we will look at other options in future.

### "Fully satisfied"
Katowice to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. The flight and the service was smooth and efficient. The plane clean, the stewardesses nice and helpful. Everything on time. Fully satisfied, the flight experience up to my expectations.

### "Comfortable quick hop"
Very pleased with ground and in-flight services. LOT staff checked me in and issued boarding passes for onward Aegean flights. Comfortable quick hop from Gdansk to Warsaw with complimentary drinks and snack.

### "There was no leg room"
New York to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. I have a serious complaint about the Warsaw to Tel Aviv leg. The Boeing 737-800 seat map for business class shows a 2 x2 configuration which led me to believe it's a real business class seat. In fact, it's a 3x3 and the airline didn't even keep the middle seat empty. There was no leg room - configured like a charter plane. When complaining about this to Lot, I got atheanswer that as per the fine print, they can change planes.

### "could hear racist slurs"
Delhi to Warsaw. Staff on the flight behaving as if it’s a punishment to work there. No smile, no attention, no involvement. Extremely cheap and poor food, be ready to eat something before you fly. Asked for an additional glass (!) of wine, the stewardess looked at me and completely ignored my request. Able to understand Polish, I could hear racist slurs from staff towards Indian passengers. Avoid at all cost.

### "left her alone at the luggage pick up"
Warsaw to Toronto. I ordered special assistance with wheelchair for 86 years old mother and she doesn't speak English. They left her alone at the luggage pick up section, didn't say nothing. My mother was left for 2 hours and assistant left her. It was such terrible time for my family waiting outside of Pearson pick up passengers. We were not allow to get in, we were asking all the airport staff about her, they just kept telling us to wait.

### "airline is always delayed"
Warsaw to Beirut. The airline is always delayed. They never board on time and the flight does not take off on time. This is not my first time traveling with this airline and it is not the first time they delay us more than 45 mins while boarding and while taking off. This is very unprofessional and does not show any respect to people’s time. I will never recommend this airline to anyone

### "Ground experience awful"
Not Verified |  Warsaw to Sofia. Ground experience was awful, lack of space in non-schengen part of departures, very slow boarding, bus to the airplane (remember, we are speaking about an airline where ticket for 2 hours flight costs at least 300 euro for economy class). Small airplane, but with high seats density, one of the two toilets has been blocked for business class passengers, but I have not seen any on a flight. Only basic drinks (coffee, tea and water) + small snack are offered.

### "don't care about their customers"
They almost ruined our honeymoon. We were supposed to fly out from Vilnius to London City at 7AM, but after 1hr delay without any explanation they canceled the flight. Airline representative did not turn up at the gate for 20 minutes to collect the passengers. We managed to reschedule another flight to London Heathrow via Warsaw, where in the evening our onward flight to Bali was departing. Were supposed to arrive at LHR at 4PM, with 2.5 hours spare for check in. The flight from Warsaw was delayed again, for an hour. This did not leave enough time to change terminals. We tried, but still ultimately failed to fly out of Heathrow. Had to spend the night at the terminal, and buy new tickets to Bali, at our oen expense. So LOT had failed us twice on the same day. During our waiting time at Warsaw (over 4 hr long) we did not receive any food, drink or compensation. And now the important bit: They are NOT signed up to arbitration, unlike WizzAir or Ryanair, or any other major airline. That means the only way to get any compensation from them is if they agree, or if you go to court. We filed a claim - a month later a reply that the delay was caused by "an event like a bird strike" which under EU rules does not qualify for the compensation. This email was sent from a 'no reply' address, so there was no way to follow up and argue with them. They said if we wanted to reply, we would have to fill out a new form again and wait for a month. They basically don't care about their customers. Even though we arrived in our destination city many hours late, after one cancelation, diversion, and delay. No way to even talk to them. The only way is to take them to court, as they basically ignore any comms. By the way people - any time airline claims Bird Strike has happened - know that bird strikes are very rare, and all of them have to be registered with the CAA, so its easy to check they are lying. If they were signed up to arbitration, it would be an easy claim, but now our only option is to file a European small claim court case.

### "crew was nice"
Krakow to Warsaw. It was another excellent and comfortable flight with LOT Polish Airlines. The crew was nice, and the plane was spacious and clean. No delays, everything on time. The airbridges during departure and arrival were provided. I see lots of negative comments here, but I have checked other airlines, and they also have similar comments. Well, most people, when getting some problem, then they are looking for commenting over the internet. Still, very rarely somebody satisfied writes anything about it, so do not worry and do not be afraid of LOT. Like any other airline, it has problems sometimes too.

### "Do not recommend at all"
Do not recommend at all. I’m 6’1 and when sitting up straight, the seat finished where my neck started. This was from London to Warsaw, I’m hoping that the long leg of the flight is on a different plane.

### "always happens with LOT"
Warsaw to Kaunas. Our plane came back from the destination airport, the crew says there is was a technical problem with the aircraft. Why this always happens with LOT, I do not get it. And why you keep the shuttle bus for like 20 minutes with all people in there? What is the point, also some technical problem?

### "short and comfortable flight"
Krakow to Warsaw. Very short and comfortable flight. The crew members were nice and polite, the flight was on time. Enough space in the cabin even for tall people. Interesting articles in the on-board magazine. I recommend.

### "each day flight LO411 is delayed"
The flight delayed 30 minutes, from one and a half months each day flight LO411 is delayed from 15 minutes to more than 1 hour. No entry through the sleeve, paid on-board service, Flight 5/12/2019 I would like to give one point to Mrs Kinga the flight attendant who worked perfectly, was available to passengers, smiling and helpful. Unfortunately, the other staff of the two boys behaved as if they were going on vacation sitting in the back talking as loud as if they were alone. Lot oczywiście opóźniony 30 min, od półtora miesiąca każdego dnia lot LO411 jest opóźniony od 15 min do ponad 1 godziny. Brak wejścia przez rękawa , płatny serwis pokładowy, Lot 5/12/2019 Chciałbym dać jeden punkt dla Pani Kingi stewardesie która naprawdę pracowała wzorowo, była cały czas dostępna dla pasażerów, zawsze uśmiechnięta i pomocna. Niestety pozostały personel dwóch chłopaków zachowywało się tak jak by lecieli na wakacje siedząc z tyłu rozmawiali tak głośno jak by lecieli sami.

### "very unprofessional staff"
Not Verified |  Don't recommend, very unprofessional staff. They changed me seats from the 3A to 16A without any previous notification. They didn't want to give any explanations and the general way of work very rude. One of the worst companies to fly.

### "never take this airline"
London to Warsaw. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the flight gets delayed for no apparent reason. The staff is inattentive to connection delays. They want you to board the plane knowing that you will miss the next flight. Once you are in Warsaw, you are at their mercy and there are no good alternatives at that stage and they will continue to delay you. They forced me to buy a emergency ticket to make it to my destination in time. For anyone who values their time and wants to make it to their destination, this not an airline to take. As a professional who values his time and safety, I will never take this airline.

### "Air Belgium were very nice"
Newark to Prague via Warsaw. Our first flight to Warsaw was operated by Air Belgium who were very nice and accommodating aircraft was fine with a 2-4-2 configuration so I can sit next to my wife and don’t need to bother no one when going out of my seat. Online check in and seat selection was easy starting 36 hour prior to departure. Though the second flight was on an old aircraft takeoff and landing were smooth.

### "Try to avoid it if you can"
Both ways from Warsaw to Geneva, we have a delay. The way from Warsaw, we got 30 mins delay, and return way, we got 1 hr delay. The plane is quite old I guess. I don't know why it is best airline in Poland - the national airline, not the low budget air. It's really bad. Try to avoid it if you can.

### "Worst ever airline experience"
Warsaw to Barcelona. Worst ever airline experience. Plane was late by 1 hour 20 minutes taking off because of "computer problems". Had connecting flight in Barcelona on another airline 3 hours after "scheduled" arrival. They refused to send my bag to this other airline, so I had to get it from baggage check and take it to another terminal. Missed my flight home and spent $1,000 on a new ticket. They were unapologetic. They said on the phone that I could file a claim online. I told them there is no link to English on their site (which was true in Barcelona, so I waited until I got home and found English). There was in fact nowhere on their site where I could file a claim. Only "contact us" by email. I contacted them by email and never heard back one word.

### "LOT Airlines is pure horror"
Stockholm to Tallinn. LOT Airlines is pure horror. 7 flights in the last year, out of which 6  delayed, 2 with technical problems, including a 6 hour delay in Kraków. By far Europe’s worst airlines. Avoid if you care to have a comfortable trip and safe flights.

### "Dream flight"
Budapest to London City with LOT Polish Airlines. Dream flight. Boarded quickly, less than half full, immaculate and really comfy aircraft, lovely crew, actually had nice food and drink. Landed on time, on DLR within 10 minutes of touch down. Cost the same as Ryanair from Stansted on the way out to Budapest.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Chicago to Cluj via Warsaw. I purchased seat with bassinet for my baby. We bought seats row 10 forgot exactly the letter, but it showed that we had space for their bassinet against the wall, butthat was row 8. This is their reply email to my request for refund. Dear Ms **(not putting in my name)*, Thank you for your message regarding your travel on board of our flight LO2 on may 31st, 2019. We apologize for the time it took to review the case. We would like to inform you that the airplane which operated your flight was Boeing 787-9, where row 8 is the first in Economy Class. As per the General Rules of Carriage of passengers, the carrier reserves the right to change the type of aircraft as compared to the type indicated in the schedule. Please be aware that since you travelled in the row of your selection, unfortunately we find no grounds to offer reimbursement. Furthermore, the baby bassinets are designed for infants of up to 6 months and for safety reasons should not be used by older children. A free of charge reservation of the first row is available for passengers travelling with infants who meet the criteria. Despite your disappointment on this occasion, we hope your future travels will be satisfactory in ever respect. My baby was 5.5 months which I replied but they never got back to me. Do not fly this airline.

### "it became chaos"
Warsaw to London. I recently flew Lot Polish Airlines and I am disappointed in what I experienced. I got to the airport, and my scheduled departure time was 13:30 (2:30 PM). I looked at the departure board at 13:25, and I saw it was delayed. I went and asked the gate agent what was happening, and she looked and me and grumpily snuffed that 'the plane is delayed. It will be exactly one hour. Goodbye' and walked away. She was true to her word, and 1 hour later we all boarded via jet bridge. We all got settled on the 737 that they fixed. We taxied to the runway. The engines were now at full throttle, and then we slowed down. We came to a stop on the runway and started moving back toward the terminal. We parked at a spot on the apron, and it was announced that we would have to deplane. After half an hour on the hot and stuffy plane, everyone crammed into 3 buses and were taken to the one and only bus gate at the airport. We were told that a replacement plane would be coming soon, and it did. 5 hours later. While we were waiting though, it became chaos. In fact, I even considered cancelling my hotel in London, England and just flying straight back to Toronto, Canada (There were 2 WAW-YYZ flights that night.) And then, just as I was about to cancel everything, they announced it would be bus boarding to a plane parked at a dark, empty terminal with no jet bridge connected to it, so we got through stirs at the front and back. After we all got on, everyone was quiet and upset. At least we got to get to London. With Warsaw Chopin Airport being the only hub for Poland's flagship carrier, I would've expected them to have spare planes ready for use in case of delays. They actually had to fly one in from Dubai to get to us. They started bringing it to us as soon a LOT reported to the crew in Dubai who had a spare plane to get that shipped as a passenger-less flight to Warsaw, and it was the ugliest, yellowest plane I've ever seen. Anyway, that's all for now. Don't Forget to Travel On!

### "Highly not recommended"
Bucharest to Warsaw. Terrible airline. If you want to be late, fly LOT. Delays are constant, you cannot rely on connecting flights with them. If it`s not your only flight, or flight is not in the early morning, you almost can be sure, that something will be wrong. Flew numerous flights (20-25 flights) in last couple years, most of them were with delays. Cannot understand, how such airline is surviving in this tough market. Have been claiming to myself, that this is my last ever flight with them, but now I am sure. Had customers from Germany today, their flight was VNO-WAW-DUS. Guess what - first leg was cancelled. Absolute nightmare, not airline. Highly not recommended.

### "I would fly them again"
Budapest to Amsterdam via Warsaw. The aircraft was delayed and I was afraid to miss my connecting flight in Warsaw. However, boarding went fast and the crew managed to arrive 10 minutes before scheduled arrival time in Warsaw. I was surprised by the comfort of the seat and friendliness of cabin crew. On board a small sandwich, juice or coffee and a chocolate bar. The crew was professional. However, sometimes announcements were hard to understand due to the volume of the speakers. The legroom was fine, even being tall (195 cm). The airline has a good price/quality ratio on short haul flights. I would fly them again.

### "seats were comfortable"
Warsaw to Nice and the crew was amazing. Legroom was good and seats were comfortable. During a flight a selection of complimentary beverages was available. I recieved a sweet bun with pudding which was delicious, and before landing a chocolate wafer.

### "desperate, tired and unhappy"
Poor old 737-800 really basic without any entertainment screen and basic things. Maintenance, cleaning was also poor in seats, tables and overall cabin. Team looks desperate, tired and unhappy for the flight. Food was really awful – beef with un eatable, cold and hard with something cold I couldn’t even identify

### "zero customer service"
Budapest to New York via Warsaw. Never flying with this airline again. The aircraft was old and in a very used condition. There is absolutely zero customer service mentality at this airline. I could not find the option to select a “special” meal (vegetarian) while purchasing the ticket or during online check-in. During my 10 hour flight I have been told that they can not provide me with a special meal unless I registered it beforehand. The comment of the flight attendant when I asked where was this option so I will not miss it for my return flight was “I’m sure it’s there” and pushed the trolley away from my seat. I might have made a small mistake, but the mentality and approaching this problem is definitely not neglecting the passenger and pushing the trolley away. Interestingly they have found an “extra” different kind of special meal (religious reasons) for the passenger behind me. This airline lacks customer service mentality so much they let their passenger starve on a 10-hour long journey.

### "I was on an old aircraft"
Warsaw to Toronto. While my outbound was a pleasure aboard a 787, the same cannot be said for my return flight. This was supposed be a LOT flight when in fact I was on an aircraft operated by a Lithuanian carrier. Of the flight attendants, only a couple were from LOT with the balance from the Lithuanian airline. Generally, the service onboard was good. The food and beverages were supplied by LOT and were of average quality. My major complaint is that I was on an old aircraft. In fact, the plane was originally owned by China Airlines as was clear from the video monitors which showed our flight details in Chinese and English. The seats only reclined and were not lie-flat. This really affects my ability to sleep comfortably as I am over 6 feet tall. The crew never explained to us why we were not on a LOT plane. If I had been a Pole on the flight, I would have been quite upset as many announcements were made in English only and most of the FAs couldn't speak Polish. When one books a flight with an airline, one expects to be carried by that airline and not a substitute. I enjoying flying the 787 with its much improved air quality and LOT indicates that this aircraft is used on the Toronto-Warsaw route. So I wasn't pleased to be in a much older airplane. To sum up: "not as advertised".

### "I might have got lucky"
London to Yerevan via Warsaw. One of the few airlines flying from London to Yerevan on the dates I needed & included booked luggage at no extra charge. My flight was delayed from London Heathrow, but thankfully not more than an hour, once on the flight I found out as both legs of my journey would be under 5 hours; there would be no in flight meals, unless purchased. It didn't necessarily bother me, it was nice that there was the option of complementary tea, coffee and water as well as a chocolate wafer, there were no screens either so no IFE & no USB or plug sockets to charge your device. The flights were about as basic as you can get, felt better than low budget carriers due to ample leg space, but only marginally in terms of ground service. Crews did their best. The connecting flight was already boarding by the time we landed in Warsaw, however other than the crew moving any urgent connecting passengers to the front of the plane there were no announcements or information about gate numbers, so after a frantic run we were able to check the boards and get to the gate on time, it seems that they were not going to wait, although they knew the London flight was landing behind schedule. The second flight to Yerevan was a bit of a relief as it was not delayed and baggage arrived fine, which is something I've heard and read is not a common occurrence for the route. I don't know if I would recommend the airline as I think I might have got lucky on this occasion.

### "never ever choose this company"
Copenhagen to Larnaca via Warsaw. Very upset on the company, 3h before my flight I get a call from a lady begging me to change the flight with another company because the connection one was fully booked, I am saying no because we had only 50 min in between the flights and that was very risky, In the end we accept and we take another flight. She said we will get a compensation of 200 € right away as a compensation. We take the other flight we almost missed the connection one, we start our holiday over stressed and exhausted. 3 months after we still didn't got our compensation, and I called them today just to hear that someone is on the case and I will hear from them in a few days, but nothing about when we will receive the compensation. So thank you Lot Airlines, we for sure never ever choose this company or recommend it.

### "by far the worst airline"
Chicago to Warsaw. This is by far the worst airline to go through. Terribly rude service, no wifi, old plane, food is horrible. On top of all that lost 3 luggages. Now I'm waiting for them to still find them and send them to me. Please take my advice if you can afford the +$100 difference with different airline like Swiss or Lufthansa do it, they are truly amazing to fly with.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
Not Verified |  Budapest to New York via Warsaw. The worst airline I've ever flown. I do highly not recommended this company. The ground service in Budapest was terribly unfriendly and arrogant staff. They cancel our flight 30 hours before departure from New York back home. The service is very poor.

### "way below Singapore Airlines"
Not Verified |  LOT Polish Airlines, Singapore to Warsaw in business class. Flight on time, seats were 2-2-2 in 787 Dreamliner. Flatbed. Food and drinks ok. Service: just ok, way below Singapore Airlines. I had to make my bed, spread the white sheet on seat by myself, that would never happen on Singapore, Thai etc. Will fly again only if price is significantly cheaper.

### "I was able to sleep comfortably"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Lviv via Warsaw. After reading all of the negative reviews of this airline, I wasn't expecting very good service, but that certainly was not the case. We has a short delay in Toronto but arrived at our destination on time. so that I could catch my connecting flight. The seating configuration is 2-2-2 and the seats are an ample width and fold down so they are completely flat for sleeping. We were provided with a blanket, pillow and sheet and I was able to sleep comfortably for about 5 hours on this night flight. Attendants provided excellent service and the food was nicely presented and quite good. They also offered a good selection of beverages. All in all, I would put LOT on par with the other major European carriers and Air Canada, but certainly below the Asian ones.

### "almost always late"
Warsaw to Brussels. I like this airline except, for one thing, it is almost always late. I have missed more connections with LOT than all other airlines combined. You should always plan for this airline to be late and plan accordingly. They just can not get it together.

### "tried to overcharge us"
Lviv to Prague via Warsaw. It was the worst experience we had with an airline. Very rude from their team in Ukraine, they tried to overcharge us with their check-in luggage options with very unfriendly manners. Then on the second flight their team and one the managers were extremely rude forcing everyone to check in their carry on. !

### "Simply call it late airline"
Not Verified |  İstanbul to Toronto via Warsaw. Simply call it late airline. I read lots of negative reviews about their delays and still made the mistake of buying my ticket from them. Also their old screens were not working. I recommend you pay a few dollars more and buy your ticket from another airline instead of this bad airline

### "empty seats all around"
Toronto to Warsaw. This was a decent flight. The boarding was organized and the cabin crew was polite. The movie selection is impressive if you are into art house cinema. There were empty seats all around, so it was a comfortable flight even on economy class. Food selection did not include vegetarian options by default, which I found odd.

### "has the worst customer service"
Chicago to Warsaw. LOT has the worst customer service. We couldn't make our June 25th ORD to WAW flight and called LOT's customer service before the flight left to rebook for the next day. After waiting on hold for at least 40 minutes, our June 25th flight departed and LOT automatically cancelled our flights. LOT's customer service then said they could not rebook since our reservations were through a travel agency and the agency would have to do it. They also stated the LOT ORD ticket counter could help us the next day. So on June 26th, we were the first in-line and was given to the ORD supervisor. After doing some research, the supervisor said he could rebook us on the 5:30 pm flight that day for an extra charge of about $500/person due to change fees and fare difference (we had 5 people so $2500 in total). We agreed then waited at least an hour before the supervisor came from the LOT back room and ultimately said the 5:30 pm flights were no longer available but he could book us on the 9:30 pm flights for the same $2500 extra charge. We agreed then waited another 1-2 hours before the supervisor came from the back room saying the 9:30 pm flights were only available to us at full fares for 4 Economy and 1 Premium ($7300 in total) since he had to create new one-way reservations to keep the return flights in tact. At that point, we had no choice but to pay $7300. By the time BB made our new reservations, we were the last people waiting at the LOT ORD ticket counter or 5 hours later. We are very disappointed and angry at LOT and the supervisor for our $4800 in extra cost and time, and LOT's ineffective and inflexible processes and poor handling of a common airline situation. I've traveled many times over the years for business both domestically and internationally and LOT has the worst customer service and inefficient process/ systems. To top it off, LOT didn't respond to my formal complaint submitted via their website until I filed a complaint with the US BBB.

### "crew members showed up late"
I had a flight with LOT Polish Airlines on July 26 from Heathrow to Warsaw. I was travelling in economy class. The flight was scheduled for 10:15 am UK time. Cabin crew showed up at 10.00 and it took several minutes for them to start boarding that took quite a long time. After boarding; crew members were nowhere to be seen, hidden somewhere, there was none on the floor. We were waiting approx another 30 mins before a staff member informed us that they 'are awaiting for a decision regarding non-standard baggage'. No extra info was announced. The flight finally took off at 12:03 pm. During the flight, staff looked like they rushed through the plane; they also informed that because of some unforeseen circumstances they have no fresh supply of the food; so I spent a flight with a glass of water and sweet baton. There was no entertainment or wi-fi available. In Warsaw, we were waiting a long time to be let out of the plane without being given an explanation. Because the flight was so delayed, I have missed the coach for my destination (well over 300 km one way); two other were sold out, so I needed to pay off a huge amount of money for a private transfer. I have filled in the complaint & sent it off via LOT Polish airlines website; however, after well over a month of waiting I haven't received any response from the representatives. On my way back from Warsaw to London City, the LOT flight was delayed '15 mins only' as crew members showed up again late. The plane was quite small with not enough space for basic baggage and many people had their bags tucked underneath their feet; which was not quite safe. That was the only return flight with LOT I had, and I would not take this airline ever again.

### "I will not recommend"
Bucharest to London via Warsaw. Worst airline. Rude not helping at all for their flight late we need to wait at airport. I will not recommend. Be aware they are the worst national airline operating in Europe.

### "could-do-better Airline"
London to Minsk via Warsaw. A could-do-better Airline. As my flight from LHR was due to depart in the early hours (0630hrs) I got to the terminal the previous day to check-in electronically. The machines would not accept me neither did the surly girl in charge. However, I managed to get into a check-in desk where a very helpful gentleman checked me in. This saved me a lot of hassle the next morning. The flight took off 20 mins late. With a 2 hr flight there was basic refreshments and no in-flight entertainment. Seating was not too bad with a configuration of 3+3. Transit at Warsaw was easy and the staff helpful. The next leg of the flight was on an Embraer with seating in 2+2 configuration. Services were the same as before. I landed in Minsk on time. Not a bad airline but their London end needs more staff.

### "Do not risk using LOT Polish"
Toronto to Zaporizhia via Warsaw. Security at Warsaw Confiscated a 5 year old child's small roller scooter from my relatives who were transferring between LOT Airlines flights. No written notice or proper explanation in English was given, spoke Polish. Refused to add it to the luggage, send it by mail or allow relatives from Warsaw to pick up. The scooter is expensive from a famous brand. It was approved as a carry-on by LOT and by Toronto airport security at departure for the first part of the flight. Scooter had no batteries or sharp parts in it and is absolutely safe for air travel. No carry on regulation states that it is a prohibited item. Heard of similar  stories from friends who used LOT airlines, especially when it comes to duty free alcohol. Horrible customer service at both LOT airlines and Warsaw airport. Refused to provide any compensation and blamed one another, no respect for customers even in person at Toronto airport. The customer service representative just walked out on me when I ask to contact Warsaw airport to get the scooter from them and told me to write a bad review. Do not risk using LOT Polish Airlines or Warsaw airport. You are putting your valuables at risk and taking chances on ruining your mood with hopeless issue resolution process afterwards.

### "I am very disappointed"
Warsaw to Yerevan. Terrible airline. Every time we travel with this company we do have so many problems like to lose luggage or delayed flights. Mainly flights to Yerevan are always delayed and this was occurred not only with us but also many of our relatives who also travel with this company are always delayed. So we must reach to destination at 4:00 AM we reach at 7:00 AM. It is awful to wait in their airport as they do not even have a good duty free  or shops where we can just pass that time. And the worst thing is that they announce that the reason is that the plane comes from another place and it is not even landed. I can’t understand is it so difficult to organize the flights that such problems doesn’t occur. If the ticket were many months ago bought where is written that the flight will be 10:20 why they send the plane in such time that it just lands at 10:30 and also needs cleaning and so on. So I am very disappointed and i advice you not to choose this airline.

### "my suitcase was broken into!"
I flew from Prague to Tokyo and had a connecting flight at Warsaw on 8/20/2019. Our plane from Warsaw to Narita got delayed and I was wondering why. I only had a 2-hr sleep from a long-haul flight so when I got my baggage in Narita, I didn’t even check if there’s something wrong with my suitcase as I travel frequently and nothing like this has happened to me. When I got back home, I was so shocked that my suitcase was broken into! I immediately checked my other bags inside and saw that one of them was half opened, and another bag had items missing!

### "ruined our business trip to Korea"
On 22nd of August 2019, LO632, SOF-WAW had a delay of 30 minutes despite being on time landing from WAW. The crew on board said we were catching up in the air, however, we landed during boarding to Seoul. The fun fact is that there were some passengers from Sofia as well who received their luggage in Seoul but we didn't. We have worked at the airport for quite some time and know if the plane is going to catch up. Totally ruined our business trip to Korea because we are going to another city in the country.

### "bad service and unfriendly staff"
Singapore to Amsterdam via Warsaw. This was the first and also the last time i have flew with LOT. I have flew with a lot different airlines, but I never experienced this kind of bad service and unfriendly staff during a long distance flight. If you do expect some service from an airline, then avoid LOT. In the online check-in system LOT just block all the seats. So we had separated seats on both the first flight and our flight back home. At our first flight the ground staff just told us that the flight was fully booked, so they couldn’t help us. At the airplane no one of the other passengers wanted to change seats. The cabin crew did nothing while I was 26 weeks pregnant they just told me: sorry flight is fully booked and I had to sit alone, I found that just rude. Of course I got upset and eventually someone wanted to change seats. Again, the cabin did nothing for me, they couldn’t care that I was pregnant and upset. At our flight back home we were lucky that a friendly staff member of Singapore Airport could arrange two seats together, because again LOT (of course) was not able to help us. Botton line: do not expect any service from LOT. Besides this issue the cabin crew also wasn’t friendly during our flight. The crew didn’t smile once during our flight, it almost seems they are forced to work for LOT. When they served drinks they literally ran through the passengers, if you did not react on time you just don’t got a drink. My husband needed a pen to fill in his customs form. He asked one of the crew members if he could borrow her pen because he saw she had a pen in her pocket, she just said: ‘NO’ and walked away. Ridiculous reaction if you ask me. At the flight back home the buttons of my entertainment system were broken, so I could only use it to a limited extent. This bad experience has really affected our holiday. We are never going to fly with this airline ever again.

### "Legroom was fine"
Not Verified |  Warsaw to Paris. Flight was delayed 3h 30min. Boarding process was terrible there wasn't boarding groups. The time it took me 20 minutes to get out of the gate into my seat 28F. Legroom was fine but nothing special. Inflight service was good and very cheap (2,5 euro for sandwich). Lavatory and cabin was very dirty. Cabin crew was friendly.

### "I recommend this airline"
Warsaw to Hannover. The trip was very nice. Flight started in time and there was no problems or anything. The seats were very comfortable and crew was very nice. The only problem was there wasn't WiFi. I recommend this airline.

### "Never use this airline!"
Copenhagen to Sofia via Warsaw. Never use this airline! They will lose your luggage and they will try to rat away from responsibility. It is the standard rather than the exception to lose luggage. Any legit business would have improved their standards and procedures...

### "rude, disagreeable and impolite"
Singapore to Paris via Warsaw. The cabin crew were rude, disagreeable and impolite. We were a group of 7 family members. We tried but it was impossible to order vegetarian, diabetic or allergy food. We subsisted only on bread and butter provided with the meal as even the salad had prawns and dessert had gelatine. The hostess shouted chicken or beef several times at my aunt who only speaks French. I had to intervene to stop her tirade. From Singapore to Warsaw, the USB sockets weren't working. From Warsaw to Paris, the toilets were incredibly dirty - it was stinking, dirty water filled in the sink and toilets so dirty. Never ever again on this airline.

### "this was awful"
Amsterdam to Warsaw. Lost my bag along with other 67 bags somewhere in Warsaw, it has been 3 days - still no tracing available, no updates. Ground staff at the boarding was very rude, in-flight service people had no manners. When I called to check where my bag is after 24 hours - the phone support is non-existent. I choose to fly LOT because I have gold status with Star Alliance, this was awful - it was my first and the last time.

### "I enjoyed my flight"
I was flying from Warsaw to London. No delay, cabin crew was kind. I got free candy bar during my flight. Nice legroom and clean toilet. I enjoyed my flight.

### "my best international flight"
Krakow to Los Angeles via Warsaw. I thought LOT Polish Airlines did a great job. Yes, they were late to board by 1 hour but we arrived only 15 minutes late. My bags also arrived without any problems which is a good thing. I flew premium economy which probably made all the difference in the world. Seats were comfortable and food was pretty good. This was my best international flight yet. The entertainment was also good. They even had some movies that have not yet been released on Netflix.

### "ground staff have no manners"
Gdansk to Warsaw. The airline didn't manage to sign a luggage agreement with Emirates since Emirates opened Warsaw eight years back (which LOT should certainly have done- as many passengers connect LOT-EK, and Emirates easily sends luggage to the final destination with LOT given that the first leg is on EK). Their ground staff have no manners or customer service attitude.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I enjoyed this direct flight from London City to Vilnius. The planes were clean and on time,and the staff were friendly. It was my first time flying LOT and I was pleasantly surprised.

### "a big disappointment"
Singapore to Prague via Warsaw. I fly LOT for business within Europe a lot so I decided to fly with them outside Europe. However... The crew was little bit rude on non-Polish people not really want to speak English. I ordered a special meal. The first of the meals was delivered with the seat number written on a napkin. When the second meal was served, a flight attendant asked me if I ordered a special meal. Upon the confirmation, she asked where is my seat - I exchanged it with my daughter so she could seat by the window (I was unable to do so during the check-in). After that, the flight attendant went away without giving me the meal. I had to asked for the special meal while the standard meal was served otherwise I'd get the standard meal which will cause me health issues. The seats in their Boeing 787 are not very comfy. While LOT is good for short-haul flights, the long-haul flight was a big disappointment. I do not recommend flying LOT on the long-haul flights.

### "Good value for money"
I have been traveling with LOT Polish Airlines for more than 25 years. LOT has been keeping decent international standards and levels of service. Good value for money. Food has been good. Staff OK, professional. Ground service good. Luggage never lost.

### "never fly with them again"
Moscow to Kosice via Warsaw. The worst airline in the entire world! They cancelled my flight from Moscow 2 months ago, but they didn't tell me about it. No email, no call, nothing. Then I came to the airport and was wondering why my flight is not on monitors. I was told by LOT representative that the flight was cancelled 2 months ago. You didn't care about me overstaying my Russian visa because of the cancelled flight and I had to chase it and PAY for it. And honestly nobody wants to go through the stress I went because everybody knows how hard it is to get permission to leave Russia if you overstay visa. Then when I got eventually to Warsaw I have asked 3 times at LOT desk if they will handle my luggage all the way through to Kosice. I was told yes, because it's a connecting flight. Then I came to Kosice and of course my luggage is lost. I will never fly with them again.

### "rather strange really"
Split to Gdansk via Warsaw. Departure from Split airport was delayed because the plane from Warsaw flew in late. As the captain informed, the delay was caused by the prolonged check-in of passengers to Split. As a result, the plane landed at WAW at the start time of the GDN connection. It could take only five minutes to hold the plane to the GDN direction and all passengers could have made the connection flight. This is strange - an international plane can wait but domestic no. Another LOT proposal is to drive a 400-kilometre distance by taxi - rather strange really.

### "a major headache"
Flight from Hamburg to Larnaca via Warsaw; the first part of the flight was performed by a Bombardier 400 instead of a bigger and roomier jet plane and had to check in cabin luggage to be carried in the plane cargo space. I bought a seat with extra legroom (money down the drain) and got exactly the opposite. Upon arrival to Warsaw with a major headache from the noisy aircraft delays starting coming one after the other and so far departure for Larnaca has been postponed by 2 hours for 00.30 07/7 instead of 22.35 06/7 and on top of that, they changed my seat again despite the fact I paid for extra legroom! When I mentioned this to airline officials they laughed at me and offered no answer! I flew hundreds of times with all kinds of airlines but the worst by far title goes to LOT! Their departures are always delayed from a few minutes to a few hours (talking about the flights I flew with them). So my conclusion is fly with LOT if you don't have a specific schedule to keep or something fragile that can't travel in the plane under storage and you will surely get to your destination sometime later than expected.

### "seats and legroom fantastic"
Not Verified |  From Warsaw to Tokyo. LOT is a great airline. The flight was delayed, but the crew gave us some snacks and apologized. The seats and the legroom were fantastic. During the flight the crew was nice and helpful. The entertainment in 787-9 is very modern and offers a big choice of movies and series. You can also fill a questionnaire there.

### "Don't expect any service"
Dussseldorf to Kaunas via Warsaw. Hoping to fly to Kaunas, but after spend some time at the Dusseldorf International airport the destination changed to "Annulliert". There is no LOT crew or service desk at the airport so you can only try to contact them by phone. After several attempts of more then 30 minutes hold the line music I went home. Don't expect any service at this airline.

### "Very bad service"
Oslo to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. My flight was canceled while we have been waiting in the airport after check-in without any early notices! We found out only from information on the screen! The didn't given any reason or answer because there were LOT counters in the airport. We had to contact them by phone waiting a long time for an answer. We didn't get any refund! Very bad service!

### "ruined our vacation"
❎ Not Verified | Tokyo to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. In one word nightmare. The first time im gave them a try and will never happen again. The connection flight has been delayed 8 times and they gave us one voucher to survive in the airport unbelievable. I am so dissolved, they ruined our vacation.

### "It is terrible airline"
It is terrible airline. I had a flight from Amsterdam to Wroclaw. The flight transferred in Warsaw. The first flight delayed in 2 hours and then I missed the second flight to Wroclaw. Therefore, I have to wait more 4 hours in the airport to take another flight to Wroclaw. So I lost total 1 day in the airport. It is waste a lot of time.

### "missing my connection in Warsaw"
Was originally booked Tbilisi to Dusseldorf via Warsaw on a flight supposed to depart around 4am from Tblisi, having only 55m to connect in Warsaw. Only after booking the ticket I found online the on time performance of LOT's flights from Tblisi is abysmal, with a delay of an hour or more happening almost every day the flight is operated. And indeed, when I arrived to the airport I found out the incoming aircraft was delayed, which would mean missing my connection in Warsaw. However, the ground staff in Tblisi managed to rebook me on Lufthansa flights via Munich, meaning I arrived on time and received much better service than I expected on LOT. All in all a good experience.

### "rude and appalling"
Toronto to Warsaw. Due to minor health issue where I just need extra leg room, I purchased a seat with space for extra fees. For no reason provided, it was changed. When I brought to LOT attention, they said they have their list and I did not purchase the seat I claimed. They were not interested to see my ticket printed and kept saying I did not purchase it. Essentially calling me a liar. To make the situation worse, they offered for additional substantial money to upgrade to 1st class. I am Polish and old school, so I have seen Polish hospitality, but LOT's behaviour was rude and appalling. All passengers around my seat got quite upset by LOT's behaviour. Dear LOT, you have a long way to be professional. There are options to fly to Poland and you have lost 10 passengers forever. To readers, be careful, as LOT is apparently doing you a favour to have you aboard. Replies I received from LOT are a joke and this behaviour is corporate culture. This is not a question of what is legal, but what is decent, common sense and polite.

### "very smooth and no issues occurred"
The booking and the flight itself were very smooth and no issues occurred. A very cosy and 'family-like' atmosphere was distinguishable on board. The Embraer operating on route to London City (LCY) is a brand new one, however its legroom is not as good as it is in the older LOT's Embraers. A small refreshment which consisted of a cup of tea/coffee and a glass of water, followed by a chocolate bar were comprehensive for such a short flight. The prices of other food and drinks on board were however reasonable. The crew were quite attentive and really kind in contact with passengers, though during most of the flight they were seating in the back part of the airplane and talking to each other. The thing that in my opinion could be improved is the communication between the pilots and the passengers - it would be a nice touch if they informed passengers about e.g. the waiting time for landing (as it is mostly done in British Airways before landing in London).

### "flights are normally on time"
Not Verified |  Billund to Warsaw. I fly with Lot Polish airlines more that once per month to different locations in Europe and China. The flights are normally on time, with some minor delays from Warsaw airport in the afternoons, especially on Sunday evenings. My Monday early morning flight to Brussels was cancelled once, but I received an SMS an afternoon in advance which I appreciated. As a frequent flyer, I have an access to business lounges in many countries. I use LOT insurance on trip cancellations in case of sickness. I used it once and I could claim my money back from the insurer. Although the procedure was a bit extended, and not enough information on it on lot website, but it worked out in the end. The thing that I find really annoying is the telephone customer service that is impossible to reach outside of regular working hours and at the weekends. Would be also recommended to keep the frequent flyer number associated with the login details so I do not need to enter it every time I check in online. When the last two are improved, I could spread a good word on the airline. Also Warsaw airport misses plugs to charge phones!

### "choose another airline"
Kraków to Singapore via Warsaw. This time I survived with minor delays, and I have to say that it usually occurs on domestic flight much more than on long haul. The aircraft was clean, but one reason how I chose my carrier is the level of service provided. The WAW-SIN leg was super unpleasant for me. It was messy, no smiling. I felt like a 4th class passenger on the kettle wagon, like the biggest burden on their shoulders. I even tried to be nice, bothered them as little as possible, but they looked bitter and unhappy with what they were doing. Are they forced to work there? I can hardly recall an unpleasant crew like they were. On my return it was a bit better and tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, yet my conclusion is that I will choose another airline for my long haul flights.

### "Poor experience with LOT"
Poor experience with LOT Polish Airlines. I flew from GDN to Yerevan via WAW and back from Tbilisi. All 4/4 flight segments delayed. According to history and statistics this occurs for weeks almost without exceptions - the airline has significant problems with capacity and reliability. I didn't reach connection flight. Although medium haul (3-4 h) segments the airline chartered old and uncomfy (worse than LCC) airplanes. I have never seen such mess and lack of professionalism during boarding and disembarking plane. Poor service on board - only advantage are quite affordable refreshments prices. Cabin staff quite OK,

### "never recommend this airline"
New York to Krakow via Warsaw. This was the worst flight I’ve ever been, after delaying my flight for 2 hours for no reason and making us miss our connecting flight to Krakow and there was no people to help us when we landed in Warsaw. Then they got us a charter bus which took 8 hours, instead of a 55 min flight. The flight attendants had nasty attitudes. I would never recommend this airline to anyone!

### "never met such mess"
Krakow to Warsaw. I never met such mess, unpleasant crew, lack of punctuality. I take LOT several time within last months and met significant delays, lack of luggage delivery on time, dirty planes. This is the worst airline I ever met.

### "whole trip is quite average"
Gdansk to Warsaw. I had this unpleasantness to fly with LOT lines, in an instant I became a lady and a mister, my boarding cards sow that. How can two tickets be issued to the same person? The level of ground passenger service at a very low level. The whole trip is quite average.

### "last time flying LOT"
Not Verified | Warsaw to Copenhagen. I have used LOT a few times now and every single time the planes are late for departure. I am boarding a plane now and I will never ever use this airline again. If you are not in a hurry LOT is fine - if in a hurry better choose someone else. 2/10 = last time flying LOT.

### "airline is unreliable"
Warsaw to Krakow. This airline is unreliable, if you value your time avoid at all cost. Constant delays and cancellations. Any connecting flights with LOT are a huge risk. It’s always the same excuse for delays “operational reasons

### "a pleasant journey"
It was a pleasant journey onboard LOT Polish Airlines. Round trip from Krakow to Bucharest. All flights were on time, and boarding was reliable, the cabin crew was amicable. It is a high-speed connection with a beautiful view of the Carpathian Mountains.

### "is the worst airline"
Lviv to Nice via Warsaw. LOT Polish Airlines is the worst airline. I recently traveled from LWO-NCE via WAW and my flight landed in Milan. I was suppose to land in Nice France. Which is 500 kilometers from Milan. LOT polish airlines told passengers they need to find there own way at their own cost to get to Nice. Passengers that want to go back to Warsaw and get rebooked had to wait 2 days since LOT doesn’t Fly daily to NCE. I had to pay $75 for a train which took 8 hours and $25 for a metro. All in all why fly with an airline and pay them money when they can’t even get you to your destination on time or even to where you need to get. This is the 4th time this year LOT screwed me over. I am done. Lucky European laws will get me my compensation for this canceled and humiliating flight.

### "worst airline I have used"
LOT must be the worst airline I have used. On the flight from Kiev to Warsaw, my luggage came back with wheel ripped off. Their online claim policy for damage luggage has a 7 days limit. I have filled up their online claim form twice. After submitting the form you don't receive an instant confirmation email. The customer service told me to wait 5 days then contact them or submit the form again if I dont hear from them. Submitted the form twice, waited.... and nothing. The only number they have is to automated phone line service and you actually can't talk to anyone. You can contact the advisor via live chat, which is pretty useless and they tell you to submit the form again. I would give 0 points if I could. Unhelpful, unreliable, with bad constructed system. Avoid at all cost.

### "all flights significant delays"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. Nothing happened on time, I took 4 flights with LOT for my trip and all flight faced significant delays. Staff was polite and accommodating.

### "No space for legs"
Zagreb to Chicago via Warsaw with LOT Polish. Don't go with this airline if you go over 3h flight. No space for legs if you are a tall person, seats are quite uncomfortable. But that's only a problem if you fly to destinations over 3 hours. The flight attendants are not helpful, their English is hard to understand. If you call them to your seat for help or to get a glass of water they will be mad, and will tell you to get up and pour it yourself in the back of the plane, and if you are sitting in the middle you are in trouble as every time you need to ask people to move so you can stay hydrated or want to go to the toilet. What's the point in the call button than? This is my first and I hope last bad review about anything, including restaurant, flights, hotels etc. The workers at the airport are very rude and minding their own business, don't really care about helping, instead they tell you "Go read the screens or use the smart screen helper" without even looking you. The only good side is that aircraft captains are very professional and speak very good English.

### "value for money"
Amsterdam to Tokyo via Warsaw. Due to the problem with the 737MAX, LOT used an older 737 and a chartered one from Blue Air on the way back. From WAW to NRT, 787-9 Seats in business (2x2x2) are a bit short in flat for 6"3 but wide enough to manage a few hours sleep. Service was constant and cabin crew try to keep you comfortable. Food choice was between Western and Japanese. Tasted nice. Wine selection was could. The Polish white wine Polaris was amazing. Excellent value for money.

### "staff were rude, never smiled"
Tokyo to Warsaw. Overall not at all impressed about the service on this flight. The staff was far from being attentive and friendly, were rude, never smiled and didn’t attend to passengers calls. On a 11 hour flight only two drink services and no snacks, which caused a great number of people walking up and down the aisle to help themselves at the drink trolley in the back of the plane. This obviously caused annoyance for all passengers seating on the aisle, who were not able to rest at all. Would recommend reviewing hospitality and service standards, a smile and a thank you every now and then would be appreciated.

### "avoid at all costs for long haul"
Seoul to Heathrow via Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. Most awful experience! Flight was cancelled 5 minutes before boarding. The staff were then rude and extremely impolite. Took them ages to help each person, with a lot of people missing out on leaving flights. The guy who dealt with me, did not even apologise or speak. Instead typed away at his computer huffing away. Not only that the airline itself is very basic with the worst entertainment and food value. Great for a cheap quick flight as it’s very affordable, just avoid at all costs for long haul.

### "absolute garbage airline"
Poznan to Oslo via Warsaw. An absolute garbage airline who are late or cancelled for unknown reasons as staff are not professional enough to provide information to the passengers. If you have a connecting flight and you depend on an airline to be on time,  do not use LOT.

### "unprofessional and rude attitude"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed by unprofessional and rude attitude of certain personal from LOT flight attendant and staff at the airport. Flight was from LA to Vienna, transfer in Warsaw. Flight from Lax delayed almost 2h which result in missing connection to Vienna so I was forced to stay one night in Warsaw. I asked a multiple times is there a possibility to catch the flight but they said they didnt know, because they are not sure when we will land ( at that point we were almost 7h in the air!) So, when we finally landed people at the airport were so “power driving” - no, with that passport you need to go to that window, etc. I told that woman very nicely a multiple times that I am trying to catch the flight, but nothing helped, she even didn't want to listen to me. Anyway, I have a better luck on the next window and guy even assured me that airplane is still at the airport and that I will make it. So, I passed the transfer and I didnt have an idea where to go ( very poor organization). In my opinion the worst airport which I ever been, and I am frequent Europe traveler. In the end, very rude woman (she even came very near to my face) from LOT front desk just gave me in advance prepared ticket for the next morning, and hotel voucher. So, I naturally at that point I was very upset and I requested whatever transfer from Warsaw to whatever city in central/east europe so I can catch some connection to Vienna- answer was - we dont have any connections to anywhere after 7.50pm. So, if you dont have time constrains and if you have a strong nerves for rudeness then choose LOT. Otherwise, stick with Lufthansa, Austrian, air France and Turkish airline. Unfortunately, I was forced to choose LOT this time, but there will not be a second time.

### "disappointing customer service"
Warsaw to Krakow. We booked a round trip flight with a rebooking (with a fee) option for a flight on the next day. 30 minutes later, we got a call about our another connecting flight, and so had to change the just booked tickets. We tried to call the call center, but they didn't answer the calls for almost 3 hours in total. Since the flight was on the next day I tried to reach them via Facebook as well, but they refused to help me and asked to keep calling the calling the call center. The entire call costed me over 30 AUD. In the end I managed to get connected and was quoted an extremely high price for changing one way hours by a few, which was 64% of the original ticket price. The new flight time we requested was originally cheaper than our booked one, but during the 3 hours waiting time on the call the price doubled. Extremely disappointing customer service. Wasted half a day on trying to reach their customer service, and wasted a lot of money. Also, a lot of stress for me and my partner.

### "Once but never again!"
Amsterdam to Singapore via Warsaw. I am deeply disappointed that a full fare airline like LOT does not compensate passengers after a daylong delay, hiding behind all kinds of excuses. No compensation, no booking onto partner airlines, no issue of vouchers/hotel booking, just ‘flight is canceled, the next one is available in four days'. Even flying Business Class with LOT does not make a difference. Apparently they don’t care enough about maintaining that passenger demographic. Shame. Once but never again!

### "cancelled my flight with no reason"
Moscow to Toronto via Warsaw. Very bad airline, my first time and last time with this airline, it cancelled my flight with no reason.

### "pleased by the efficiency"
Krakow to Moscow via Warsaw. I was pleased by the efficiency, aircraft cleanliness and the for-purchase food which was reasonably tasty and not exorbitant. Legroom for a 6-footer was fine. For economy class, it was all good.

### "they changed the aircraft"
Warsaw to Geneva. LOT Polish Airlines is by far one of the least practical airlines from the European mid tier of commercial, national airlines. What is annoying is their bizarre policies which they supposedly think are ok but which annoy frequent travellers who experienced standard, typical service on other airlines (I am LH Gold status holder). My favorite two examples are: - times of boarding, in case of the delay, at their airport in Warsaw are always adjusted 5 min at the time. So you never know if you still have 15 min time to seat at the lounge or you need to go to the gate. Instead you appear at the gate and the time is postponed every 5 minutes. Sometimes 2 times, sometimes 5-6 times. Very annoying. - seat selection, especially in the emergency row. One of the gold status members is free seat selection. So I select an emergency seat for more leg room, at check in online I have to give my consent that I speak English, am able to open the door etc. When I then enter the plane, 70% of time I find out that row 12 was ultimately not an exit row (which is 14) and they never inform you that they changed the aircraft. Very annoying. The crew is not helpful at all, they just say they didn’t know. I am not sure who manages this company but they clearly do not fly very often.

### "No mention of compensation"
Flew Edmonton to Warsaw return. Booked online at LOT Airlines. Premium Economy. 1) No mention whatsover of mixed cabin. Straight economy with Air Canada Edmonton to Toronto leg without being able to book seats online. Was seated in row 29. Same situation with Westjet on the return leg from Toronto to Edmonton. Unable to find any mention of fare classes on LOT's website. 2) Flight from Toronto to Edmonton was cancelled. LOT did not advise me of this cancellation and only after I contacted them did they fly me out the next day. No mention of compensation. Extra night hotel expense and missed day of work. I have never had these issues with any NA based airline and I fly a lot of miles.

### "nothing to complain about"
Warsaw to Cracow. LOTs performance on domestic flights is alright, however, it could be better. The plane was OK, average leg space. Flight was on time. I have nothing to complain about, beside the food. A small chocolate bar is too little.

### "Stinking and filthy"
A chartered type aircraft arrived late, then the tyre was faulty and took 1 hour to change, the aircraft was certainly an ex Ryanair and appeared about 20 years old. Stinking and filthy.

### "extremely comfortable"
Minsk to Warsaw. This is one of the best flights I had in Europe. The airplane is extremely comfortable, with soft seats and plenty of space to stretch your legs. The airplane has a 2+2 configuration, meaning that you have either a window or aisle seat. Flight attendant are corteous and provide a free drink and chocolate bar. Boarded in Minsk through the airbridge and left on time despite the challenging conditions (snowing and frost). Very good for such a short time flight. I wish LOT had more of this airplanes..

### "flight attendants were nice and attentive"
The plane was brand new and seats were very comfortable despite being of the ultrathin sort. They also had a power connection in front of each seat! The flight attendants were nice and attentive: we received a free drink and a chocolate. I did not like the short seat pitch (although I am 1.71 my knees were solidly against the seat in front of me when it started to recline) and the lack of windows (really? we still have rows without windows in 2019?). Above all, a 45 minutes delay meant we arrived after 10.30pm. Looking at statistics, this flight is always late; why not change the schedyule, then?!?! Although I would recommend LOT, I would strong discourage taking this flight, especially in row 11!

### "never had any problems"
Warsaw to Chicago. My wife and I have several flights per year with LOT and different airlines. My wife also works for different airlines so I can say we are frequent flyers and can give you honest review. We fly to Poland 1-2 times a year and we never had any problems. Every time so far LOT customer service is really great to us. Are there any bad apples? of course, like everywhere else, but there are many airlines that customer service is worse! LOT is almost always on schedule - are there delays? of course like everywhere else and not always because of the airlines itself, there are many factors that cause delays. Food comparing to many other airlines is very good. They serve a lot, quick and leave people alone so you can rest. If you need anything, ask for service - simple as that. Ticket prices are very comparative and if you search online, you can get awesome deals. I think LOT used to be really bad (many years ago) but now from my experience LOT is top airlines and I recommend to give them a try.

### "worst European airline"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Warsaw. Once I thought that Alitalia was the worst European airline, until I tried LOT Polish. Aircraft was old with poor space between seats. Poor space for luggage and you’re asked to put your luggage down the seats when the inflight crew lets other passengers store jackets and sweaters in the space that’s supposed for hand luggage. Delayed flights without explanation, while they let you at queue for almost 1 hour waiting to board. Bad boarding, without order. Inflight crew isn’t the most kind or helpful. No entertainment system. I heard that a passenger was denied to use the toilets because, as attendant said: There’s no power or water by now, maybe after take off there will be. This is what you expect of a low cost airline, but not of the flagship airline of a country. I would rather take a stop flight instead of flying again with LOT.

### "LOT is getting better and better"
Mombasa to Warsaw. I've got to admit, LOT is getting better and better. LOT's Boeing 787 Dreamliner's is one of the best aircrafts I flown. Legspace was above average (81cm), seat pitch as well. I found it extremaly comfortable. Cabin is very clean and modern. IFE is average. Cabin crew is professional and very polite. The food option was however very very mediocre. This was a charter flight, so that was not the food they serve on regular flights. The second thing, that I can complain about are the co-passengers, but their behaviour cannot affect my opinion as it's not the airlines fault. I highly recommend this airline.

### "Complete waste of time"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Warsaw. I wasted two hours of my time at Los Angeles airport because of LOT. I had my boarding pass, no checked luggage, so I went straight to security. After waiting an hour there, I was told that the boarding pass was not valid, and I had to go at the LOT counter. There, an agent told me me, laughing: ah yes of course mobile boarding passes don’t work for LOT flight here! After that I wasted another hour waiting to get it printed at the counter. If they know anyway that mobile boarding passes don’t work in LAX for your flights, why allow people to get them from their site?! Then at the counter, I was told that my carry-on luggage was too heavy, whereas on my flight to LAX (also with LOT) it was ok! I told them it didn't make sense, as they should have the same rules for the same planes. They didn't want to hear anything and I had to check in my luggage, resulting in losing even more time at my destination. Complete waste of time!

### "It is an expensive airline"
Bucharest to Oslo via Warsaw. The departure for my flight from Bucharest to Warsaw (on the way to Oslo) seemed to be OK until, one second before liftoff, aircraft went in full braking (from liftoff speed) with nose gear slamming back on the runaway. Explanation given was technical problem. Of course after the failed liftoff attempt we had to re-fuel. One on top of the other, our connection flight was good and lost. Arrived in Warsaw after connecting flight departure. So we were offered with alternative flight connection to Copenhagen, then to Oslo. Arrived in Oslo with 3 hours delay. It is noted the helpful attitude of ground personnel in Warsaw airport. Generally the short haul flights are on Embraer machines, a bit cramped. Catering onboard is free of charge (water, coffee, tea and a candy bar). Nevertheless the price paid for a sandwich and a refreshment was ridiculously low, so no problem. It is an expensive airline for the level of services offered.

### "shameful treatment of travelers"
Split to Warsaw. Sometimes we meet with the term “low cost line” and how to call an expensive line that doesn’t meet any standards? I had with the friends a flight from Split to Warsaw by LOT Airlines and I do not know why? Maybe over booking - I was transferred to business class, which is really a substitute on short routes but exist. After take off, a pretty embarrassed stewardess informed me that unfortunately there is no meal for me because I’m not planned passenger. It’s a shameful treatment of travelers. As the travel class rises, should with all consequences or not at all.

### "flight is always late"
Warsaw to Sofia. The flight to Sofia is always late, regardless of weather or any other conditions. Apparently a management decision has been made in this case in order for other flights to be on time. Regardless - a negative review is due here.

### "found the cabin service to be attentive"
We had to book a return flight urgently to return to the UK because of health reasons, we had limited choice from Astana, Kazakhstan, and when I read the LOT Airline reviews on Skytrax I almost didn't book this flight. I understand that flight experiences with the same airline can be variable, and that the better airlines, reduce the number of problems. However, my wife needed wheelchair assistance, which was provided at Astana, Warsaw and Heathrow. We were never delayed from leaving the plane. The change at Warsaw was a short time and we were managed efficiently through the airport. The temperature in Astana was about -20deg requiring the plane to be deiced, and there was snow on the ground at Warsaw. Despite the weather both flights left close to their planned departure times. Despite previous reports of disinterested cabin crew, we found the cabin service to be attentive. The premium Economy seats were the same as Business Class, so don't pay the premium unless you want a linen table cloth! The food was good, I was offered two options, I went for what was offered as chicken, but it was in fact duck, which was fine by me and was tender and with a nice sauce.From my experience of these two flights, I would have no hesitation in flying LOT again, we have experienced much much worse on long haul.

### "the worst experience ever"
New York to Riga via Warsaw. I was waiting for my flight to start boarding in the business lounge in Riga. The monitor kept displaying that the flight was ready for check in, not boarding or delayed. When the flight time came, the monitor was still showing check-in, I decided to go to the gate nevertheless and found out that the gate was already closed. The LOT representative at the gate refused to help me, the plane was still there, visible from the gate but she repeatedly refused to call the staff and let me in. Upon my insistence, she just stopped talking to me. I went to the LOT ticket office and they said they knew about that monitor problem but it is not their responsibility. LOT refused to reimburse the ticket, I ended up spending one extra day in Riga, paying for a new ticket, taxis, hotel and wasted my weekend. Never again with LOT, this was the worst experience ever.

### "appalling service"
Transit flight to London via Warsaw. Outbound flight delayed by 2 hours resulting in not making the connecting flight in Warsaw. Placed on an afternoon flight and ended up spending 9 hours in the airport. Ground staff rude and not willing to talk about the possibility of an earlier flight on another airline, they just passed us the boarding pass and said this is all we are offering. Roughly 25 passengers on my flight stranded in Warsaw with connecting flights to Germany, Brussels and the UK. Just an unreliable airline. Having sent in the complaint 3 weeks ago, still no reply. As for their business class, food substandard, seat not so comfortable, leg room definitely not like other star alliance airlines. As a gold member, I am surprised star alliance lets them get away with this appalling service.

### "premium economy is a gem"
Venice to Singapore via Warsaw. I know that this is not a perfect airline with so many cancellations and delays everybody is speaking about. I guess I was lucky as my flights were not cancelled. They were delayed but fortunately not enough to miss my connection. If have I travelled economy or business, my experience probably would have been similar to others here, somewhere between mediocre to bad. But their premium economy is a gem! Something really special, probably the best product of their kind! Much better than other bigger and more famous airlines. The seat is wide and comfortable in 2-3-2 configuration compared to economy 3-3-3; with good recline, legrests and foot rests, the cabin and lavatories impeccable. The food and beverage service excellent. Everything very elegantly presented with real cuttlery, china and different real glasses according to the drink. From welcome prosecco, aperitifs, wine to coffee or tea or midnight glass of water not even once was the plastic cup used! The meal is substantial and well presented. cabin crew nice, on par with other european airlines. On demand inflight entertainment similar to others, nothing to complain.The only exception are the cheap earphones which definitely should be changed. And one particular thing, probably unique to LOT: they have premium class even on connecting european flights: last row of business, in front of the curtain with service level slightly below business but you still get a very nice meal and a choice of drinks. With premium you feel special during the whole trip, not just on intercontinental flight. My trip from Venice to Singapore via Warsaw and back was memorable And I would definitely fly with them again

### "The seat was terrible"
This is one of the worst flights I have taken. I upgraded to business class since this flight was operated by Air Italy and they dont have premium economy so I wanted to get the extra space and sleep. The seat was terrible! There was no flat bed on the plane. My inflight entertainment didnt even work. The staff were all from Air Italy. Meals were terrible, food was not edible. Drinks were barely available. Everything I wanted was not offered, they told me these drinks are "sold out". I couldn't even sleep on this flight. The dessert was only fruit. I am very disappointed. LOT is the worst airline in Europe. The flight was delayed by 2 hrs for no reason. I dont know why you would pay to fly in Business if the service is like with  Ryanair. One of the worst flights I have taken in business class. Thanks LOT for the disappointment.

### "Economy class is horrible"
Moscow to Toronto via Warsaw. Economy class is horrible, seats are very uncomfortable, food is horrible. Flight attendants unfriendly. Moreover, I missed my first flight because they couldn’t for some reason to print my boarding pass and they made me to buy a completely new ticket. I had the worst experience. Avoid them at any cost!

### "Service onboard was relatively poor"
Warsaw to Brussels on the new B737 Max 8. The flight was slightly delayed, but it wasn't a problem for me. Aircraft B737 Max 8 (SP-LVD) has high ceilings and was clean. Leg room was comparable to other major carriers. Service onboard was relatively poor (chocolate bar and water, tea, coffee), but it was only 2h flight. I would fly LOT again if any chance and I recommend it to other passengers.

### "Service on board was poor"
Warsaw to Gdansk. This flight was a part of flight from Dubai (first leg fro Dubai to Warsaw was operated by Emirates). After leaving Emirates plane I was heading to pass control which was surprisingly fast, all counters was opened but automated gates was closed. However after passing pass control there is only two lines for security screening, which was quite long already. I found it's easier to go outside, reprint boarding pass outside in the check-in counter and pass security control from check-in area directly. After doing this I stayed in Polonez lounge which is very comfortable and well provided with good food. Boarding started on time however after we board the plane we had to wait for other transfer passengers which delay my flight for around 30 minutes. Service on board was poor but enough for 30 minutes flight. My luggage was transfered from Dubai, passed to LOT in Warsaw and reached safely final destination in Gdańsk without any problems.

### "gone without any surprises"
Flying by LOT from Tallin to Gdańsk through Warsaw. I've made Online checkin so at the airport I had only to drop my luggage and print boarding passes. Airport security went very fast due to access to fast track (but in normal queue also wasn't many people waiting). Lounge was located next to the entrance to duty free area. Before boarding ground staff had to travel between boarding deck and a plane which makes cold wind come inside terminal and cause everybody start to freeze. However we start boarding as soon as possible (just 10 minutes after scheduled time). First flight was operated by Estonian airline Nordica. Service onboard was poor (chocolate bar and water, coffee or tea like on all LOT flights). Crew on ground and on board was very friendly (All Estonians I've meet was very nice). All trip to Warsaw and next part to Gdańsk was gone without any surprises and my luggage arrived on time.

### "such a terrible airline"
Warsaw to Gdansk. I have never seen such a terrible airline. Due to a funny partial strike, I have waited at airport for 3 hours. No announcement about strike, some ground personnel walking around and speaking in Polish. Finally they take us to a bus stand by walking. Then we waited a bus. Bus arrived after 40 minutes. We arrived at Gdansk Airport which is closed and there were no bus, taxi in the vicinity. LOT evn could not think how we can reach the city center at 5 o'clock in the morning when thay dropped us at the airport. I have informed LOT about this situation and they give an answer after 20 days. Thy were just defending themselves with unbelievable stories. I have repeated my claim and they have repeated their unbelivable and nonsense claims. There is no any polite word in their response even a word of excuse. I think they dont deploy suitable personnel in their customer service. As far as concerning LOT, you cannot find quality control and a clever organization may work in crises managment skills. So, I will advise everybody not to fly LOT Airlines. Ther are many other airlines flying to Poland and you must prefer one of them but nver LOT. But if you have time to spend airports and intercity bus travel you can prefer LOT.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Toronto to Warsaw. Absolutely horrible experience - avoid at all costs, for the sake of your work, life, and sanity! Flight was cancelled 2 days before the original date. No reason was given, just a simple text message from the airline saying, “LOT informs: flight LO046 on 05JAN19 was cancelled. Contact us: in Poland +48225777755; other countries-check lot.com. Sorry for inconvenience.“ The staff on the line were impolite and had very little empathy for the cancellation, with the nearest rebooking 2 days away. The cost of this cancellation includes missed days at work, a train connection, cost of living in another country 2 extra days, not to mention the immeasurable consequence of co-workers and supervisors who depend on me. The worst experience.

### "of course no apologies"
Vilnius to Düsseldorf via Warsaw. I have received a short message informing that my flight will be delayed by 1 hour which means I would miss my connecting flight. I had similar experience before with other companies from the Star Alliance and always was contacted by airline representatives offering a solution to the problem. In case with LOT I had to call their call center, was waiting about 7 min till I got connected to an operator. The lady wasn’t trying to be helpful and just stated yes, you will miss your connecting flight. I had to insist proactively on the rebooking for an alternative connective flight. After timely discussions this was finally done. And of course no apologies for the inconvenience caused, seems that for LOT customers this is a standard.

### "call-service saved my Christmas"
Amsterdam to Tokyo via Warsaw. Not particularly about the flight itself but their customer call-service saved my Christmas vacation, and would like to say that they were outstanding. May not be a big deal on their side but they were able to book another flight although I had missed my original one, and the deadline had passed. This ultimately saved my family and I total of +3600euros, or would have missed my chance to see my family again. I never write reviews for anything usually, but thought I'd do something back even if its very insignificant. Shoutout to you 1581, you were my Christmas present to say the least! On the contrary, the flight and the flight service was appalling.

### "refused rebooking"
Amsterdam to Singapore via Warsaw. Outbound fine. Reasonable service and food was good. Seating was fine but if the seat in front reclines access to the aisle becomes almost impossible if in a window seat due to poor layout. Flight was late leaving Warsaw but did not impact much at destination. Inbound SIN - AMS did not occur due to Lot cancelling the flight 5 days in advance. Rerouting refused with earliest date offered being January 9th, a delay of 4 days. Lot refused to transfer to another Star Alliance flight citing fare I paid (over £1000 ) refused to give reason for cancellation, did not comply with EU261/2004 in regard of written notice of rights, refused rebooking at a later date of passenger choice despite this being on their website and again in breach of 261/2004 art.8c. I would give a zero rating if this were possible

### "communication is subpar"
Flew Singapore to Prague via Warsaw. Arrived in business cabin, Im handed over the usual kit, the zipper is broken, the flight attendent's reaction is to hand me a pack from premium eco. Not classy Food ok, flight ok. Lounge in Warsaw is narrow, packed and overall just unpleasant. I want to take a shower, I must go to the front desk to request a huge key from staff that looks unhappy to be here. Shower is small, as in 1m by 1m for the whole room divided by 2 for the shower side. On the way back I arrived at the airport. My request to upgrade return flight for business was denied. At the airport I'm told my ticket was canceled by Lot. Actually they also just canceled the flight without proper information. Had to spend extra 24h in Prague at my expense and hours on the phone to get an alternative flight. Do not fly LOT unless you have no other option. It's simply not worth the trouble as the whole experience feels messy, their staff is poorly trained and communication is subpar.

### "food is abysmal"
Astana to Brussels via Warsaw. LOT has been flying to Astana recently. I flew with them a few times but have decided not to do so in the future, LOT is running on a low-cost airline model. Leg-room is ok, but even on 6 hours long flights, you don't get an entertainment system. The food is abysmal (not worse than, say, Lufthansa, but still), the service is not particularly friendly, and you don't get any food and only water, coffee and tea on short flights. You don't even get a gin-and-tonic on a long flight.

### "I would fly LOT again"
Krakow to Warsaw. The flight was  smooth and on time. I enjoyed the complimentary tea and chocolate bar. I was travelling in emergency exit row which i chose for free during the online check-in. I would fly LOT again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Budapest to Chicago. Worst airline ever. Four hour delay. Really old outdated plane. They didn’t offer water in business class! The food was terrible. The crew had no manners and basically chatted in the cabin the entire flight. This airline is an embarrassment.

### "reluctant to fly LOT again"
London to Larnaca via Warsaw. 1. LHR - WAW flight delayed by two hours therefore not going to make connecting flight as only 35 transit time with Booking made. 2. When finally landed in Warsaw noted that Larnaca flight also delayed by 1.5 hours. Even though we made the flight yesterday another flight delayed. 3. All luggage lost and 24 hours later no contact from airline. The number in Cyprus at the airport for lost luggage not answering for the whole day I have been trying. Called Poland and they say they cannot help. When this happened with Aegean who lost my luggage they would answer the phone and were extremely helpful and luggage arrived in less than 24 hours. Quite a difference in Star Alliance members. I will be very very reluctant to fly LOT again.

### "Such a bad flight at the start"
Oslo to Warsaw. Such a bad flight at the start. The flight supposed to take off at 7.40pm but it got delayed for 1 hour plus. I have a connecting flight (also LOT) right after this and was so worried that I unable to make it on time. At 8.38 pm, the flight has yet to set off. This airline should really improve on their efficiency!

### "not able to select a seat"
Not Verified |  I bought a business class ticket 6 weeks ago. Business class means: lounge, fast lane and leg space. That are the essentials - the rest is unnecessary. And that's when the problems start with LOT Polish Airlines. Their website often does not work properly, so when I booked my flight on November 3, I was not able to select a seat. I immediately asked them via e-mail to solve the issue - which they did 14 days later! Now, I receive my boarding pass and that shows a seat in one of the back rows. I call the helpdesk - 20 minutes to get an answer although I entered 5 for business class. After that the agent told me "sorry, I can't help you" and "check the agent at the airport". Even when I told them I do not want to pay 1000 euro for no leg space, there was no solution offered.

### "no service at all"
Los Angeles to Minsk via Warsaw. There is no service at all. After the first meal you do not see cabin staff for next 10 hours. There is no snacks, water or anything through all flight between two meals. The entertainment is bad, the movie choice is very low. Do not recommend to use this airline.

### "they are utterly pathetic"
Gdansk to Warsaw. I will never fly with this airline again. Of four flights booked over the course of a week, three were delayed and one was cancelled, minutes before the departure. I arrived at my final destination 6 hours late and in danger of needing to sleep rough at the airport in the UK as my transfer had been missed. When seeking help at Warsaw airport I approached a LOT representative in Business class who all but verbally abused me as I wasn't travelling in that class. All I was seeking was help! My legitimate claim for compensation was ignored by LOT for three months. I escalated to the CAA Poland but that was ignored as well. Finally I engaged a claims management company and LOT were forced to settle. I urge you to travel with a professional airline and avoid LOT Polish airlines at all costs, they are utterly pathetic.

### "seat was cramped"
Not Verified |  New York to Berlin via Warsaw. Horrible. The seat was cramped, my kosher meal came frozen and when I wanted to change my return ticket they tried charging 400$ and I couldn't even get to a manager. Never again.

### "avoid at all cost"
I am Polish while my wife is from outside of the EU. As my wife, she shares my right to travel to any EU country without a visa. We were flying to London just after xmas, when we arrived at the airport and tried to check in LOT told me that my wife will be refused entry to the plane because she needs a visa! I've tried educating them about the EEA law and that my wife doesn't need a visa to travel to the UK but they didn't want to listen. I was forced to book additional flights from UK to Spain in order to satisfy them that my wife will not leave the airport in the UK. Of course after arriving in the UK I've cancelled the Spain flight and went through British immigration without any issues. Horrible experience and avoid at all cost.

### "a delightful journey"
It was a delightful journey, comfortable, convenient — huge difference comparing with low-cost airlines. Cabin crew were also excellent and pleasant. Price of food and drinks was quite affordable and the quality of them is also alright. The only thing is the aircraft - a little bit of an old Embraer, and the cabin inside was already a little used up, and bus instead of airport sleeves but no more complaints. I would fly LOT again if any chance and I recommend it to other travelers.

### "lacks any understanding"
Warsaw to Krakow. LOT lacks any understanding that they are operating in the service industry where their primary concern should be in how their staff engages with customers. I have the impression that this has remained in Soviet times. Not worthy of the star Alliance status.

### "enough space to be comfortable"
Berlin to Warsaw. Turboprop airplane. Legroom was a bit tight. No drinks on the flight but the flight attendants came with snacks. For a short flight, it was fine. WAW-LAX. The food was ok. On my flight to Warsaw (LAX-WAW) the food was excellent with rosemary potatoes and cheesecake. On the flight back to LAX, 2 meals were served. The first meal was stuffed cabbage which was actually pretty good. The second meal, which was Lasagna, was terrible. There were two carts set up in the rear, one with drinks (blackcurrant juice apple juice, orange juice, 7up pepsi, wine, etc) and snacks (candy, chocolate, peanuts, pretzels, ramen, etc.) High ceilings, quiet engines, nice aircraft (B787-8). Bathrooms were nice with a live flower, hand cream, and some pretty good smelling air freshener. Legroom was pretty good, considering I am 6'2. I had enough space to be comfortable but I was too tall to use the footrest. Entertainment was adequate, with some good movies and tv shows. IFE system was pretty fast and responsive. The crew didn't seem happy to do their jobs and their English abilities were limited. No Wifi. Overall the airline is good if you are traveling on a budget to Europe. I would only recommend it if it was much cheaper than the larger carriers in Europe (BA, Lufthansa, SAS, KLM, etc.)

### "airline become very unreliable"
Poznan to Warsaw. I was a loyal customer for many years and I still like flying them, but this airline now has become very unreliable. Flights now are often late for airline-caused reasons and there simply are no replacement aircraft. If an aircraft is late in the morning, all following flights will be late as well. Makes them useless as a "network airline".

### "No more of this carrier"
Split to Gdansk via Warsaw. As a result of a computer error, I became the owner of two tickets for the same flight for the same person, I became a lady and a mister. Despite the two months’ time to departure, for Lot Airlines this is an impossible situation to correct. So one passenger has two tickets and nothing can be done, the payment was of course taken twice. The connecting flight from Warsaw to Gdańsk, the staff is not able to ensure getting to the plane, the solution is to buy a ticket for the next flight. Staff incompetent and rude. No more of this carrier.

### "Left and arrived on time"
Great flight. Left and arrived on time and returned to LA landing an hour early. Food was good, service very friendly. I’m glad it got better, our summer trip wasn’t so good. More choices in entertainment would be nice. But for the price I’d give this flight 5 stars.

### "no problems at all"
Not Verified |  
Third time on this route with LOT this year (London to Warsaw), and no problems at all. Brand new 787 MAX aircraft. Comfortable seats, nice crews, punctual flights, nice service. I will always opt for LOT when flying to Poland.

### "Outdated airline"
Tokyo to London via Warsaw. Pre-booked seats and vegetarian meals. At check-in in London I was given boarding passes without seat number and the team claimed the flight was ‘overbooked’. Went through security and when going to the gate, received a SMS without instructions, just a link to website, to inform me that my connecting flight Warsaw/Tokyo was canceled. The overwhelmed service desk rebooked me via Shanghai/China and the team claimed that this was the only possible route. It's quite dreadful to transit in China given that you need to apply for a visa, immigrate and check in again and go through security. When I enquired about a possible cancellation of the return flights since I was not boarding the London-Warsaw flight, the LOT service desk assured me that the return reservation would not be affected return flights fully confirmed. Instead of landing at 8:40, I arrived after 3pm the afternoon in Tokyo. I lost my pre-paid seats and didn’t get a vegetarian meal, my luggage didn’t arrive (arrived three days later). On my return flight I was told – surprise – that I wasn’t booked on the flight. The staff arebooked me but of course couldn’t give me the seats I paid for and again wasn’t given a vegetarian meal. They also make it extremely difficult to claim refund and compensation. Outdated airline.

### "Truly the worst experience"
Newark to Warsaw. Truly the worst experience of long distance travel in 30 years as a frequent flyer and Miles and More Senator card holder. Indeed, this was the 3rd totally unsatisfactory experience with LOT in 2 weeks. I treated myself to Premium Economy travel for a leisure trip to run the New York marathon. I expected to fly via Boeing 787. Instead LOT provided a very old Airbus in poor condition. Staff were rude and unhelpful. On both flights there was no functioning entertainment system in the cabin for 9-10 hour flights! The return flight was delayed for several hours without apology or explanation. I live in Poland and will avoid this carrier in favour of a professional airline like Lufthansa. LOT should not be run by the State and should be sold to a company that understands customer service.

### "We are very disappointed "
Chicago to Lviv via Warsaw. We came from Chicago to Warsaw and in Warsaw airport worker said that our carry out bag is too big for a plane, they have full plane, so we need to put it in a trunk. It was weird that only our bag was too big, the plane was half empty (we noticed that after)and our bag could be easily put under the seat. Also in Chicago we didn’t have any problems with bag. After we got our bags and arrived home we saw only empty boxes with no bracelet and charm in. It was a gift, and unfortunately not very great. We don’t feel sorry about money that we spent. The fact that someone’s hand was in our bag is horrible. We are very disappointed of the work of airlines and airports.

### "Absolutely terrible airline"
Beijing to London via Warsaw. Absolutely terrible airline. First of all, the flight was delayed 12 hours and they kept making excuses and moving us around. Then when we arrived in Warsaw, they gave us a new plane ticket from Warsaw to London, and a hotel ticket too. We went to collect our luggage and go to the hotel, but they wouldn’t let us go out since we didn’t apply for a visa even though we have British citizenship. We couldn’t even collect our luggage! We returned to the info desk and they gave us a blanket and pillows and told us to sleep on the waiting room chairs, since it would be 7 hours until our next flight. Horrible airline. Do Not Use.So unhelpful.

### "entertainment system didn't work at all"
On both flights WAW-NYC and NYC-WAW, the entertainment system didn't work at all, the over head light didn't work in all seat line, so I couldn't read anything, seating in an aircraft for 10 hours without any kind of entertainment was a nightmare. Although I flew with two different aircrafts, the cabin staff announced that they woyld fix the entertainment system, this have never happened. The food was extremely bad, we couldn't get an extra drink. The cabin staff were very noisy and were lacking kindness. I couldn't believe they are a member of the star aliance group, they are miles away.

### "staff was unfriendly"
Odessa to Los Angeles via Warsaw. I will never use this airline again! Very little attitude to customers, I had a medical issue and had to change my ticket date, but staff was unfriendly and unhelpful, they suggested to pay me double price of my ticket to change it. Unbelievable, no customer service at all, I didn't think they are interested in loyalty of their customers. Moreover the planes are old and dirty!

### "doubt I will fly again with LOT"
Moscow to Los Angeles via Warsaw. The flight was cancelled and it took me about an hour to reach airline representative over the phone as they simply did not show up at the booth as there was no flight. They re routed my flight very quickly, but they cancelled the last one and due to that I was stuck in LAX for few hours trying to resolve the problem. Each time call waiting time is about 40-60 min and I had to call three times as they did not know what to do. I ended up buying new ticket and then had to call cheap o air for refund as the itinerary was purchased through them. I doubt that I will ever fly again with LOT.

### "our flight was cancelled"
Los Angeles to Vilnius via Warsaw. 36 hour before our flight I try to do a web check-in, but it was impossible. I try to reach the LOT company be phone, email and Facebook. No results. After 8 hours they answer the phone and I got the information that our flight was cancelled. Still we don't have correct information regarding our flight. They promote us another air company, but we still can't make a web check-in. Terrible service, or maybe it is more correctly to say no service.

### "Please think twice"
Toronto to Zaporizhia via Warsaw. I have booked a flight with LOT, I had to change my flight dates. I called the help line, first call 1:45 minutes wait, and my call was lost, second call, 45 minutes of wait and finally I was transferred to cashier to pay the fare difference. She hung up on me, third call, another 35 minutes of waiting, dead end. After 30 minutes I received a call, to make changes. I gave the operator full details, she booked me in wrong cabin, I ended up cancelling my entire flight and go back to Air Canada. Please think twice. If you are looking for customer service.

### "always very friendly"
Warsaw to Munich. I had a very enjoyable trip with LOT as usual. I'm flying with them 20+ times per year, short and long-haul and never had any major issues. In case of delays they always try to find alternative connections for me. Service on board and on the ground is always very friendly, responsive and customer oriented. In my opinion LOT is, besides Austrian (OS), the best carrier to central Europe. During the last year they have massively expanded their network and flights connections in the region. Their C-Class service (short and long-haul) is on par with any other European carrier I've flown with (maybe OS and LX being slightly better). Their Boeing and Embraer seats are very comfortable and spacious. Hence I cannot understand complaints from other users in this forum. Maybe they do not fly not very often with LOT (or in general) and had a single bad experience. I always appreciate the personal and attentive service of their crews. Besides that, flight connections in Warsaw's Chopin airport are very convenient and smooth.

### "the worst airline in Europe"
Warsaw to Chicago. I have flown LOT Polish Airlines many times, and they are literally the worst airline in Europe. Their customer service is the worst, and employees go out of their way to be not helpful. I avoid them whenever possible. Flights are always late, employees are rude, they actually go out of the way to make your trip worse. I am currently sitting on a 9-hour delay that is their fault, and not only did they treat me like it was my fault, they downgraded my seat on the rebooking without any compensation.

### "I was satisfied enough"
Toronto to Oslo via Warsaw in business class. After my wife and I settled into our spacious seats, I began to relax. The pitch of the BC seats is the longest I have seen, and the seat is flat for sleeping. I had no trouble sleeping a few hours on the night flight to Europe. Mind you since Poland is probably not a first world country of the highest standard of living, the food served even in BC was just OK. It wasn't excellent by any means, but it wasn't awful either. They try as hard as they can in their service, even if it is not always with a smile. The amenity kit was very basic, the movie choice was limited. I found the lavatory spacious and clean. The flight from Warsaw to Oslo was also delayed by 30 minutes. On the way home, Oslo to Warsaw arrived ten minutes early, and then Warsaw to Toronto left on time and again we touched down ten minutes early. In summary, I can guarantee you will find a more solid Star Alliance airline such as EVA, ANA, Air Canada, Lufthansa, but LOT will not be one of your worst flying experiences either. If you are lucky to use their BC cabin, you will find a seat with enormous pitch and leg room, and for me sleep and rest quality trump the food or alcohol or service or movies, so I was satisfied enough.

### "service is very disappointing"
Disappointing service on a flight from Warsaw to Chicago. No option for vegetarians. I'm a member of the Miles & More program where I stated my preferences and still was told I had to pre-select a vegetarian option for each flight. Ok, forget dinner then. Come snack time I ask whether the sandwich is vegetarian and all I got was a shrug and a "I didn't check" response from the stewardess. Long flight, no meal then. These days a vegetarian option is a must on all respectable airlines so this service is very disappointing.

### "longest flight ever"
New York JFK to Bucharest via Warsaw on August 31st. Flight was scheduled for 10:05 pm, reached the check in gate in time around 8:00 pm, two hours before departure. At the gate we were informed that the flight has three hours delay, our connection at Warsaw will be lost, and the next connection will be after seven waiting hours in the airport. That was  unexpected and very inconvenient. We had to call and wake up our relatives (3:00 am in the morning at their end), not to wait for us at scheduled time, and make new arrangements for who to come and pick us up. So, after a total of ten waiting hours we reach the destination on September 2nd not on September 1st as it was scheduled. The longest flight ever. Return flight September 20th was not perfect either, we depart 45 minutes delay, which was recovered during the flight, but on the waiting ground there was no air conditioning, not allowed to adjust the window to make it dark and nobody mentioned why and for how long we are waiting.

### "a very rude attitude"
Warsaw to Copenhagen. The flight was delayed for 2 hours, when we talked with the guy at the gate, at the first announced time he told us, that we could go eat and come back at boarding time 19:30. My girlfriend and I sat down for a tea. I’m looking at the screen with departure times a couple of times, at 19:25 we are going to the gate which is announced on the screen. When we get to this gate, we are told that the gate was moved and closed, which we do not understand as the screens said something different and the guy at the gate as well told us “boarding starts at 19:30 at this gate” We ran to the other gate, where we were told that this gate was to Hamburg - at this point I got frustrated. We were told to go to the LOT counter. The guy we talked with here was very rude and didn’t seem like he wanted to help, after some minutes of discussion where he tried to tell us that we were dumb “don’t you know you have to go there 30 min before time” “don’t fall asleep” - I even told him that we were drinking tea and looking at the screens. All of a sudden other lady came to the counter, she had the same story and was also frustrated. It was at this point the LOT employees realised that something was wrong. The guy we talked with went into the back room to talk with whom I assume to be of a higher rank. He came out and unwillingly changed our flights but again with a very rude attitude. I am very shocked that this is how LOT treat their customers. To make it all even better our new flight is also delayed.

### "service was good"
❎ Not Verified | Gdańsk to Lviv via Warsaw. I find the branding of the company very well - nice uniforms, adverts, visual impressions. As for ultra short haul flghts the service was good. The staff was nice. A huge advantge is that this airline allows multi-city connections for good price. Outstanding very comfy seats both in Embraer and Dash Q400. Unfortunately LOT has problem with punctuality - my flight WAW-GDN was delayed 45 min, and I noticed that lots of flights too.

### "positively surprised"
Warsaw to New York. I was positively surprised by LOT. Flights on time, modern, well maintained aircraft, delicious catering by DO&CO, and professional and warm service by the crew.

### "I will not recommend LOT"
Odessa to New York via Warsaw. On the flight to Warsaw I saw that the steward when I was sleeping put the snack on the table and did not wake me up. When I woke up the box was not sealed and it was not a full box. Food was missing from the box. From Warsaw to New York it was a "mess" in the Warsaw airport. The security checked us once. Then on second floor in airport in safe place they checked us again. After boarding when we started to go to the airplane they again checked us. Why were we checked again? In the airplane from Warsaw to New York I understand if you are not Polish they did not pay attention to you. They dont ask what food or drink you want. The steward was unpleasant to non Polish passengers. They took my blanket and pillow away form me. They did not give me back my pillow and blanket back. And why was there not normal security procedure which created much havoc and discomfort. I will not recommend LOT Polish to anyone.

### "courteous and professional"
Frequent strikes or strike threats at Air France made me switch to using LOT for my flights to Europe, this being my third trip this year (YYZ-WAW-VIE return CDG-WAW-YYZ). I found LOT's Premium Economy seats more comfortable than those on the AF planes, although passengers in the window seats may be blocked if the seats in front are moved backwards. The food was good, albeit rather heavy with lots of cold cuts. Nevertheless it was more plentiful than on AF and served on real china with real cutlery rather than plastic. In B787-9 there is access to toilets shared with business class, while in the older B787-8 one has to use the toilets at the far end of economy. I once succeeded in my upgrade bid to business and found it comfortable but basic with the 2-2-2 layout and lack of separation from the neighbour. I thought the food in Premium was actually better than in Business. Most of my flights departed slightly delayed but arrived on time or only a bit late. The crew on all flights was courteous and professional. The only negatives were (1) uncomfortable headphones, and (2) the fact that passengers pick up bread by hand from the basket.

### "outstanding both ways"
London to Singapore via Warsaw. Read so many bad things about LOT after booking at a bargain price, but the flight was outstanding both ways, service exceptional, food great. A bit mystified why a full meal at breakfast on the return was not dinner time in any time zone we passing through would rather muesli than prawn curry at 5am but was a great meal, loved the post-dinner shots best have slept on a flight maybe a link there. At Singapore behind the check-ins near where you enter departures there is a VIP check-in area which includes LOT, use the Singapore Lounge it far better than the one they recommend, I took the day layover in Warsaw and had a pleasant day around town only 20 mins on the metro.

### "worst airline we ever flew"
Not Verified |  The worst airline we ever flew. We were supposed to fly on September 17 from Berlin to Los Angeles via Warsaw. Our flight from Warsaw to LAX was canceled. Nobody notified us. They lied that they sent us e-mail back in May. We paid extra for 2 seats in Exit row for extra leg room, they took that away from us, lied that they will put us in business class We lost a day in Warsaw, went trough 3 managers and 3 controls just to be lied again. We will never fly LOT again.

### "a very poor experience"
Avoid! On a 12-hour journey from Singapore to Warsaw there were no headphones/earphone provided, so if you didn't bring your own you're stuck. Food was the worst I've ever had on a long haul flight and I travelled a lot with different airlines, simply awful. The pillows were tiny (bring your own!). No 'nice touches' like other airlines offer during long flights (free snacks in between meals, passing through the cabin offering water etc). The crew seemed grumpy on both legs of my journey. Overall a very poor experience and I'd rather travel with a stop over in the future than choose LOT.

### "never fly LOT again"
Krakow to Warsaw. Horrible experience with LOT, flight from Krakow delayed by nearly 2 hours. No apologies or explanation from staff, when approached the desk the woman said she was busy and I need to talk to the staff at Warsaw about my connecting flight to London. Once onboard once again no apologies or reason given as to why the flight was delayed. When I arrived to Warsaw I had to wait nearly half an hour for my bag. At that time I was too late to check in for my onwards flight to LHR. I went to the desk only to be told that it isn't their problem that I missed my flight as I'm not flying LOT to LHR. When I asked about my options the woman laughed and said I can sleep at the terminal on the bench and once again told me that it's not their problem and they won't do anything, not even apology. I had to book hotel and another flight for the following day costing me nearly £200 plus I lost day at work. Will never fly LOT again and definitely will not recommend to anyone.

### "cabin crew did not show up"
Warsaw to Amsterdam. I almost had weekly fly with this airline in the past half year, this city connection always got 30 min to 1 hour delay. Last month there was one early flight canceled (7:05am, from Amsterdam to Warsaw), and the reason was that the cabin crew did not show up, first time in my life! I think LOT is explanding too fast but the service does not catch up, obviously it is not ready for the guest. Between Amsterdam and Warsaw, there are two airlines available, you will immediately see the big difference about their service! In the past when I flew with LOT, every year I got the chance that there was one flight canceled and LOT did not care anything if it is within Poland! do not mention about delay, as it is every time! !

### "overall horrendous experience"
Newark to Budapest via Warsaw. Horrible service including ground staff, inflight crew, customer service and overall horrendous experience! Booked our trips on LOT airlines for 6 months ahead. Paid for seat selection and confirmed veg meals ahead. Onward journey the flight to Warsaw was delayed. After the flight was cleared for take-off, the pilot announced they are still waiting for passengers who got lost in the airport. For more than an hour there was no air-conditioning in the flight. I asked if they would turn on the air conditioning. The attendant mentioned she does not know about it. After the sweltering heat, they offered some water. The flight took off with further the passenger boarded the flight. At Warsaw they offered a 10$ coupon for food. The next flight to Prague was 3:10. They did not offer any other airlines. That flight was further delayed because a passenger could not make it on time. We lost more than 4 hours. Return flight was even worse. We were at the airport approximately 3 hours before. We checked in and got our boarding pass based on the paid seat assignments. We walked to the gate and were waiting in line. Few minutes later they called for boarding. When my boarding pass was scanned the LOT staff at the gate took the boarding pass away and printed a new boarding pass. She handed it to me saying please note the seat change. I mentioned to her the flight seating was reserved by me several months back and I had paid for the seats. She said sorry the flights are overbooked and asked me to talk to the flight attended to make adjustments and not block the line and mentioned she cannot do anything about it. The inflight attendant said she cannot do anything and the ground staff are responsible for it. I asked if I can upgrade to a business class with a fee. She said sorry, we do not have anything available and said to take the seats based on the new boarding pass. My family was asked to sit in different places. One of the entertainment system did not work. There was used gum on the flight magazine and flight safety instructions. After sometime another ordeal started. The flight attendant will not give vegetarian food for one of us because the new seat assignment does not have vegetarian food selection. We explained that we made the meal selection several months before and that we were asked to change seats by LOT airlines. The attendant refused to give food and said she can do only based on new boarding pass. She said the other person wanted it. (I should be sitting in that seat as per my reservation) I had to starve and skip my lunch. After 8 hours they started serving breakfast. This time I had my information from my phone ready to show the food selection. After argument, she came and slammed the food over my son’s food and left. Didn’t feel like eating that food. Finally, the plane landed and stopped. Everyone opened the overhead bin and had their luggage and standing. The flight started moving to the gate again. No announcement to ask the passengers to sit down. Called LOT airlines to complain about the ordeal. They asked to open an issue for faster response. More than 2 weeks no response. Called multiple times still no response. Seat selection money in drain.

### "Another terrible experience"
Another terrible experience on this terrible airline. Of my last four flights, for three of them they sat me and my wife apart, and all four were delayed. 25% chance to sit with your party, 0% chance the flight is on time. Don't worry, the staff are also terrible. Glad I've moved out of Krakow and I don't need to deal with this garbage any more. The new planes have punishing tight seating, thin backrests, and a comical amount of legroom. Paid everything. No entertainment. The only thing that differs from a discount airline is the price. Fail.

### "suitcase is not there"
Kiev to Paris via Warsaw. Monday departure to Kiev 45 minutes to record; late flight then gallopade for correspondence in Warsaw. Staff unfriendly. Arrival at Roissy my suitcase is not there. 20 minutes chaotic tale with the company provider Alizya who handles luggage. We will warn you an hour before delivery but be careful it is a hidden number so do not miss it. Tuesday: an unintelligible SMS informs me that my luggage would be found. Wednesday: nothing. Thursday morning: I call them: 25 minutes of waiting for 'to hear by someone named Abdel the same thing as the day before. As I protest loudly, they said "I put you waiting until you calm down". Not a word from the airline. I wanted to save money with this flight I lost money.

### "never again booking with LOT"
Larnaca to Amsterdam via Warsaw. Worst airpine by far. First delayed 1 hour. When I arrived in Warsaw they kept us in the airplane for at least 15 minutes. The connecting flight from Warsaw to Larnaca had a delay for 50 minutes at first and waited at the gate for another 2 hours and then flight was delayed due to technical reasons. The flight was then cancelled. Never again booking with LOT.

### "crew unfriendly and stand-offish"
Singapore to Brussels via Warsaw. Check-in and boarding were efficient. The problems began in the cabin, the cabin crew was unfriendly and stand-offish. We had to wait more than an hour before taxiing to the runway with very poor information. We received a quick glass of water in the first five minutes before being locked in our seat for an hour without seing the cabin crew. We received the dinner so late than many people refused it, preferring to sleep (we took off at 1am). After dinner, 8 hours have passed before the crew propose an other drink. They had to manage a medical issue with a passager (nothing dramatic), they asked for a doctor with anxious an harsh voice before walking between the rows with panicked and angry face. This unprofessionalism gave a strange atmosphere for a while. They looked so bored when we asked them for anything and very upset each time something didn't go perfectly. For the rest, the food was very tasty, the plane was all new and very clean. The seats were not so comfortable but enough for a cheap flight.

### "disable self check-in"
Kiev to Dusseldorf via Warsaw. It's outrageous that a Star Alliance member would disable self check-in so everyone has to weigh all of their baggage. For the national airline of a European Union country, my experience has been worse than with any budget carrier. I've flown over 200 times on a variety of airlines, and if you want to delay the check-in process to weigh every person's piece of luggage to ensure it is under 8KG, why not just up-front allow passengers to pay a little extra money to carry-on more weight? Ryanair does this, and I never thought I would say they're an innovator in passenger-friendly airline policies. 8KG maximum is ridiculous and has nothing to do with airline security or the capacities of the plane itself. It's frustrating to arrive at an airport and effectively pay a tax to then have to check your bag. I'd rather just pay 25 Euros at the airport and be able to carry my bag with me than have to scramble to re-pack a carry-on inevitably leaving some things in my newly checked bag. It's frustrating that airlines nickel and dime their passengers. I booked through a rewards website Chase, and LOT website doesn't allow to add checked bags on a ticket booked elsewhere. There must be other ways to generate revenue than meticulously weighing bags, sending passengers to another desk, and swiping their credit cards.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
Krakow to Prague via Warsaw. Cannot recommend this airline! After being delayed leaving Krakow for Warsaw, we were not sure that we would make our connection. We got to Warsaw, sprinted through the terminal to catch our connection to Prague and then had to wait 20 minutes for the bus to come take us to the plane. We thought we were in the clear! Arriving into Prague, we realized that our bags did not make it. Went to the baggage office where there was a line of people from our flight. Filed a claim and was told to call the number the next day. We called, waited, called, had the hotel concierge call, and nobody from the Prague airport answered the phone, impossible to get through to LOT. Their social media team is useless. Used an international call to try to get answers only to be told that I needed to call a different number (they ended up giving me a fax number instead of a phone number). Long story short, I called my credit card company and their emergency travel assist has taken over calling the airline and waiting on hold on my behalf. Filed the report of missing baggage and for reimbursement and was told it will take 4 weeks to process. It has now been 7 full days I haven't gotten any information on the status of my bags or even an email from the airline. How is it even possible for an airline to be THIS bad in 2018? I will never fly LOT again and have to question how they are still members of Star Alliance.

### "absolutely terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Gdansk to Moscow via Warsaw. This is an absolutely terrible airline. First, they are never on time. Second, customer support is non-existent - impossible to reach out unless you are ok to sit on the phone for 2 hours on international tarif. Third, I’m sitting in Moscow without my luggage for 3 days already and all the can tell me is it is in a Warsaw in some distribution center and they don’t know when it will be sent.

### "support is poor or nonexistent"
Oslo to Toronto via Warsaw. LOT client support is poor or nonexistent. Due to delayed departure from Oslo we had a 10 min run to catch Toronto flight in Warsaw. As expected the luggage didn't arrived in Toronto and we made the standard claim - After one week, there is no update on the claim on the system - Emailed LOT for info, automated response was wait 4 weeks for an answer!? - Called LOT Canada, the agent doesn't have access to tracking system, no idea of the process for delayed / lost luggage. An airline has the obligation to transport passengers and their belongings safely. I understand delays, but lack of consideration is not tolerable.

### "worst customer service ever"
Zurich to Tbilisi via Warsaw. When we arrived in Tbilisi our baggage was lost. When we were queuing at the lost and found desk we recognized that we were not the only ones. Around 60!! other persons of this flight were missing their luggage! Nobody of the airline was caring at all about this and we got no answer on phone, via email and facebook. That’s the worst customer service ever and I think it’s a shame that they are member of star alliance. Can’t recommend LOT at all. Still waiting for luggage and news.

### "experience is the worst"
Geneva to Lviv via Warsaw. The experience I had with LOT services is the worst I had because their people do not know how to provide a services! I had a case with lost luggage and there was no one there to help me, they just to not care. I arrived in my city at night and find out that they lost my bag, no one was in their office, only supervisor who is a polish speaker (I arrived in Ukraine and not supposed to speak Polish there). He told me go home and register my claim in internet - he finally registered my claim. I called in LOT next day and no one is even picking up the phone. If you do not know how to provide a services in good but more important bad situation - go bankrupt, really. Would never fly with LOT.

### "Very unprofessional!"
Krakow to Ljubljana via Warsaw. Flight was good and staff were good but they lost my bags for over 4 days and did not contact me in anyway shape or form to let me know the progress of my bags being found unless I reached out and asked a question. Then when they found it they rang my hostel to tell them that it was at a hotel 500m down the road and I had to hurry and pick it up myself. Also they've offered me only 100$ US as compensation even though I spent more. 100$ US to get clothes for more than 4 days. Very unprofessional!

### "avoid this airline"
Luxembourg to Gdansk via Warsaw. I am frequent traveller on Lot, the service was nice 10 year go. Unfortunatly from beginning of 2018, delays became the norm. I am not talking here 15min rather over 45min. Last week I flew back from London, with one hour delay and at landing not a word from the flight deck. I am now stuck in Luxembourg, I just saw on flightradar that the inbound flight will be delayed by 1h30 - so no chance to catch my connection. In one word, avoid this airline if you want to make it on time, there are plenty of cheaper and better airlines flying to Poland.

### "a way to go for LOT"
Singapore to Warsaw. Flew LOT polish airlines a couple of times on long haul flights from Munich to Asia or to north America with a transit in Warsaw. It is still a way to go for LOT. First, there is no LOT own lounges for intercontinental flights in Warsaw Airport. Generally the service makes you guess that LOT has a public background and not a customer-focused one. The service in the cabin is not professional enough. There are two types of cabin crew, the old stewardess who does not really give a damn about the customers and prefers to play with her smart phone and the young stewardess who really wants to focus on customers but do not have good role models and end up just too hectic. It is arbitrary if you got offered a drink, or a meal, or if you got all components of your meal at the same time. Too bad. the quality of meals in the cabin is however excellent.

### "never fly with this airline"
Chicago to Warsaw. Terrible, huge mistake! My mother flew in May, my husband flew June, I am flying July, all flights had delays with 1 hour or over. All of missed connecting flights, my mother spent 7 hours with a baby in hands at the airport, my and my husband both rerouted in order to manage to get to Bulgaria. Our family will never fly with this airline.

### "One of the worst flights"
Paris CDG to Warsaw. One of the worst flights ever. Check in opened barely one hour before departure. Departure was delayed and in a tiny boarding room with barely any shops. We took off almost one hour late. During the flight the attendants had barely gone halfway through the plane and there was no food left to serve (too bad for a flight scheduled for lunch time). Baggage claim was terrible and took us almost 1h to have our bags delivered. Avoid this company and airport if you can.

### "Another hassle-free trip"
Another hassle-free trip with LOT. Although the check-in area at Warsaw airport was quite busy, we didn't loose time queuing, as it's now possible (at least when travelling with LOT) to print the luggage tag by yourself. The flight was pretty empty which made it quiet and cosy. Contrary to many LOT flights, this one wasn't delayed at all, so no I have no reason for complaining about that. The biggest advantage of that flight was the brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8, still fresh and clean. It made our trip even more convenient, because it's incredibly quiet and has comfortable, soft, leather seats installed. The seats have moreover: an adjustable headrest, decent recline and a power port. The only drawback was that LOT didn't use the jet bridge at Vienna airport.

### "flight is overbooked"
Prague to Bucharest return via Warsaw. The first three legs were eventless. OK. Some delays, but specially on WAW-OTP the captain kept us updated so we knew what is going on. The weather was also not perfect, so no problem. Can happen. OTP is not the best airport I ever been to. More like an overcrowded train station. Security check in transfer zone in WAW is really to small for this amount of passengers. I decided to exit and go through main security, I think was a smart decision. And exactely when one is thinking this LOT is fine, why do the people complain the problems started. We are already in the bus, waiting to be taken to the airplane. We were waiting perhaps 10min already as somebody from the gate came downstairs and told us to go back. As on the gate we were only informed per loud speaker that the flight will be delayed. No information until when. Staff at the gate was very arrogant. I heard the answer: there will be no annoucement for the new time. Follow the monitors. If you miss it is your fault. Anyway, ca. 40min later the flight was cancelled. Staff on transfer desk was kind, but not very helpful. Although there was one more flight to PRG they put me on the next day flight at 8am. So instead of sleeping in Prague, leaving the hotel at 10am to get to my train I had to get up at 6am, drive back to airport and hope to arrive on time to PRG to get my train connections. However, there is one more moment worth of mentioning. On 15th one flight was cancelled. When we were waiting on boarding for today's flight at 8am suddenly came the announcement that this very same flight is overbooked that they are looking for volunteers to reschedule their flights. So, you cancel one flight, you overbook another.

### "it was a huge mistake"
Tallinn to Krakow via Warsaw. I was not taking LOT for a years - took them yesterday again and it was a huge mistake. LOT - Late Or Tomorrow - this is always true in case of LOT - always late, worst service within standard airlines i know.

### "a total free for all"
Venice to Krakow via Warsaw. LOT personnel did not open check-in until 1 hour and 45 minutes before flight, 15 minutes later than they said that they would. When we checked in, we were informed that we owed 40 Euros for our baggage (my wife and I had one bag each). We tried to pay at the check-in, and were told that they could not accept cash, and that their credit-card reader wasn't functioning, so we would have to go to a baggage office that was across the terminal to pay for baggage. When my wife got there, she was told that it would cost 48 Euros because she was paying by credit card. We were extremely aggravated, but payed for the luggage so that we could continue our vacation. The flight was 2+1/2 hours late leaving for Warsaw. We were worried about our connection to Krakow, but were told a total lie by the flight attendants as they said "Don't worry. Everything is delayed in Warsaw". This was very untrue as our flight to Krakow was boarding as we arrived in the terminal in Warsaw, causing us to run to make the connection. Also, when we boarded in Warsaw, it was a total "free for all" as they did no pre-board, and everyone from old men in wheel chairs to mothers with babies in a stroller was all treated equally by the airline, and had to jockey for position to board the flight. I am handicapped and use a cane due to having broken my ankle very badly a few months ago. This added to the stress a great deal. We did manage to arrive in Krakow, but our luggage did not. It was unbelievable that we went through all of that agony to have the privilege of paying 48 Euros for luggage that they lost. Never again.

### "trip became a nightmare"
Venice to Warsaw. My trip became a nightmare thanks to LOT Polish Airlines when they lost my bag in Warsaw, found it in 3 days, and despite all promises to send it to the ports, it never came and just stayed in Venice airport. On our return flights back we were placed on standby, and the only explanation we were given was the flight was overbooked without really caring. This “airline” is a government owned company and the only airline in Poland, so you can imagine they could care less about your bag as they rely only on domestic passengers which have no other option but to fly with them. Beware when there is no competition, and is a business that changes management with every new government. I will not be flying again on this airline, not for business nor leisure. I’m Diamond Medallion in SkyMiles and travel a lot for business, let’s spend those dollars in companies that deserve to be in business.

### "constantly late"
Chicago to Sofia via Warsaw. This is officially the last time with LOT Polish. They are constantly late, they do not care that we have to spend 8 hours in an airport waiting for connecting flights. They don’t even try to make it on time. I looked at the schedule for month of July none of the flights leaving ORD have made it on time, and the only option is with 45 min connection to Bulgaria. My mother flew a month ago - the same thing, late again. I will never fly with them again.

### "this is the worst airline"
Chicago to Sofia via Warsaw. In my 15 years of flying between the US and Europe this is the worst airline I've had to deal with. To begin, they had 6 desks checking two transatlantic flights and as a result the line to check in was out of this world - it took over an hour and a half to get to the check in desk. At this point I was almost certain I will miss my connection so I mentioned it to the lady at the desk who, after checking with her manager, reassured me I was going to be ok. Fast forward 10 min when I got to the gate to see that our departure time has been pushed back by 40 min so there is no way I will make my connection at which point the personnel "kindly" informs me they are not going to hold the flight to Sofia for me and I am likely just going to have to wait at the airport for the next flight - 8 hours later. We didn't start boarding until an hour and 15 min after our original departure time during which time no one cared to inform us in English why we are being delayed. After spending an hour on the phone waiting for customer service the lady on the phone told me she couldn't do anything for me other than apologize and hung up on me. I have no words - Polish Airlines have managed to ruin two of my vacations in a row. Instead of spending the time with my family I'll get to hang out at Warsaw airport once we finally actually get there. Never again am I am going to fly this airline and you shouldn't either - the hassle is not worth it.

### "Very disappointing service"
Very disappointing service for flight segment Warsaw-Istanbul: We had preselected our seats as far to the front of the plane as possible and were holding boarding passes (issued in Toronto) accordingly. At boarding in Warsaw the system showed ‘seating issue’ and for no reason other than ‘different configuration of plane’ we were allocated seats in the rear end of the plane. Our request to allocate us our original seats were met with a shrug and a ‘no, too late’. The fact that the flight was delayed by 40 minutes did not come as a surprise given LOT’s track record so is not worth paying much attention to in this review.

### "never had a bad experience"
Seoul to Warsaw, Ggreat service. Very courteous cabin crew, flights on time, comfortable seats and decent catering. Unbeatable value-for-money C-Class fares between Seoul and Warsaw. Service-wise LOT has become a serious competitor for the traditional flag carriers in Europe. I am flying with them nearly every second week and besides minor delays I never had a bad experience with LOT.

### "delayed by some sort of mess up"
Budapest to Vilnius via Warsaw. This month I'm doing my 5th flight with LOT. 5 out of 6 of these flights were delayed by some sort of mess up. First time the plane had tech issues, and we waited for another plane to arrive. Next time they didn't have enough planes. This time the plane is overbooked and I'm on “stand by” which is worse than a delay. All I have to say is that it is the worst airline I had a chance to use. And when you try to talk to the staff to get to the bottom of this, they act so rude. They just basically tell you to write a complaint online which takes minimum of 30 days to get a reply.

### "a punishing lack of legroom"
LOT going downhill. The new planes have paper thin, uncomfortable seats and a punishing lack of legroom. Service on board is poor, food is poor. Ground service is worse. On a round-trip to LHR from KRK I was seated apart from my wife both times, despite open seats. WAW gate staff refused to move us, said to find seats once on board. I went to service desk and they were shocked, and called the gate to make them switch us. Delayed both ways. Might as well fly Ryanair or easyJet, it's the same garbage now.

### "regret choosing this airline"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Yerevan via Warsaw. Regret choosing this airline. Flight from Warsaw to Yerevan was delayed for 1 hour 45 minutes 2 hours before boarding. Then my flight was cancelled without explanation from Warsaw to Toronto. No compensation was provided. Called to LOT in Warsaw and was waiting for 60 minutes and nobody picked up the phone. After that decided to write an email 4 days passed still no response from them. Price for the ticket was not cheap. I flew before via Ukrainian Airlines and can say that they are way better than LOT. Will try not to fly via LOT in future and won't recommend this airline.

### "Worst airline I've flown"
Singapore to Venice via Warsaw. Worst airline I've ever flown with! 1 hour delays for both flights I took from and to Singapore. Also very poor service during the flight, they served drinks only once during a 12 h flight. Food was terrible, barely edible. The inflight entertainment was very poor with only few languages for the films. Finally the cabin crew wasn't kind and professional, poor English speaking and availability. Never will I fly with this company

### "Overall very good flight"
New York JFK to Warsaw and flight on time. Two meals served; one after take off (hot), another one before landing. Drinks served a few times, also available in the rear part of the plane. Surprisingly wide choice of good movies, including the current year hits. I had seat 28D which next to the aisle in the middle part of the plane. However, as there were some empty seats, I had all 3 available for myself, which was very good for the night flight. Overall very good flight.

### "The aircraft are okay"
Paris to Warsaw. I like flying LOT mostly for its staff. The aircraft are okay and similar to Air France flying on the same route. Economy class is not served any meal, just a chocolate bar. I miss the last minute business class upgrade option that I often use in AF.

### "Choose a better airline
London to Singapore via Warsaw with LOT. I liked this airline before and thought it was worth trying. Big regret. The connection is almost impossible to make it, flight from London-Warsaw is delayed almost every day and LOT wont wait for you. Bigger airlines usually wait few minutes if they know there are passengers with a connection just landing. LOT cabin crew kept saying they’d wait but the reality is that the flight to Singapore never waited. As they don’t have a daily flight, the alternative to take us to Singapore involves wasting 24 hrs of travelling back and forth. And
 absolute waste that could be avoided. The worst part was the crew promising that they have communicated the other plan and that they were waiting for us. They literally said ‘dont worry sir, we’re a people driven airline and the connecting flight will wait’. Huge lie. Its not worth the risk. Choose a better and more responsible airline.

### "Overall, excellent service"
Newark to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. It was our first time flying on LOT Polish Airlines. Flight attendants were polite and professional. Newark to Warsaw was on the Boeing 787-8 with a great entertainment system and comfortable seats (and I am a tall guy over 6 ft in height. Food was delicious and the flight attendants provided non-stop drinks before, within and after food service. Second flight (Warsaw to Tel Aviv) was on the relatively old Boeing 737-800, however, seats were ok for this 4 hour flight. The flight attendants provided an excellent service (even with no food on this 4 hours flight). Our luggage arrived very quickly at Ben Gurion Airport and we were out of the airport in less than 1 hour after landing. On the way back from Tel Aviv, we flew in the same itinerary. The plane from Tel Aviv was a brand new Boeing 737-800 Max, however, without an entertainment system. On the flight from Warsaw to Newark, we received outstanding service and delicious food, and arrived 1 hour early to Newark and our luggage was already on the carousel after we passed immigration (which took about 20 mins). Overall, excellent service.

### "Drink service was frequent"
I flew from Stuttgart to Chicago viw Warsaw in Premium Economy. Check-in in Stuttgart was acceptable, although it was very crowded. Security check was fast. Priority boarding didn't really exist. Onboard, we were seated in row 7, which usually is economy, because they offered it for Premium Economy passengers. That's bad because they wouldn't have realized us having booked Premium Eco, but we just had to remind them. Drink service was frequent, the breakfast was excellent. Flight arrived on time then. I can really recommend changing in Warsaw as the ways are really short and you can find the gates easily. On the 2nd flight, they also didn't really care about priority boarding. The Premium Economy seat is in my opinion one of the best in the world, I just have to complain that some parts were broken and that it was impossible to leave your seat if the man in front of you fully reclined his seat. Both 2 meals were excellent and the drink services were frequent. The young cabin crew was really nice and caring. But at last, I really have to mention that the IFE was really poor. Screen unresponsive and hot at all times, the selection of movies was wide but none of the movies was attracting my attention. Really no airline to choose if you want to be entertained during a long haul flight.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Tokyo to London via Warsaw. Just like flying with a budget airline. So disappointed. Tasteless food, toilet seats couldn’t be opened. Very delayed flights on the way back. There is a very little selection of movies to watch on their entertainment. Flight attendants can’t be bothered to say hi and good bye. Will never fly with this airline again.

### "No help for passengers"
Warsaw to Hamburg was scheduled for 5 pm to be operated by Nordica / Regional Jet frm Estonia. Check in 1 hour before and they told me that flight is on time. At boarding time (04:30 pm) the flight was cancelled. They asked all passengers to claim bags on belt 3 and got outside to LOT ticket counter for rebooking. The handling agent at the gate sent one guy to show the way who was so fast that a lot of passengers could not follow. Fact is that in this week about 50% of the flight between WAW and HAM operated by Regional Jet have been cancelled. What is going on? I arrived in HAM 15 hours later the next day with the help of Lufthansa who brought me home via Munich. Furthermore LOT should send  management to other airports to see how such issues can be handled in a professional manner. Why is there no counter in the terminal to rebook? They should look in FRA, AMS, ZRH, LHR were the home carriers have transit counters with agents who can help. For passengers with hand luggage only they do not need to collect bags and at 05:00 pm there were may flights to Germany which some passengers might have been able to catch if no 2nd security check was in the way! Is there no way to handle the checked bags. At a CJ900 there are not too many. No comment about EU compensation rights. Contact the customers service". No help for passengers who asked for a rental car to drive home. (Its 7.5 hours drive and can be done by 2-4 drivers who change in driving from time to time). I think they have to understand at LOT that some people after a working week in another country only want to get home. LOT needs to understand what Customer orientation means. And I wonder what this Estonian airline is good for and if their planes are ok or just scrap!

### "shocking customer service"
Singapore to Stockholm via Warsaw. Got a text at 9:30pm Saturday evening that my flight was cancelled and rescheduled for 3 days later. Cancellation was less than 27 hours before departure and being the weekend left me with very few options. Spent until 1:30am trying to get a resolution other than a 3 day delay or a refund in 2 weeks. Customer service were utterly useless, sometimes rude and sometimes telling blatant lies. Refused to pass to supervisor or managers, refused to pass to complaints. Allowed no escalation. Finally got an offer to fly with another airline and be downgraded and being left to send a complaint to try and get a refund on the downgrade and compensation. Frankly a terrible experience and a company that has no interest in its customers. Since checking online this seems a very common complaint for delays, cancelations and shocking customer service. Buyer beware.

### "service onboard nothing special"
Munich to Wroclaw via Warsaw. LOT is a member of Star Alliance, which comes with some benefits. However, mileage accrual seems to be very restrictive. The service onboard was nothing special, a chocolate candie bar and a non-alcoholic drink were included. Everything else is charged. The crew was okay. LOT are okay. There are better airlines. And there a worse airline.

### "smooth and without problems"
Belgrade to Warsaw. My flight went smooth and without problems. The aircraft was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable with sufficient recline. The ERJ-175 is a small jet and with a light interior and beige leather seats it seemed cosy. We were served a glass of water and a chocolate bar. The crew on my journey were helpful and accommodating.

### "just kept changing the departure time"
We flew with them to Bangkok and back. During the 13 hour flight they gave us 1 tastless sandwich to eat, no choice of foods at all. The evening before our flight we received a text message at 10pm saying that our flight was at 1pm instead of 8am. Ok, we thought, we should still be ok for our connecting flight to London as there were 6 hours between the two. The next day at the airport they just kept changing the departure time until we took off about 6 hours late. No information or a word of appology just a sandwich. Of course we missed our flight. It was the 24th December and we spent the night at an airport hotel. The next day we bought very expensive new tickets to London, but we thought it would be ok, as the airline was going to pay for it. We submitted our claim with all the paperwork right there at their airport office. A month later they responded saying that they won't give us any money because the delay was caused by unforseen circumstances. It's ridiculous because they can just say this for every single claim then! We'll never fly with them again and tell everyone about this experience.

### "Crew were young and cheerful"
Arrived to London LHR Terminal 2 two hours before take off time, check in was a breeze, within 2 mins I was on my way to Lufthansa Lounge LOT is using. Great lounge, plenty seats options, good food, choice of drinks etc. Flight was on time, boarding started 25 mins before take off time. Brand new Boeing 737 Max 8, with Sky Interior ceiling, gorgeous and spacious. Dark blue leather seats, with a lot of legroom, power outlets in each seat. Doors were closed on time, but taxiing took 20 mins so we departed delayed - arrived 10 mins late to Warsaw. 737 Max 8 is fantastic airplane, so quiet and comfortable. Crew were young and cheerful, very good English. In Economy they serve hot drinks, water and chocolate wafers for free, other foods and beverages are for purchase but very cheap. What was a bit strange, there was no cabin divider between Economy and Business Class, just a headrests with different colors, so we could all see Business Class service. Flight was smooth and very comfortable. My suitcase arrived after 12 mins of waiting. Totally recommend LOT! Far better than other airlines operating this route.

### "I will use them next time"
Tel Aviv to Wroclaw. Fantastic flight. The airplane interior was new and fresh. Seats were very comfortable and it was enough space. Food was tasty and prices very affordable. Cabin crew was nice and helpful. There was a little bit delay due to operational reasons. I will use them next time as well.

### "recommend to avoid this company"
Budapest to Tokyo via Warsaw. When we travel from Warsaw ti Tokyo they give us separate seats even if we buy tickets together few months ago and they do not ask about this option (to pay for seats as a low cost company). We try to change seats but it was impossible, and the employees were very impolite with us. In fact LOT is a low cost company even if they pretend to be  premium airline. I ask the crew to try to save this issue but they said its better if I'll try to convince passengers near to me. They help me not! I do not recommend this low cost company with very poor service and they do not care the passengers needs, they want only to take money, and that's all. For sure I'll not travel with this company, I have the worst experience with LOT. I recommend to avoid this company.

### "worst experience of my life"
Warsaw to New York. I travelled once with LOT and was the worst experience of my life. They waited 45 min for a passenger. The food was not taste at all. I won't recommended this company no anyone. They are unprofessional, with horrible services. To be honest I better fly with United Airlines than LOT Polish airline.

### "spacious and comfortable"
Seoul to Munich via Warsaw in business class with LOT Polish Airlines. The ICN-WAW leg was on a new B787 aircraft with full-flat seats. The seat was on par with any modern airlines: spacious and comfortable. The blanket and the pillow was also nice. The amenity kit was rather basic, and the toothbrush was not very good. The food and beverage selections were quite good, as good as any European airlines. The flight attendants were fairly friendly, although sometimes pushing the flight attendant call button did not produce any response. The in-flight entertainment system had some newer movies although the selection was somewhat limited. The music selection was really limited, ironic that we were flying into Chopin Airport. The WAW-MUC leg was on small Embraer aircrafts in 2x2 configurations. The business class seat was the same as the economy class, but with the aisle side seat kept empty. The food on this leg was also OK, given the short flight time. On my outbound trip, the flight from WAW to MUC was delayed for 2 hours. I have seen many reviews complaining about delays with this airline. Since my flight was the only one delayed on that particular day, it didn't seem that flight delays were serious problems with this airline. The lounge at Chopin International Airport was too small. Especially on my return trip, I could barely find an empty seat because the place was filled with passengers. The food and snack served in the lounge was OK. I would fly again if I am going to an European city where no direct flight is available. The flight experience, especially for the long-haul leg, was at least as good as with any major European carriers.

### "consistently the worst service"
London to Chicago via Warsaw. I do not recommend Polish Airlines to anyone, we flew with them today and consistently had the worst service, resulting in us not making our last connection, sleeping in an airport, with them refusing to rebook our tickets without us repaying, leaving us stranded in the airport overnight. Firstly in our first check in, the lady from LOT left her shift in the middle of helping us, making us wait for the next person to come in. Then that flight departed an hour late with no warnings of delay. After that we left from Warsaw, leaving again 20-30 minutes late. This resulted in us arriving 20 minutes late to Chicago, and when we went to try to recheck our baggage there was no one at the desk, we ran around asking people until eventually the guy saundered up and rudely told us to go put our bags with the other airline. Due to all these delays we missed our flight by 2 minutes. When we called customer support we spoke to Caroline. She would consistently say she would call us back and hang up, then not call back. We spent 3 hours recalling them and arguing, and although we asked to talk to her supervisor, we had to wait two hours to finally speak to him. When the supervisor, got on the phone, he said that while our connection was below the minimal connection time (meaning they should repay us) that was only because of their airplane delay so they wouldn't help us book our next flight, and that since we "got lost" looking for where to recheck our bags (ie their employee wasn't at his station to guide us) it was our fault we missed the flight, and that if we hadn't "been wrong" we would have made it. This is the only airline I ever heard of that would make you pay for the flight you had with them again because of their aircraft delay. In the end, the customer service agent hung up on us, as did her supervisor, after both were being continuously rude, not answering questions, and blaming us for their errors in service throughout the call.

### "satisfied of this flight"
Hamburg to Gdańsk via Warsaw. Check-in in Hamburg started olny at one counter and first was served some passengers from economy line before business. Dropping luggage was quick and not problematic, however I had to extra ask for priority sticker on my luggage and for printing boarding cards (I was checked before online). My tools had to be dropped in oversize luggage. Fast track was quick but with some extra scans of my bag. I've wait in lounge which was nice by very heavy occupied. Flight was very quick and surprisingly on-time with as always very poor service on board. In Warsaw I had only 1.5 hour of waiting. Second flight was with propeller aircraft which was half empty and almost everybody had a window seat. This was first time I've ever flown with an aircraft fully operated by women crew (cockpit and cabin). Luggage comes on the belt very fast. I'm fully satisfied of this flight.

### "excellent service"
Vienna-Gothenburg via Warsaw in Business class. Excellent service on board, welcome drink and newspapers, good food, friendly service and then a bus for business class passengers to the terminal on arrival. Far better than is offered on Lufthansa, at a lower cost. Warsaw airport is easy to connect through. Flights left and arrived on time. My return flight was delayed, but I was informed 12 hours in advance and then after calling their hotline I was rebooked with no fuss on Lufthansa, actually getting me home earlier than planned! Excellent service on the ground and in the air

### "All in all nothing to complain about"
Flew LOT Polish Airlines from Milan-Warsaw and return. Aircraft clean with medium legroom and service with free coffee/tea/water, other beverages and food for a fee. Regular communications from cockpit crew, good staff. Both flights were smooth and pleasant. All in all nothing to complain about.

### "should do it better"
Munich to Minsk via Warsaw. LOT have very good connections between Central and Eastern Europe that enable flexibility for a decent price. They use mostly Embraer planes that are for me most confortable regional airplanes. Cabin crew is nice, professional with good language skill. My last trip was in this sense no exception. On KBP-WAW leg 737-400 was used. It was clean, fit, but seat didn't recline. No problem for 1 hour flight, but I would not like to fly longer in a cabin like this. There were also some annoying and needless setbacks. On line check in is customer unfriendly. For MUC-WAW I got the seat assigned, without any possibility to finish. For other flights I could choose max 3 different seats. What is even more strange. On some flights only window seats, on some only aisle seats. Specially strange as WAW-MSQ flight was less than 50% full and WAW-MUC 60-70%. KBP-WAW was delayed for an hour, no big deal, I think we all caught our connections in WAW but there was no information about this on the timetable, they kept us waiting for 1hr in queue before they started to accept the baggage etc. Not really pleasent. Security control in WAW lacks basic courtesy and boarding for WAW-MUC leg was chaotic cause at gate 4 were MUC passengers and gate 4N were BUD passengers. If you came from connecting flight you did not know where to stand and nobody to ask. Overall, nothing really bad, but a flight company that has ambition to be the biggest in central-eastern Europe should do it better.

### "most comfortable seat"
Prague to Larnaca via Warsaw. This was first time I've tried Lot in premium economy on short haul flight and it was very pleasant. First flight was 50 minutes route from Prague and plane was changed in last minute to CRJ 900 from E175 and it was operated by Nordica, but crew was great and premium economy food was tasty (really no different from that in business class), problem is (as with business) you get the same type of seat as economy, but you get fast track of two checked in bag and priority boarding, so it was ok. Second flight was on Lot 175 and I have to say, when flying Lot try to fly route operated by this aircraft, because seats are really spacious, nice recline and tons of leg room (I've tried their 737-400/800 and seats are not comfortable there at all), also seats have chargers which is pretty good. To service part, right after boarding we got orange juice as welcome drink which was nice, crew was great and I really liked to food, we got served right after business class (all 5 people), just couldn't choose the hot meal, because they only had couple of them, but fish was good and everything was tasty. Overall this was really positive experience with Lot (unlike my previous one in economy), but when flying short haul tried to pick a day when its operated by Embraer instead of Boeing, because it was probably the most comfortable short haul economy class seat that I've experienced.

### "food served was outstanding"
I flew LOT in Economy Class from Prague to Los Angeles, USA, via Warsaw, Poland, in December of 2017. I fould LOT's hard and soft products to be on-par or above other operators in the European region. Check-in via their Apple iOS mobile application worked flawlessly and the baggage drop at Prague airport had no line. The agent there was efficient and polite. The flight from Prague to Warsaw on an Embraer 170 was uneventful and encountered a slight departure delay, approximately 20 minutes, but arrived in Warsaw on time. Both the cabin and flight deck crews made timely and informative annoucements in Polish and English. The aircraft was clean and the staff served complimentary water and chocolate wafer cookies, along with the option of duty free shopping. The only item I noticed was that the seat covers were worn and in need of replacement, but it wasn't too bad. Warsaw Airport was small, easy to navigate, and the airline and border staff proficient. All were able to communicate in English easily. The Warsaw to Los Angeles flight was delayed two hours on account of a late arriving aircraft. The staff announcements were informative and no additional delay was encountered. The Boeing 787-8 on the second leg was immaculate and all fixtures fully functional. The economy seats were comfortable, with plenty of padding, and ample legroom. (I am 6-foot, 1-inches, for reference.) The recline was also sufficient without impeding the person behind you. The food served was outstanding, best food I've ever consumed in economy, and I've flown over 1 million miles to-date. The staff were professional and proficient though lacking in smiles, but not uncommon for their culture. The entertainment system was plentiful and functioned flawlessly throughout the nearly 12-hour trip. Again staff announcements were made in both Polish and English by the cabin and flight deck personnel. My only issue with the second flight was bathroom cleanliness. It appears the staff may not observe the condition throughout the flight and a small effort to keep it clean and orderly would have made a big difference, but this was the only issue encountered. Overall, I found LOT to be an excellent option on on European travels. The staff were polite, efficient, and competent, the planes were comfortable, and, apart from some delays and some very minor issues onboard, as mentioned, the trip was comfortable and enjoyable.

### "ground and cabin staff were very friendly"
Flew LOT Polish Airlines from Dusseldorf to Gdansk via Warsaw. Very great leg room and the seats were good. On every seat you have a socket. Every seat has a moveable headrests. The ground and cabin staff were very friendly. A coffee, water, tea and chocolate bar is free. I must say that the food on board was good and very cheap. The flight arrived to the destination on time. This flight was very comfortable and I had a really enjoyble flight.

### "I would fly again"
Katowice to London via Warsaw. Check-in in person at the airport was fast and efficient, only took a few minutes. Flight into Warsaw was on-time. Some refreshments were provided, definitely better than other airlines for a 40m flight. We had a 55m layover so we proceeded to the passport control for non-Schengen flights. This was quick and easy. A note on Warsaw Chopin, it's a decent airport but I think I'm spoiled by the much quieter London airports without constant announcements (some of which were very unprofessional). Our flight to London was unfortunately delayed by 1.5 hours which was very disappointing, especially considering there is close to nothing to do or eat in the non-Schengen part of the airport. A similar set of refreshments were provided on the flight to London. The aircraft (737-800) had a very nice interior and the seat comfort was above average as far as short-haul economy class goes.1 Overall I was disappointed that the flight was delayed but the ticket was cheap, snacks and drinks were provided and the staff was polite and efficient. I would fly again and not just because I want to support my home country's airport but because without the delays I would have no complaints about the airline itself and the service.

### "never again fly LOT"
Warsaw to Los Angeles. Munich to Warsaw with Lufthansa was good. Traveled with my fiancée and we traveled together on one ticket. Lufthansa seated us next to each other on a full plane - no problem. Somehow LOT didn't manage to do this. Checked in online and couldn't reassign seats. Asked at the transfer desk in WAW and were referred to the gate. At the gate we were brusquely told that they couldn't do anything. Of course we had middle seats in the middle - the worst on the plane. The flights were expensive but everything was lacking. Boarding was chaotic with ground personal running around confusedly. Took us 40 minutes standing in line. Once on the plane, they announced that 15 passengers had gone missing. So we had to wait another 50 minutes delay. The food was terrible. They had pork or chicken. Then we were served some disgusting lasagna as the second meal. They didn't do extra rounds for more water, so you could only get something to drink twice in 12 hours. IFE is severely limited. But the worst was the seat pitch. It was as narrow as on small narrow body planes and this was a 11 hour intercontinental flight. And then you have to take into account that it isn't even cheaper than other airlines who are more serious and think that their customers are more than a herd of cattle with dollars printed on their backs - like Lufthansa or Turkish Airlines. I'll make sure to never again fly LOT.

### "advise not to fly with LOT"
Amsterdam to Tbilisi via Warsaw. Flight delay, 4 hours. No information why delayed. Poor communication. No arrival on destination. Rebook failures, 3 times. Aeroflot had to assist LOT  worker how to rebook. Second day again rebooking failed. Because of LOT I missed my flight for my wedding. And Christmas. I will advise not to fly with LOT. LOT did not care about my final destination.

### "their timetable is unreliable"
Amsterdam to Lviv via Warsaw. First they have no reason to depart 2 hours late from Amsterdam. Transfer is missed. Then for 2nd transfer ground personnel send me to wrong gate. Then 3rd transfer is night flight. Then maybe it works. Really disappointing, weather was good. Effective airtime is 1.6 hours. This way travel is 17 hour. They told me if you miss a flight the rest of the tickets are invalid! Staff is friendly but their timetable is unreliable. Bad for business.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Paris CDG to Warsaw. LOT POlish is consistently one of the worst airlines in Europe. LOT in Polish means flight, but it actually is an abbreviation for “Late or Tomorrow.” It’s one thing to be consistently late, it’s quite another to not care, and make no effort to make up lost time. If you are a member of United frequent flier program, they award half, or less, UA Miles than Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian or SAS. They are a budget airline in terms of services, but not price. I fly a lot, and live in Warsaw, and have begun flying on indirect flights on Austrian, Lufthansa or Swiss, even when a direct flight on Lot is available. I’ll wait for a longer connection if possible to avoid using Lot. Regularly, mileage earned on their flights does not post to my United account - 75% of the time, I have to manually request credit two weeks after the flight. There are so many other options - Wizz Air, other airlines, even walking or riding your bike, is a more reliable and enjoyable option. Truly an airline of last resort. Today, as usual, they are late. Cabin staff are rude. No effort to expedite boarding. Plane arrived on time. Just pure inefficiency. Avoid at all costs.

### "I'm very disappointed"
Larnaca to Prague via Warsaw. I'm very disappointed about how LOT tricked me on price of ticket. They start to add price lower, but its without baggage. For which they charge you another 40EUR on airport. If you have couple kilos more doesn't matter if its 2 or 20 than its another 90EUR fee. Flight is 2,5 hours delayed. But what was the worst, they didn't forget to charge me for more kilos and luggage they made all documents about it. But when I left check in, I realised they didn't gave me fly tickets. This is last time Im flying with this company. I bought ticket only as it looked cheaper than direct flight from other company. But in the end it cost 1,5 more than comfortable direct flight. I dont know how long I will be waiting for another flight in warsaw, as my flight will be missed. And I will have to take taxi as my friend cant wait so long for me there. So I wanted to safe some Euros and in the end flight is much much expensive, uncomfortable and long.

### " really enjoyed the flight"
Amsterdam to Moscow via Warsaw. Had to choose the earliest flight to Moscow from Amsterdam. Easy booking on the website,  easy on-line check-in. Convenient and pleasant connection at Warsaw Chopin airport. Both flights were  on time. New and clean planes with enough legroom in economy class. Very nice and polite staff. I really enjoyed the flight and will definitely consider LOT in the future.

### "delayed again by 2 hours"
Reading the negative reviews I thought I would keep an open mind. However my first flight from Toronto to Warsaw was delayed by 2 and a half hours by the time we took off, the seats were uncomfortable and the staff didn’t seem pleased to help you. But there was a lot of food given on the plane (did not eat it so wouldn’t know how it tasted). Currently I’m in Warsaw and my second plane to Budapest is delayed again by 2 hours. The weather is very good for December so that should be no excuse. Will never fly LOT Polish Airlines again.

### "never fly LOT again"
Vilnius to Los Angeles via Warsaw. We get to Warsaw on time from Vilnius and we see the flight is delayed. For the next 4 hours, they delay the flight by 15 minute increments. Then they cancel. After 2 hours in the airport lines to get a hotel voucher, we end up in the middle of nowhere outside of Warsaw. we spent 24 hours in a remote motel. The next flight was 24 hours later to LAX. Then to top it all off, seat video didn't work, couldn't move us. Missed a life event, will not only never fly LOT again, but will never let anyone I know fly them as well. They offered us a discount on a future flight once we complained, which of course we wouldn't use.

### "legroom is quite comfortable"
Budapest to Warsaw. The ground crew was very polite and helpful, when we had some problems with our lagguages they arranged our issue without any additional fees. Cabin crew was okay, the meal and drink service is nothing special (chocolate bar, coffee and water on a 55 minutes flight). The legroom is quite comfortable on the Q400 aircraft and we landed without any turbulance or problem. The flight took 55 minutes so you can bare the turboprop aircraft. LOT Polish Airlines says that they wanted to be Central- and Eastern Europes' favourite airline. Compare to the others it is time to develop. (Higher services for that price or the present service for lover price.)

### "first invest in decent training"
I traveled on the domestic Szczekin to Katowice via Warsaw route. The flight from Szczekin was delayed about 25 minutes. It was snowing on that day and most of the flights were delayed. Shortly after landing at WAW, I received an SMS that my further flight to KTW was canceled. Such situations happen. However, according to the old tradition of LOT, cancellation of the flight becomes a problem for the passenger, not the airline. In the transfer center I was told that a substitute bus connection will be started and have to go to the bus terminal. There will be well-marked LOT employees who will show me the bus. There was no one on the scene, except a group of confused passengers. The telephone number which was given in SMS could not be reached. I had to return to KTW on my own. LOT is currently developing very strongly. Modern planes appear, new directions. However, I have advice for LOT, first invest in decent training in passenger service, and only then you can dream how conquering the European aviation market

### "needs to improve greatly"
Frankfurt to Los Angeles via Warsaw. The meals on my flight to Los Angeles were inedible. The quality was by far substandard. The selection of inflight movies is extremely limited and the choices are outdated movies only. LOT needs to improve greatly, if they want my repeat bussiness.

### "good flight experience"
Both flights on time. A very good hard product again and on time performance. Weaker soft factors than on the way to Bucharest. On both legs the pursers were less interacting and courteous as on the flights some days before. And this makes a major difference. Nevertheless a good flight experience. As I was booking late, PE was even cheaper than normal Economy.

### "nice drink and food service"
Zurich to Bucharest via Warsaw. Both flight legs without any problem, nice drink and food service and enough space (good pitch). Seats very comfortable. Headrest adjustable. Priority boarding and baggage tags respected. First leg on time and early arrival, second 50 minutes delayed boarding but having just a 10 minutes delay at landing. The boarding delay was not handled well in WAW airport. I left 15 minutes before primary boarding time LOT Lounge (Schengen side) to cross boarder control into non-Schengen transit area. Arriving 5 minutes before boarding should start at the gate. 5 minutes after official boarding time a delay of 10 minutes was shown on the gate screens, adding every 10 minutes 10 minutes more. No verbal communication out the delay, only in the airplane before takeoff. Due to the manner how LOT was dealing with the delay, I was standing about 55 minutes at the gate instead of being able to use longer or again the lounge. Not very satisfactory!

### "problem is the airline staff"
Szeczin to Belgrade. Today 4 Octobar I missed my conecting fly From Belgrade to Rzeszow. Fly from Belgrade depart later 30min and beacuse of this I miss next fly to Rzezsow. And I now need to wait in Warsaw 6hrs. Problem is not waiting, the problem is the airline staff. They are not friendly, and they don't won't listen. I ask 3 times what happen with my flight, no information. After that I must wait bus for passport control, there is not any bus for faster transfer? I travel a lot, I'm a professional volleyball player, and I have problem with flights but not something like this without communication. Very, very bad - I'm now here on airport waiting my flight.

### "Do not use this airline"
New York to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. Do not book a ticket here. We booked flights right before a holiday, and LOT Polish Airlines cancelled the day before our flight. Didn't even call, just sent a vague email for us to figure out on our own. We booked our tickets months in advance and to book a day before is crazy expensive and stressful. Do not use this airline.

### "Very friendly staff"
Odessa to Zurich via Warsaw. Very friendly staff, clean, professional. On time and I was statisfied. I flew from Odessa to Warsaw, had a night there and then to Zurich. The price was really good - I can recommend them.

### "unprofessional circus operation"
Warsaw to Lviv. My 12:55pm flight was first delayed a few hours and then they drove us to the plane via bus where we sat on the tarmac in a bus only to be driven back to the terminal and told the flight was to be cancelled and they were unable to find any flights so I had to do a overnight stay over which at least they paid for. The cancellation process was disorganized and no one was there to help me know what to do or where to go next. We were left on our own to figure it out. Eventually an hour later I finally found a LOT rep to tell me what was going on and what to do. Total mad house. Most unprofessional thing I ever saw. Secondly, during my departure waits to Lviv and back, all I ever heard was a steady stream of delay announcements. I was terrified my return connection back to the US would be delayed. Food was terrible and in flight entertainment was about 20movies to choose from. This airline is the most unprofessional circus operation I have ever seen in my life and I recommend only flying them if you don't have to be anywhere on time. Delays and cancellations are what they excel at. The worst experience of my life.

### "rude and inconsiderate treatment"
Newark to Cluj via Warsaw. Worst experience flying out of Newark airport. The airline decide to hold up an entire flight to Warsaw because they had some VIP's coming and being delayed. They make all passengers wait and part ways to ensure the VIP's are getting their preferential treatment. Such a rude and inconsiderate treatment. Not to mention a lot of people around me are counting on getting there on time for their connecting flights. As for me, I'm taking this trip to go to my father's funeral, and missing a connecting flight will mean I will literally delay the funeral. I don't know if I am angry, disappointed or extremely sad. This has showed again how our country is upside down and how money and fame will make your life count. As for the rest of us, we don't matter dear LOT airline.

### "LOT are horrible to fly"
Warsaw to Frankfurt. LOT Polish are horrible to fly. My ticket was purchased on 19 March 2017 from Condor Airlines. The return back home was very confusing. When I arrived 2 hours before my flight from Warsaw to Frankfurt by Polish Airlines, they told me that I am on standby. They oversold the seats and I was very unhappy about it. The women working by the counter as well information center are very rude. They don't have any customer service skills. They act like we have to please them, not them. The problem has been solved, but it was very stressful. Never again.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
Prague to Larnaca via Warsaw. Prague to Warsaw on small Dash 8 which is ok, but in some days they operate this route by E175 which I would prefer. Plane had been delayed over and hour because of the weather which wasn't huge problem since I had 3 hours layover. We received small choolade bar and glass of water, for anything else you had to pay. One hour before my flight I've found out that second flight will be delayed as well almost 2 hours. It started with boarding, there were two lines, one for economy and second for business and with small children. Since there was a problem with some passangers at the economy line they opened second one. It was ok, until it was time for me, than group of 20 people with 3 kids came and they let me wait until they were processed (like it was only me and I got EU passport), so I had to squiezed myself into second line, but still like 30 people passed me. I boarded this old Boeing 737-400 (it's time to retire them), agian in some days this route is operated by E175, but unlucky again. Seat pitch in this plane is terrible, seats are new, but not confortable, only plus is that they have sockets so you can power up your phone. Cabin crew wasn't really great and they were not friendly. Only thing you've got for free was glass of water and chocolade bar which is not ok, on 3 hours and 30 minutes long flight, plus selection of meals that I can buy was really limited and not really tasty. Like it's not budget airline and even though I said this flight was only not supper expensive option it wasn't cheap either. Of course no IFE, screens or Wifi. So I cannot recomend this airline, I will fly with them only if I have no better option.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Toronto to Pula via Warsaw. The plane was delayed by over two hours at Toronto Pearson airport. The connecting flight from Warsaw would allow us only 30 minutes to catch it. Many people on the plane lost their connecting flights, but luckily we made ours. The staff was rude on the plane and at the counters. Even asking that we be let off the plane first to catch our connecting flight was a big denial by the staff on the plane. On our return flight they forced both of us to check-in our baggage (proper weight) but claimed the size was too large (not true as a duffel bag can be squished). We fit our carry-on just fine in the cabin as carry-on on our first flight. But because there was no electronic self-check-in on the way back we got screwed by the airline. Because of this I could not sit with my partner. Many people were split up because the plane was completely full. The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful and did not tend to us when we had a question in line. They asked the people behind us what they needed probably because we didn't speak the language. Either way it was very odd that they skipped us and helped certain others. My biggest complaint is that LOT did not place my smaller than most bags on the airplane. I found this out after 3 days of arriving back to Toronto and inquiring about this numerous times at Pearson airport and LOT. The LOT contact center was disgusting and did not provide any information about my lost bag. Pearson finally said that it will arrive on the flight tomorrow (3rd day after arriving to Toronto). I can expect delivery on the 4th day if this is true information. I am just curious to see if anything was stolen from my bag. Not to mention that my keys were in there as I was caught off guard to remember to bring them on the plane with me. I wasn't able to access my home or vehicle in Toronto due to this. I will never fly with this airline again in my life. They get 1 out of 10 for the newer planes and the on-board entertainment. But for staff, service and headaches with lost luggage they get a big ding. The savings of a $100-$200 was not worth it.

### "Flight was cancelled"
Warsaw to Paris. Flight was cancelled. The passengers were re-directed to the transfer desk. The queue was an hour-long. No annoucements of any kind were made. After an hour they told me they could do nothing for me (neither reimbursement not compensation) because everything had to be done online. Well, I do not enjoy queuing up for an hour for nothing when they could have just well told me and all the other passengers in the same exact situation what to do before wasted their time.

### "intentionally false information"
Warsaw to New York JFK. Flight was delayed 2.5 hours. This delay resulted in a missed connecting JetBlue Airways flight to Syracuse. The airline gave me a voucher for hotel stay and breakfast. When I called the hotel they said I had no reservation. I came back to an empty terminal but was fortunate to find couple ladies from LOT that swore this has never happened before. So after about half an hour she said ok, we got you a room at the Hilton. I was relieved and started walking back to the AirTran. I decided to call the hotel to ask for a shuttle and tell them I'm on the way, this guy informed me I didn't have a reservation. By the time I came back everyone cleared out. I spent over nine hours at the terminal after already traveling for 15 hours. The people give you wrong and intentionally false information just to get rid of you. Too many option to pay a lot of money to sleep on terminal floor.

### "flight was very good"
Krakow to Warsaw on a Boeing 737-400. I arrived at the airport around 07.00. After security I went to the gate. 10 minutes before the scheduled departure time (09.10) we were told our flight will depart at 10.00. Slightly after 09.30 we started boarding the aircraft. We boarded using the jet bridge and it was raining outside. The cabin was very modern as it was retro fitted with slimline leather seats in 2016. The cabin was clean and so was the seating are with no gum on the seats or armrests. The legroom on LOT's Boeing 737-400s is excellent with lots of room between my leg and the seat. We departed after 10.00 and the crew apologised multiple times about the delay. The snack and drink service was better than usual with water, Pepsi, jellies and chocolate wafers being served. Shortly afterwards we landed at Warsaw only 30 minutes after scheduled arrival time. All in all I would say the flight was very good and the staff were very sorry for the delay even though it was not their fault. In my opinion the aircraft was very comfortable, better than other airlines I have flow to date. The flight was very cheap, around £25 considering it was booked around a month earlier. I highly recommend LOT but when booking connections at Warsaw with them I would recommend at least 2 hours time, just in case there is a delay.

### "Extremely poor customer service"
Chicago to Warsaw. Our bag was lost upon arrival in Warsaw. Claim was filed with LS Airport Services and I was given information with contact numbers/emails. It has been 4 weeks and bag is still lost. Daily phone calls to the LOT customer service numbers provided by LS are going unanswered or busy. Multiple emails are unacknowledged and unanswered. Extremely poor customer service.

### "Zero customer service"
Amsterdam to Lviv via Warsaw. Worst airline I have ever dealt with. Zero customer service. When my baggage didn't arrive on my flight into Lviv, there was a LOT customer service booth with a girl inside who didn't know anything. She said to wait for someone else to show up. That person never showed up. My luggage is missing and there's no one to help me. Never use this airline, they may lose your luggage and you'll be on your own.

### "a simply not again experience"
Warsaw to London. Simply unacceptable. Our flight departure was shifting every 30 minutes and finally got a new departure time of DELAYED. Whatever that means for LOT. English language level very poor. No announcements regarding status of the flight. Combined with Warsaw Airport that makes a simply "not again" experience.

### "Two hassle free flights"
Flew LOT Polish Airlines from Bucharest to Zurich via Warsaw. Normally I do not book business class for European flights, but this one was actually cheaper than the economy ticket for the destination on that day. Fast check-in, easy security check and fast boarder control although no fast track available at OTP. Two hassle free flights with easy connection at WAW airport. LOT lounge there rather too small for the number of flights respectively biz pax, but nice with a good food offering. Inflight food and service impeccable, although I would have wished an hot main dish on the (2nd) evening leg. One hour delay in WAW due to a thunderstorm.

### "cabin staff was kind"
Košice to Riga via Warsaw. I would say that I flew with two different airlines. I really enjoyed my flight from Košice to Warsaw. We have very kind and helpful crew. Plane was small but I have lot of space for myself and seats were comfortable. (E95) When I had to ask some question during my transit, employees were helpful. Both flights from and to Riga were terrible. Airlines shouldnt use these DH8D planes. They are really uncomfortable and noisy. However cabin staff was kind and they gave us information about our flight.

### "had to spend 10 hours in Warsaw"
After my LOT flight was late from Venice (LO310) and the flight to Lviv (LO225) didn't wait for me, I had to spend 10 hours in Warsaw only to get to know that the flight they put me on is also delayed for an hour, and the ground crew doesn't even know the exact time of flight because the crew is also late for this flight from some other delayed flight.

### "connecting flight didn't wait"
Venice to Warsaw. Plane was late 50 minutes departure. Arrived 45 minutes late and the connecting flight didn't wait for some 10 minutes. No support was provided. The only option given next flight that arrives at 1am. It was manageable to accomplish me through the passport control, but they didn't even try.

### "seat was soft and comfy"
Krakow to Warsaw on Embraer 195. After security at Krakow Airport I had around 2 hours to spare so I spent it plane spotting as there is nothing to do while waiting. The seating was full so if you find a seat you would be best to stay seated as you will have difficulty finding another. We boarded the aircraft using one of the newly installed jet bridges at Krakow Airport, LOT is one of the few airlines that use them. While we were waiting to pushback the crew ran through the safety demo and handed out snacks, which was a wafer. The seat was soft and comfy, the seat reclined slightly. The drinks were handed out, tea, coffee and water. At Warsaw we deboarded using the jet bridge. I had around 4 hours to spend at Warsaw before catching a flight home to Aberdeen. Overall the flight was amazing and LOT did not disappoint me. In my opinion LOT is the best airline if travelling in Poland and can be cheaper than the train or bus, even with connections. The flight was very cheap and was definitely worth paying the price.

### "we could not get seats together"
Flew from Budapest to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. Even more than a day before we could not get seats together even though we travelled and bought the tickets together. At Budapest airport we were helped and got seats together. At Warsaw airport LOT staff put on a typical "we do not want to help you" attitude, they were quite rude. They definitely have no idea what service culture, clients or representing a brand means.

### "room for improvement"
Beijing to Warsaw. While the instances of turbulence along the way were preceded with an appropriate warning, the flight attendants didn't see fit to intervene in the instances in which people refused to comply, for example one of the Chinese passengers who was just casually stretching his legs next to his seat was ignored by the flight attendant who was passing him by. The seat was comfortable and there was enough room to fit your legs. The inflight entertainment system was quite standard. The touchscreen was quite unresponsive but the remote worked fine. The food was decent: the first meal was fried chicken with rice whereas the second one came with a peculiar sandwich as well as some very tasty yoghurt. The beverage cart passed me by lots of times so there was never any problem getting some water, tea or coffee - aside from one time when I couldn't find the call button and went to the rear of the plane only to have the head stewardess point me to the bottle and essentially had me pour the drink for myself in a way that made it seem like I hadn't paid more than $800 for this trip and thus had no reason to expect this kind of things to be done for me. The biggest problem was that there wasn't a single line of Chinese spoken by the crew during the flight (the FAs were Polish unfamiliar with a word of Chinese). I would expect to hear at least some pre-recorded message of welcoming people on board, where the flight is going to or a turbulence warning. That's not too much to ask and that way the Chinese passengers would feel much more secure. There's definitely lots of room for improvement and LOT would be wise to take cues from Lufthansa or Etihad.

### "a very pleasant flight"
On the 29th of March 2017, I flew on a LOT Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from Gdansk to Krakow. The overall flight lasted around 50 minutes. On boarding I was asked to place my cabin baggage into the hold as it was too big for the aircraft's overhead locker. The baggage was delivered to me at the aircraft on arrival at Krakow. When I boarded the aircraft the crew was welcoming and friendly. The cabin was clean and the seat was very comfortable. Legroom was more than enough and the seat reclined. After departure, the crew served tea, coffee and water accompanied by a snack which was the chocolate wafer or Frugo jellies. Shortly after the snack service we started descent and we arrive into Krakow on time. The announcements were made in Polish and English and the crew's English was of a very good standard. The captain kept everyone updated on the flights progress and the arrival time. The ticket was £18, which was really cheap considering the ticket was bought 3 months before the flight. Overall, a very pleasant flight and great service. I would definitely fly with LOT again.

### "worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. I purchased my tickets well in advance. I flew from Lo Angeles to Moscow and was supposed to fly back tomorrow. I called to see if I can upgrade my flight to business as I was flying with an infant and my son was not very comfortable on the flight there. When I called I was told my flight from Moscow to Warsaw was cancelled. That is two days before the flight! Had I not called I doubt I would have been notified about this. I was given two options, fly two days later or receive a partial refund. I could not fly later as I had to be at work the day after my flight. I asked if I could possibly fly the day the next day and was told that yes, but LOT will not be paying for the hotel. I choose to receive a refund and had to purchase a much more expensive ticket as it was just a day before the flight. I was told by LOT representative that this flight is operated by Aeroflot and I should complain to them directly. However, I purchased my tickets from LOT and Aeroflot was never mentioned in my ticket. It is LOT responsibility to make sure I make to my destination on time. I fly quite often, but this was by far the worst experience with an airline. Complete deiregard for the customer and lack of responsibility for the tickets they sell. I am 5 month pregnant and flying with a 10 month infant and it is a difficult trip for me. LOT has made it a complete nightmare. Will never use LOT again and will advice anyone else not to use this airline. Better pay a little more and have a decent customer service. I can not say I am disappointed, I am actually quite mad as I was put in a horrible position and LOT has never apologized or offered any solution.

### "customer service of LOT is excellent"
I had a return flight with LOT from Paris - Warsaw – Tbilisi. The flight from Paris to Warsaw was delayed by 2 hours. When I arrived to Warsaw, my flight to Tbilisi had already departed. The ground staff could not find any seats to allow me to reach Tbilisi the next day. Ground staff were very kind and professional. The only possibility was to cancel the trip and come back to Paris as the entire trip was only 4 days long. I spent the night in Warsaw (the hotel was provided). In this regard, it should be highlighted that the customer service of LOT is excellent. After filling the claim form on-line, two and half weeks after the trip I received the reimbursement of the air ticket and the modest compensation for not reaching the final destination. I congratulate LOT for having very helpful customer service which is rare nowadays. One final remark about the stopover of 30-40 minutes in Warsaw which is a big stress. I travel very often via Warsaw. This is the third time when I could not make my connection. Please, note even when the flight is on time (but the flight from Paris to Warsaw 19.40 pm - usually every time delayed), it is very difficult to make the connection because of passport control in the airport of Warsaw. I saw hundreds passengers having the same problem from other destinations as well. LOT is losing a lot of money because of this issue and I believe it needs further evaluation and monitoring. My understanding that it should be possible to increase the stopover in Warsaw up to 50 minutes or 1 hour connection time!

### "a very good experience"
Warsaw to Gdansk on LOT Polish Airlines in an Embraer 170 aircraft. Cabin was spacious and seats were comfortable, 2+2 seating. Onboard a snack was provided, but only water as beverage. Overall the airline was efficient regarding operations (check in, luggage etc.) and the flight was a very good experience.

### "great compared to the price"
Warsaw to Tel Aviv. Really great compared to the price paid. The prices were pretty low and were also including check in luggage, though only a snack at the airplane. The seats were comfortable and clean, and we had power connection. The only problem was that we received the last row since we didn't choose the seats and it wasn't the quietest (lucky I always bring ear plugs). The ground crew wasn't the fastest and because we were flying to Israel they had trouble with the extra security and we were a bit late to depart.

### "good regional airline"
Paris to Tbilisi via Warsaw in April. Check-in was quick and staff professional. The crew was very friendly and ready to assist passengers. The food is for purchase so called - LOT Gourmet offer which has limited selection but for affordable price. LOT provide free plain and sparkling water as well as tea and coffee. The crew distributed chocolate waffles as well. It is good regional airline with affordable tickets and normal product. However, there is one issue which needs to be considered by LOT management. The stopover of 30-40 minutes in Warsaw is really disaster. Most flights are delayed at least 15 minutes. It is so stressful to go through the passport control and run to the gate. I travel very often and every time is a huge stress. I could see hundreds passengers having the same problem from other destinations as well. This should be re-looked by the management. Generally, I recommend to fly with LOT Polish airlines.

### "tickets could have been a bit cheaper"
Vilnius to Brussels via Warsaw. Couple of convenient options for check-in, including text message and e-mail. Only disappointing is that at VNO there is no possibility of printing a boarding pass in self-service kiosk, you can do it just at counters. However there were no queues. Departure on time, VNO-WAW on a Q400. Crew professional and attentive, served a sweet treat and soft drinks, as the flight was very short. The flight to BRU was delayed by nearly 40 minutes, as the plane arrived later from its previous flight, an old Boeing 737. Although you could really see the jet was ageing, the cabin was refurbished and clean. Crew was nice, but seemed a bit tired. In general I am very satisfied, but the tickets could have been a bit cheaper. If they are, LOT would become a stronger competitor with other European airlines, including LCC.

### "serve you a simple but tasty meal"
Paris CDG to Warsaw - Rzeszow. Crew is professionnal, and pay attention to passenger's needs. They serve you a simple but tasty meal, even on short flights (Warszawa-Rzeszow is a 30 min flight operated in Q400 aircraft). In Warszawa airport, most of the flights remain boarded and unboarded on the apron and require a bus to reach terminal, but it goes fast and without stress. The main minus of LOT is its high price.

### "experience was quite good"
Katowice to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. My overall experience was quite good. They need to change few things, like more professional cabin crew because one was talking about their private life loud during whole flight. The rest was really good. Seats for this plane were comfortable, ground staff was good and knows what they are doing, also comfort of the flight (take off and landing) was very professional and smooth.

### "cabin crew were exceptionally friendly"
Flew Zurich to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. The flight was on time. The aircraft was very clean (and without middle seats), and as the plane was roughly 30% empty, I had a vacant adjacent seat, which made my journey more comfortable. The service was modest - coffee, tea or water and a wafer, however, the paid service offers a wide selection of snacks including salads and sandwiches at very good prices. The cabin crew were exceptionally friendly and attentive, they seemed relaxed and created nice atmosphere. There were also detailed announcements about the flight from the captain and the first officer that ensured me that I was in a safe place. Overally there is nothing to stick with.

### "the staff are friendly"
Very nice flight from Krakow to Milan via Warsaw. Very comfortable. A little turbulence on the WAW-MXP route, but alright, we were close to Alps Mountains. Aircrafts are excellent and clean, the staff are friendly, and the captain explains the details of the flight quite often. I would recommend LOT again. Great, modern airline.

### "staff were prompt and professional"
Overall this experience was comparable to flying a US carrier internationally. In other words, clearly inferior as an overall experience to something like SAS or Cathay but not nearly as bad as this site would have you think. The 787 from Warsaw to Chicago was reasonably comfortable for Economy, and of course, brand new. There was a decent selection of new and older films - not the most comprehensive I've ever seen, but you won't be bored, and the equipment was new and worked well. The aircraft staff were prompt and professional and service ran smoothly. Whoever was running the preflight desk in Warsaw definitely perfected a distant stare to avoid talking to anyone standing in line. The meal service food was just dreadful - in hour 8 of a 10 hour flight we were served an ice cold cheese sandwich after a truly gross lunch six hours earlier. If anyone from the airline is reading this: I'd pay another $20 or $30 per ticket for edible food.

### "lack of communication disturbing"
Budapest to Chicago via Warsaw in November and the flight was ok. The cabin crew was not the friendliest and didn't speak good English. My return flight from Chicago was cancelled due to some software problem with the emergency lights (or at least that's what they told). We waited for 5 hours, until 2am, and then they cancelled the flight. Afterwards it took another 1.5 hour to get a voucher for the hotel and reschedule the flight. Luckily I was in the beginning of the queue, because those behind and the last ones might have waited until 5 in the morning easily. The ground crew was not really controlling the situation, there was a lot of running around, not enough people to handle the situation, and their English was not the best. I was disturbing that they talked a lot in Polish to the Poles, and that gave the impression one is missing out on information. To be fair, they gave out water and sandwiches after 4 hours of waiting, but that gave little comfort. Overall (if your flight is not cancelled) it is a good value for your money airline, but the lack of professionalism of the crew and the lack of communication was very disturbing.

### "wasn't a bad experience"
Brussels to Wroclaw via Warsaw. My flight from BRU to WAW departed with about 15 minutes delay due to the late arrival of our E195 aircraft. The boarding was fast, the aircraft was in a good condition with comfortable seats and cabin crew was friendl. They offered sandwiches, beverages and snacks for payment, however prices are reasonable. They accept payments with MC, Visa, AMEX, etc. and also PLN, EUR, USD and CAD in cash. Later  was given tea, coffee, water free with a chocolate bar. We arrived on time. I had 1:20h to make my connection from WAW to WRO. Later it turned out that our flight to WRO will be delayed. Finally we took off about 25min later than scheduled and arrived at WRO with 15min delay. Our aircraft was a Dash Q400 (as usually on LOT's domestic routes) which is OK on short-haul flights. The crew seemed to be tired and wasn't kind. Most of the fight time they spent in the galley chatting. All together it wasn't a bad experience but also there's nothing I particularly liked or disliked. Although, I wouldn't have minded arriving at WRO earlier than midnight.

### "nice slim leather seats"
Warsaw to London. Excellent flight, despite 45 mins delay (because of weather). LOT has one of the best Business Lounges I've been to - food and selection of drinks is excellent. Boarding started on time, but when we took our seats, Captain informed about 45 mins delay due to very strong winds at Heathrow Airport. Boeing 737-400 has interior refurbished with nice slim leather seats, good legroom, mood lighting etc. Very nice and clean. Cabin crew was nice and friendly, smiling and reacting to the call bell. Service consists of hot beverages, water and chocolate wafer, other items are for purchase - deal is really good - chicken sandwich is just 2GBP. Can of coke is less than 1GBP. Captain was informing us about delay etc. Landed around 40 mins late. Bags arrived 20 mins later.

### "very pleasant experience"
Warsaw to London Heathrow. Check in at Warsaw airport was quick and efficient. Very polite ground staff. Boarding well organised. Warm welcome upon boarding. Aeroplane refurbished with new seats with power sockets and mood lighting. Onboard service offered complementary tea, coffee, water and a free snack. Flight was very pleasant, captain made announcements in Polish & English. Cabin crew professional, courteous and attentive. Arrived in Heathrow at impressive Terminal 2. All in all a very pleasant experience.

### "I was not expecting such a high level of service"
My choices to fly directly from Warsaw to Madrid were very limited, so I choose to try LOT, as the alternative of Iberia is simply not an option (terrible airline, see past reviews). I will say I was pleasantly surprised with LOT. Upon boarding, the flight staff greeted me enthusiastically. They were immediately friendly and helpful. This continued throughout the flight. The meal service was personable and they were very accommodating. I was not expecting such a high level of service. The meal was on par with any of the other 4 star European Airlines. The seating configuration is the typical Inter-Europe ruse with Business Class being nothing more than coach with no middle passenger, but the pleasant service and decent meal made up for the inconvenience. Overall, I was very impressed with LOT and would fly them again.

### "baggage is included with LOT"
Bucharest to Zurich via Warsaw. LOT Polish Airlines Embraer airplanes have comfortable leather seats with a decent pitch. Drink service of water, coffee and tea and a chocolate-biscuit bar. But the inflight menu is buy onboard. Both flights on time with early arrivals. Easy transfer in WAW, nice Business lounge with a good food and a simple drink selection. Nice that the baggage is included with LOT, often at the same price others let you fly without any baggage included.

### "professional and amiable"
Warsaw to Poznan. After a smooth boarding we had to wait half an hour for the de-icing of the plane. The LOT Embraer jets are about 10 years old but they have not lost its modern cabin look. The plane was half-empty so I had the whole 2-seat row for myself. The seats were more comfortable than those of LOT's Bombardier Q400. After a small delay we were offered water, tea or coffee and a wafer. The cabin crew were professional and amiable towards passengers. Each passenger got a Christmas postcard from LOT Polish Airlines, which was very kind.

### "poor quality of the ground staff"
Beijing to Zürich via Warsaw. The Boeing 787 was nice and the experience onboard was also ok, except that they didn't collect trash before turning off light for sleep time of a long trip. On the ground, in Warsaw, the passport control was extremely slow, unprofessional and rude. From what I saw about the LOT ground staff, I am not surprised that 2 of 3 my checked luggages were damaged. They must dropped them from quite a height, which made the 2 wheels on one side broken. LOT has great aircrafts and the staffs on board were excellent in foreign languages, but with such poor quality and responsibility of the ground staff LOT needs more efforts to improve before becoming a competitive airline.

### "decent flight experience"
Was flying first time with LOT Polish Airlines Zurich to Tallinn via Warsaw. First leg to WAW with E170. Seats very comfy and good pitch. Coffee, tea and water as complimentary drinks, a chocolate-biscuit bar as complimentary snack. There is more stuff available but you have to pay. Flight due to late arrival and bad weather conditions in ZRH 40 minutes delayed, arrived 15 minutes late at WAW airport. All transfers were granted. A solid performance for the price I paid for the ticket. LOT Biz lounge not that big, a little cramped, but with one of the best food choices in Europe. Was having a superb Polish soup for lunch. Second leg on an CRJ900 from Nordica, repainted with the LOT logo, but still registered in Estonia. All crew but the purser (LOT employee) were from Nordica, service was LOT, like in a wet lease. Had an emergency exit seat and plenty of room. A decent flight experience.

### "Spacious and clean cabin"
Munich to Warsaw. Very good flight. Spacious and clean cabin, with nice leather seats and great legroom. Crew was cheerful, friendly and professional. Very good cabin announcements, from purser and pilots. Hot drinks, water and small chocolates are free, other items for purchase, but with a flight time just over one hour, nobody purchased anything. Very pleasent experience.

### "never flying with LOT again"
Copenhagen to Kosice via Warsaw. First leg of the flight was delayed (1h 20min) - no explanation was given to us. The second leg was delayed too (40min) and thanks to a longer flight than planned, we arrived at 00:40 instead of 23:35. The cabin crew was speaking english very silently, I couldnt hear what they're saying, it almost looked like they did it on purpose so people cant hear their poor pronunciation. Even though we were already delayed for 40min in Warsaw, and it was like -2 degrees outside, the cabin crew left the doors open 12 minutes after everyone was on the plane. They were re-fueling so there was a really strong smell inside of the plane, and it was freezing in there. The checked baggage was being loaded on plane after boarding. I'm never flying with LOT again and I advise everyone not to do that too.

### "very disappointing overall"
London Heathrow to Warsaw. Easily the most uncomfortable I've ever been on a plane. The distance between the seats is far too small. Seats are very uncomfortable and have lumps in the wrong places. Drinks service was very slow, temperature in the cabin was too hot and the air vents about the seats not working. The final blow for me was the stewards still waking around the plane during the landing putting themselves and passengers at risk. Very disappointing overall. Would happily pay more to never use this airline again. Makes Ryanair look pro.

### "cabin crew were friendly and welcoming"
Early morning flight from Heathrow Terminal 2 to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. When we booked, we were told that the aircraft would be a B737 so had chosen seats 7B and 7C. At the gate, we found we were going to board an Embraer ERJ-195. With a 2-2 seat layout (instead of the 737's 3-3 configuration), this meant that 7B and 7C were separated by the single aisle. Not an issue. Seats were comfortable, if slightly on the small side. For a short flight like this, if you keep your jacket / coat on, you will feel restricted. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. The announcements were in Polish and English (the English was understandable). Flight was on time and smooth. No inflight entertainment, and food and drink were offered for an extra cost. Everyone received a cup of water and a chocolate wafer biscuit. To be honest, this was fine - it's not a long flight (2hrs 30mins) so a meal isn't needed. If you want to stay properly hydrated, buy a bottle or two of water before boarding. Same if you want a snack - there are plenty of places to eat before flying, or where you can grab a sandwich if you must eat something while in the air. For us, the main reason for choosing this flight was the time of departure / arrival, and the relatively low cost.

### "stress and agony"
Belgrade to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. Ground service is almost a disaster. Staff look very anxious and they seem to be very unprofessional in handling basic rules, such as checking boarding passes before boarding, informing people about delays etc. They repeat constantly one sentence 'I am doing my job'. I heard the same phrase from minimum 7-8 of them in 2 hrs. I think even this parrot like manner shows that they have some issues with doing their jobs. They serve only coffee, tea or water during the flight. By mistake if you ask for a coffee and water, the reaction from the staff is like you are abusing their generosity. So, be careful to chose only one. I had a bad impression from this flight. My previous trip with LOT was in May 2016, and the flight was cancelled after 3 times taking-off and returning to the departure point due to some technical problem. This adventure lasted from 2PM to midnight and after 10 hours of torture they decided to cancel the flight and offered free tickets for next day. And next day flight was also 3 hours delayed without any information. I was trying to avoid them, and preferring Austrian, Lufthansa or Turkish Airlines instead of direct flight but this week, other options were too complicated and I had to take LOT again. I will never fly again with LOT, even they offer free tickets. Life is too short to go through all that stress and agony. And I strongly recommend people to stay away from this airline.

### "very nice and professional"
Chicago to Sofia via Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. My flight to Sofia from Chicago was very nice and professional. The wait time was very short and the staff at the desk were friendly. The aircraft was clean and had nice bright colors, the seats were comfortable and sturdy. The staff were welcoming - from the entrance they greeted me with a smile and happily showed me my seat. The whole flight was very calm and smooth. Overall the flight was very professional.

### "price paid worth the price"
Kraków to Warsaw, domestic flight. The ticket cost around £25, which was worth the price. Inflight a glass of water was served with a Polish wafer. The flight took 35 minutes, so inflight entertainment was not needed, however there was an inflight magazine to read. The seat was very comfortable and reclined. Overall the price paid for the ticket was worth the price.

### "should be ashamed of themselves"
Warsaw to Toronto. I'm scared of flying. Knowing this, whenever we book a flight, my husband goes above and beyond to ensure that we have seats booked together, as sitting alone would make my flight experience a nightmare. When my husband booked flights with LOT many months ago, he looked online to see if he could pre-book seats together; he could not. He emailed LOT customer service, explained the situation, and was told that LOT does not allow seat booking in advance, but we could ensure we had seats together when we checked in online 24 hours prior to the flight. My husband logged in 23 hours and 59 minutes prior to the flight. Strangely, we were allotted two middle seats in completely different rows and the system would not allow us to change seats. Thinking this was just a technical glitch, my husband called LOT’s customer service and was told that we could only change our seats when we checked in at the airport and that we should get to the airport early. When my husband asked why we were separated in the first place, we were told that seats were randomly assigned and not based on us being on the same ticket (which, by the way, is insane – if we booked together, of course we want to sit together). The next day, we arrived at the airport more than 5 hours prior to our flight. Upon check-in, we were told that there were no seats left and we would have to sit apart. My husband explained the situation, and reiterated that we were told both that we could not book seats in advance, and that we could only change seats at the airport, but the check-in agent would not help. When my husband asked her why we were not seated together from the beginning, we were given a number of different responses:  We were randomly assigned and because we have different last names, we were not put together. Weight and balance – she told us there were seats available, but we couldn’t have them as they were “trying to balance the plane.” Everyone else had already checked in and these were the only two seats left (I’ve flown on hundreds of different airlines and have never seen everyone checked in 5 hours prior to a flight, so I suspect this was a lie). Everyone else paid to pre-book their seats (even though we told her we attempted to pay to pre-book out seats and were told that LOT does not provide this service). Interestingly, we were then told that we would be seated together if we upgraded to Premium Economy. Three days prior to the flight, my husband put in a bid for LOT’s Premium Economy auction. He bid the lowest amount, figuring it would be rejected and that it was worth a shot anyway. He received an email a couple days prior to the flight to let him know that his bid was, in fact, rejected. Now, my some sheer coincidence, we would only be able to sit together if we paid full price to upgrade. I felt we were bullied by the airline into paying for an upgrade; it worked. But, I will never fly with LOT again. They should be ashamed of themselves.

### "service is average at best"
Short flight from Budapest to Warsaw with LOT. Good that it is direct, but the service on the plane is average at best. You get water and crackers, but anything else is for extra charge, even though this airline is not a traditional low cost one. No delay, smooth flight so really no major complaints, but the service is mediocre.

### "food was pretty average for business class"
I recently flew LOT Polish Airlines from the US to Ukraine through Warsaw. I was generally pleased with the experience. The aircraft was well maintained, clean, and comfortable. The 787 features a pretty standard full lie-flat product in Business Class. The service was professional, with cabin crew doing a good job at making sure passengers had what they needed. The food was pretty average for business class - perfectly edible but not anything spectacular. In Warsaw we used both the LOT main lounge outside the Transit Area, as well as the Bolero lounge for transit passengers. We found the LOT lounge to be very comfortable with an excellent selection of food and drink. The Bolero lounge was not as good but still exceeded most of the domestic lounges I've been to in the US. Our short flight from Warsaw to Lviv was excellent, with a full (and very tasty) meal served on the leg. Service was top notch on this regional flight. Overall I would fly LOT again. Warsaw was a very easy airport to transfer through due to its compact size. My main complaint was that ground service needs improvement. The boarding process for LOT is chaotic and I didn't feel that ground staff performed to the same caliber as their peers in the air. That being said, I still found flying through Warsaw an improvement over Frankfurt or Moscow. In summary: Pros: Fleet, lie-flat product, in-flight service, LOT lounge, ease of transferring in Warsaw, price, quality regional flights. Cons: Ground service, lack of on-board WiFi.

### "very tight legroom"
Krakow to Chicago via Warsaw with LOT. I was upset with the seats on the B787. They were uncomfortable and very tight legroom. The restrooms were very dirty and the toilet seats never stayed in place kept closing. I don't know if I would be choose this carrier again. I was told the B787 plane is supposed to be more spacious but they are wrong. The food could have been better.

### "the experience was fine "
I flew LOT Polish Airlines from New York to Warsaw and back in Economy Premium. I bid both ways on Economy Premium and won even though my bid was not that high. I learned the real reason people don't bid for Economy Premium on LOT Polish Airlines. There are crying babies nonstop! They put the babies in the first row directly behind Economy premium so there are three separate babies screaming at all times on a nearly nine hour flight. This happened both coming and going from Warsaw. There are only three rows in Economy premium so the whole section is suffering the entire time. You may also have babies at the front row of Economy premium as well although I had only one going and none going back. LOT Polish Airlines needs to do something about putting so many babies behind Economy Premium (especially three of them all together). Other items would be to remind check-in that Economy Premium receives priority on luggage check-in so you get your bags first. I forgot and suffered waiting twenty minutes at JFK (there are lots of bags on International flights). TV and move selection is fair although if you flew LOT Polish a lot I wonder if you would run out of options. No Wifi, which would be nice when you are at least flying over land. Other than that, I thought the experience was fine and the new 787 was comfortable.

### "not a single smile from cabin crew"
Warsaw to Toronto. Airplane seating comfort, in-flight entertainment, and overall interior look fine. There is okay seat space for long haul flights (9 hours in my case). Customer service is lacking big time. I had a feeling that nobody from the crew is willing to help with anything. I did not see a single smile from the cabin crew during the whole flight not even at exiting the aircraft upon arrival. Cabin crew appears to be unwillingly performing their job duties. They assume by default that all of their passengers are Polish and will speak English only once you tell them several times that you don't understand Polish - some of them had to be told on 3-4 occasions the same thing about language - is that ignorance, I don't know.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Flew LOT Polish Airlines from Warsaw to Tbilisi. Efficient check in with a marginally overweight suitcase. Boarding seemed a little slow but I had a good seat (Emergency Row exit). The seat had been pre-booked for a small premium and I had two seats to myself - this was a bonus. There was no free food or drink but as it was a night flight it was not a significant factor. There was also no IFE but again I wanted to rest. Luggage came quickly off the flight on my arrival in Tbilisi. In summary a basic no frills flight without incident. I enjoyed a good rest because I had chosen a seat with plenty of leg room.

### 'don't expect too much"
Warsaw to Milan. Flight was ok, we departed on time, boarding was completed without any special occurences. The biggest minus is old, little bit dirty and small plane, which wasn't much comfortable. Nevertheless, it's short connection, so it was bearable. Recommended if You don't want to fly with cheap airlines and you find a ticket for a good price. Just don't expect too much. Small plus for chocolate bars served.

### "not hesitate to fly LOT again"
Our flight was late departing JFK, and ground crew told us not to re book our connecting flight from Warsaw to Gdansk. Business class seats full flat and comfortable and the service was excellent. We flew SAS business class in February and that is 15% better but no complains about LOT, nor food or service on board. But we got into trouble in WAW since the flight did not make up the lost time from late departure and we missed our connecting flight to GDA. Business class rep from LOT was less than helpful, she could attempt to re-book us on another flight or go with us to the connecting flight and ask if someone would give up their place for a reward - normal scenario here after all we were going business class. All she did was to offer to have us stay day longer in WAW and maybe take another flight to GDA next day, she also suggested a train - she did not bother to book us on the train, she did not even told us about the train schedule, she just tried to get us out and stop bothering her - bad experience here all around. We submitted all costs related to this involuntary detour and are waiting for LOT to make good on their promise to reimburse us. We would not hesitate to fly LOT again just keep the ground LOT staff away from us- please. Also, what happened to WiFi in business class?

### "poor customer service"
Warsaw to Stockholm. Poor customer service. Website is slow and not user friendly, app is a disaster. Login to my account doesn't help to speed up check in - you still have to have your booking code (some other arlines are so much better in this area). Cabin luggage is checked with no flexibility with small overweight - which can be understand (but not liked). The problem is I was not allowed to take my hand luggage on the board despite weight was ok. There were no possibility at the gate to check real weight and staff member judged on his feeling.

### "food and service were excellent"
I've been going to Eastern Europe every year since 2009, and this is the first time I've flown with Lot Polish Airlines. Although the Flight from Chicago was 30 minutes late (1st July 2016), the flight actually arrived earlier in Warsaw. Seat 2D was very comfortable. Food and service were excellent. The flight attendants were extremely attentive and friendly throughout the flight to Warsaw. Warsaw to Riga was the same. All four pieces of checked-in luggage arrived in Riga without any problems. On the return trip (24th July 2016) Riga to Warsaw, the flight attendant went out of her way to retrieve my hand-carried luggage from the the cart as it was being unloaded from the plane in Warsaw, handed it to me, and directed me to a special van for business class passengers waiting at the tarmac to take us to the terminal. Flight from Warsaw to Chicago was also excellent, food, service and comfortable seat (again 2D). 2 checked-in luggage arrived at O'hare without any problems. All in all, very happy with LOT, and will definitely fly with them again in 2017 going the same route.

### "had to wait 14 hours"
I had to fly back to Italy from Warsaw early in the morning. Late at night, a few hours before the flight, the company called to say that my flight was cancelled (due to unknown reasons). Ok, it can happen, but: the customer service on the phone did know anything about what I had to do and suggested a flight late in the evening via Frankfurt because "there were no other flights". In the morning I went to speak to the ticket office to try to understand how to go home, they said that I was able to take a direct flight in the evening (which was not the first flight to Milan). I had to wait 14 hours and not a single voucher was given to me, I had to pay for water and food. They even denied my refund request. I will never fly with LOT Polish again.

### "a lot less than I expected"
I picked LOT as they offered the most convenient connection between those two cities. The layover in Warsaw was only 60 mins and I managed to make my connecting flight just fine, the airport is well sign-posted and small enough for an hour to be enough if you fly within Schengen. AMS - WAW (ERJ-190) leg on the outbound journey was fine - nothing special and the wine is passable for the price charged. You do get a free chocolate bar and a glass of water after they've passed the cabin with the chargeable items which is a bit cheeky. WAW - KTW (DH8D) was a joke. That aircraft is so noisy you cannot hear the PA announcements made by the cabin crew. As a result of the noise I was left with a huge headache. Inbound journey was more eventful: KTW - WAW (DHC-8-400) - delayed. The noise was horrible again - but it's only 35 mins so fine, I can bear with it. WAW - AMS (Fokker 100). At the gate the LOT people informed us the aircraft was leased from Carpatair. It was an old Fokker in 2x3 configuration and I was sat in the last row just by the engines. So, the noise, again. Flight was delayed for about 15 mins, we boarded the aircraft and then the curtains to the kitchen went shut. We sat there on the tarmac for another 50 mins with no communication from anyone, no drinks or food offered. Finally after another 30 mins of waiting the captain came on and blamed the airport for the delay (which might as well have been true). There was no info from the cockpit mid - flight. Cabin crew was ok but not necessarily over-friendly. The whole experience was a lot less than I expected and I don't think I will fly with them again. If they want to pose as a regular airline, then they need to scrap the chargeable menu and give people food fgs. If they want to be a low - cost airline well, they need staff that are far more attentive then at the moment and better aircrafts. Yes, the seats had on the Fokker were decent (leather, I'd think) and the pitch was good but I don't think I will fly with them again.

### "on the plane we were not fed"
My wife and I flew LOT Polish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Riga via Warsaw airport. Flight to Warsaw was detained almost 2 hours. Because of this, almost missed the flight of the same company in Riga. On the plane we were not fed. The airport of Riga received a broken suitcase. Because of this, we in Riga had to buy a new suitcase.

### "you have to buy food, drinks, etc"
A return trip between Warsaw and Nice. The staff at the airport and onboard were friendly and attentive. The seats were very comfortable, however, they lacked any form of inflight entertainment. The only serious issue, nonetheless, was the price of the ticket. Tickets at this airline are very overpriced. This fact gets even more annoying when you are on board and realise that you have to buy food, drinks, etc. This make me have mixed feelings about recommending this airline to friends.

### "staff attentive to passengers"
Warsaw to Budapest. LOT staff that helped me at check in. The security line appeared was long but only took about 15 minutes. Nice airport, clean and nice stores with standard free wifi. Announcements at the airport are made in Polish and English. There weren't many seats at my gate but I was fine standing. Boarded about 10 minutes late via a bus to the plane, a little crowed but luckily the ride was only a minute. Flight attendant at the entrance of the Bombardier Q400 greeting in Polish and English. The plane was simple but had nice leg room. We took off a little late  and chocolate bars were passed out, staff were attentive to the passengers, the pilot kept us informed. You could also purchase food for a small price.

### "just don't know what they are doing"
Toronto to Warsaw. My first experience was relatively uneventful - the highlights were flat seats in Business where one couldn't lay flat because the total length of the flat seat was most likely around 170cm, and passengers having boarding passes to the same seat in WAW and the mess it created in the airplane. Mediocre service. Mediocre food. Even for the relatively low price this was not a great value - I recall that at the time I thought that taking my first flight on the Boeing 787 wasn't really a good experience. This time (mid-July 2016) I was flying Business class and LOT has outdone itself on all fronts. 3 hr delay in YYZ due to a problem with AC. In WAW, I was nearly declined boarding the connecting code share flight because even though I was checked in through to my final destination, I was not on their passenger list. No one could tell me what was going on. I asked about my luggage and was told about 6 times that it was (a) onboard and (b) no luggage from Toronto was onboard. A complete, unfriendly and hopeless mess partially redeemed only by getting to finally get onboard (after the aircraft waited for me for 20 minutes past its departure time) and enjoying a good Aeroflot Sukhoi plane and excellent service in Business class. I dread going back the same route in a month, and will avoid LOT going forward. They just don't know what they are doing.

### "flying LOT is a living nightmare"
London to Tbilisi via Warsaw. Flying LOT is a living nightmare. Their flights to London Heathrow are notoriously delayed (2-4 hours on the average). LOT, of course, keeps blaming LHR, however their management and a handful of old 737s are to blame for this fiasco. It took me 27 hours to reach the destination (twice in the past four weeks). The first leg was on a rundown 737 with partly broken-down seats, aircon not functioning until we were well airborne and leaking toilets close to where meals were being prepared. The second flights were a tad better but still heavily delayed. Their management should get a grip and take a fast track course how to run an airline. This is simply not sustainable.

### "never fly with LOT again"
New York to Odessa via Warsaw. We purchased our tickets on Feb,20 2016 and were looking forward to our vacation, we also make our seat arrangements - we chose window and middle seat because we are senior citizens and were looking for some comfort on the long flight. When we checked in New York all was fine and our flight was smooth but on the way back we have to deal with big problem : our seats were changed to our big surprise in connected flight and flight to JFK - we try to speak to representative in Warsaw but he told us to be happy that we sit together and biggest surprise was waiting when we see our seats - we were surrounded by 4 toilets, and it was nightmare because traffic to the bathrooms was nonstop during ten hours of flight and we cannot rest for ten minutes - staff pushed us few times with food carts. We paid extra $32 per person that give us chance to choose our seats and we did it five months before our flight - can LOT give us an explanation. we will never fly with LOT again and will never recommend it to my friends.

### "impressed with their seat pitch"
Although these were two very short flights with LOT from Stockholm to Ljubljana via Warsaw, was impressed with their seat pitch in economy. Was very comfortable, both on the E70 and the Dash 8. Moreover, the transfer at Warsaw airport was efficient. A great consideration for European flights.

### "I'm very disappointed"
Tokyo to Wroclaw via Warsaw. I'm very disappointed and I don't think I'll be flying with the airline on this route again. I'm an expat based in Tokyo, and was flying to Poland for a wedding. The flight from Tokyo to Warsaw was delayed few times only to be eventually cancelled. The customers were left to sit at the airport for 8 hours, then transported to a nearby hotel. The cancelation was due to technical issues with the aircraft. They scheduled the same flight for next day 9AM and started to delay it AGAIN a while before boarding, due to similar issues. At this point, the ground staff was doing their best to rebook angry customers onto other flights while the only represnetative of LOT went to have a smoke. I was eventually escorted out of the airport while others were still trying to rebook into other airlines. A warning to other travelers, LOT Boeing 787 aircrafts are infamous for their issues and those incidents made it into national news a few times already.

### "by far the worst airline"
Krakow, Poland to New York City via Warsaw. By far the worst airline I have ever flown. Constant delays and cancellations. Flight attendants that will go hours without offering food or drink. Complete and total incompetence by staff to deal with problems caused by their company. I don't think I've had a single problem free flight with LOT and I have flown with them 10+ times. At one point my flight from New York city to Warsaw was delayed by 4 hours because the plane was late. This caused me to miss my connection flight to Krakow. Instead, they offer me a flight to Katowice (1 hour from Krakow) and a bus to take me to Krakow. I was upset because I purchased a plane ticket, not a bus ticket, but it was my only option. Then the plane to Katowice was delayed by three hours. What did I receive in exchange for my 8 hours of travel becoming 26? A voucher to use at the airport restaurants that was only valid for the cheapest item on the menu (plain pasta with spaghetti sauce is what I got. Avoid LOT at all costs. Pay a few hundred extra to fly through another country. At least then you'll have a comfortable and worthwhile flight.

### "business class very nice"
The LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to New York JFK on the Boeing 787 was spectacular. The business class offerings are very nice and the staff extremely attentive. The cabin is open, lit very well and seats, very comfortable. The IFE at my seat  had a nice selection of movies, flight information, and music.

### "avoid LOT Airlines"
Avoid LOT Airlines. Yes, they are cheap. But save yourself some hassle and pay more. We had an international flight going to Chicago through Warsaw. The boarding process was very unorganized. During the flight, the staff was very rude. They spoke Polish and were hesitant to switch to English. Upon arrival to Chicago, we discovered that both of our bags were damaged and were torn. There was nobody present at the LOT lost baggage kiosk , so we had to go one floor up to the LOT check-in desk. Instead of taking care of us right there at the check-in desk, LOT personnel sent us to a gate to wait for their colleague who could assist us. They directed us to a gate that does not exist in that terminal. After 20 minutes, we just left. We were done. It was almost 10 o'clock in the evening, we had an 8-hour flight and we had 4-hours of driving ahead of us. When I contacted LOT customer service the very next day, LOT asked to present original receipts for the suitcase (from the date they were bought) and a verified estimate of how much it would cost to repair our bags. Only upon submission of those 2 documents, LOT would consider whether to reimburse us or not.

### "cheaper than standard Economy"
I fly frequently on Vienna to Warsaw route and chose Premium Economy as it was cheaper than standard Economy on specific dates flown. My expectations were pretty low as Economy on LOT is no-frills - but Premium Eco was the opposite. You sit in the C section of the cabin and you get food and beverages. Flight staff most friendly and it was a real pleasure. Will go for this service again. The E195 aircraft is pleasant to travel in.

### "avoid this dreadful airline"
Prague to Larnaca via Warsaw with LOT Polish. This is the most atrocious airline I've ever experienced, in every possible way. On my way to Prague, the second flight was cancelled because of an engine failure. The plane took off from Warsaw and landed back in Warsaw after 2 hours of circling. When returning, the first leg of the flight was delayed by 2 hours meaning I would arrive 1 hour later than my connecting flight's departure. No staff had a clue at the airport, nor their call centre, no apologies, no compensation, no explanation, no solution. I had to pay €500 for an emergency flight on Aegean, at least to make sure I would get back in one piece. Avoid this dreadful airline at all costs.

### "will never use this airline again"
LOT Polish Airlines post frequent domestic flights and then cancel them right before the departure (happened to me and my wife 2 times during our visit to Poland from Katowice to Warsaw and Warsaw to Katowice) which is a deliberate way to attract more customers and then put all passengers from canceled flights on to one flight. They also postponed my flight to New York JFK from Warsaw by 3 hours without any explanations. I will never use this airline again and will rather pay more to other airline than deal with them.

### "she can't see our tickets"
Toronto to Paris via Warsaw with LOT Polish. Booked award flight through Aeroplan. Usually we never print out tickets, just check in with passport. Not with LOT Polish, the check in lady insisted that she can't see our tickets and need our eticket numbers. So keep this in mind! Aeroplan has tendency also to send itinerary change emails/ change of eticket number. Perhaps disconnect of communication between Aeroplan and LOT. Other than that, Do not hesitate to fly in business class.

### "Seating comfortable"
LOT for a roundtrip from Vienna to Tbilisi via Warsaw. All four sectors were Embraer aircraft. Seating comfortable and there is a lot of space between seats. Food and drinks have to be purchased, only a tiny bar of chocolate and a cup of water are served free of charge. Due to heavy wind the trip from Tbilisi to Warsaw lasted 40 minutes longer than scheduled, and I would definitely have missed my connection to Vienna but - during the descent to Warsaw the purser invited me to sit down in the first row of the aircraft. So I was out of the cabin quickly and ground staff speeded up my transfer through immigration and security control. I reached my connection to Vienna with a ground time of only 15 minutes. Last surprise of this trip: Even the luggage made it to Vienna on the same plane.

### "would definitely fly LOT again"
Flew LOT Polish Airlines on a domestic flight from Warsaw to Krakow. Overall I found the whole experience very recommendable. Staff were quite friendly and the flight was on time. Fare purchased was €45 for the domestic lasting 31 minutes, better than other travel options with a nice schedule. Legroom was adequate and service consisted of a complimentary chocolate bar and tea or coffee. I would definitely fly LOT again.

### "didn't care for the food"
Toronto to Prague via Warsaw with LOT. The downside was the significant (almost 6 hour) layover in Warsaw on my outbound journey, but I was willing to make the sacrifice for the savings. The business class seat is full lie-flat seat with a very roomy interior and 1x2x1 configuration in the B787. I didn't care for the food, and I only ate one of the meals as the options in the menu sounded unappealing. The lounge in Warsaw was pleasant, though I did get bored waiting so long. One of LOT's agents suggested I go see the city in the long wait period I had, but I didn't want to be lugging around my laptop everywhere or risk getting lost or delayed in the snow-covered city in January. I should add that the second flight I had from Warsaw to Prague, was on a pathetic old plane with European style business class seating which just entails blocking a normal economy seat beside be, but I couldn't care less as the flight was just an hour long and easy to zone out.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew Warsaw to Beijing both ways with LOT Polish Airlines. My first flight on board 787. The first impression was nice, as there was much more space in overhead compartments than in smaller aeroplanes to put luggage and the window brightness was regulated. AVOD was also fine - the only flaw being silent sound at some movies, even when volume was set to maximum. Food tasty with a choice of meals. The weakest point was lack of free alcoholic beverages. The seats were comfortable, but a bit cramped (could have been much better, especially given how they praise them in TV commercials). Most of the staff were nice, though older attendants seemed to be annoyed and weren't very helpful. Overall pleasant experience.

### "comfortable 7 hour flight"
Chicago to Warsaw with LOT Polish. Unfriendly staff, cold and poor food. A smooth flight, little leg room but comfortable seats. Quiet cabin. Overall, a comfortable 7 hour flight. No delays and a friendly captain who kept us updated throughout the flight. The entertainment options were very limited, with only 30 movies, 6 of which I thought were relevant. The beverage options were vast and served fresh.

### "the seats are far better"
After flying the outbound leg of the my LOT Polish Airlines trip on economy, which was not terribly comfortable, I  upgraded to Premium Economy to end my vacation. The seats are far better with excellent leg room and width. The service and food top notch, a welcome kit, drinks and more attentive service. While it costs more and may not be something you do every time you fly, I highly recommend it if you can.

### "would not travel again"
I flew twice from New York to Warsaw in LOT Polish Airlines business class. My TV was broken on the way and my seat was broken on the return. The cabin crew was unfriendly and almost bothered to be asked something. Customer service regarding damaged luggage is unsatisfying. (Broken suitcase on both trips). I was not expecting such experience and service travelling business class. Would not travel again.

### "flight attendant were very rude"
This was a charter flight from Krabi to Warsaw but the crew and flight attendants was from LOT Polish Airlines. I was dissapointed the flight attendant were very rude if you want something they do it with discouragement. The food was horrible. But the seat was full flat so confort of sleeping was perfect. The inflight enterteinment was not as good as other Star Alliance airlines.

### "incredibly low price"
I booked this journey as part of LOT's opening specials for the Tokyo route at an incredibly low price. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have considered them. LOT business class gets you Star Alliance miles, and is a really great product. Food far better than LH, relatively attentive and very curteous service, plenty of room and pretty comfortable seats. Decent IFE. The cabin design is pretty bland and the seat covers should be exchanged for a more exciting design than grey and blue stripes.

### "we feel pretty let down"
Although the flight out to Warsaw was good, the flight back to London was a complete nightmare, which was not helped by the staff on this flight. The company changed loads of things including the advertised plane we were flying on and their complaints people take up to 4 weeks to respond (if at all). Poland really needs to move into this century when it comes to customer service. Having said that if we did not have a young baby I would fly from Heathrow with them again, mainly because its a better airport, less distance to walk and the all round passenger quality/service was better (when we did not have a baby). However until our child is guaranteed not to cry we will use an airline which has more understanding staff and passengers, as with lots of Polish people seem to still bear the mentality of "I'm alright mate, sod everyone else", which is also apparent with the crew on my flight. Myself and my wife booked seats right at the back at a cost of GBP15 each (I think). We booked separately, but chose the back as we have a 4 month old baby. I had no email confirmation at all and we had no emails to check in/allocation of seats. When printing out the ticket 24 hours before, my wife's seat had been changed to 8C which is the other end of the plane! Changing our paid seating numbers without any prior notification is against the agreement we made with LOT. We chose the very back to be of least torment to passengers with our baby and he was very restless. The seat I ordered was the right seat, but it was not a Boeing 737 as listed on the ticket but an Embraer 190 which has 4 seats per row rather than 6, so instead of me actually being at the back I was also placed in a completely different seat, with no notice. Our baby was very restless and this plane only has one small toilet and very limited space in the back area, so we had to try and comfort him sitting down much to the annoyance of other passengers. We tried our best, but if it was the plane advertised then there would have been 2 toilets and much more room at the back, so it would have been easier. On boarding the plane, there were many business class and "priority boarding" customers. We were the only ones with a baby and were told to wait until everyone (approx. 30 people) had boarded (despite paying for our seats "at the back"). Our baby was screaming and the attendant was just ignoring my wifes polite requests (she is Polish). So much so several of the other passengers started to protest to her in our defence. She eventually begrudgingly let us through. The attendant was also not helpful. My wife was trying to stop him crying and she made her sit down, which made things worse. During the fasten seatbelt sign (turbulence) she let about 10 people go up and use the toilet without making them sit down! This is dangerous, I have never seen this on any other airline in 30 years of travelling! The main thing is that we were not given the service we were promised as LOT changed the plane, changed the seats, I had no confirmation and we had no other communications. The staff were not very supportive - we feel pretty let down really!

### "attendants were very welcoming and open"
LOT Polish Airlines, Paris-Tbilisi via Warsaw. The flight attendants were very welcoming and open, and helped people's questions about tight connections. The flight from Paris to Warsaw was 2 hours. No food offered. European flights operate a "LOT Gourmet" service, where food and drinks could be purchased. Water and vafeles are free and offered once at the beginning of the flight. Warsaw–Tbilisi flight takes 3.5 hours and the same "LOT Gourmet" service with exactly the same limited choice. I advise that the management of LOT introduce on routes to Caucasus and the Middle East - My Premium Menu which is the new offer from LOT for routes between Warsaw and Beijing, New York, Chicago and Toronto. You can upgrade your meal (economy class) at the time of booking with additional payment. We are travelling 6-7 hours entire route (Paris-Tbilisi) with 45 minutes stopover in Warsaw and we are not able to eat. I believe that this will attract more passengers.

### "uncomfortable seats"
Toronto to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines was the worst experience I have had. The cabin crew are not friendly, rude, and grumpy. Communication is bad - the plane was 2 hours late for boarding and they weren't updating us about what was going on. Food wasn't appropriate for all passengers - they served ham sandwiches for breakfast unless you request something else ahead of time. Flight was uncomfortable, tight and uncomfortable seats for a long ride (7 hours).

### "nice cabin staff"
Odessa to Stockholm via Warsaw, flying with LOT Polish Airlines for my first time. Clean and fresh cabin. Good feeling in the seat, good legs space. Tasty meal and a cool beer. Black swedish type of coffee. Positive and nice cabin staff.

### "seats old, worn out and quite dirty"
Warsaw to London Heathrow with LOT Polish Airlines. Smooth checking at LOT Zone at Warsaw Airport, very nice Lounge, great selection of food and beverages. Flight was on time, landed 15 mins ahead of schedule. Old 737-400 and it shows. A lot of legroom, but seats are old, worn out and some are quite dirty. Lighs were blinking during the flight, overhead lights did not work at all. Paid service in Economy, good selection, very cheap prices. One of the crew members got into quite a loud and upleasent discussion about credit card payment with one of the passengers. Seconds after landing some passengers stood up and started to open luggage bins, taking bags out, walking, hardly balancing while plane was still taxing, but cabin crew did not react at all. Quite unprofessional. Very good cabin announcements from cabin crew, but you could not understand anything from pilot's PA.

### "poor customer service"
The only positive comment about this LOT Polish Airlines flight is new Boeing 787. The, flight was delayed 2hrs out of Warsaw because captain decided to wait for 2-3 connecting people - never seen anything like that in the past. Most people who were on time for this flight missed their connecting flights out of Chicago. Ground staff for LOT in ORD didn't do anything to rebook my Spirit flight I have to purchase a new flight on my own for next day. I wrote a complain to refund me a ticket or at least credit me a next flight with them with in the year - nothing. Terrible airline, poor customer service, never again.

### "a comfortable experience"
Cabin crew professional and and attentive. Made sure to save a row for me and my friend as we were separated, and recommended places to go in Warsaw for a guys night out. Sale onboard is half priced compared to many other airlines out of CPH, so all in all a comfortable experience.

### "service is uninspired"
I flew from LOT Polish Airlines Munich to Krakow via Warsaw. The MUC-WAW leg was ok, although not great. What happened on the WAW-KRK leg was outrageous. We boarded the Q400 on time. Takeoff was commenced and then suddenly aborted at high speed. The pilot announced that there were problems with the hydraulic controls of the plane. We were then bussed to another Q400 waiting on the apron, including the crew. Boarded again, started the takeoff run again, and aborted again at high speed for technical reasons. Even the cabin crew looked scared. We were then dumped at the terminal, with the flight cancelled for the day due to a lack of equipment (no wonder with two Q400 sitting inoperable on the tarmac). Finally, we were asked to go to the transfer terminal, where we were booked on a later flight, which had been upgraded to a ageing Boeing 737 to accomodate all the waiting passengers. This flight was an hour late, but at least it finally got us to Krakow. Besides all this, the airline feels decidedly second rate. Cabin service is uninspired, no free beverages except for lukewarm water. Not the kind of service you come to expect from a Star Alliance Carrier. I flew Aegean Airlines earlier this year, another Star Alliance Member, and they were way superior to LOT. So if you have alternatives to LOT: take them.

### "had to wait 26 hours"
Stockholm to Odessa via Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. First flight to Warsaw began OK. After a while captain said that due to foggy weather he had to go to Gdansk. There we stood waiting for two hours. The plane was filled with petrol but our stomachs didn't seem so important. When we later started to Warsaw they said they wanted to give us a cup of coffee or tea for free. When they came to me I said I wanted to order a sandwich but it was impossible. I said I must eat but they didn't have anything. I told I had an important business meeting in Odessa and some minutes later she came back and told me that flight to Odessa should wait for me. In Warsaw I was running to gate 21. They had never seen a pensioner running so fast at this airport. When I came to the gate door was locked and nobody there. Why they promised when they couldn't hold it. The plane was still at building and they had to wait only for some seconds. Had to wait 26 hours on their next flight.

### "weakest link of Star Alliance"
Prague to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. No online check in available from numerous destination including Prague. This problem lasts for more than 2 months despite numerous promises. Simple IT fix is taking ages which results in passangers need to arrive to airport 45 minutes earlier than necesarry. Really annoying. No beverages on this flight (other airlines with cheaper tickets provide beverages). Weakest link of Star Alliance, stay away!

### "expected to get at least a cup of tea"
I decided to try LOT Polish Airlines from London Heathrow to Warsaw to 8 September because of the convenient departure time. This was a mistake, as the flight was delayed by almost three hours forcing me to cancel meetings. I knew that LOT doesn't serve free meals anymore but expected to get at least a cup of tea considering the delay. Not a chance, unless I pay PLN 8 (about $3). Turns out LOT Polish Airlines only have three 737s in their fleet, so a delay by one of the planes spills over the entire schedule.

### "my experience has been very positive"
Amsterdam to Toronto via Warsaw on LOT Polish Airlines. Fast check-in at Amsterdam Airport, but the flight to Warsaw was delayed by one hour. A tasty meal served onboard the aircraft, an E195. The second flight was with a Boeing 787. Boarding drinks served. Lunch offered appetiser, salad, entree and cheese and dessert selection. It had a distinctive Polish touch. There was espresso coffee after the meal too. The meal served before landing was bigger than what I had experienced before across the Atlantic. The seats in Business Class on the 787 were wide, comfortable and can transform into full-flat beds. The crew was friendly and professional. The in-flight entertainment could be improved in my view. All-in-all, my experience with LOT Polish Airlines has been very positive.

### "smooth boarding and on-time flights"
Gdansk to Milan via Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. Easy and efficient check-in, smooth boarding process and on-time flights. The crew worked hard but were not particularly friendly. On the first flight a chocolate bar and water were served free, on the second flight refreshments were for payment only. At Warsaw the domestic flight was parked at a remote stand - otherwise airbridges were used. The seats were comfortable with plenty of legroom.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
If you are a foreigner that doesn't speak Polish this is the best way of domestic transport within Poland. Polish airports are generally in good shape and staff speak english (unlike staff at trainstations). I've flown the E-jets and Q400s and they are equally comfortable. The Q400s are very loud however, and LOT does not distribute earplugs before the flight so if you are annoyed by high noises you might want to bring your own or noiseblocking headphones. Otherwise this is a very affordable and fast travel within Poland. There is no business class on domestic routes but if you do a online check-in 24hrs before the flight you can easily choose the first-row seats without extra charge.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
I flew LOT on routes WRO-YYZ and YYZ-WRO, both flights via WAW. The WRO-WAW flights were domestic flights operated by turboprop Dash-8 Q400. Those flights were short, only meal on board was a small candy bar and sour jellies. WAW is a quite good connecting airport with realistic 30 min MCT. Only issue was security control between non-schengen and schengen zone, as the security staff was rude and unhelpful. Flights WAW-YYZ and return operated by 787 were rather comfortable, 787 planes are quite new, so the interiors aren't too bad. Seats are narrow, but comfortable. The space above the head while seating on the window seat can be disappointing if you are tall person, because of the shape of fuselage. Staff is the weakest LOT's point, flight attendants aren't helpful, uncivil, they're not smiling at all. Meals were much better than the Air Canada's on the same route, suprisingly organic. LOT's IFE is nothing special, some "fresh" Hollywood's blockbusters, some classic films and some polish movies, choice of music is disappointing. Overall, LOT on long-haul flights isn't better, but it isn't worse than other airlines like Lufthansa, Air Canada etc. Great thing is a convenience of 30 min WAW transfer, it's better MCT than most airports in Europe.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
I flew LOT on July 28th from Sofia to Chicago trough Warsaw. They canceled the flight Warsaw - Chicago and made us claim our baggage and go to a hotel. I was alone with my 10 months old baby. They did not do much to find another flight for all the people left there, and many, such as me, stayed at Warsaw for 2 days. Finally, on July 30th we were on the plane. Nothing was as I have seen before. The crew members were rude, everything I asked for was accepted with unpleasant facial expressions. The food was awful and obviously not enough because I was offered a different meal of that I wanted. The biggest problem came when I found out that they put wet blankets in the bassinet where my baby slept. Never had issues with such unprofessionalism from any other airline.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
We bought 3 return tickets for the trip Toronto to Zagreb via Warsaw. Going to Zagreb no problem, but coming back we were forced by LOT Polish Airlines to leave our vacation a day earlier as LOT Polish Airline canceled our flight from Zagreb to Warsaw, which supposed to be perfect connection to Toronto and all happened with verbal "Sorry and apology". We should leave Zagreb at 1pm on July 22nd and arrive same day at Warsaw at 3pm or so and leave at 4:45pm to Toronto, when LOT has changed our flight back, they said we have only option to leave with early flight from Zagreb (which made us come to Zagreb from our hometown Vukovar which is 3.5 hours away from Zagreb airport and use hotel over night). So LOT Polish Airline put us on that 8am flight to Vienna and from Vienna to Warsaw with 5 hours of waiting time at Warsaw airport. After we talked to LOT representative she said that this is the best option and after we asked for hotel and any credit, she advise us to sent email to their claim department which did not really care about what happened. After 3 email exchanged we learned that this company, Lot Polish Airline is not worth to be used ever in the future.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Flight WAW to ORD July 24. Food service was very rushed. Flight attendants poorly trained to cater to business class passengers in terms of attention to service requests. Very stingy with hard liquors, will only serve couple of drinks during dinner service and will purposly ignore any more request. Food average. You have to ask for everything, nothing is ever offered even water. Looks like saving on liquids including liquor and water was their main goal. Magnificent aircraft especially in business class too bad crew in business class is not properly trained.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Just a short trip of about an hour but the flight was good. Our 4 year old was given a puzzle book and some pencils. Water and a wafer bar was provided. Cabin crew were friendly enough. Check-in was extremely slow though. 3 counters open with a short queue and it still took 20+ minutes. Counter staff seem to move very slowly!

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
My flight from Kishinev to Toronto was cancelled and the alternative that they offered was not acceptable. Instead of 1 transfer, they offered 2 transfers with 7 hours waiting in Vienna. I was travelling with a 9 month old baby and LOT were not at all understanding.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Warsaw to Toronto on July 1, 2015 with LOT Polish Airlines. My experience is very poor. The entertainment system did not work properly. I had to ask for another headphone. I waited for about 15-20 minutes, and when I noted this duration to the attendant, the answer was: "we are preparing food, we are busy"  My girlfriend waited for about 40 minutes for a glass of water to take a medication. The sign that indicates need of help was on in both cases above, but seemed nobody cared. Delay in flight due to computer issue for about 1,5 hour. The captain indicated the issues, but when it got fixed, he never assured the passengers that everything was alright. LOT should consider that people on economy class receive at least average standard service.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Nice to have Boeing 787 on this short flight instead of usual old 737. However the seats in Economy are very narrow with quite limited legroom. If you are over 180cm/6 ft tall, you may find it very uncomfortable. LOT has a food for purchase in Economy, but selection is quite good (sandwiches, salads, snacks, hot meals), and soft and alcoholic drinks. Eveything is cheap, and for large sandwich, beer and coffee I paid 28 PLN, which is 6 Euro/9 USD. Water and chocolate wafer is for free. Good IFE with around 40 movies and many tv shows. The only downpoint of this flight was some cabin crew. Some were nice and smiling, some looked very grumpy, with basic English skills or not talkative at all, answering with "no", "yes" only. Sometimes the word "please" would be apreciated. Generally, good flight, but some cabin crew must remember who pays their salaries and treat us with respect.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
This airline has embraced the worst airbus space limits for customers in economy class. You have no chance to rest on this airplane. They have 9 rows instead of 8 as other Star Alliance flights. My shoulders and elbows were in continuous touch with my neighbors. Leg space is horrible. It's a real torture to fly with this type of plane. This was my first and last experience with this airline. They do not respect Silver status for a Star Alliance member. They did not allow me to drop my baggage to the priority counter indicating that they recognize only Silver more (which I have never heard of before). They are part of Star Alliance and do not respect the rules.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
We did a round trip. I am gluten-intolerant and requested gluten-free meals. The first one, dinner, was good, I was very pleased. The "breakfast" consisted of two muffins and fruit. No butter or jelly! And I paid $15 for that! On the way back our flights changed and I didn't know I was supposed to confirm the gluten-free meals. Therefore, they didn't have any for me. The flight attendants were very helpful though, they brought me a vegetarian meal that was not claimed for one meal and for the second one they put together a meal for me - mostly salads, fruit, and nuts. I was pleased with the service and that they went above-and-beyond to provide me with the meals I needed. I can't say enough about the good service. We brought back three adopted boys who spoke only Polish and the attendants were very patient in answering their questions since we could not understand them.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
FRA-WAW-ODS. Two short hops on LOT on smaller jets. Was run like a low cost airline: Just a cup of water and chocolate but the seats were comfortable and no IFE. Staff are friendly. A food and beverage cart run down the aisle charging about 2 bucks for drinks and snacks and almost no one bought anything. I wonder if they flushed all the coffee down the toilet at the end of the flight? I don't think the model is cost effective for Poland. Probably more coffee and tea wasted than paid for by customers. Flights left and arrived on time. Flights booked with mileage points so no idea as to value. I needed a good connection between Frankfurt and Odessa and this was one of them.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
ARN-WAW-JFK. First time connecting through WAW and first time flying LOT I did not quite know what to expect. Arrived in WAW on time had no trouble at all finding the gate. WAW overall seemed fresh and nice with free WiFi and a lot of power outlets even loading stations if you forgot your iphone charger. The boarding process was pretty smooth and we pushed back with a 15 min delay. As for the flight this was my first time on a 787 and I loved it. The plane is very quiet and looks great big nice windows with a dimming-function I've never encountered before. The IFE was alright a very good selection of Hollywood movies however if you are a movie geek like me you've might have seen some of the finest picks. The seat comfort was OK. Good amount of leg space seat was fairly comfortable and the tables where very functional. The food was fine nothing special really but I wasn't flying hungry or thirsty. Overall the service on the plane was really good the flight attendants always had a smile on their face and were quick to assist you if you needed anything. We arrived at JFK 20min before scheduled time. Bottom line I would not hesitate to fly with LOT again especially when their prices are generally lower then Lufthansa or KLM.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
The seat comfort of the new Boeing Dreamliner is very poor there is no comfort foam in the seat cushions it feels right away very hard and after two or three hours it hurts if you have to fly 11 hours? This is a very poor (economy class) passenger seat design of Boeing the thin seat cushions are not finished with durable comfort foam. It will probably be resistant of 16 or 20 G but there is absolutely no passenger comfort in the seat cushion of the Dreamliner.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
This was the first time flying with LOT in many years and I have to say they have upped the ante. Flew PRG-WAW- ORD. First segment was on a comfortable E175 with excellent service. Second segment was the game-changer. 787 Dreamliner in Business Class. The cabin was maybe half full - the service was absolutely stellar. They provided sheets for the fully lay flat seat after the best meal which was delicious. I had requested a vegetarian meal which come out perfectly but also wanted to try the Vegetable Moussaka which was served for dinner so they let me have one of those as well. They served a nice selection of champagne and wine came around the cabin offering their special Black Currant Vodka which we tried and which was delicious. We finished our dinner with two glasses of Polish mead. The attention to detail in the cabin was what impressed me. They would only cross over in the galley even though the first row of seats in the middle were empty. Upon deplaning they all had their positions in the cabin from which they said goodbye. My favorite J seat across the Atlantic is usually on the 747-800i with Lufthansa and I have to admit - this was completely on par with that. Frankfurt has more connections to the rest of Europe but if the times and connections are right I would very happily and very well will most likely fly with LOT in the future. This was a ticket just so I could try out the 787 which I hadn't flown yet but I was so impressed with LOT's service it's going on my list of preferred airlines. Well done to the J cabin crew and purser LO 3 on April 6 WAW-ORD.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Warsaw-JFK on Dec 20. B787 Dreamliner. Beautiful quiet and very spacious airplane. Full flight but seats are ok good legroom however aisles are narrow and you may end up bumping other passengers while passing by. Flight was delayed 25 mins but we landed on time. Service was ok first drinks trolley then meals (chicken with potatoes or pasta bolognese) Greek salad some cheese and meat cuts bread rolls and chocolate waffle followed by cold and hot drinks. Alcohol is for purchase but prices are affordable (wine and spirits 10 PLN = 2 Euro) same as mid- flight snacks. Before landing very smart box with sandwich fruit salad and chocolates was served followed by drinks. Generally food was ok. Many rounds with water during the flight. Very nice and attentive cabin crew. Decent IFE system personal screens no issues however only around 40 movies 50 CDs and 7 TV shows may not be enough for some to choose from. To conclude good flight fantastic airplane and nice crew.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
BEG-WAW and WAW-TBS. E170 on first leg. Rudimentary service consisting only of a glass of water and a choco- waffle. The only choices you had was between still and sparkling water. Still ok for such a short flight. Legroom was superb like on an A330. In-flight magazine of very poor quality. Second leg on E190. It was a more comfortable plane but exactly the same service on a 4-hours long flight. Got offered a pillow and a blanket for the night flight what was a nice surprise. Plane was full. There were some unruly Polish passengers on-board. All in all I would fly LOT only if their price is the same or slightly above the low-costs on the same route.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
We flew economy plus during October 2014. The aircraft was a Dreamliner 787. If you are a middle passenger or an inside one you are in big trouble. You cannot get out of the seat unless you step on the aisle seat. While comfortable when seated it is impossible to get out or move around. The aisles are narrow and barely passable without bumping a passenger. Regular economy must have felt like cattle without the amenities that we at least got in economy plus. Unless you can get an aisle or adjoining aisles with a partner or the bulk head don't book a ticket.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
LHR-WAW-LHR 23/24 October on 787 Dreamliner. It was a trek to the gate in the new Terminal 2 but had priority boarding so went straight on. Boarding took some time to complete but I suspect that was due to passengers turning up late. Took off about 40 minutes delayed but made it up on the way and arrive about 10 minutes late. Outbound sat in 6G premium class cabin. Very comfortable seating and sufficient legroom. Although this was a short haul flight I would quite happily endure a long haul flight in this seat. The service was excellent. Very efficient and friendly cabin crew. IFE was good if a little limited; would like to have had more choice of music and movies. Choice of hot meal and snacks as well as drinks - all very tasty. Inbound in business class cabin seat 1D. Extremely comfortable seat which reclines flat. Controls simple to use but a bit of a pain taking the IFE monitor out of the center console (other seats in rows 2 & 3 have their monitors in the back of the seat in front. Cabin crew excellent the kind of efficient service you'd expect flying first class. Choice of meal snacks & drinks also excellent. Took off around 30 minutes delay but landed before scheduled time.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Chicago to Warsaw was delayed for more than 1hour however this delay is nothing compared to what happened next on my flight from Poznan to Krakow connecting at Warsaw. First they held us at the Poznan airport for more than 2 hours without a clear explanation. Flight was then cancelled and there were no more flights to Warsaw at that day. Very close to midnight and the airline representative told us that we could take a 4-hour bus ride to Warsaw otherwise there is not much they can do. The bus is fully packed and they did not provide any food or drinks during the entire 4-hour journey. After we arrived at Warsaw airport at about 4.30 am we asked about our connecting flight to Krakow and they told us there is no flight available today for us. So that means they basically dumped us at Warsaw airport without any further arrangement. I had to take a taxi going to train station and took another 4 hour train ride to finally get to Krakow. All in all my first experience with LOT is absolutely horrible and I will avoid flying with them in the future at all cost. LOT appears to stand for "lots of trouble". They treat their customers as third-class and the words "customer service" are definitely not in their vocabulary. Stay away from them if you can!

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
WAW-LHR LO 279 October 16th in C-Class LOT is using its 787 Dreamliners on this route at the moment which was a nice surprise. C-Class seating is flat-bed and very comfortable and spacious. As a nice treat LOT offers its long-haul meal service scheme in business class on this short-haul flight. Very decent Do&Co Catering dishes served individually at each seat no tray-service. In any case a nice idea how to promote the long-haul product to potetial clients. Crew service exceptionally friendly and polite as usually on LOT. Excellent value for money and in terms of the overall product impression for sure on par with LH LX and OS.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
12 - 21 Sep. LO0046 LO0537 LO0536 LO0045. 1) Online check in and manage your reservation: More and more people like to do online check in or just avoid the long wait at the airport and check in at the airport at the automated kiosks. With LOT you do not have the option to check in and print your boarding pass and luggage tags at the airport kiosk. I did check in online but the wait at the airport to drop your luggage was unusually long. 2) Seats: The New Dreamliner's seats are tight and I'm not a big guy. It was uncomfortable to travel 8 hours half hanging out of my seat. 3) Meals: When they served the meals all 3 of us asked for chicken but all 3 of us got beef. 4) Drinks: I don't really drink but when I saw that the gentleman beside me handing over money to the stewardess I asked him for what and he advised me that they charge for alcohol. I have not traveled with an airline long haul where you have to pay for your drinks. 5) Customer Service: Returning back from Poland we got into a bad weather one of the stewardesses was passing by and I asked her for a drink. Her answer rudely was that I had to go to the back of the plane and get it myself and she just walked away. I went to the back where there was 4 stewardesses chatting away. If the service had been better I would recommend this airline.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
17 September Bucharest - Krakow with a stop in Warsaw. The plane left 40 minutes late from Bucharest causing us to miss the connection to Krakow. In Chopin airport LOT personnel had no idea what to do. We had to wait 3-hours until to the next flight - the service on the planes are similar to a low cost airline. They offer a glass of water and chocolate. The plane to Krakow had a delay of 35 minutes so we reached Krakow around 1am instead of 9pm. Return 26 September 2014 the same scenario repeated. The plane from Krakow to Warsaw had 35 minutes delay announced at the time of the boarding. We had only 40 minutes stop in Warsaw. Luckily for us we weren't the only passengers missing that flight since they had other passengers coming from Gdansk and other cities with LOT with delays. LOT connection to Bucharest waited for all these passengers. I will never fly with this company again and I would never recommend to anyone. Better fly with low cost and at least you know what to expect: bad services no food delays noisy and old airplanes. And do not expect to understand what the crew is speaking to you in English.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Flew LHR-WAW and WAW-AMS on LOT got mixed feelings about the airline. The flight from LHR to WAW was an outdated B734 with a real tight seat-pitch and narrow seats I was glad that the middle seat was free. What really concerned me was the fact that there is practically nothing complimentary anymore. A glass of water and a chocolate bar that's it! Crew seemed outdated but were friendly and always correct. The way back from initially WAW-LHR-AMS had been rebooked to the non-stop flight on ER195 better seat-pitch and seats and far more comfortable aircraft but same no frills service scheme as on the London flight.

AMS-WAW in Business. I used the LOT Upgrade option to jump from Economy to Business for USD100 and it was well worth it. The Lounge LOT uses in Amsterdam is the KLM Lounge which is good as it is better than the other options. Flight was on time on an Embraer190 priority boarding respected. Very polite and helpful service on board (no objections to change seat to first row). As this is a short haul flight Business is the same configuration as Economy with adjacent seat blocked. Food really tasty hot cold drinks and alcohol served throughout flight. For this price a perfect solution.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Flew LHR to WAW on an old 737-400. Flight was over 3hrs late due to "operational problems". LOT provided a£10 refreshment voucher but that was it. Minimal apologies and when the cabin crew did apologise it didn't seem genuine. Landed after midnight by which time I had missed my connecting flight to Bydgoszcz with Eurolot. Please be warned that Eurolot is now separate to LOT and neither airline cared that I had missed the flight. I was stranded in Warsaw (even missed the last bus and train). Had to fork out for a hotel myself. No help whatsoever from LOT even after speaking to the LOT representative on the ground. Avoid this airline at all costs! They behave like a low-cost airline. You even have to pay for food on board. All you get is a glass of lukewarm water and a small chocolate bar.

Tel Aviv - Warsaw - Wroclaw and back. TLV - WAW with Embraer 195 WAW-WRO-WAW with Embraer 175 WAW-TLV with Boeing 737-400. Embraer planes are very comfortable. Boeing 734 worn out. Good leg space flights on time crew mostly friendly. Since August 2013 there's practically no service on board. All one gets is a chocolate covered wafer and water! Even on the 4-hour flight from Tel Aviv to Warsaw (not to mention the 3 hours spent at the airport). More (sandwiches salads drinks beverages sweets) is available but one must pay. Needless to say ticket costs full price. LOT offers free meals only on flights lasting above 6 hours. That's a great pity! I loved LOT and used to fly with them 2-4 times a year. Now I only take them when I need to get to Poland. On the TLV- WAW route El Al offers by far a much better service (for - more or less - the same price).

Flew Warsaw to Heathrow 14th July on LO285. Delayed almost 2hrs so LOT dumped me my wife and two young kids at Heathrow at 23.45hrs after the last tube had left. Office was shut no-one available anywhere. Choice was a nightbus to somewhere in north London with a vague hope of getting home at some point or a taxi. We spent £120 on a taxi to Hertfordshire. I'd suggest Ryanair at least you know they'll dump on you. I thought a scheduled airline would be more considerate of its customers but apparently not.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
I flew from BRU to WAW and back. Flights on time. Check-in in BRU inefficient. Reactions of the crew unkind - upon entrance they were unpleasantly surprised that they had to greet me in English instead of standard Polish. The same for other requests. I got a sour reaction when I asked whether I need to pay for drinks which turned out to be inexpensive (Coke for 1 EUR) but it should be clear even without asking. Seats comfortable. Poor inflight magazine.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew from London to Warsaw on flight LO282 on Friday 4 July. We were surprised to be only offered a glass of water by way of refreshment. Only by reading the inflight magazine did we find that economy passengers had to pay for anything else. On arrival at Warsaw we had to stand by the belt for nearly 50 minutes before our bags arrived. During this time passengers were asking what the problem was only to be told that a number of planes had landed and it was a very busy time. This did not explain why bags from flights operated by other airlines were on the belts and being reclaimed by passengers. LOT should dispense with their baggage handling company at Warsaw and employ one of the other companies which clearly know what they are supposed to do.

CPH to VNO via WAW on 9th July 2014. Two short flights both on the Embraer 175. Plenty of legroom and seat width. The head rest can be adjusted to your needs. There was a little delay but landed on time in VNO. Staff on board very helpful and smiling. Got Water and chocolate bar for free while drinks and food was for purchase at very reasonable prices. WAW Chopin airport is bright and clean but beware it is very badly sign-posted. There are also very limited options for eating and shopping worth taking into consideration for a long layover. Will definitely fly LOT again.

An excellent flight from Frankfurt to Toronto. The food was outstanding one of the best in economy class we have had. Much better than the airlines that fly FRA-YYZ non-stop.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
JFK-WAW-JFK. The food: In my experience if you book online and request a special meal on your ticket you're good to go right? Wrong! With LOT apparently you have to call ahead and make sure they got your message. I failed to do that so on the flight from JFK to WAW I ended up eating only rice. The meat sauce was abysmal. Same situation going back to JFK: nondescript grey meat sauce with noodles as first meal a salmon sandwich as the second meal (again no choice). Overall very disappointing and frustrating. But what really made me wish I had never set foot on that aircraft again was the unspeakable rudeness of the flight attendants. They addressed the passengers in an abrupt way that could only be construed as terribly disrespectful. Between themselves they talked very loudly. We arrived an hour earlier in JFK and since our gate wasn't ready yet we had to wait an hour for the airport to clear us. These things happen all the time when you fly frequently but the flight attendants were so vocally unhappy about it you would think this is the first time they had to go through that terrible ordeal!

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Warsaw-Tbilisi 29 May 2014. Tbilisi-Warsaw-Amsterdam 1 June 2014. LOT offers very attractive fare on this route with pretty short connections in Warsaw. They operate new Embraer-195 aircraft which is very quiet and feel quite spacious despite of just 2+2 abreast seating leather seats with a comfortable pitch. The leg Tbilisi - Warsaw was however operated by one of their old 737-400 with very tight pitch and narrow seats. Flights were on- time most of the crew were friendly. The service is limited to serving water and a wafer bar free of charge the rest of food and beverages can be bought from their Sky bar. I bought a sandwich / coffee combination which was less than 4 euro I think it's very affordable. The short connection in Warsaw (I had 1 hr 10 min between the flights) can be tricky if you need to change flights from Schengen to non-Schengen zone. There was a bottle neck with long lines to passport control and security check at the Warsaw airport so I really had to run to catch my flight to Amsterdam.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Excellent flight in Premium Economy cabin from Beijing to Warsaw. Check in smooth and took less than 3 minutes. With the Premium class ticket you can use fast lane through immigration and security check to skip all the queues. Flight departed on-time and arrived to Warsaw 50 minutes earlier. Comfortable seat with only 9 passengers (21 seats in total). Very friendly and attentive service with few rounds of drinks in between main services. The only downside is the choice of meals in flight from Beijing - only Asian choices and not very tasty. Food is served on chinaware great selection of wine and drinks (similar to Business class in other European airlines). My suitcase was damaged during this trip and that was sorted and fixed at Warsaw airport. Their product is really good since they started operating B787 Dreamliner. I would recommend them but probably not in Y class.

13th April flight 724 Tbilisi - Warsaw and flight 281 Warsaw - London. LOT must be the worst airline I have flown with. 3 hour flights very expensive tickets not even a sandwich or a chocolate bar.

WAW-FRA AMS-WAW everything perfect smooth check in (also for the flights operated by AC and UA)  nice new lounge with few hot dishes big plus for the staff who even helped with printing documents from her own e-mail the printers are not available though WAW airport boarding smooth baggage tagged with priority tag arrived first on the way back from AMS. On board huge change in pilot - passengers communication frequent comments on the take off route landing. Crew smiled and joked with passengers Sky Bar process ok. Nice ciabatta with chicken.

WAW-CPH-WAW February 2014. Embraer 170 both ways. Nice aircraft. Flights punctual. Quick service at interline desk in WAW. Quick security pass in transit (from non-Schengen to Schengen). Granted lounge access as LH frequent traveler. Travels faultless though un-eventful. No IFE. On board given water and chocolate only. Price list for additional intakes available and reasonable. Ordered Starbuck coffee (2.6 USD) and was on top given a huge free chocolate muffin as a Valentine surprise gift a nice touch. Staff were fine and did a good job.

Warsaw-Copenhagen quick and good service. As a Miles and More Gold card holder everything went very smooth. Business Class check-in Priority Lane for security ( Warsaw Airport is very nicely organized and easy to navigate) then to LOT Business Lounge for some coffee and grab newspapers. Boarding started 20 mins before departure time. Flight on Embraer 175 clean and comfortable leather seats. Friendly and chatty cabin crew. Quick flight only 55 mins so I didn't ask for any food/drinks which you can purchase. I like LOT's attention to safety on board - safety demo is very detailed and interesting and their cabin security checks are meticulous and sometimes even strict. Arrived on time. Good and professional service overall.

LOT 02 ORD to WAW 16 January 2014 Business Class. Airport Lounge left something to be desired but the peace and quiet was very welcome. Service on board the aircraft was superb. Business Class was served by 3 excellent personnel. In the first 90 minutes of the flight dinner was over and we were able to get to sleep. You didn't have to ask for anything. On time at both ends. Price was right service and aircraft were super.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Flew YYZ-WAW WAW-KRK August 2013 and WAW-ORD on the way back. Stand by is always fun attempted to get on the WAW-YYZ flight but there was no available seats. All in all it was a good experience flying on the B787 Dreamliner. The aircraft was brand new clean and impressive. Didn't like the fact that we landed in Warsaw and were parked on a remote stand having to board buses that took us to the terminal however this is probably not LOT's fault contact stand was simply not available in Warsaw. I was a bit disappointed with the IFE System and the food. The IFE could be much better offering more movies. A promo video for LOT would be useful as well. Food was not as good as it used to be a few years back when I flew their 767s. You can simply tell that they are trying to save on service. Flying to KRK was positive brand new Q400 operated by Eurolot. Very comfortable and much better than the old ATR 72. Both flights the staff was friendly and professional. All in all the Dreamliner is a huge improvement from the old 767s however areas LOT could and should improve in are: IFE Food OTP (on time performance).

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
BRU-WAW-LCA 5 January 2014. Web-check-in system very easy but as usual many front seats blocked in advance even if I always try to check in online as soon as web-check-in opens. This is a night flight from Brussels to Warsaw and then in Larnaca it arrives at 02.55am (+1). Flight from Brussels left with 20 mins delay but this was not a problem as there was enough layover time in Warsaw for my connection flight to Larnaca. Arriving in Warsaw and going to the gate there was already announced 15 mins delay in boarding. It seems that most of the people don't respect the hand baggage allowance rule and also the airline itself shows much tolerance on this. I could see many people (all in economy) boarding carrying 2-3 handbags and ground staff and flying attendants saying nothing about it. This gets annoying because besides onboard safety it is the space issue in the overhead cupboards not enough space for everybody. After boarding and being seated we had to wait in the aircraft for 50 mins. Pilot informed us after 30 mins we had to wait for baggage and that is why there was a delay. In any case flight left with almost an hour delay and arrived in Larnaca at 3.25 am instead of 2.55am. Service was average (as usual LOT doesn't offer onboard meals and you have to buy your food). Food is reasonably priced. Flight attendants polite but many not very friendly. I recommend this flight mainly because of the good connections and time schedule allowing you to not waste your day flying but instead flying in the evening.

Warsaw-Copenhagen and Geneva-Warsaw. Both flights on time very comfortable leather seats with a lot of legroom both flights on Embraer 175. Very nice aircraft. Cabin crew friendly always chatty and smiling grooming top notch. On European flights in Economy LOT offers only chocolate bar and water for free otherwise you have to pay for food but selection is quite wide and quality is very good. On each flight I took large baguette with chicken breast and veggies and Starbucks coffee and I paid 5 Euro! Bargain! Wines are for 2.5 Euro as well nice selection. All announcements in Polish English and Danish/French nice touch. Decent product highly recommended.

We had a great series of trips on LOT. We left Sep 15 from Vancouver changed planes in Toronto to Warsaw. The Warsaw leg was fantastic we upgraded to Business Premium on the new 787 Dreamliner. The staff were incredible my wife was born and raised in Warsaw so she speaks fluent Polish but that did not matter all the staff was very fluent in English. The meals were excellent the movies were current and we could watch as many as we liked. We also had a return flight from Warsaw to London and it was great. The return flight from Warsaw to Vancouver was another winner we are going back in January and we will only fly LOT to Europe.

LOT from TBS to PAR via WAW cabin crew was friendly and efficient especially for TBS-WAW. The meal is for purchase which is better than previously tasteless sandwich. The price of the food is acceptable but there is not much choice of hot meals. The boarding was chaotic without proper announcements. The transfer in WAW was smooth and quick.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
On September 28th at 8pm my husband and I were scheduled to depart from Toronto and travel to Israel (scheduled to arrive Sep 30 at 4am local time) with one scheduled stop in Warsaw. Arrived at the airport for 5pm to check in. By 8pm no announcements had been made in terms of any delays but our flight was not being boarded. The flight crew was 15 minutes late. When travelers started making inquiries it was announced that repairs were being made to the plane and it would be delayed for at least another hour. Boarding was not announced until 11 pm once the flight was boarded we spent another hour in the plane waiting for the flight to take off. Midway through the flight it was announced that the plane was having issues and that an emergency landing was being made in Iceland. Upon arriving in Iceland no food or hotel vouchers were handed out and no information was provided as to next steps for at least an hour. We spent no less than $70 on food coffee and water while waiting at the airport. Food vouchers were not provided until 2pm - about $15 per person which was not enough to buy much more than a drink and sandwich. Information about the flight to Warsaw was not provided for 3-4 hour after landing with no definitive instructions as to when another plane would be available. We missed the day that we planned to spend in Warsaw and also the connecting flight from Warsaw to Tel-Aviv Israel. Once we finally arrived in Warsaw we were thankfully given hotel taxi vouchers and boarding pass to Tel-Aviv through Moscow. In Moscow we spent roughly another 4 hours at the airport and another $100 between the two of us for food (no vouchers were provided). From Moscow we finally caught a flight to Tel-Aviv arriving in Israel 20 hours later than expected - 12am local time on Oct 1. Overall we were extremely disappointed with the service received - 3 lay overs instead of the scheduled 1 - and the lack of communication between the airline and travelers. We missed 2 days of our trip.

WAW-PEK in economy premium with brand new B787 dreamliner. The flight was excellent with the very high standards from the cabin staff. They were helpful friendly and chatty. Seats were spacious and comfortable. ICE entertainment system needs to be updated as choice of entertainment is rather poor. The dinner and breakfast were both tasty. Flight on time. Noticeably improved service compared to last experience. Highly recommended.

Warsaw - Chicago with new Dreamliner. It was very comfortable a lot of space clean toilets the flight was on time. USB charges and dimmable windows are great. The entertainment was a shame! Such an amazing modern plane and they give you just two movies for free for 10 hour flight and want you to buy the others I have never seen this anywhere else. I also didn't like that during night they dim all the windows and lock it so you cannot make them lighter and at least look out of the window when there's nothing to watch on your TV and you cannot sleep. It was very cold at Warsaw Airport.

LO151 August 10th 2013 (WAW-TLV). Although booked flights including meals (Child meals) LOT decided to change the airlines contract and drop the catering service for short haul flights. Failed to notify us. Onboard I was left with no solution and two starving children. Furthermore we reserved a window seat although once boarded we discovered there was no window at that specific seat. One of the worst companies I have flown (and I'm a star alliance frequent flyer). No real entertainment on board Avoid at all cost especially with children!

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Took a recent flight with WAW-BCN on an older 737-400. The aircraft was in an awful shape. Cabin was dirty with two different types of economy class seats of different sizes colours and comfort level. Only one bathroom working for over 120 pax that smelled worse than an outhouse. Flight delayed with no explanation. Never again will I fly this airline or should anyone else considering there are much better priced airlines out there that at the very least keep the cabin hygienic. Cabin crew was pleasant.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
LO 045 24Sep WAW-YYZ. Boarding was quite chaotic due in part to the number of families and wheelchairs. There was literally no priority given to J Class customers despite the signage and demarcation at the gate. Two boarding doors were used and that was helpful. The aircraft was well maintained and the crew was very attentive during the pre-departure process. Seats were spacious and comfortable. The onboard product is not as slick as some other airlines but I have no complaints. The food was plentiful well prepared and nicely presented. The wine list was very respectable. The IFS system lacked depth of selection but otherwise adequate. The highlight of the journey were the purser and two flight attendants working in J Class. They were absolutely charming and very attentive. Hats off to LOT for the calibre of their flight attendants and the upgrading of their J Class product. I would not hesitate recommending LOT to friends.

First and last time I will fly LOT. Returning home on LO 355 18/8/2013 when checking the flight details Sunday morning to my horror our flight was showing Warsaw and not Frankfurt as its destination. Numerous calls to the airport then LOT and finally found that the airport put the wrong information on the internet. At airport the check-in staff couldn't or wouldn't tag our luggage to our final destination Sydney Australia. Her English was poor as she tried to insist that we speak Polish to her. Once on board the food and beverages had to be paid for. We had to pick-up our bags and recheck them at Frankfurt for Dubai.

YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. FRA-WAW portion was operated by a LO E-175 aircraft. This was on July 24 2013. After arriving from the connection flight from YYZ I went to the boarding gate and waited. The check-in process was efficient and smooth and the Polish cabin crew were friendly and welcoming (the younger flight attendant serving the drinks in my area was not as friendly but still pleasant). I was pleased with the wide array of drinks available on the flight as there were even plenty of alcoholic options. A sandwich was provided which was to my surprise very good and quite plentiful. The flight landed right on time at WAW and in general I thought it to be a great flight. The spoken English of the flight attendants could be a bit better but apart from that I though t it to be a great flight with nice and friendly service. I wouldn't hesitate to fly LOT again.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
I have traveled LOT between New York and Warsaw on numerous occasions and have connected out of Warsaw to various Eastern European destinations such as Vilnius Moscow and Lviv. Generally speaking LOT's service is good to very good. The entertainment selection is either too "Polish" or the selection is too narrow (I am a Polish-speaking American so I can take in Polish entertainment but English-only speakers might be befuddled.). Food generally good to very good. FA's competent and polite sometimes the English pronunciation is a bit off. When my JFK-WAW flight was 4 hours late on 5/22/13 and I missed my connecting flight to Lviv the airline did a decent job of retrieving my bag in WAW setting me up in a hotel and paying for meals and airport transportation. Generally pleased with their service both on US and European flights.

I fly with LOT at least once a month usually on short trip between MXP and WAW and I was always satisfied. Last week I tried out their new WAW-PEK flight operated with the Dreamliner.

7 August PAR-WAW-TBS. Flight was not good especially WAW-TBS. I had flown LOT twice in the summer and I do not understand the policy of freezing passengers. It was so cold that everyone made complaints to the FA. This time the FA was very nice and they managed to increase the temperature during the flight. The food is for purchase which is now much a better option. However there is a problem with choice of hot meals which is basically not available. Another problem is that they accept only credit cards and not cash. I believe there is room for further improvements.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
WAW-JFK return in new 787. Although this is an upgrade over the 767 they used to have on this route I couldn't help but be disappointed in their new B-Class seat. It looks good but is practically speaking a little cheap and flimsy. The tray tables were difficult to operate and the video screen felt like it was a million miles away. The electrical outlet can only be accessed when the seat is in the upright position. Considering that even American Airlines has gone to a mini suite in their new aircraft you think Lot would have done the same. Food and IFO were both sub par. On the plus side the seats are fully flat. I slept 4 hours very soundly. FA's were also very friendly and helpful. They were definitely the best part of the whole flight. Would I fly this product again? Not if I was paying for it.

Tel Aviv TLV - Warsaw WAW - Helsinki HEL (July) and back (August). TLV-WAW with Embraer 195 WAW-HEL-WAW with Embraer 170 WAW-TLV with Boeing 737-400 soon to be replaced by E.195. Embraer jets are very comfortable. July flights as in my previous reviews very good. Regarding August flights from August (with the exception of the long-haul flights to North America and Asia as one FA told me) there's really no service on board. All one gets (even on the 4-hour long TLV flights) is a chocolate-covered wafer and water. If one wishes to eat and drink other products are available for money. What a shame that LOT chose this option! As in my past reviews I still recommend LOT but I am truly disappointed and hope things will soon change regarding cabin service.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Flew LOT 352 MUC-WAW connecting to LOT041 WAW-YYZ. First leg on Embraer was a short one hour flight with very good service and smooth flight. LOT041 was on the Boeing Dreamliner business class. Boarding in WAW a bit chaotic. Flight left 90 minutes late as workmen attempted to fix (unsuccessfully) a seat that would not go flat. They gave up and said it would be fixed in Toronto. Only about 10 passengers out of 24 seats in the J cabin so it wasn't a problem. Another seat had a tray table that refused to stay horizontal rendering it useless. A metal flap covering the opening of the place where the TV monitor flips up in my seat fell off. All this in a new plane that has only been in service since last December! Cabin service very good FA friendly. Food and drink quite good. The plane itself - the 787 is super-quiet and I love the electronic window shades! A very good experience despite the few glitches. The flight made up the late departure and arrived only 25 minutes late in Toronto.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Overall a poor experience. Staff service on board was decent the flight was decent but the worst was airport service. Flying out of Warsaw I was given trouble by a baggage attendant for a painting. It was 0.8MM over the size boundary and as a result I was spoken to in a rude manner about my disregard for "passenger safety. After a long argument I found the manager myself and with no problems was told I could easily bring the painting on board. In regards to duty free: I purchased a bottle at the duty free but was not allowed to take that on board either because it was not "In a special bag therefore it was not purchased at the duty free. I had the receipt to prove it. Afterwards on my return trip I purchased another bottle and this time requested the special bag but was told that they are not allowed to give the special bag anymore and I can only try to get the bottle on board with the receipt. Overall poor experience decent flight.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
My comments relate rather to the ground services than to the flight. I took several flights on European routes and they were no worse then other European airlines. However reservations booking online and any other sales services leave much to be desired. The airline offers multitude of different fares which are not adequately defined so one never really knows what one buys until some changes are required. No proper definition appears online or on tickets. The staff handling reservations are not helpful to say the least or outright incompetent. Ground staff in WAW are often very rude. On top of it there are additional unexpected charges. For example when one pays extra for luggage at the airport there is an additional relatively high charge just for the transaction. All in all there is nothing wrong with the airline for a quick uncomplicated jump between WAW and an airport in Europe but watch out at reservation. Not for serious travel. Not very often on time so if you have an important meeting allow sufficient extra time.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
First and last time flying with LOT. Flight from Chicago to Warsaw was delayed 2 hours. As a result I missed my connecting flight to Moscow. Seats in business class were quite uncomfortable no electric outlets and the inflight entertainment was pathetic. Transfer desk in Warsaw was a nightmare: one person trying to rebook dozens. Little did I know that my return flight would be even worse: flight from Warsaw to Chicago was delayed 3 hours and then cancelled. Had to get luggage back (waited an hour for that) go back through customs passport control etc. then pushed from one line to next - no clear instructions no help no information. Eventually rebooked to the flight to Toronto. Seats on that flight were also even more uncomfortable than on the first flight and the seat controls were simply not working. We had to spend the night in Toronto and fly to Chicago the next day. As far as travelling in business class and flying in general this was the worst experience ever.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
TBS-WAW-PAR flight in the second week of May. The experience is just terrible. Check-in area for flight TBS-WAW is awful since you need to pass the guy who is checking passport irrespective business or economy class (gold or silver status). You need to stay in line and wait for his clearance. Boarding was chaotic without clear announcements. The plane was Embraer-170 which is like a small mini bus. The seats are uncomfortable and had very little pitch between the rows. The big joke is the meal service - small sandwich which is for a flight of 3.5 hours. I do not mind paying for food if it is offered (excellent example Pegasus airline). I should say that LOT Polish airlines service getting worse and worse. Not recommended airline for travellers to Tbilisi. There are much better options from traditional airlines like Lufthansa and Turkish airlines. The best low cost for travellers to Tbilisi is Pegasus airlines.

VNO-CDG via WAW . My first time on E170 & E175. Satisfied by the flights (seat comfort pitch inflight service ). Big issues on ground handling. The flights had a 75 min connection. At VNO although I am a STAR ALLIANCE member they put the priority tag on my suitcase after I mentioned it. 40 minutes Holding over WAW due to Fog. During boarding in WAW I expressed my concerns about my bag but they told me its ok because they are other pax and there will be a delay. 15 minute delay and arriving at CDG on time. Of course no bag on the belt. They told me I'd have my bag next morning it never happened I had to wait 3 days. Overall a great flight experience but improvement needed with ground handling.

WAW-LHR. Y Class on a very tired B737-400. Cabin crew were friendly but the aircraft was quite uncomfortable. I could feel the seat frame through the ancient cushion on the seat. The size of the departure lounge at Warsaw was far too small and crowded for this flight also - perhaps not the fault of the airline but added to the overall average experience. The food was more than acceptable.

Athens to Krakow and back. The time of departure was early morning about 04.30 and the aircraft was an Embraer 170. Small aircraft but clean and comfortable. The staff were not friendly. The flight was excellent and the arrival on time. The meal was poor but the trip was short. The only problem for me was the behaviour of cabin crew. The return was the next day. The departure time was after midnight with the same aircraft. The cabin crew were again rude.

I travel a lot on European flights lately to Stuttgart and Milan from Warsaw. Most of all - On time and on schedule. Embraer planes are quite comfy. Staff on board smiling and helpful. You always get at least a sandwich and you can have a glass of wine what is not normal on all European airlines in Economy. I recommend LOT for travelling on European routes.

Chicago to Warsaw booked premium economy on dreamliner but once it got grounded I got a free upgrade to Business Class both ways. Service was great. Business lounge at Chicago was excellent but no TV? Onboard greeted with Champagne or juices. Dinner was 5 course of excellent quality. Good selection of wines and drinks. Service was quick and polite. Seats were comfortable but not fully reclinable. Bag came out first as it should be.

WAW-LHR-WAW. Both flights onboard a 787-800 Dreamliner. A very comfortable plane with great windows and large screen IFE system. The choice of films were somewhat limited but guess it was because it was a promotional tour flight in Europe. The outbound flight was delayed for an hour with very little apology from the captain but generally the crew on both flights were good. Just hope the 787 will be back in the skies again soon.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
PRG-WAW on B787. Plane arrived 30 minutes late due to bad weather at WAW they text us the delay information on my mobile. The airline was fine for such a short trip. Unimpressed with the new aircraft. The 3-3-3 seating configuration in economy very narrow seats and unpleasant for long trips. The pitch of the seat is 31 in and the with 17.3 in. Only two airlines have 2-4-2 seating configuration and probably will be better with seats of 18.5 in width. Nice IFE with 14 movies and best of all a Survey from the customers (very nice).

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
I have flown return between WAW and PRG. Good service on this short flight. My caveat with LOT is an unhelpful agent when I called to change flight for the same day in the same class of travel and same price. Small things make a huge difference when choosing airline for travels.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
LHR-WAW return. Short-notice flight ticket purchased 14 hours before departure at a surprisingly low price. Both flights 10-20 minutes late but not an issue for me. Embraer 195 to WAW Boeing 787 Dreamliner to LHR. Both flights appeared full. Excellent service particularly on the return leg in the Dreamliner - multiple drinks rounds and very pleasant helpful FAs - it felt like a long-haul flight. Flying in the new 787 was mostly a very pleasant experience though the seats would be uncomfortable on long-haul flights and the tray table had not been cleaned. Usual long wait for bags at WAW and the usual bus to the terminal.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Prague to Warsaw round trip on the new B787 Dreamliner. Put on scheduled flights as part of its European promotional tour. The online check-in is a breeze and so was the boarding process on both segments. LOT went out of their way to show off the new jet even providing headphones and activating the AVOD IFE for the 1-hour flight. Economy seating is reasonable with decent legroom adjustable headrests if a little tight at shoulder level in window seats. There's in-seat power (AC+USB) and great entertainment options. Even on a short trip drinks and biscuits are served. For the flight back we got upgraded to Premium which easily matches some of the European business products. With 2-3-2 seating it's way above your usual premium economy: spacious seats adjustable PTV screens priority security check and priority boarding in WAW welcome drinks served. LOT's 787 is a huge step forward but the airline itself offers a very solid product.

Route WAW-MAD R/T on board of new Embraer 195. Nice leather seats very good legroom quite good comfort - I like LOT's Embraers for 2-seat rows. Nice and helpful cabin crew. Catering: drinks (juices water coffee tea or wine) sandwich and sweet snack. Minus for delay on first leg.

2/12/12 Warsaw-JFK Business Class. Smooth check-in at Warsaw Airport Business Class desk Priority Lane through security two lounges to choose from. Flight on time with B767-300ER. Refurbished Business Class cabin but still looking a bit worn out however seat controls worked properly. Very friendly and attentive cabin crew took my coat offered champagne orange juice or water with some newspapers explained how the seat works etc. After take off Purser greeted every Business passenger individually offering menu wine list and explaining dining options. Opted for regular service and it was fantastic. Tasty traditional Polish dishes 5-course dining with good wines and those little touches like small chocolates cherry liquor No carts on a cabin everything served by hand by knowledgeable and friendly FAs. Given small Digiplayers with some movies TV shows music and games big cart with snacks fruit basket sweets cakes little sandwiches were put in a galley as a mid-flight snack. Before landing we were served hot dinner. Landing cards and customs forms had flight number and date written already so attention to details was superb! Before landing all passengers received small photo album with old LOT postcards nice touch! Bags were delivered when we get to the carousels. Great service fantastic cabin crew can not wait to fly their B787!

LHR-WAW-KRK return. Baguettes only provided on WAW-LHR leg dry snacks on all other legs. Ageing ATR-72 on KRK-WAW flight - seat wouldn't stay in upright position. Cramped LOT Charters 737 used from WAW-LHR. Flight arrived early at LHR. Not as good as previous flights with LOT but ticket was a bargain price. However I'm tempted to use BA next time.

18/11/2012 LHR-WAW. Smooth check-in in T1 at Heathrow. Boarding started 30 mins before take off time. 737-400 but fitted with nice and comfortable dark blue leather seats clean and with a good legroom. Very pretty and smart uniformed cabin crew helpful with finding seats baggage space newspapers magazines. Very good and professional safety demonstration. Service started 20 mins after take off good sized baguette with seeds cheese veggies chocolate waffle and full bar service incl. wines and Polish beer. Second run with drinks while cleaning after meal service. Cabin crew very attentive always smiling and approachable. All information from FAs and Captain in both Polish and English. Landed in Warsaw 20 mins ahead of schedule parked right next to LOT's new B787 Dreamliner which was also announced by Captain. Great flight very good airline totally recommended. Paid 129 Euro for one way ticket booked a day before!

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
A regular on MXP-WAW-MXP route. Service carried out with new E-170s: seats are very comfortable good legroom food and efficient crew. On around 30 flights I experienced just 3-4 delays which is acceptable. Ground assistance always good. I also flew on WAW-FRA route with a B737: relatively old plane very crowded but still good flight. In my opinion one of the best airlines for short-haul flights.

LHR-Warsaw on 8/8. Brand new Embraer 195. Nice leather seats very good leg room good stowage space. Flight on time. Nice and professional cabin crew in smart uniforms fluent in English (and Russian). I like LOT's safety demo - it is detailed and well explained in both Polish and English. As for a service - refreshing towels full free bar service large baguette chocolate bar hot drinks many re-fills. Kids got a colouring books and toys nice touch! Good professional service highly recommended.

Tel Aviv TLV - Warsaw WAW - Wroclaw WRO (July 2012) and back (August 2012). Warsaw - Tel Aviv - Warsaw Boeing 737-400. Warsaw - Wroclaw Embraer 175. Wroclaw - Warsaw Bombardier Q400NG (flight operated by EuroLOT). Boeing 737 a bit worn out but OK with great leg space. Embraer great! Bombardier new (from May 2012) - very nice. LOT excel on European routes. They serve snacks on domestic flights and sandwiches on European ones. In the last year sandwiches have replaced the hot meals on the TLV route which is a shame for a 4-hr flight! FAs very nice and great leg space.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Scheduled to fly on 6/30 from Newark NJ to Warsaw got to the airport 3 hours prior to departure informed flight had been cancelled due to technical problems with the plane which never arrived from Warsaw. What followed was total chaos. LOT employees at the airport had no idea what they were doing and they were rebooking people on other airlines at the speed of 45 mins per individual. After spending 10 hours at the airport we left without being rebooked. I was on the phone most of the night trying to get rebooked and after numerous errors made by LOT we flew out the following day on another airline. We came back on LOT on 7/23 and flew from Sofia Bulgaria to Warsaw and Warsaw to Newark. LOT employees in Sofia were professional and nice and knew exactly what they were doing. The short flight was ok however the 9 hour flight from Warsaw to Newark was not great. Their planes are very old without any entertainment choices and no water in the bathrooms. The food was so bad that even the bread was inedible. In addition I have emailed the airline regarding the occurrences on 6/30 and no one has even replied. Staff in Newark and NY need to be trained and the overall service need to be improved.

Warsaw to Chicago July 21 2012. Had booked 6 months in advance with confirmed reservations and seat assignments - at check in counter in Warsaw was told they didn't have my records even though I could see my name had a seat number on her screen - they were overbooked and gave my seat and my wife's to someone else had to fly standby and got on after visiting many different LOT counters. Of course the flight was 2 hours late - bad ending to a wonderful vacation.

Several domestic legs flown during a 10 day holiday - Gdansk Warsaw Wroclaw Krakow all except one Levon Embraer 175 aircraft. Comfortable seats disinterested staff plastic cup of water and a chocolate bar. Would rate well as a no frills but this is a supposed full service airline. Only one sector on time. One sector code shared with - old noisy crowded ATR used.

Was to fly from Warsaw to Cracow. Was not allowed on board due to 14 pax overbooking on a 46-seat plane. It all happened despite trying to check in 8 hours before departure time and despite being a status passenger. If I could I would avoid them.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Regularly fly from AMS to KRK via Warsaw. All in all basic experience seats are very cramped and padding is non existent but does not seem to be notably different from LCCs. Catering is alright just a snack on these flight nowadays. The most appalling thing is staff service as long as you don not ask anything or no flights are canceled delayed etc. Lot seems to work fine. Lately I had a few cancellations and that is the moment when staff get nasty and rude. They never seem to manage these kind of situations appropriately and will always try the passenger to blame for the airline's cancellations and delays etc and will never acknowledge their own mistakes. When they notice the blaming passenger strategy does not work they will always try the I do not understand / speak English excuse and send you from counter to counter and you are left on your own. So frustrating!

Flight: In last month. Warsaw-Barcelona on very new Embraer E195. Departure sharp on time arrival 20 min earlier. Great new and clean aircraft nice leather seats with a lot of legroom. Very nice enthusiastic and attentive cabin crew. Stylish uniforms I really liked their hats. All announcements in Polish English and Spanish. Very professional and detailed safety demo. Food was large hot baguette and big chocolate waffle plus many runs with full bar service incl. wines beers soft and hot drinks. Good info from the flight deck. Solid highly recommended professional service.

Flight: In last month. PAR-WAR-TBS return flight. The service is lower than average. However the European segment for Paris- Warsaw is ok since the flight time is two hours and a small snack is sufficient. Warsaw-Tbilisi flight was awful. We froze onboard and passengers were complaining to crew - no attention. The stewardess said that this is a regulation in the company. There is not much space for legs in their E-195/E-175. The flight time is more than three hours but there is no service of food. The same sandwich was served and the cost of ticket is 500 Euro. Never with LOT again! I would recommend travelling to Tbilisi by Turkish and Lufthansa. The price is the same but the service is much better.

KTW-WAW-KTW. Short day trip to Warsaw on both legs E170's (SP-LDD and SP-LDG). On the way to Warsaw landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled and coming back we arrived 11 minutes ahead of schedule. On such short and also regional flights LOT served us cold drinks and some snacks. I recommend LOT because also for me (5' 8.9" ) it was so comfortable that I could almost straighten my legs under the seat in front. Cabin crew on both legs very polite and kind captain let me take some photos of the cockpit after landing.

WAW-ORD. Flight on time. Cabin half full so I enjoyed more space. Starting from April there are some novelties introduced - new meals on larger plates new selection of wines and spirits I noticed (finally) new amenity kit and blanket. They also introduced waiter service - no carts everything is served by flight attendants. It makes C class experience quite enjoyable. 2 of 3 attendants serving in this cabin were really friendly. Seat was ok but it was a day flight. For red-eye flights it might be a bit uncomfortable. Overall quite nice experience. After receiving 787 and its full flat seats it'll be really good product. For now I can see improvement in soft areas.

MUC-WAW-RZE return with overnight stopover in WAW outbound. MUC-WAW on E170 almost empty very comfortable flight friendly service and on time. The next morning to RZE on ATR 72 packed the flight was only 40 minutes so service was rushed but on time. Return flight to WAW on E195 also full left 30 min late but on time arrival. Transit time of 1 hour in WAW is more then sufficient no additional security checks for Inner Schengen flights. Onward flight to Munich was chaotic full E170 45 minutes late due to transit passengers. Arrived in Munich 30 min late. E-Jets are very comfortable on flights to and from Munich we were served a chocolate bar sandwich and 2 rounds of drinks more then sufficient for a 90 minute flight. ATR is worn out and cramped but for a flight less then one hour it really doesn't matter. All in all a very good experience.

Booked MAN-LHR-WAW return via lot.com (bmi used for domestic legs). bmi changed my booking twice but LOT customer service were very helpful. It's been a while since I've flown with LOT but I wasn't disappointed for the price paid. Cost-cutting is evident though: the hot meals and hand wipes are gone and replaced with a large baguette. A cramped LOT Charters 737 was used on the outward leg from LHR. Returned in a more comfortable Embraer 195. Great FAs - polite attentive and seemed much happier than in the past. Will definitely use again.

TLV-WAW-CDG. First leg Boeing 737-400 second Embraer 175. Leg space excellent very comfortable seats great pilots and attentive flight attendants. Boeing worn out but still fine. LOT are excellent on European flights but the TLV route is not as it used to be: only a sandwich is served on this 4 hr flight (bar service excellent). I have always enjoyed LOT and still try to fly with them when possible but service on intercontinental flights must be improved.

Boeing 767-300 Toronto to Warsaw. The good thing about this flight was that we landed safe and on time. The plane was very old little room between seats very uncomfortable. Almost no entertainment they have only one or 2 big screens. The staff was pretty rude some of them refused to speak english; food was poor quality they offer only jus and water for free. For wine and beer they charged 2-5 dollars per drink.

HAN-WAW Boeing 767-300ER. Check in no problem with severely oversized luggage. Severely overbooked I was upgraded - later downgraded as the 10 last rows were mistakingly not available by check in staff – so eventually there was a lot of space. However I was offered a seat in business if I would accept economy class food. I accepted and was put behind the 5 true paying business-class passengers but enjoyed the advanced seat and space. Seat easy to maneuvre. IFE not working except for flight tracking. Staff attentive but a bit like robots no smiles and got a feeling of being alienated. Was offered two meal options in economy food tried both. Food tolerable.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
I was on flight 85 from Hanoi to Warsaw with connecting flight to Berlin. The Flight was scheduled for 11.55 but was delayed for 5 hrs. Unlike most passengers we realised there would be a delay 18 hrs in advance after having problems with the online check-in. Even though the airline was aware of a significant delay no effort was made to inform passengers. No information on our right to compensation under EU regulations was given either. Adding insult to injury the flight attendants on the plane ignored any request for information or service. At one stage I had the assistance lamp on for an hour before I gave up and went to the back to find attendants chatting leisurely. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich with cheese and water. No yoghurt or muffin as included in the regular meal. Again a sign of minimal effort. Even though this flight was relatively cheap it was not good value at all and staff made no effort to improve what was obviously a terrible experience. I would not recommend flying with this airline on a long haul flight.

LHR-Warsaw. Flight was delayed 3 hrs due to fog in London but we were kept informed about any changes and LOT was one of the few airlines which actually landed into LHR that evening. Smooth and quick boarding into B737-400. Nice dark leather seats I had emergency exit seat with plenty of legroom! Very nice crew of 5 despite full flight did good job with service. Good English positive attitude always smiling responding to all call bells (and there were plenty questions due to delay). Big ham and cheese baguette with full bar service.

The flight itself was smooth and the timing great however there was no inflight entertainment.

HAM-WAW-KRK return in Economy with Embraer170. Seating good (2-2). Both flights from WAW were more than 15 hours delayed. Bad information in WAW. They called for the flight opened the gate and then let the people wait. Info bad so nobody could leave the gate area although they must have known that the delay would be longer (because later they told that the incoming airplanes arrived much too late). Onboard service okay for short haul flights (free beverages on domestic and also alcoholic drinks on international flights with a light snack). FA's looked very serious no smile but not unfriendly.

YYZ-WRW-PRA return last week. We flew to Warsaw on Air Italy chartered by LOT. Check in took 90 minutes. Hideous food inedible. No special meal provision for low sodium though reserved. Warm drinks served twice and never replenished though on their website LOT recommends one glass of water per hour. A few insolent and unhelpful staff. Not enough washrooms. The flight to Prague was on time well staffed clean. We arrived at Prague Airport on May 8 at 1200 for a 1430 flight to Warsaw and a connection to Toronto. The flight to Warsaw was delayed 40 minutes and we were worried that we would miss our connection. The gate crew at Prague arranged for a wheelchair for my partner who was unable to run through Warsaw airport. The flight attendant made certain we would be met at the gate and brought directly to the Toronto flight and flight was held for our arrival. We appreciated this service. The flight Warsaw to Toronto on LOT equipment was comfortable enough bathrooms and drinks. The marvellous measure of their service was that our luggage made it too!

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Warsaw-Toronto return. Planes old and uncomfortable. Food is barely edible. Entertainment shocking. Most of the cabin staff do not speak English. Amsterdam to Warsaw ended in a divert to Katowize due to bad weather. Luckily our connection to Toronto had been delayed anyway - turned out all in all was delayed 4 hrs which put us 4 hrs late in Toronto. Delays are expected due to snow however LOT only offered drinks / food around 3 hours into the delay. Initial attempts to land in Warsaw were aborted 3 times due to visibility - at least safety was a concern! Baggage was slightly damaged on both journeys which was disappointing. I would not travel LOT again.

JFK-WAW-JFK . Very old plane seats extremely close together and nowhere to stretch your legs. Minimal overhead storage. The food served was barely edible. AV was one screen per cabin and the headsets were very outdated. The flight took off slightly late on both legs. Flight attendants professional but not friendly. Flights were cheap so you get what you pay for. From what I just experienced I cannot recommend this airline to anyone who wants to have a comfortable flight.

New lounge in WAW are excellent.

WAW-SVO on new E175 leaves 1030pm but due to time difference between Warsaw and Moscow arrives at 0230am. Although the aircraft is new and comfortable for a short haul you won't get much sleep.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Almost missed my father's funeral in Poland because of this airline. LOT was the only airline that made its passengers come to O'Hare on Feburary 1st day of the huge blizzard in Chicago in anticipation that our flight which was scheduled to depart at 9:55 pm would depart. After hours of waiting at the terminal they boarded us on the plane and made us wait until midnight to tell us our flight was cancelled. We were stuck at the airport because the blizzard became so bad that no taxis were running. The only bus running was in between the terminals. LOT gave nothing - not even a blanket to keep warm with. No transportation from the airport no hotel not even a cot and a blanket. ORD-WAW delayed over 2 hours which made me late for my connecting flight from WAW-KRK. Told me on the plane the flight was waiting for me and everyone else who had that flight - turns out they are liars. The plane never waited. Scheduled us for a later flight which was late by 2 hours. On the way home same thing delays delays. Unless you want to be stressed angry and late I recommend taking a different airline. The cheaper price is not worth it.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
Milan Malpensa - Warsaw - Wroclaw return in business. First leg an Embraer 170 which looked a bit tired inside but with comfortable seats in business class with 2-2 seat configuration with plenty of legroom. Service attentive and food above average with plenty of drinks. Second leg was in an ATR 72 of Eurolot which has the last rows reserved for business class passengers but with a common service for both classes (snack bar and water or juice). Aircraft looked old and was uncomfortable and very noisy. Return flights were on Embraer 175 (only recently delivered to LOT) and Embraer 170 which was in a much better condition than the previous 170 flown on the outbound leg.

KRK-WAW-ORD. First leg a new ERJ175 comfortable seats short flight and good in-flight services. Connection in WAW ok 3 hrs connection in new terminal 2. but after arriving at the gate found out flight would be delayed by about an hour. B767-300ER is the same since I first flew it back in 1995/7 - old worn down seats no in-flight entertainment system just a screen in front of coach where most of the time is a map from Zoom airlines? Food was OK but not the best headsets didn't work well seats uncomfortable - mine didn't recline old cabin layout. Not recommended for those who want a comfortable flight.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
LHR-WAW-BEY BEY-WAW-GVA. They have discounts on Wednesdays because the flights are so quiet. LHR flight on a 767 belonging to LOT Charters - clean if a little tired. No one was in business class but it was economy class with the middle seat blocked. As there were so few people on the plane economy was the same and they let us all spread out - a row each. All other flights were comfortable new Embraer E170s with 2-2 layout. Beer and wine in economy although they keep it quiet and you have to ask. Cold food on all legs - sandwiches which were nice if simple and it might have been better for them to have served "breakfast" before landing rather than the meal after take off at 4:30am. Very friendly crew. The only downside is the complete lack of IFE which is fine for short haul but when you're flying to the Middle East that's 6-7 hours of flying. I would recommend them for short haul - not the choice for long haul.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
A bright sunny day from Bratislava to Poznan took 11 hours. Reasons given by LOT in Bratislava and Warsaw (including in writing):"technical reasons" (many LOT aircraft are antiquated which explains pervasive delays on domestic routes). Reason given by LOT head office: Weather reasons. Stranded passengers are not assisted and not informed about their rights. Alternative solutions are not offered. This is one of 3 bad experiences I had with LOT where at the end for a lower price you get cancellations and huge delays without any notice and LOT lying to you after a cumbersome and customer unfriendly complaint process.

Toronto- Warsaw return. Flying very old B767 filled to capacity seats worn out and no entertainment at all (broken down) - except moving map of flight. TV screens showing that we are on Zoom flight? Drinks for purchase - first time I see it on a transatlantic flight. Didn't buy the drink right away and when finally food tray arrived wine and beer were sold out. Food below average small portions. Service average little smile.

ZRH-WAW I was the only one in Business very attentive crew with a friendly attitude making sure I was ok. Food okay wine also - not perfect but okay. Lots of refills. Clean and comfortable E170. It was an M&M award ticket so cannot comment on value for money. The only problem was with arrival to Warsaw where the plane parked in the middle apron instead of the gate.

Copenhagen - Hanoi via Warsaw and back. Nice Embraer on way to Warsaw no food. Delayed because of snow so quick transit in Warsaw. Very old B767 from Warsaw to Hanoi with only an overhead screen that plays movies on tape - not good at all. Food below average need to pay for beer/wine. No service between meals have to get up to get drinks. Noisy drunken passengers keeping us awake first half of the trip even though it was way past midnight. Quieter flight on the way home but manual boarding passes in Hanoi and needed to queue in Warsaw to get transit passes. Again snow delayed us over one hour but this time we were packed into an old 737 and told we had to wait for de-icing but the plane didn't move in 45 minutes didn't queue up for de-icing without telling us anything or serving any drinks. I would only fly this far again with LOT if they are more than £120 cheaper than alternative choices.

LHR–WAW–LHR B737-500 outbound and B737-400 inbound. These aircraft had been delivered to LOT in 1993/94 and I suspect the interiors are as they were when the aircraft left the factory. The seats had a dated and tired look about them - cushion of my seaton the inbound flight had collapsed into the seat-frame so that it was as if I was sitting in a bucket. Catering both ways comprised a quality filled roll with hot and cold drinks. The cabin service was efficient and professional but without much apparent joy on the part of cabin crew.

GDN-WAW-MXP return E170/175. Clean airplanes sandwich and drinks on way to MXP juice and refeshment on domestic flight. Staff friendly. Due to fog in GDN we couldn't land and had to fly back to Warsaw LOT organised a hotel food and transport and rebooked us for the nearest flight.

CPH-WAW-HAN. ATR 170 first leg and Boeing 767-300 on second. Tickets at very reasonable price. Fastest connection CPH-HAN. Precise arrivals and departures. Airline not up to 4 star but provides good value for the money. Inaugural flight celebrations in airport in Hanoi and onboard for the new route. Customers provided with champagne souveners flowers. Food good though not perfect. Seats not flat no personal TV screen on biz-class. TV sets are portable and must be set up by staff on the serving trays which then become unavailable for other uses eg. meals laptop etc.

KRK-WAW on E175. KRK is a small local airport with not much facilities but check-in was OK. The flight is 45 mins but they manage to hand out drinks. Seats were good however given the age of the plane it looked a bit worn-out. Staff friendly.

Round trip ORD-WAW-KBP. I found B767 to be surprisingly spartan (no adjustable air vents over the seats in economy for example). The return trip was a disaster. KBP-WAW flight was delayed by 4 hours which meant I missed my connecting flight. I was put up in the Mariott adjacent to WAW which was nice but making the arrangements was a pain and should have been done for me when I got off the plane. I had to stand in 3 different lines for the better part of an hour to get the arrangements taken care of. The next morning I was put on a flight to Newark because the ORD flight was full and that flight was also delayed by 4 hours. When I became aware of the delay I talked to someone at the desk to ask if there were any open seats on the ORD flight that was boarding at that time. I was told that there were in fact some business class seats but upgrading would have required going to the ticket desk at the front of the airport. Nobody at the gate seemed to be authorized to do such a thing. In a situation where there are a dozen or more passengers like me who missed their flight to ORD the day before there's no excuse for any business class seats to be empty on the next flight to ORD. By the time I got to Newark there were no remaining flights out that night so I was handed another hotel voucher and got on an uneventful flight on American Airlines the next morning and arrived home 36 hours behind schedule. To the credit of LOT in Newark they had my voucher and rebooking ready but could do nothing more than just apologize. Why couldn't the people at WAW be this organized? It's LOT's main hub after all. I understand delays happen and missed connections happen but I think when you're handing someone their second straight hotel voucher perhaps you owe them more than just a ticket to get them the rest of the way home.

Heathrow-Warsaw B737-500 Economy. Newspapers handed out and adequate refreshments. The plane was old but clean and well maintained and flight left promptly. The legroom was good and the seats although a bit narrow were fine for the fare paid.

Lviv-Warsaw-Budapest. Check in agent efficient but check in area at Lviv airport was very cramped. Flight to Warsaw (B737-500) was pleasant with a tasty snack and wine served legroom generous. At Warsaw passengers were bussed to the terminal and then again to the E170 for the second leg to Budapest. Comfortable seat on-time pleasant service and tasty snack with wine. Apart from the tedious bussing at Warsaw this was a good product at a very reasonable price.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
As a weekly Business traveler from LHR to Warsaw LOT has been my choice for nearly 2 years mainly because of the convenient scheduling even though on average a business return costs approximately £100 more than with BA. Until recently all was going well with the occasional delayed flight which is normal. In the last few months all this has changed. LOT now have a policy of cramming their flights to capacity - as most passengers fly economy the result has been the compacting of business class to 2 or 3 rows with all seats occupied 6 across. The last 3 weeks I have been sandwiched into already small seats with no space to work or even sit comfortably. On one occasion upon entering the plane I was confronted by a 140kg woman in the middle seat with a crying baby on her lap. Her body occupied fully a third of my seat & I didn't fancy 2.5 hours under her bulges & a crying baby for company. When I pointed this out to the stewardess I was met with a shrug and told "flight is full". I asked how was I supposed to even sit here discretely so as not to offend the passenger concerned & was met with total indifference. Last night was the last straw same situation yet again with same uncaring attitude of the flight crew. I took my bag and left the plane. I went to the customer service desk where there were 5 staff 1 of which was working with a queue of customers 1 on the land line phone presumably to a customer 2 women on mobiles who I can only assume were on private calls due to their demeanor - the 5th woman resting with her head in her hands & elbows on the counter all with closed signs. I asked for the station chief and was directed upstairs to his office . On complaining of the situation again I was met with total indifference. No apology or attempt to placate me was made shrugs and said flight was full. Apart from the fact that a business ticket is purchased for just that reason to work the absolute apathy & uncaring attitude of the staff mean that I will never use this airline again & bodes very badly for their future as a competitive service provider to business users. I wonder if enough business fliers like me who spend in excess of 120000zl a year were to leave them would they even notice or care. I don't think so. This is definitely a leftover from the days of the Politburo and hopefully it will soon meet the same fate.

LHR-WAR-KTW- LHR. Very old 737-500 but felt sturdy. Refreshments good. Cabin Staff very friendly and responsive. It was my first time on LOT and generally found it okay. Small Embraer jet to Katowice service was fine

WAW-LHR Economy. On the whole service is quite good however my biggest annoyance is the use of small old aircraft on high capacity routes. On the Heathrow flights they are filling up old 737-500's. There are usually over 100 people in economy yet only 1 toilet for all the passengers. The whole experience on many LOT flights is one of being cramped. Competitors are flying newer A320's and A319 with 2 toilets in economy on similar routes. LOT is very poor at customer feedback. They never answer queries on their dedicated e mail address. They are good at Warsaw at getting special assistance passengers and passengers with young children through check-in and security.

NYC-WAW-VNO and back. LOT is horrible when it comes to being on time. 3 out of 4 flights were late and flight attendants should have been more proactive and sharing this information. I had special meal which was fine NYC-WAW but was less than average on the way back. Drinks are $4 each and lack any quality stuff. I appreciate them serving a small meal for the short flight from WAW-VNO. Friendly staff half spoke conversational English. Aircraft are older models and average at best. Seat buttons for the entire row didn't work for the NYC-WAW flight. Provided cushion and blanket. Seat comfort good for economy class.

Krakow to Newark in business class. The seats were old and did not work well. Was not provided with the normal kit such as eye cover socks etc. The staff was attentive. I would not fly again on this airline -it was marginal at best.

Chicago-Warsaw-Munich return. Seats were reasonably comfortable except on the overnight Chicago-Warsaw where my seat felt hard from the outset. Food good as food goes these days in coach - a hot meal with 2 choices as well as a sandwich meal. Sandwiches on the WAW-MUC-WAW legs. Inflight entertainment not up to standards of other international carriers - the 2 movies on main screens only were "B" movies at best - and my audio came through only one ear piece of the head set. My wife's headset was the same. LOT staff were courteous and efficient at check-in and on the flights. The baggage got where it was supposed to without damage.

WAW-LHR in Y class. Very quick boarding to a little bit old B737-500 and punctual take off. Crew was friendly and smiling. Drinks had wide range of choice. To eat I got Tortilla and later snack.

JFK to Warsaw - arrived at airport and was told flight was delayed until following day at 9am. I told them that I would miss my connecting flight They told me that it didn't matter. The important thing was to get me to Warsaw and then to try to find a flight to final destination. Came back to airport the next day at 9am only to find out the employees didn't even work until afternoon and that the flight was delayed until 11am. Then was told the flight was delayed until 1pm. When I called customer service I was hung up on! Finally I was told the entire flight was cancelled and they could not get me on another flight for 4 days! I insisted they book me with another airlines and they reluctantly did so and I continued on my vacation 36 hours later.

Myself and my partner booked flights on www.lot.com in November to Agadir in Morocco. We were keenly anticipating the typical LOT service and pampering on our 6 hour flight. You can imagine my dismay when upon boarding the aircraft we were presented with a menu card and a selection of cold sandwiches Knorr Barscz and peanuts for our long distance jaunt. I immediately enquired with the cabin crew that surely we would be receiving a warm meal on board. She replied curtly in the negative. Was this a joke? If it was a short 2 hour journey it could be forgiven but this was unacceptable. I explained that we had paid almost 2200 zl for our tickets on the LOT website and demanded to know why we wouldn't be receiving any warm food on the flight. She explained that this was a chartered flight and the tour operator decides if passengers have the option of getting a warm meal or not. So let me just confirm that. A tour agency I have no affiliation with decides whether I am able to avail of a warm meal or not? I explained that I had booked independently and had no affiliation with any tour group or agency. I was a LOT customer and there was no indication on the website that I was purchasing a LOT charter flight. I felt cheated. Seems that LOT Charter do a good job masquerading as LOT. To sit at 35000 feet for six hours without any food and to be told that you can buy a miserable sandwich for 10 zl is scandalous. Some people with a couple of children were spending up to 100 zl just for some sandwiches and soup. Shameful. On the return flight on the 27th Jan it became even more farcical. They ran out of sandwiches half way through the flight and there was no other option for people but to just sit there-grin and bear it. I feel that I have been cheated. I bought tickets which in no way could be considered low cost.

### LOT Polish Airlines customer review
AMS-YUL and JFK-AMS economy comfort. Out on refurbished MD 11 very comfortable seating friendly and staff. Interesting catering concept - small portions but good quality and packaging. Self service drinks. From JFK on B777 with 3x3x3 seating. First 5 or 6 rows are economy comfort with 4 inches of extra legroom. KLM charges 80 euros extra for this section - but onboard the crew has no issue with passengers re-seating themselves into this section which seems unfair to those that have paid for the privilege. Purser explained to me that it is KLM's policy to not enforce seating assignments meaning its free for all. Very strange while other airlines are perfectly well able to keep passengers in their dedicated section.
