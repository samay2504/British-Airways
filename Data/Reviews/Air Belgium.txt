### "Uncomfortable business class seat"
Air Belgium for Srilankan Airlines. Uncomfortable business class seat looks well used only good thing was the massage function. Mix of crew from Air Belgium and Srilankan mostly friendly. Food was tasty and filling a good variety to chooses from. Toilet wasn't overly clean.
