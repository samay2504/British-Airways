### "totally not worth it"
Bangkok to Moscow with Rossiya Airlines. Not the worst airline I flown with, but far from good. For the money they charge, service should've been much better. Food was average, seat comfort was none. Didn't get any sleep. Plane was packed, overcrowded, and even in these conditions the price for the ticket was outrageous. Because of that virus situation, it was the only airline flying and they knew it, so the price was unreasonable. I'm pretty disappointed, mostly because of how much money I've spent on this ticket, totally not worth it.

### "great service, nice food"
From Prague to Saint Petersburg, great service, nice food, professional group, price of the ticket was higher than competitors but worth it, highly recommended.

### "highly recommended"
Flying from Saint Petersburg to Prague, Rossiya is providing an excellent service, punctuality in time . Professional cabin crew working so hard, they accept Aeroflot points, highly recommended. I believe the company should be at least categorized as a 3-Star airline.

### "no complaints about Rossiya"
Moscow to Bangkok. Rossiya fly some of Aeroflot's long haul flights with ex-Etihad Boeing 777's. Their concept is strange. They still have an old personal entertainment system but it only gives you a route map. Really. Instead they have an inflight wifi-system, but to be able to use it, you need to download Rossiya app before the flight (wifi is only for the system, it's not connected to the WWW). They do not have power sockets is economy class and remember your own headphones as well. Our flight was on time. No complains. Food was ok, nothing fancy. They serve you two free meals with basic drinks (no alcohol). This will keep your belly full all flight. I've used many airlines, and I have no complaints about Rossiya. Ticket was cheap, plane was comfy and clean, flight was on time, service was ok (basic Russian style) and they didn't lose our bags. Good value! Just remember what i told you about the entertainment system.

### "no consistent business class product"
Denpasar to Moscow. Hard product ok as the aircraft has been flying for Emirates before with angled seats providing acceptable comfort. Huge screen, but only showing airshow. IFE works on your personal device through a dedicated app. Selection of movies rather limited. Streaming with some issues during the flight. Catering on level of premium economy. Some choices, but very basic food. Wine available - one white and one red, basic quality. No snacks between the two meals on a 13 hour flight (nuts only). Crew trying to do their best, very friendly. Overall no consistent business class product - huge room for improvement. Value for money below average.

### "friendly staff won me over"
Gatwick to St Petersburg. I was slightly apprehensive about travelling with Rossiya Airlines but need not have been! This was full flight from Gatwick to St. Petersburg on an A319. The plane had seen better days but was clean. When I checked in I asked for an aisle seat and was denied one. Boarding was very quick and I soon found myself in a rather uncomfortable seat for the just over 30 min flight. The cabin crew were very nice people and efficient. The service included a complimentary sandwich and drink which was appreciated. I plan to visit Russia again in August and will gladly use this airline. The friendly staff won me over. Disembarkation was via a bus transfer to the main terminal.

### "pleasantly surprised by the product"
VKO-AER. Overall, pleasantly surprised by the product. Online check-in via Aeroflot’s website was quick and efficient. Vnukovo airport is clean, spacious and comfortable with lots of Rossiya’s check-in counters and assistance desks. The aircraft was new and clean, although legroom was a bit tight, seats themselves were very comfortable. Cabin crew were quick, efficient and friendly. Free food included a nice sandwich, tea / coffee, juices and Coke. You could also purchase a nice craft beer with snacks. Overall, a very pleasant experience for a middle, discount-sector airline.

### "comfortable seats"
From Prague to Saint Petersburg and back, new aircraft Airbus A319, comfortable seats with a nice legroom space, cabin crew were polite, friendly and helpful. Rossiya Airlines is really good and I can say that they are much better than many other European Airlines.

### "All in all a nice flight"
Simferopol to Moscow Vnukovo. As I understood, this flight is executed on a wide-body aircraft in summer, this time it was Boeing 777-300. The flight itself was good, the aircraft was rather old but very well-maintained, seat width and pitch are really big, cabin crew was awesome: very polite, professional and understanding. Departure and arrival on time, the boarding process started an hour prior to departure - so the passengers had to sit in the plane for an extra hour. The queues for check-in were rather long, I prefer they to open more check-in counters. IFE is present but not working, but their journal is really interesting - I spend almost the whole flight reading it. Food includes a cup of water/tea/coffee and a sandwich, I considered it quite tasty this time. All in all, a nice flight but I have to decrease my rating because it was heavily overpriced.

### "strongly not recommended"
I flew Rossiya on a business trip Moscow to St.Petersburg return. First leg of the trip was OK, but the second one was terrible. First, they changed the seat, from 6D to 22D, unannounced. I first found out about it at boarding there a girl clerk (not smiling) bluntly crossed with a pen seat number printed out on a boarding pass and wrote down a new one at the rear of the plane. To my complaint she barked out; plane change, when I insisted, big aviation safety guy, who was loitering at the boarding desk apparently doing nothing but entertaining the girl, started to threaten me that he would put me off the the flight if I don't accept the seat change. Great experience for those who long for good old USSR style service! Otherwise strongly not recommended!

### "flight attendant worked tirelessly"
This A319 business class operated in a 3x3 configuration, with 3 Biz Class rows, middle seat empty, ala typical Euro Biz configuration. Initially a disappointment as was expecting 2 rows of 2x2 (per Seat Guru) with more spacious seats, but seat 1F had plenty of room and the bulkhead had a cut-out for additional foot-space which was unexpected/appreciated. Food edible (if mediorce) but more than made up for by very attentive service from flight crew. My flight attendant worked tirelessly throughout the short 3hr flight, she was kind, friendly, attentive and my glass was never-ever empty. Altogether a really enjoyable flight and Take-Off/Landing bang on time. Having been nervous about flying an Aeroflot off-shoot have to say this was one of the most enjoyable short-haul flights I've had in a long while. Rossiya recommended.

### "Overall a pleasant experience"
Friendly airline and friendly price tag. From Moscow (Vnukovo) to Prague. This has been already my third experience with Rossiya (previous flights to/from Barcelona). Normally, I prefer Aeroflot and in some cases used CSA or TravelService. Rossiya is fairly OK - easy online booking and check in, swift drop off at Vnukovo airport. No queue. Standard ticket incl. 20 kg baggage, 5 kg cabin baggage and seat selection (unless you wish to pay 500 Rub for extra leg room in front). Plane was new and clean. Leather seats comfortable and with sufficient legroom. We were served complimentary sandwich and cold/hot drinks. In fact, Aeroflot would not offer much more, CSA and TravelService are no frills. Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. Flight was on time. Based on my experience, I would rate Rossiya well above TravelService or CSA and close to Aeroflot economy (its mother company). However, Rossiya is a clear winner in terms of value for money. Overall a pleasant experience.

### "decent service for such a price"
Simferopol to Moscow Vnukovo. Was very surprised when saw aircraft type Boeing 747-400 while booking, and actually it was - which happens rather rarely for a 2h flight! Booking and online registration were done via Aeroflot interface and were quick and efficient. Ground staff were a bit annoyed but not rude. Simferopol airport doesn't have a possibility to serve wide-body aircraft near the terminal building, so we had to get to the plane by bus and it took a long time. The aircraft was a bit tired but nevertheless convenient, also I have no complaints for the cabin staff. Food (including a cup of water/tea/coffee and a sandwich) didn't look appetizing. The cabin is equipped by an ancient IFE system but it's not working for now. Came to Moscow in time, no delays. I managed to book this ticket rather cheaply (90$ OW, with baggage) so this is a decent service level for such a price. OK for short flights, but I consider that travelling this airline on long-haul routes may be bothersome.

### "an underwhelming experience"
Moscow to Petropavlovsk. Needing to go to Kamchatka for work, I decided to pay for business class, as I didn't fancy the 8-hour flight from Moscow in economy. Nominally part of Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines is nevertheless far from an equal to its mother company, and I was disappointed when I realised that the flight was operated by RA, as I have come to esteem Aeroflot on longhaul routes in both business and economy. Online check in was easy, and baggage drop was handled at Berlin Tegel by UTAir, who flew me the first leg. On arrival at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, I went to the pretty decent Rossiya Airlines lounge where I used the wireless, had a coffee and ate some fruit before going to board. Business class passengers (both of us) had a small shuttle to the plane, which allowed us at least to skip the crowded main bus. The plane itself was freshly painted with a gorgeous mural of an Amur Leopard's face plastered over the nose, which looked amazing. Inside, however, the cabin was quite aged, but the welcome was warm (one stewardess spoke English well) and I was glad that the business cabin was empty. The stewardess informed me that the entire plane's entertainment system was not working, as if she was letting me know that one of the meal options was unavailable: she seemed totally unbothered by this, and while of course I was prepared with my laptop and a bunch of series, this seemed really poor and I would have been furious had I be flying west and wasn't intending to sleep. A meal was served promptly after take off (salmon, rice and vegetables, salad and a dessert) that was of the standard you'd expect on a medium quality European airline's economy section, and then I went to sleep. The business seats recline fairly well, to around 80% and were fairly comfortable, meaning I got at least 6 hours of shut eye, which was the main point of flying business. A meaty breakfast and undrinkable coffee were served over the volcanoes of Kamchatka the following morning, before touching down in Petropavlovsk. Definitely an underwhelming experience, next time I will try to ensure I fly with Aeroflot proper rather than one of its subsidiaries, but overall I got what I paid for.

### "nothing outside of the ordinary"
I took a trip on Aeroflot from Moscow to St. Petersburg operated by Rossiya Airlines. I booked the flight late, so I paid a considerable premium on the ticket. That said, it was cheaper than the roundtrip ticket on the Sapsan high-speed train from Moscow to Peter. As expected for a holiday weekend, the flight was at or near capacity. The A319 had more leg room than my last flight on the A319 I flew with S7 airlines, but not much more. Boarding is not by zones, or by class it seems in Russia. It is whoever gets in line first, and a bit chaotic. The line typically forms quickly before boarding, and it is better to be early in line. Basic economy traveling is cheap within Russia, but like airlines worldwide the charges add up with luggage, etc. So everyone tries to just bring carry-on bags. Therefore, if you have carry-on luggage, you need to get in the line early or you might not find any overhead storage space. The flight is relatively short, about 1.5 hours, so you can tolerate a little discomfort. The flight attendents were professional, but not friendly. Once airborne, they hastily served a small, rather tasteless snack and choice of water, tea or coffee - no juice or alcoholic beverages. The temperature in the cabin was very warm - an experience that I have had on every flight I have taken inside of Russia. Russians tend to like it warm, but this was a bit too warm. On the return flight to Moscow, we sat in a holding pattern above Vnukovo airport for about 45 minutes and ended up reaching the gate 35 minutes late. No reason given by the pilot when he informed us of the delay, but delays sometimes happen because Vnukovo-2 is used for flights of high-ranking government officials. Overall, since I booked the tickets late it was an expensive flight, so value for the money might be skewed to the negative. However, that was my fault. That said, the flight was nothing outside of the ordinary.

### "kind and attentive"
I flew Rossiya Airlines from Tel Aviv to Yekaterinburg via Saint Petersburg in January. Both flights were on ancient A319's. No IFE of any sort. Flying from TLV-LED is 5 hours, and very long without any IFE. Bring a book. Crew very mature, probably ex Aeroflot, but very kind and attentive and you can tell they are serious about their job. English is hardly spoken, one girl could not even answer a simpe question of "how long is the flight" and called another girl to assist me. Food was very basic but no complaints. I sat in an Emergecy exit which was very nice, lots of leg room. I had the same seat assigned for LED-SVX, but for some reason at boarding it was changed for a regular aisle seat with no explanation or apology. Needless to say I was upset, and demanded answers from the head Stewardess, who could clearly see that my old seat was crossed out with a pen, and my original seat, 9C, was not honored. She tried to convince me in poor English to take a middle seat in the Exit row. I was not happy about it, but realized I lost the battle. A few minutes later the same head Stewardess offered me an aisle seat with the one next to me empty. It was a nice gesture, and proved that she cared about my complaint. That's rare these days in the airline industry. Catering was very poor, a tiny sandwich with drinks. Nevertheless,they brought me safe and sound to SVX.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
I used Rossiya around 30-35 times within last 12 months due to frequent trips to St Petersburg where Rossiya has its home base. Some good things happened due to integration of Rossiya and Aeroflot ground handing. Aeroflot is a quite civilized business so they taught Rossiya check in staff how to organize check in and how to politely serve customers. Ticket office services even despite coming to Aeroflot brand remain slow and helpless with insufficient staffing. Online services have all migrated to aeroflot.ru so all work fine. For some reason Rossiya still maintains its own website (quite shabby though) but clicking to check in or ticket purchase will all lead to aeroflot.ru. Inflight experience is well deserved 2 star with every effort put not to allow it to become 3 star. Meal service is the worst in the air (inedible sandwich plus cup of tea/coffee that are better not to taste). Bring your own food and drink from the airport. Their aircraft are second hand A319 with median age about 20 years or same aged B767-300 where seat configuration is 2-4-2. Toilets are old type (non-vacuum) so some terrible smells have accumulated within their lifetime. Legroom is non-existent on every plane type so I always try to get seat in emergency row. Seat comfort is the worst part of travel with them. Unbearable and painful if you're on a long flight. The crews are old soviet style. Even younger ones miss normal modern communication skills. Their English is usually incomprehensible so I don't get how foreign passengers can get flight info or even being communicated with. But there is one strong reason why this company is 2 star not 1 star. They are always on time. Not a single flight I was on have been more than 5-7 minutes late. Never. So that's why they fairly deserve their strong 2 star rating.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
I flew from MPX to LED. The plane took off and arrived on time. The airplane and the toilets were clean. There was no inflight entertainment. The crew were very present during the flight but with basic English skills. The seats were very small and a very reduced leg space. They served us excellent food. Very surprised of the quality for an excellent price.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
PRG-LED SU6222 15/8/14. LED-PRG SU6221 20/8/14. Worst experience ever! Very used old and dirty aircraft old staff! No shop (you can't buy anything) food was just some awful sandwich (thrown away) no alcohol no sweets. Staff were unpleasant. Absolutely can't recommend I hope it was my last flight with this company.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
A319 from FRA to LED on 2014-03. Very good seats sufficient leg room. Good food and beverages. I miss the glass of wine. No Audio / Video onboard but fine for 3 hours. However for this excellent price it is acceptable.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Samarkand and St Petersburg. Check in took about 1 hour there was only a few people before us. The agent refused to check in our luggage until our final destination which was Paris. It took 20 minutes to explain that we could not check in them is St Petersburg because we had no visa for Russia. The boarding was very long and they made everybody go out to board the oldish 767. It took about 20 minutes standing outside at night to get into the plane. The crew were unpleasant there was no inflight entertainment. The food was okay if you want to eat fish at 4am. We had a 1 hour delay on arrival and it took 1 hour to get off from the aircraft by bus. The following flight between St Petersburg and Paris was also a bad experience.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
I flew from St Petersburg after switching from the international to domestic airport. We all crowded on buses to get to the plane then we all rushed up the stairway to the plane with no lines no order no controls. The plane was full the seats were horribly tight I am only 5'11" but could not slouch even enough to let my head rest on the seat. The food was pretty bad though I was expecting worse. The lights kept flashing on and off getting bright dim flashing. It was about the longest 5 hours of my life.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
FV245 LED-FRA 7/9/13. FV246 FRA-LED 14/9/13. Flew this airline last month to and from Frankfurt-Main on vacation. The fare was quite high but I had connection with other family members in FRA so had no choice. The Airbus A320 was okay satisfactory and clean. The seat pitch well I'm 1.82m and it is rare that an aircraft is comfortable for me this one wasn't but it's a common issue. The flight itself was okay the flight crew were informative. The cabin crew were terrible. Not a single smile. Unkind and impolite. Fellow passengers asked about the reasons for the delay and got a very rude answer. Inflight meal was awful as always. Can't review the ground staff since I had an internet check-in (which took me half an hour to deal with). The inbound flight was on time the return was 1.5 hours late. Transit passengers lost their connection flights. The bottom line is that this is the worst not low-cost company I have flown with.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Ekaterinburg - St Petersburg direct flight. Check in was fast and easy. Flight left and arrived on time. Aircraft was an Airbus 319 and I had good leg room. Flight attendant service was OK but in Russian. I did not test their English although announcements were bilingual. Breakfast was served but was fairly basic. There were some problems with offloading passengers at St Petersburg (not sure whose fault) and there was an apology from the chief steward for the delay. Luggage was waiting in the airport by the time we disembarked. While it was a three hour flight there was no inflight entertainment.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
On a trip to Samarkand we chose Rossiya for the price. However the service is unacceptable. The comfort of the seat is horrible with a poor pitch. We had delay for all flights and the crew were unpleasant. In Samarkand it took 5 hours to leave the airport due to customs and immigration. Checking in the luggage for the return flight was long and unpleasant. They did not want to check them in to my final destination (Paris). It took about 20 minutes. Boarding took about 35 minutes outside in freezing temperatures.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
TXL via LED to Tashkent and back from Astana via LED to TXL. Flight from TXL to LED in an Antonow was great. Flight back from Astana to LED on an Airbus 319 was horror for 4 hours. Even me as a short person could not stretch out my legs. The transfer at LED was a bit unusual. We had to change terminal our luggage could not checked through from TXL to Tashkent. We had to pick it up in St Petersburg. Because nobody spoke English and my Russian is very limited it was difficult to clear the matter with the luggage for the next flight (LED - Tashkent). In the end it worked fine with some unusual handling.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
VIE-LED-DYU on 12th Aug 2012. Everything was OK. The price of the ticket was very low. All flights on time. Cabin crew friendly and nice. The food was OK. All planes were A319-Airbus but they were clean. My luggage was sent directly so I didn't have to pick it up at LED.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Online check-in did not exist so I had to use the desk even without bags. On-board experience was ok. The planes were very old B737-500 with non-existent legroom and An-148 where legroom was ok. The crews were mature but welcoming. Their English skills are very basic and announcements were just incomprehensible. Overall ok but very much post-Soviet style. All flights on schedule. For the price paid I could expect more civilised experience. I have never been able to accrue my Aeroflot Bonus miles on their flights despite them being a daughter business of Aeroflot. Overall very mediocre.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Flew Gatwick-LED-OVB have used this company a few times and have never had any serious problems. Flights have always arrived on time food and inflight service very decent. However flight was as usual on an old A319 Airbus that had seen better days and the legroom was a little tight (I am 5'10). Rossiya do not offer Echeck-in for international flights and you still have to collect and re-check baggage at each transfer which is annoying. Also still no in-flight entertainment. They do the important things well but need to modernise their fleet and operations. Overall very good value for money.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
LED-AMS. E-checking doesn't exist so 40-minute line at airport. Onboard almost no room between seats very claustrophobic. FAs are average with no charisma. Flights on time. Hot breakfast is probably the only plus of this airline.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
My wife and I recently travelled on Rossiya from Istanbul to St Petersburg. The aircraft was a second hand A320 which had been bought from a Spanish charter operator. It seemed nosier than other A320s we had been on and was about 20 yrs old. It was clean and tidy. Seat pitch was unbelievable we were squeezed in like sardines and the seats were like rocks. Food and service ok and we arrived on time.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Ekaterinburg to St Petersburg. Flight left and landed slightly ahead of time. Emergency room seat so had plenty of legroom. Seat did not recline. Breakfast basic but adequate and there was a choice. Flight announcements in English and Russian but cabin staff did not speak English not were they listening to foreigners speaking Russian. Aircraft adequate and there were no problems with the actual flight.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
London-St Petersburg-Novosibirsk. All flights on time cabin crew friendly and food pretty good and substantial. All planes were oldish A319-Airbus but comfortable and clean. I had to collect luggage and re- check-in after each flight which was annoying and there was no inflight entertainment but these were really only minor downsides to a trouble free journey.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
St Petersburg to Rome recently. Modern A320 with comfortable seating and good leg room. Cabin staff friendly courteous and efficient with limited English language skills. Overall very impressed ands would repeat the experience.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Kiev to St. Petersburg on new regional jet the AN-148. Leg room was a little tight but not unlike other regional jets I have flown. Plane clean service good and even meals were respectable. Flight attendants spoke no English and I spoke no Russian but my Russian-speaking son was with us so there weren't any problems. Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg - that's another story!

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Helsinki-Saint Petersburg a short 35-50 minute flight. The service is somewhat limited due to the short duration. Planes a bit old and a bit scary. On one of the flights next to my seat on an old A320 there was a square piece of plastic on the floor with a sticker saying Boeing 777. I was petrified but we flew alright. A very good middle between major expensive and low- budget airlines.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Very pleasantly surprised. Airbus in good condition and things professionally run. Good flight at very cheap price (St Petersburg to Moscow).

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
LED-HEL. Ticket much cheaper than the western airlines service not lower. The plane was an old A320 with standard seats. The flight was short they offered only sandwiches with water or orange. The airport is not that great but it is not the airline’s fault. The building was old and unpleasant.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Saint Petersburg to Tel Aviv around 5 hours flight. No problem with the service staff speak english. No space for legs between seats -. don't fly them if you are above 1.80m. No entertainment on flight.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
Helsinki to St Petersburg - short flight 2hrs or so. Seat pitch was fine plane was exceptionally old still had ash trays smelt of musky smoke must have been flying in the 1960's. Flight staff dont speak English only Russian which was ok no need to talk to them. Flight was delayed by an hour or so due to snow. Actual flight was a bit scary... never been scared on any flight before but Rossiya Air brings about a whole new flying experience. I probably would fly them again if I was desperate or on a tight budget otherwise fly BA or Finnair.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
STO-LED Boeing 737. Efficient flights but be prepared for a strange service concept. You are offered a non-alcoholic drink tea/coffee and a chocolate bar regardless of its early morning flight or a late night one. It's a short flight so you might survive anyway but in this respect I prefer the competitor on this destination SAS where you can at least choose what you want to buy.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
LGW-LED-LGW. Usually I fly BA but the ticket price with Rossiya was much cheaper than usual. I booked 3 days before departure e-ticket as standard. Flight from Gatwick registration quick and easy. Outbound flight an A320 approx 40% filled. Seat pitch excellent. The interior look is slightly tired but seats are nice. Inbound flight an old ex-Aer Lingus B737-500 filled to 80% capacity. Aircraft interior in a tired state. Food great as it was a typical Russian mash potato with beef. As an overall evaluation very good value for money.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
A frequent flyer with GTK Rossiya since I have to travel a lot within CIS and Europe. Recently I have decided to give up the choice in favour for this airline for good. First and major issue is there online booking service. Even if you have booked a flight online and you cc was charged it does not mean you are done. Often flights are being cancelled. Customer service do not even bother to inform the passengers about the changes in advance they just rebook you for another flight on another date (that happens!) and then refuse to make a full refund if you decide to completely cancel your itinerary due to the fact they have cancelled the flight on exact date you needed. To reach their head office in St Petersburg by phone is a nearly impossible mission since it is permanently busy. Reaching customer support toll free number is useless since they will anyway send you out for a personal visit to their office. As you can imagine it is very handful for business travellers. Visit to the office is a guaranteed 2 hours waiting in a queue. A typical Russian service for a not so cheap price after all. They do not have to care about customers satisfaction since they will anyway hold up to 60% of the market. There are basically only two sufficient airlines in Russia - Rossiya and Aeroflot. Both state owned and both with beyond bad approach to customers. Unfortunately no other choice. Its a shame that a huge country like Russia with distances of up to 10000 km from Central to Far East destinations can not offer its citizens an airline we could be proud of. Do not fly with Rossiya Airlines unless you have no other choice of course.

### Rossiya Airlines customer review
A major carrier serving St Petersburg (formerly Pulkovo Airlines). I was flying LED-CDG route on them and the airline is mediocre. Not bad actually but if you compare it to Air France ageing Boeing attendants looking tired nothing special meal. But what can you expect from the ticket cost round trip 150$? Nothing special indeed.
