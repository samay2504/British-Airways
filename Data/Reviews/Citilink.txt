### "her exceptional professionalism"
Not Verified |  I am pleased to commend Mdm Novia for her exceptional professionalism during our recent flight cancellation on 11 November 2024. After our Citilink flight from Pontianak to Jakarta was canceled, Novia managed all the necessary arrangements for our next flight with outstanding efficiency and kindness. Her assistance made a challenging situation much easier, and we are very grateful for her dedication and hospitality. She truly goes above and beyond in her service.

### "avoid flying this airline"
Not Verified | The flight was cancelled and rescheduled for a time that was inconvenient for our travel plans. To reach someone at the customer service was almost impossible and I spent multiple hours trying to reschedule the flight. The Citilink app didn’t work properly as well. It was a disaster. At Lombok airport, the company representative requested to pay additional fees for the same exactly luggage I brought from Bali to Lombok. She refused to take my credit card payment and asked for cash only. When I paid cash and asked for the receipt, she said that can only provide pictures of the bills she took from me. Try to avoid flying this airline.

### "cost to check baggage was $240"
First time flyer with Citilink. Not possible to check in for international flight (therefore not possible to buy luggage allowance online for $30). At checkin, the cost to check baggage was $240. Manager explains I had to buy luggage allowance by calling a special number a few days before the flight, before I checked in. They say this with a perfectly serious face. Where is phone number? Online. How to find? They don't know. How to know? Explained online. Staff was otherwise pleasant, if amateur. Seat was cramped as expected. Staff on plane was friendly. Flight was 1/2 hour late due to "problem with engine.

### "not able to check in online"
I was not able to check in online before the flight, apparently this doesn't exist for their international routes. So I couldn't pick the seat, but more importantly, I couldn't add any extra baggage- I knew I was going to be a bit over, so prepared to pre-pay. At the check in desk, was refused a bag to go at my feet, when I protested I was told "its a very busy flight". I was made to repack twice and eventually charged an extortionate fee to check an extra bag- when I questioned if this was more expensive than if I had booked prior, I was told it was. But how was I supposed to book extra baggage, when I can't check in beforehand? Apparently, you can go online in a period of time before just for this- not clear at all. And that "very busy flight"? A spare seat next to me, a spare seat in the row in front, and the three seats on the other side of the aisle a spare seat. I've been fortunate to fly with multiple airlines through south east Asia the past few months, and never had an experience as bad as this one.

### "I was more than satisfied"
Jakarta to Singapore onboard their Airbus A320neo. Check-in was absolutely fast, and they did not overcharge me for being a tad overweight having prepaid for my bag. The ground staff honored my window seat request without issues. Boarding started early, and the flight attendants were already 100% friendly right from the start as if they were already having a very nice sleep and ready to go. While I admire the freshness, cleanliness, and condition of the cabin, their decision to fit 180 boring old-generation Collins Pinnacle seats is something I always despise; these seats were thick which gave me less legroom compared to other slimline seats. It was, however, user-friendly and quite comfortable if you get past the legroom. Boarding started way before departure time, but that had no effect on on-time departure as we left 11 minutes late (well, it was just 11, so, definitely not a complain-worthy issue). I was given a bottle of water on this flight due to me having purchased the bundle. If I remember correctly, this was not mentioned in their list of benefits upon booking, so I took it as a very nice gesture. I could tell that the cabin crews were very seasoned and had done their job for years; they were friendly, courteous, and awesome throughout the flight. Landing was done early, and upon arrival, my bags were already waiting for me, tidily arranged by the Singapore ground staff. Citilink called themselves Supergreen, and they earned a Super-green light from me; no wonder they are a 4-star airline. Based on this flight alone, I was more than satisfied.

### "Do not fly with them again"
They kept rescheduling the flight one-sidedly. Was supposed to fly on 5.30pm, got rescheduled a few days ago to 6pm. And then got rescheduled again on the d-day to 7pm. This is very uncomfortable as people could have had plans. And there is no clear reason for the reschedule, only “operational reasons”. Wanted to reschedule to an earlier flight via their live chat, but got rejected. The live chat is also not responsive. The ticket price is not cheap as well, so it’s not value to money considering all these inconveniences. Do not fly with them again.

### "a delay of 5 hours 15"
I thought Citilink was a cut above most Indonesian airlines. Sadly not. Our flight was due to depart at 3.45pm; we received an email the day prior to departure saying the flight departure was changed to 7.30pm. Then a Citilink agent rang and asked if we accepted the changes. We had no choice as all other options at this late stage were fully booked out (it was Eid). Then on the day of the flight (today) we received another email saying the flight was delayed until 9.10pm, a delay of 5 hours 15. My wife is pregnant and this meant staying at the airport for hours on end. At one point, I asked about a meal voucher but a Citilink agent said the flight was not delayed. I showed her the evidence to the contrary but she would not accept the delay. Then, as a final insult, as we sit here at Bali airport, the flight has been delayed a further one hour. No meal voucher, no snack, no drink, no offer of compensation. This is Citilink. Never again will I fly with this low-quality airline.

### "could not check in online"
Terrible online service. The website is not in English. You cannot manage your booking online. I could not check in online. I do not recommend.

### "all in all great flight experience"
It’s a LCC and as such they do a great job. Check in was smooth. Without major hassles. The flight departed on time only to be held up by the tower for half an hour due to “traffic”. The seat was comfortable. They did something strange for a LCC. They fed all of us a free meal. It wasn’t the best meal. But it was a hot chicken. Meal. And also due to some social media content. They gave everyone on board a free gift of a t-shirt I’m sure that was a once off. But all in all great flight experience. Note no wifi and no screens. But that’s minor now days. Because we all have. Content

### "have not received a refund"
Our flight was cancelled for no reason (I was told by locals it was probably because some local dignitaries wanted to fly that day) and we were told we could fly the next day which would take 2 days to reach Padang. This would mean we would miss our boat from the Mentawis so it was impossible. We had to change our airline at the last minute and was assured because Citilink had in effect cancelled our flights we would be entitled to a full refund. 3 months later we are still waiting. I have contacted them many times but have not received a refund. I had even paid for the flexible ticket just in case I had to change things.

### "The flight was quite good"
The flight was quite good, the friendliness of the ground and air staff was very good. Quite satisfied with the flight this time. Thank you Top Choice for domestic options. Penerbangan yang cukup baik, keramahan Staff darat dan Udara sangat baik. Cukup Puas dengan penerbangan kali ini. Terima kasih. Pilihan Utama untuk pilihan domestik.

### "Uneventful flight"
Uneventful flight, lucky not having had any delay. Definitely this airline is the better (if not best) option when flying low cost in Indonesia, also related to safety. Don’t expect anything, even not a glass of water (when flying cheapest fare). Little seat pitch though.

### "found the customer service extremely good"
Not Verified |  First time using this airline and pleasantly surprised. Compared with other low-cost airlines, I have found the customer service extremely good. Knowing that the flight was delayed by a few hours, the staff did everything they could so I didn't miss my connection with another airline (Scoot) at Penang airport. I was surprised, cause usually airlines don't care since you are using another airline afterwards. In this case, they arranged for a staff to pick me up straight from the plane to the boarding gate. He helped me skip all the queue at customers etc. Without their help I would have missed my flight 100%. Thanks again! Also, unlike other low cost airlines, this one is not tacky and actually quite classy. The hostesses are also very pretty! However the plane was very late so I can only give 8/10

### "indicate free baggage allowance"
On their website they indicate free baggage allowance for international flights up to 20kg. The airline staff at the airport would not accept this and instead charged me 420 Malaysian ringgit (~£84) for the 15kg baggage, which was more than my actual flight ticket. I tried to dispute but they weren’t helpful at all. Then in-between going to a cash point (because yes they don’t accept card) to get the money and pay for it, they increased the fee by another 15 ringgit. They claimed the fee/kg increased when I left.

### "should be postponed or worse cancelled"
The flight delayed for 2 until 3 hours due to operational issue. After delayed that long, it ended up with changing the plane by saying the initial plane was broken and cannot be used for now. I mean, if you really know that the plane would not be able to operate, please immediate change the plan without giving false hope for the customer that long. Every people has their own plans with their times. Something that we can do on time, should be postponed or worse cancelled by this. Very harmful.

### "Arguably the best LCC in Indonesia to date"
Yogyakarta YIA to Jakarta CGK onboard QG9779. The light load of this flight means that the check in was done in a very fast manner, and the check-in staff dealt with our tickets and bags fairly quickly. The applaudable part of it was that the check-in staff was very conscientious. Knowing that our seats were assigned randomly, she willingly and proactively offered us to get a seat in the same row. That was very nice of her. Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by the crew. Once again, the light load of this flight meant that social distancing was possible - the cabin crews started moving several passengers who have asked for a seat change to seats A and F only so that a very safe distance was created. Seat was comfortable, well sanitized, and so did the cabin. There were not much to do in this short hop as we took off and landed relatively on-time. Overall, I can see why Citilink is rated as a 4-star airline and a 5-star airline for COVID-19 handling. Special praise goes to the crews and the ground staff of this airline for being conscientious, friendly, proactive, and smart. Arguably the best LCC in Indonesia to date.

### "cabin crew were friendly"
My flight with Citilink was actually great even though it was 40 minutes late due to operational issue (It is very rare because Citilink is always on time). The cabin crew were friendly and the seat is comfortable enough. The legroom is fine.

### "taking passengers time for granted"
Not Verified |  Flight booked for 9.10 am. Changed by airlines to 12.40 pm. Actual departure time 1.40 pm and no info from anywhere for the delay. Airlines taking passengers time for granted. Non serious airline. If you value time, never go for Citilink.

### "non-reliable in terms of timeliness"
Not Verified |  Pathetic service in terms of punctuality. No info from staff. For a journey time of 1 hour, flight delayed by 2 hours and yet no info anywhere. Absolutely non-reliable in terms of timeliness.

### "asked me to process the voucher refund"
During the pandemic the flight was not allowed to depart, so i decided to call Citilink for the refund and continue the process starting from April 2020 until now. The refund center remain silent and no response from May 2020 until now. I also asked on April 2020 if my refund can be change to voucher or reschedule but the answer is no because I have been proceed with refund process. but on August 2020 when I follow up the refund process, they give me the answer that the don't know how the refund will be done so they asked me to process the voucher refund. honestly if they told me during April 2020, I will directly process the voucher refund. but that time they said you can not process the voucher refund because I already process the money refund. So right now Citilink only silent and waiting for me to change from money refund to ticket refund.

### "make a refund for the flight"
They changed the schedule and suggest us to make a refund for the flight. I made refund for 7 people of my family since Feb 2020. They said that the refund had been processed in 4 April 2020, but until now the money not yet credited to my card account. The last chat on 24 May 2020, they said that we must waiting 30-60 business days until the money come.

### "super disappointment with the customer service"
Not Verified |  I have booked a return flight from Melbourne - Bali Denpasar and back. I booked these flights at the end of February. Unfortunately Citilink cancelled my flights and I have been emailing and calling them since the 3rd of March about my Refund. For three weeks they didn't got back to me were I had to ask a family member in Indonesia to help me with the progress. They finally emailed me back, telling me I had to fill in these forms within 7 days, which I did. And again they didn't got back to me for two weeks. When they finally did, they told me my credit card details on the forms and of the purchase weren't the same. How can this be possible if I send a copy of my bank details were you can see I bought the tickets with my credit card. I am super disappointment with the customer service. It has been eight weeks, and I still haven't got my refund let a long and further progress. Please Citilink help me out!

### "not refunded the flight yet"
I paid AUD4,070 for 5 return flights from Melbourne Avalon to Bali and return with Citilink on 20 January 2020. Citilink cancelled the flights on 2 March and on 5 March accepted my refund application. It is 20 April and they have not refunded the flight yet.

### "check-in took more time"
Makassar to Surabaya. Great Staff, The check-in took more time but not queue, The flight are crowded, I can’t choose the seat, My seat is the last seat. The cabin crew is nice.

### "Good and nice ground staff"
Surabaya to Makassar. Great aircraft, so clean and new. Quite long queue for check-in. Good and nice ground staff. The flight attendant is nice. Smooth flight, good boarding time.

### "cabin crew is nice"
Surabaya to Makassar. I got promo price for this flight. Great check-in time. The check-in counter staff is Somewhat, but I can’t choose the window seat, because there’s no more window seat available, And my seat is the last one on the aisle The flight is on time and crowded. The cabin crew is nice. Smooth flight.

### "cleaning crew found my son's bag"
On 23rd December 2019, my family and I flew from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur on flight QG520. After the flight landed in KLIA at 7:20pm, we went through immigration and collected our luggage. My son realised that he left his black Addidas drawstring bag with his mini iPad and his wallet of Indonesian currencies underneath his flight seat. We were still at the baggage claim and we reported our loss to baggage lost department at KLIA. The officer there called the cleaning crew who was cleaning the cabin of the Citilink flight that we took. He said he has found the bag and will return it to us as soon as the cabin is cleaned. We waited for a short while before meeting the cleaning crew who found my son's bag. We appreciate that guy's effort in being honest by returning our lost bag. Thank you so much.

### " A very high standard"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur via Surabaya. Landed a bit behind time, waiting at the bridge in Surabaya was a guy that took me down to the apron, radioed a car which took me to my flight on the other (international) side of the airport. Took me through check in, customs and immigration and told me to hurry along. Took all up 60 minutes, five minutes later through the gate onto my flight. Brilliant operation, would have missed it otherwise. Now compare that to my sister at Ho Chi Minh a day earlier trying to get to her flight to HaNoi. Pleaded to go to the front of the queue to get to her connecting flight, nothing doing, missed her flight and finally arriving there at midnight. This is a comparison of Citilink (caring) to Vietnam Airlines (miserable) A remarkable effort from a remarkable airline. Added to this was a nice little meal on this nice little trip. A very high standard. Hugely thankful.

### "cabin crew were attentive"
Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. I can't wait for my trip back to KUL on Citilink. As per schedule, the plane took off fro, Juanda International Airport and landed safely at KLIA. The nasi lemak presented to me was delicious. The plane felt new and the cabin crew were attentive. I would certainly like to fly with Citilink again in the near future.

### "food was given free of charge"
Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya. This was my first time on Citilink. When booking, I was pleasantly surprised that 10kg bag weight and hot food was given free of charge. The price of the ticket was also affordable. The flight took off and landed as scheduled. I would certainly fly with Citilink again.

### "told Row 1 is only for VIPs"
Denpasar to Dili. Selected Row 1 seats during booking process and confirmed through airline website seats were still selected. At checkin was told Row 1 is only for VIPs and was moved to Row 10. Asked if Row 2-9 available and told they were booked. After take off I noticed only 17 people in the first 9 rows. The Citilink ground staff in Denpasar care very little about their customers.

### "an administration issue with online booking"
Jakarta to Penang with Citilink. Check in refused because no middle name included on the eticket. No middle name was requested on ebooking, only initials, so this is an administration issue with online booking. Rude refusal by ground staff to allow check in.

### "took me 50 minutes to check in"
Jakarta to Penang. I made a booking through the website and paid. However, the confirmation email I received says my status is "on hold", they never sent me another email with further updates till the day I flew. On my flight date, I arrived at the airport and the TV where they display the check-in counters says Citilink counter 33-48, I queued and waited for my turn then the staff took 1 minute to check my details and issue my boarding pass, however, she soon realized her mistake and tore my boarding pass. She told me to walk to the international counters at gate 80-90. I noticed that I was on seat 18F. I got there and noticed there were 3 queues, 2 for Penang 9.55 am, 1 for KL. All 3 queues were not that long, and it took me 50 minutes to check in because the staff serving my counter took a long time to check in a family of 10. I get that it is a big group, but 50 minutes? Both the Penang queues weren’t moving. My flight was at 9.55 am, and at 9.05 am I was still queuing behind the same family. Eventually, at 9.10 am Penang passengers started jumping queues because it was so slow. They didn’t have an automatic ticket kiosk to check in passengers without bags. By the time she was done, I had to run to my gate. There was still a line to pass through immigration. I was on seat 30F because I was one of the last to check in again. The flight was similar to other A320 flights around the region.

### "I have never experienced a late departure"
This is not the first time being a passenger of Citilink. There isn't much that I can consider to be an advantage of this airline, because this airline is a low-cost airline. But one thing that impressed me with this airline was that until now I have never experienced a late departure. Their cabin crew is also one of the best behaved in Indonesia. I ordered heavy food during the flight, the fried rice they sell in my opinion has above average taste. Fly with Citilink if you don't believe what I said above.

### "today I missed the flight"
Pekanbaru to Jakarta. I am a weekly traveler and fly with this airlines twice a week. However today I missed the flight even though I have checked in, arrived at the airport early and waiting for more than 1 hour delay. The problem is they did not announce boarding call announcement thru PA and information board as they should be. They admit that the procedure was not followed and they apologize for it. Missed the flight. -No other flight available on the same day. Wasting time for 5 hours waiting and another 12 hours until flight to Jakarta using another airline. Disappointment and lost trust to the airlines. What do I get - a sorry. - A ticket of rescheduled flight to the next month.

### "cannot expect more"
Bandung to Surabaya. You cannot expect more from the budget airline but at least there is an option, regardless the route option and also competitive fare. This is my first experience with the Airline but it was ok.

### "we were refused for check in"
Denpasar Bali to Bandung. I didn't get to fly this trip as we were refused for check in because of some payment issue according to Citilink system. The ground staffs didn't care when I tried to show them the confirmation email we received with the itinerary and showing payment status was cleared. They didn't offer any resolution and only told me to lodge a dispute through our credit card provider. Extremely disappointed and will not fly Citilink anymore.

### "customer service excellent"
Jogjakarta to Jakarta. Citilink's customer service is excellent in my recent trip. An hour before the flight departed, I just arrived to the airport. Definitely, I missed my flight, but I got "express" check-in, assisted by the staff, including 3 of my bags! I received my ticket and boarded on time. In flight, I got seated on the 2nd row from the front, which was quite surprising because I was late. Really recommended for another great low cost airlines.

### "journey was comfortable"
Jakarta to Jogjakarta. Check-in was unorganized. There was no specific lane for each destination, while 5 lanes function as all-destination check-in. Nonetheless, I was able to checked-in. Departing was delayed for more or less an hour. When departed, there was no jet bridge, so passengers have to got in by the stair. In-flight, journey was comfortable and stewards were extremely friendly. Seats were really comfortable for a low-cost airlines. recommended!

### "not fly with them again"
Denpasar to Jakarta. I'm giving a rating of 4 is because the flight was right on time. The person at the check in counter let another passenger jump the queue, even after I told her what happen. She asked me if I want a window seat and I accept it (but instead assigned me in a seat between two people. Airport security they stop me saying I couldn't bring a camera tripod inside the aircraft. I had to return to check in and asked to have my main luggage back so I can put it inside they manage to get it back and I place my tripod inside. All of this took some time, so once back at the security they were already call for the last passenger for my flight so I had to jump the very long queue and try to find by myself the same security guy that stopped me earlier so I could ask him to pass in front of everyone. Maybe it was just a very unlucky day but I will not fly with them again.

### "Well organized service"
Well organized service by crew. I took morning flight by Citilink from Yogyakarta to Jakarta. Check in and boarding process were great. The crew guided passengers to line up toward the gate so as not to disrupted other passenger in the lounge. The passengers directed into the aircraft through the nearest door of the seat so there are not many queues. I think that was pretty helpful. Very nice airline service since the aircraft also took off and arrived on time.

### "can recommend this airline"
Jakarta to Yogyakarta. Comfortable Flight on LC Airline This is my first flight travelling by Citilink. Due to Idul Fitri long holiday, I was worried about the airport crowd and the busy staff. I found the ground staff welcome was nice. The check-in process was chaotic but smooth and baggage handling was good. They distributed free meals for breaking the fast and that was delicious. I could sit comfortably without adjusting my leg position because the seat was very nice. For my height 176cm, should be no problem to be seated on regular seats. During the flight, the cabin crew were polite and helpful. The plane took off and arrived on time, really good. I can recommend this airline and will probably use their services again next time.

### "landed ahead of schedule"
I took a night flight, QG109. Scheduled to depart 21:40 local time. Started to board the aircraft at 21:10. All processes were smooth. No hurry, no obstacles or anything negative. Took off on time, and landed ahead of schedule. Great team work for Citilink, and I mean it to all crews who handled the flight nicely. Because mid-June 2018 is the peak season for all flights in Indonesia due to Eid al-Fitr.

### "cabin crew is very friendly"
Denpasar to Surabaya. First impression with Citilink is satisfied, no delay. The cabin crew is very friendly and the flight is very satisfying without any obstacles. Hopefully the service is always getting better and unlike the other low cost airlines, which are often delayed in Indonesia.

### "seat is great for a low-cost carrier"
Flew Medan to Jakarta with Citilink. During the check-in progress I had an issue with my booking because I booked my flight for the wrong date. The staff at the counter were friendly enough and guided me to the office at the other part of the airport. It took a while, but eventually I was able to change the date of my flight. Furthermore, once in the boarding gate, the crowds were uncontrollable. The queue was unorganized. In the first 30 minutes of the flight, the aircon was not turned on and it was terrible. The seat is great for a low-cost carrier. Besides that, the flight is worth it.

### "Good service from ground staff"
Jakarta to Banjarmasin. On time. Good service from ground staff until boarding. Flight attendant also OK. Its low cost carrier in Indonesia. They give free baggage 20 kg. Free magazine (read onboard only, or download in internet). Online check in. Maybe they can upgrade their website like AirAsia which can to manage booking with add on.

### "attitude to passengers nice enough"
I took the first flight of the day from Yogyakarta to Halim Perdanakusuma, Jakarta. The scheduled departure was 06:00am. I checked-in at 05:01 am local time. Although the checked-in queue and the queue to boarding room was congested enough, the citilink crew and the avsec handled it well. We were called to board at 05:25 am. Citilink is a low-cost carrier, but I think the flight attendants attitude toward passengers are nice enough. Maybe because it was an early morning flight so everyone still grasp their mood so fine. We landed at 06:44 local time. So far Citilink is not upsetting me, except when we got delayed due to traffic congestion, or severe weather, which is unavoidable.

### "the aircraft is good"
Had a short flight from Denpasar to Surabaya, the aircraft is good also with the service. One thing made me a bit disappointed is there was someone sat in my seat even though I've did website check-in.

### "one of the best in Indonesia"
Jakarta to Surabaya. I chose Citilink because of its convenient departure times and prior experiences. Check in was a breeze at T1 Soekarno Hatta Airport. The ground staff was very polite, politely showing us the way to the plane. The plane was clean and the crew was friendly. Arrived safely in Surabaya. Baggage comes out in no time. In my opinion, this airline is one of the best in Indonesia. I would recommend this airline to anyone new to Indonesia as this airline is reasonably priced, on time and has excellent service.

### "couldn't ask for more"
Surabaya to Jakarta. Their ground service was good enough, I checked in easily and didn't take time too long. The aircraft was perfect, clean, comfort, and without noise. I slept before take off and got the aircraft had already landed at Jakarta later. I couldn't ask for more than this one, also with their cheap ticket price. Thank you Citilink!

### "service great for budget airline"
Jakarta to Surabaya. I arrived 04.30am at Jakarta terminal 1 for my 05.55am to Surabaya. I went straight to check in area to finish the formalities which the line was quite ok at that time. I went straight to the gate and for some reason on the departure monitor my flight will depart at 06.10am. At 05.15 boarding commenced and I use bus to the aircraft which park all the way to the remote area in Terminal 2. Boarded the aircraft at 05.30 which and I sat at 1D. Flight attendant were very cheerful and smile a lot. On board service was great for budget airline. Landed at SUB 30 mins behind schedule but I was quite happy since the FA apologise for the delay to each one of the passenger during disembarking.

### "I will recommend "
These were in total 4 flights Makassar - Batam (Gate to Singapore) and return. Check-in and ground facilities mixed. At Makassar  very good without hassle. Good English at the counter. Check-in in Batam careless with bad understanding english (one counter for all Citilnk flights). They did not issue the seats, they confirmed verbal. Best to book seating online. Stopover ground facilities in Jakarta domestic and especially Surabaya were dissatisfying. Kilometers of changig gate in Surabaya. Boarding undisciplined. Every dedicated seat on my boarsing pass on all of the 4 flights was occupied by another traveller with different seat reservation. To chase them off you have to.be rude, otherwise they do not give the seat. There are no free meals on flight (the longest took 2.5 hours), instead a trolley with most meals (noodles to brew in a cup). So most people buy provision on ground and take it with them. Important espescially water. Aircrafts were in excellent condition and cleanliness. Comfortable seats. Staff on board and ground was very nice and helpful. Sometimes a little bit jerky English, but it works. I think the greatest plus of Citilink. Flights were all in time. However, due to bad reputation of competing domestic carriers I will recommend Citilink for short distances in Indonesia.

### "flight attendants were very courteous and polite"
PKU-BDO, QG 982 using A320 registration PK-GQQ. Was planning to fly from Pekanbaru to Bandung with Air Asia but they stopped their service on that route and have to switch to Citilink - Garuda Indonesia Junior. Citilink is a low-cost subsidiary of Garuda and so during booking have to pay additional for seats and inflight meals but the price is still reasonable, so was able to secure seats in the first row. I was not hoping for much from a low cost carrier but the experience turned out to be quite good. Check-in was quick and with standard baggage allowance per person (20kg - 44#) at no additional cost. Airplane was brand new Airbus 320 with leather seats. Flight attendants were very courteous and polite, and they were also very helpful. We paid for our meals but turns out for drinks we also have to pay extra on board, and it is cash only. Restrooms were kept clean throughout the trip. Flight deck communication was adequate; we were given informations on flight time and altitude before we take off, and arrival time and Bandung weather before we land. Delightfully surprised that their hard and soft products were better than expected for a low cost carrier and if they are as aggressive in their expansion, they can give Air Asia a run for their money. Would use again if coming back to the area, and recommended for people who wants a no-frills flight with good service quality.

### "best airline on the route"
Dili to Denpasar. Citilink has taken over Air Timor's Dili to Denpasar charter and, while not as good as Garuda, they are probably the best airline on the route (probably the most expensive too). They had a shiny A320 but they had packed 31 rows into it and there was no legroom for anyone over 175cm tall. No entertainment but that's ok on a 1.5 hour flight. Staff were quite good, food was ok. Citilink is ranked as a safe airline by our security advisors - possibly just piggybacking on Garuda's rating but I didn't notice any dodgy practices. Gardua's probably trying to position Citilink as the premiere Indonesian regional airline and they seem to be doing pretty well.

### "flight attendants were friendly"
I flew from Jakarta to Semarang on Citilink. It was a flight near the end of the Ramadhan season, so, it's packed since most of the passengers are traveling to their hometowns to celebrate Lebaran with their families and relatives. The flight was the first flight of Citilink in HLP, which was scheduled to depart at 5:15. I was notified by Citilink to be at the airport 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure to avoid long lines at the airport, which is a bit upsetting since I have to be at the airport by 2:15, only to find the flight itself was delayed for about an hour due to "operational reason". Aside from that, the trip was pretty good. The ground staff were quick, but a little more smiling could be better. The flight attendants were friendly, informative, and helpful. The cabin was clean and comfortable. Overall, Citilink is pretty good, and I will fly with them in the future as long as they improve, especially in the ground handling and the punctuality of their schedules.

### "the seats were fine"
I took a brief flight from Jakarta to Balikpapan with Citilink and found it to be overall average. I had no genuine complaints about my experience with them as the cabin crew were courteous and the seats were fine. It is a budget airline so do remember that the weight limit for luggage isn't very high.

### "the best LCC in Indonesia"
Citilink from Kupang to Surabaya on an Airbus A320. Check-in was quick and smooth. The boarding process was fast and I was greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight departed a bit late but arrive on time. The seat was quite comfortable for me. Overall, I always enjoyed fly with Citilink and will consider to fly with them again. I think Citilink is now the best LCC in Indonesia.

### "seat is very comfortable"
I flew Citilink from Balikpapan to Jakarta during fasting so it's OK not to have meal by flying LCC. But they kept selling food for people who didn't fast and they did it politely to respect us who was fasting. The flight was smooth, seat is very comfortable. They provide us with a very good magazine so I didn't get bored flying without IFE. I will never doubt to fly CItilink and will recommend it for sure.

### "flight attendant nice and friendly"
I flew Citilink 2 days ago from Jakarta (CGK) to Surabaya to attend the wedding party at 10am. I chose QG 801 (suppose to land at 9.15am). The only problem I have was my name was not appear on the quick check in computer terminal, but one of the ground staff quickly asked my ID, and checked me in. in the normal terminal going into the aircraft, I was greeted by a flight attendant who was nice and friendly.

### "compensated the passengers"
My flight was supposed to be at 20.05 from Denpansar to Jakarta. At around 18.30, I received a text message from Citilink saying that my flight is delayed to 21.50. At the airport, when I asked the staff about the delayed time, they seemed clueless. It was rather confusing, since the boarding pass and information board showed the flight time at 20.05. After not receiving any news from the staff or from the information board, at 21.50 they announced that the flight is being delayed again for another 3 hours. Citilink compensated the passengers with food and ISD23.

### "enjoyed our experience with them"
We flew Citilink yesterday from Jakarta Halim Airport to Semarang. Check-in was quick since we didn't bring any baggage. Aircraft turnaround was fast and we got onboard in no time. Take off a little late because traffic. We didn't buy any  food and beverages onboard, but the price are reasonable. Landed on time. Overall we enjoyed our first experience with them. Consider to fly them again because the price is cheaper than Garuda.

### "nice cabin staff"
Bali to Jakarta. I and my family have a satisfied reservation for this trip. This is my first flight travelling by Citilink. When check in upon departure we handled by a warm ground staff. The flight itself departed on time. I found a nice cabin ambiance with a nice welcome greeting from the nice cabin staff. As a low-fare airline, there is no inflight free meals, but we can choose variety of hot meals from buy on board.

### "choose for my next trip"
Jakarta to Palembang with Citilink and the flight was on time. Ground Crew was helpfull and nice, cabin crew also nice and helpfull. Citilink keep their cabin and airplane in clean condition, meals were not free but you can buy it onboard, a typical Low Cost airline. Overall was good for Indonesia low cost, maybe the best. I'd choose Citilink for my next trip.

### "crew helpful and polite"
Flight from Jakarta Halim Perdana Kusuma to Semarang. Booked this airline due to the airport being located in Jakarta city centre - Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP). Airline changed the departure time without notification, I realized the delay through the web check-in and asked their call centre to confirm it. The check-in process was chaotic as they only have two counters open for 5 different flights. The baggage handling was OK for low cost airlines. The cabin looks good and clean. The cabin crew were helpful and polite. I sat on the seat 31A, limited space and limited recline. The flight was good. For value of money and quality, I recommed to fly with this airlines for short flights (1-2 hours flight).

### "cabin is totally clean"
Flying Citilink from Surabaya to Bandung, I didn't expect much with this. The seat is very comfortable. The legroom is large enough for my legs. I could sit comfortably without adjusting my leg position. The cabin is totally clean and looked very neat. One more important thing is that the flight was on time.

### "very pleased and satisfied"
I flew two routes with Citilink, Jakarta to Padang and Kualanamu to Jakarta in early October and was greatly pleased with the overall experience. The aircraft were in good condition, clean and airy, the flight attendants attentive, kind and professional in their demeanor. Most importantly the product gave the impression of well practiced routine and safety not an unimportant impression for nervous fliers. We were on time on both flights. The for purchase entrees were laughably cheap and in fact more than satisfactory ie. enak sekali! As an aside, their website proved to be the easiest one to navigate of the various Indonesian airlines, permitting trouble free purchase with a US based credit card. The fares were very competitive in fact in most of the routes I comparison shopped Citilink was the cheapest. But it certainly was not the cheapest in terms of product and experience. I do not see much difference with Garuda in terms of the quality, condition and state of the aircraft. Of course Garuda does provide snacks and meals included in the price of fare. I rank Citilink slightly above par with AirAsia and certainly much better than Lion Air. The only drawback vis-a-vis competitor airlines is that the Citilink route network is substantially smaller than Garuda or Lion, flying primarily between Jawa and Sumatera. Hopefully they can add flights to destinations in the Eastern part of the archipelago to give Garuda and Lion a run for their money. Very pleased and satisfied customer!

### "rather a good experience"
It was rather a good experience of flying with Citilink from Jakarta to Makassar. Check-in went smoothly, ground staff was very polite. There was a bit of a mess with the departure gate as they changed it while the monitors were showing a different one. Nevertheless the plane took off on time and arrived on time. Service was ok, no free food but what was available was pretty cheap anyway. I can recommend this low-cost airline and will probably use their services again in the future.

### "Citilink offer competitive products"
It was my first time flying with low cost carrier Citilink from Jakarta to Banjarmasin. The check-in process was quick as I checked in online thus we could proceed directly to the gate. Terminal 1 of CGK is rather chaotic area and it requires checking of document verification and boarding pass up to three times (twice by airport authority and once by ground staff prior to boarding). Flight experience was smooth, cabin crew were cheerful and energetic. They started selling selection of food and merchandise right after the seatbelt sign turned off. Attempted to buy coffee and sandwich but both items were not available during the flight. Seats are wide and legrooms are spacious enough for low cost carrier. For my height 168cm, should be no problem to be seated on regular seats. Not to mention that 20Kg allowance is included for my flight. Overall, Citilink offer competitive products in both service and aircraft which is new and well maintained!

### "seats were comfortable"
We used Citilink to travel from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Check in was handled nicely. However it was a bit confusing since our boarding pass said we would have to proceed to have C1 whereas the TV screens indicated that our flight was leaving from C6 and the information staff at the gates didn't seem to know the gate either. Having eventually arrived at the right gate (C1), we were waiting for boarding which commenced on time. Boarding was done quickly and efficiently. The flight experience itself did not feature anything unexpected from an lcc. There was a selection of drinks and food available for a little money. In spite of the limited leg room, seats were comfortable. After arriving in Denpasar, we quickly received our luggage. Overall an ordinary lcc experience.

### "low cost airline, buy onboard"
Citilink low cost airline flight from Jakarta to Denpasar. It was delayed 30 minutes and the flight to Denpsasar took about 1h 30 min. They didn't offer anything complimentary being a low cost airline, it is buy onboard.
