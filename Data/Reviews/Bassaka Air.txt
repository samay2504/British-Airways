### "everything went smoothly throughout"
Flew Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air. Nice short domestic flight with a very courteous 5B crew, nothing but smiles and the Best of Cambodian hospitality during this 30 minute flight. Was the cheapest option at $24 incl. baggage and an onboard refreshment and everything went smoothly througout. Would definitely recommend.

### "awesome flight attendants"
Phnom Penh to Siem Reap. The cabin crew on our flight were amazing. They were smiling and managed to provide every passenger with a beverage on this very short 30 minute flight. We will definitely be using Bassaka Air in the future due to the affordable prices, cleanliness, awesome flight attendants, and speedy service!

### "my last trip with this airline"
Phnom Penh to Siem Reap. Once a good airline now absolutely unreliable. Flying from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap takes 30-35 minutes but today our flight was delayed for more than one hour citing mechanical problems. This is rather unsettling especially since the last time I flew they had the same problem, but with a shorter delay. The staff hid in the back room so they didn't have to face customers and the Bassaka terms offer no guarantee of compensation for long delays. This is my last trip with this airline.

### "worst possible customer care"
Phnom Penh to Macau. Within 3 days we took 2 flights with Bassaka Air, Siem Reap to Phnom Penh and Phnom Penh to Macau. It is a great option to travel between the  Cambodian cities. In the first flight we had no incidents, everything went great, boarding, flight, great service. The 2nd flight was delayed for 12 hours and with no other options they abandoned me at the airport for that long. When trying to reach the company to understand what happened, after a few emails back and forward they just left me with no response, even after I reminded them weeks later. It's easy to provide a service if everything goes as planned. When something wrong happens is when you separate the best from the others. This was simply the worst possible customer care service. A

### "I hope they grow and prosper in the future"
No complaints about this airline on our flight from Siem Reap to Phnom Pehn in July. No queue at check-in, comfortable seats with plenty of leg room. The A320 is old but very comfortable and clean. Cabin crew and check-in staff very friendly and professional. The flight departed early and was in the air for about 30 minutes and they still managed to serve refreshments during the flight. Excellent value as well with the tickets for both of us about the same as travelling by bus. Would recommend Bassaka very highly and I hope they grow and prosper in the future!

### "brilliant in all aspects"
Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air and I found this airline to be brilliant in all aspects. Their prices are phenomenal and I couldn't complain about anything. Check in was super fast and done with a smile. The plane is a little outdated but its still new and growing. The flight itself was 30 mins, and for such a short flight you even got a complimentary drink.

### "courteous cabin crew"
Flew Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air. As I knew nothing about this airline I was a bit apprehensive, but there was no need to be. Check-in was fast and friendly. Boarding was by bus, and once on board the courteous cabin crew made us feel very welcome. The plane was definitely old, but very clean and our exit row seats had plenty of legroom. Other seats looked a bit cramped, but the flight was short. Surprisingly a quick drink was served during the 40-minute flight, which operated 10 minutes early. Overall a pleasant experience. The only negative was that the Fasten Seat Belt signs in the cabin were not working.

### "the staff were great"
I decided to fly to Siem Reap from Phnom Penh as it was a much quicker and enjoyable. I cannot believe the price of the Bassaka Air flight, it was pretty much the same as a bus. The check-in was the quickest check in I've had at an airport anywhere. The staff were great and it was the first time I've ever been on a budget airline where I received a free drink. Bearing in mind we were only flying for 30minutes. I can't speak highly enough for this airline.

### "fly with Bassaka Air again"
Booked 3 seats one way from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap on the Bassaka Air web site which only seem to be released 1 month in advance. FA's were very attentive in helping store luggage, reasonable English spoken. Cabin announcements were clear, seat comfort was okay. The flight is only 40 minutes with take off and landing, but they still were able to serve given either juice or water. On time flight, I would fly with Bassaka Air again, good price ticket $US 22 with taxes.
