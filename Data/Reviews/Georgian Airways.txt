### "just the worst"
Not Verified | Georgian Airways are just the worst. I bought a refundable ticket. I had to cancel my return flight, they said they would refund it once I landed. There would be a processing cost to refund, this is OK. They have kept my money and not honoured the promise to refund my return ticket value. I have chased for over 3 months and nothing. They ignore you! In addition the service onboard is just awful The plane is very old, in poor condition and dirty! It is also quite expensive, in terms of value for money.

### “Flabbergasted, exhausted and appalled”
My son and I had a flight scheduled from Milan’s Bergamo airport Tbilisi and due to an issue at the airport most flights were delayed, cancelled or redirected to another airport in Milan. Our experience with Georgian Airways is that they have zero customer service or any kind of communication to us or the airport, they do not answer phone calls, or respond to emails. Luckily, my husband was in Tbilisi and had to physically attend their head office to see any Georgian Airways representative. At that time, he was given a phone number of a person in Milan that is a key contact for the airline in the city. Initially, this individual was responsive and supported enquiries from both myself and my husband. However, as time went on, the Georgian Airways flight disappeared from the airport’s announcement boards and so did the support of this Georgian airways representative. She stopped responding to messages from me and calls from my husband. We had no information at all for 12 hours about the flight and then the flight reappeared on the airport information board as “cancelled” but no remedy was offered. My son and I spent almost 24 hours at the airport not knowing anything and how we might get back to Tbilisi. The next morning, as we were collecting our checked in luggage, an unscheduled flight by Georgian Airways to Tbilisi appeared on the information board as being “redirected” to the other Milan airport. These flights normally only run on Tuesdays and Fridays between Bergamo and Tbilisi. I contacted the Georgian Airways representative again, thinking this must be our replacement flight. I was not holding out hope for her response given her lack of communication back to me the previous night but her answer shocked me even more. She advised that our flight was redirected in the middle of the night and had already left Milan. Flabbergasted, exhausted and appalled would be the least of the emotions experienced at this point. I asked her how this could be possible when none of the airport staff knew anything about the flight until it was cancelled at 11pm, plus there was no contact from Georgian Airways via email or phone, no airport announcements, or contact from her when she knew I was stranded in the airport with a child. My husband had to go to the head office again and was only able to get a no cost replacement flight for us on the Friday schedule with my photo evidence of the information board stating the flight cancellation and evidence of the lack of response from their Milan representative in my WhatsApp messages. I do believe that the airline made up an elaborate lie about transferring the flight in the middle of the night to abscond from the service responsibilities - my husband advised that they were very reluctant and gave multiple conflicting reasons in order to make us pay again. I hope this experience deters you from using this airline or at least you will be fully informed on what to expect if things go wrong.

### “Flight was very uncomfortable”
Not Verified | Flight was very uncomfortable because the cabin temperature was extremely warm. Even with just a t-shirt on it was still way too hot. Service is not good. A sandwich and a cup of water. Later crew walks through cabin with onboard service for purchase. They don’t collect waste so the cabin was really dirty after the flight.

### "Be prepared for zero interaction with staff"
Not Verified |  I had a better experience than most of the other people who posted reviews here. The airplane departed on time in Tblisi and arrived even a bit earlier. Seats are comfortable. Checked luggage is free, which is very rare these days. Be prepared for zero interaction with the staff members in the plane though. Only at the entrance, the staff greets you. They seemed quite friendly though. There's no option to buy food and no information, apart from an announcement that the landing has started. The life vests looked quite old, frayed and stained, at least the one that the safety instructor showed (maybe the ones stored under your seat are newer). If you don't need luxury and you bring your own food, this airline is really fine. I don't know how they act in case of delays or cancellations though.

### "they refused to return money"
The worst air company. We purchased a ticket and a day before a flight they simply cancelled it. We called them many times and tried to return our money. We messaged them and by email they refused to return money! That’s a fraud, they sell tickets knowing the flight will be cancelled

### "No customer care at all"
Worst airline ever. No customer care at all. Before the flight I wanted to contact support regarding my ticket, but was not able to. The flight was delayed and they broke my luggage.

### "not recommend Georgian Airways"
I would not recommend Georgian Airways to anyone. I do not even know where to start. No customer support whatsoever. We wanted to change our tickets from Paris to Tbilisi due to death in the family. We were unable to speak to any airline representative. They put you on hold and disconnect after a 10 min hold. I tried for quite a while and had to stop. My husband had an extra luggage on the way back from Tbilisi to Paris. Airline rep refused to take Bank of America Mastercard and demanded cash payment. Only after an argument she finally agreed to charge the card. Our flight departure times has been changed multiple times. On board of a 5-hour flight we were only offered water one time. No other beverages, food, or snacks even for sale. Where is famous Georgian hospitality? Bathrooms were filthy, nobody cleaned them during the flight. If you can avoid this airline, please avoid!

### "choose an alternative"
Appalling. It’s shocking that airlines like this still exist. The outbound flight schedule was changed once, the return schedule was changed three times, the last just over a week before hand by seven hours. Neither flight departed or arrived anywhere close to their scheduled times. The plane was from the 1990s. The seats declined but didn’t go back, some lights didn’t work and worst of all I’m not sure the air filters worked properly. The flight attendants were surly, although I suspect their working conditions are not the best. Once on board a passenger was travelling with a cat and none of the passengers seated near this passenger were informed or asked about having a cat allergy beforehand, which further created a delay as passengers had to rearrange to avoid a person potentially having an allergic reaction during the flight. Check-in at Tbilisi was chaos, every passenger was pushing their way to the desk to the desk. There was no order or attempt by any staff member to create order. One advantage to Georgian Airways is that they fly direct to Tbilisi from Berlin. If a change or awful flight time is to be avoided, the experience is bearable, otherwise choose an alternative.

### "no customer support to compensate the damage"
I do not recommend anyone to fly with this company because they have 0 customer support and Georgian Airways is not responsible for any loss or damage they cause. In my case, they broke my suitcase which was split in halves. As I noticed it, I immediately concluded a damage report at the official Georgian Airways counter at Tbilisi airport, just upon my arrival. The manager told me to get in touch with 'Customer Service' by email, and I did it later on the same day. After two weeks with no single reply, I forwarded my complaint and the damage report to the email address again and included the general address as well. After a month of waiting for nothing I reached the central office of Georgian Airways on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. There were four operators working, and they told me they do not have anyone responsible for damaged baggage and no customer support as it is. They asked me to address the issue at the same counter at the airport having given a phone number for me to call. When I called the number the manager from that end replied that she is only in charge of the lost luggage and no way she can deal with the damaged one. I left Tbilisi and was abroad for a while and when I came back to the same airport I approached the manager at the same old desk of Georgian Airways with the same old issue. She shouted at me saying she does not know anything. When I demanded to leave a claim and paper complaint she refused to help and just started ignoring me. In the process, I have also reached the airport administration which politely said they can not assist me with the claim. So, the conclusion is obvious and just one. Georgian Airways is not responsible for anything. If they cause damage to you or your belongings there is no customer support to compensate the damage or simply help you. Be careful when choosing your flight to or through Georgia and never choose Georgian Airways, take care!

### "website incredibly cumbersome"
Not Verified | Didn't actually fly Georgian Airways. I attempted for a day and a half to book a flight on their website. Incredibly cumbersome and user unfriendly site. I got to the end and tried to pay, the site site churned for a long time then switched back to the pay screen requiring me to re-enter everything. This happened, I believe more than a dozen times. A couple of entries just resulted in a "failed" screen. If I waited too long I was required to additionally re-enter all my demographics. I sent an email to the airline requesting assistance. I received no response. The next day I tried again. Finally switched from my Visa to an American Express card. This resulted in being emailed an AMEX SafeKey code to verify I wanted to use this vendor. Being emailed the code meant that my card info had been entered correctly. I gain emailed the airline for assistance. 24 hours alter I've not received any response.

### "No Service on board"
Online-Check in is possible 24h before flight. Bag drop-off at the airport: 90 minutes waiting. Very slow and understaffed. No Service on board. Musty tasting water. Nothing else available. Pretty old aircraft. (No LED Lights, No Entertainment System) During the flight the staff is not just not attentive, but also not visible.

### "Worst company ever"
Worst company ever. For flight with 4.15h 1 small glass of plastic tasting water. I asked if I can by something, no, not an option. Very rude crew. Haven't seen in my life so bad attitude and they lost my bag with all my necessary things.

### "musty plastic tasting water"
Not Verified |  The total customer service onboard was one third of a cup of musty plastic tasting water. No food, no snacks, not even the opportunity to buy anything. No announcements about transit (we were continuing on to Birmingham). We were all bussed off the plane and ended up at Passports. Told the official we were in transit. She wasn't interested. The next hour was a back and forth of security, immigration, cleaners, rude assistants which resulted in several people missing their connections and us having to run for 10 minutes to scramble onto our flight. I'm 67.

### "they are now ignoring me completely"
Terrible experience. Missed my connecting flight because of their huge delay. They then sent me to Vienna anyway where I was stuck for 2 nights. They said I could just speak to the desk that didn’t exist. No one helped and I had to end up paying huge amounts for hotel and transfers. Lots of other people in the same situation, they are now ignoring me completely and offering no compensation.

### "don't care about passengers"
Flight Vienna to Tbilisi was delayed for 2.5 hours, as a result i missed my second Flight home. They work very slow and don't care about passengers, even on board, no food or rttention There were no available flights on the next days and i have to stay in Tbilisi until 4th August.

### "a bad advertisement for Georgia"
I bought a ticket with Georgian airways (251,2 €). They cancelled the flight one month in advance, but I found it out by myself, as they did not contact me first. I asked them what to do. They sent me a false ticket (flight not existing), and then they stopped answering me. Finally, they never helped me to find a solution. I had to buy a new ticket at the last moment with another company in order to fly to Georgia (I went with friends). so I had to pay an expensive ticket (> 300 €). Since that time, I wrote them several times and I never got an answer. I am starting to be desperate to get back my money. What a bad experience and a bad advertisement for Georgia country.

### "Ground service is non-existent"
If you want to fly cheap, go for it. But beware: planes are 99% late. Ground service is non-existent (like priority boarding. Don't book any extra service, you only will be disappointed.

### "Never flying with them again"
Not Verified | No food (only water) offered on a 5 hour flight, it's a disgrace. Also not allowing hand luggage for a child to be checked in for free when with other airlines we've been offered that. Charging ridiculous 130 euro to check in a bag at the airport. Airline magazine at the airplane 2 years old (from 2020). They don't want to do anything for their passengers, just find easy way to take money. Never flying with them again.

### "waiting for the refund for more than a year"
Have been waiting for the refund for more than a year. My flight was supposed to be in September 2020. But it was canceled. I started to contact Georgian Airlines and in the first months, I did not receive a response from the airline at all. Then after continued pinging, they respond to me that they will refund my money and asked for my bank details. I provided this information on 11th September 2021 and then on the 15th of September, they promised that funds will be transferred within 15-20 business days. On the 22nd of October, I asked them by email about my refund. They answer that it will take a little more time. After 40 working days had passed I wrote them again on 9th of November. Since then they are not answering my emails with compliance. They are completely ignoring me. It is normal for Georgian Airlines representatives to ignore you or finish the conversation in the middle. They make promises on a regular basis and don't keep them. None of the provided dates are accurate. They are just holding up the money for no reason. I think that such actions are inappropriate. I don’t recommend to anyone to buy tickets at this company. You will just lose your money and get a lot of problems.

### "They have the worst support ever!"
Not Verified |  They have the worst support ever! No online option for cancelling a ticket. When I wrote to them to cancel the ticket, they answered me once with the options. When I have told them what to do, they have not replied again. I tried to call them various times, but each time after 5 minutes the call is being ended because nobody picked up.

### "I still haven't received the refund"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled due to Covid measures in Georgia. Understandably, of course. Everything was clearly communicated up front. However, afterwards the communication with the customer service, the claims department and the Amsterdam department were horrible. No one could tell me exactly how I could claim my refund, whereas it was clearly stated that I was elligable. Now, more than a year later, I still haven't received the refund or a clear message about the way this should be (or should have been) handled. The email-contact is very vague and they keep telling me they'll check for updates and then I don't receive any follow up. Terrible service overall.

### "still did not get any reimbursement"
After months of phonecalls and mailing, we still did not get any reimbursement of our canceled flights due to Covid in July 2020. Several promises, but no money. Shameless.

### "airline does not refund the costs"
London to Tbilisi. Both of my flights scheduled for April have been cancelled by the airline. The airline does not refund the costs of the flights cancelled and violates the international regulations of CAA. Moreover, the customer services are unresponsive - dead silence is what you get when you send emails requesting a refund. I would urge everyone to please never use this airline.

### "absolute silence"
Prague to Tbilisi. Planned departure in Prague: 09.50. After 14 hours and no information, it started shortly before midnight. Since Georgian Airways does not have a representative in Prague, CSA takes over, who tried hard but did not know anymore. Overall, there was not a single official statement. Emails remained unanswered, no telephone contact, our hotel in Tbilisi was able to help us at least with vague information. Then the info, last attempt to upload an update to the computer system. Replacement of the aircraft impossible. The company has only 8 aircraft. Next flight, two days later. In the meantime, the mood if the passengers went down, armed police officers were already gathering at the gate! Then departure, hoping that the technicians will do a better job than the airline. Flight okay. The crew as annoyed as the passengers. No apology or explanation. Notes on passenger rights were distributed at the airport. We have tried to perceive this and claim reimbursement according to European guidelines. One answer by mail 3 weeks later. It has been said that decisions are always made in a "commission" in the third week of the month but since then absolute silence. Our flight was on September 30th, 2019. Obviously nobody at Georgian Airways has understood that good complaint management also means customer satisfaction. We will definitely visit this great country again, but the airline will definitely not be Georgian Airways.

### "feel discriminated against"
I feel discriminated against the basis of my daughter's disability and would like to file a complaint. On September 20, at 18:30, I was flying with my daughter from Tbilisi to Bologna. I was accompanying my daughter who had been diagnosed with Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) since birth. For your information, people with DCP have problems controlling the movement of their hands, arms, feet, and legs, making it difficult to sit and walk. By 18:30 all the passengers were already inside the plane, however no one had approached us nor told us to get into the plane. I was standing there with my daughter not knowing what to do nor how to take my child to the place without a wheelchair. There was no accommodations for our circumstance. All I could see around was rude, incompetent staff who were scruffy, sour faced and unhelpful. They were screaming instructions repeatedly without breaking from their script to answer any questions. The immigration officers would do nothing but look at us and order to wait. When I asked the officer standing there when the attendant would take my daughter inside the plane on a wheelchair since the plane was almost ready to take off, I received an extremely rude answer, "I don't know! Wait! Wait for what when the plane was almost taking off?! Do the airport staff ever receive special training to learn basic customer service?

### "I would never fly with again"
Not Verified |  Tbilisi to Manchester. The only airline I would never fly with again. They were so rude and incompetent. There was a problem with my e ticket but they allowed me to proceed to the gate and the denied me boarding saying I should have had a paper ticket from Manchester. They denied me boarding with my luggage because I didn’t have exactly 23kg, it was 23kg and 800gr. They tried to rip me off for another 800 gr. and I was with 3 little children one of them is only 4 and they forced me to repack all my 3 suitcases in front of the queue. I've never felt myself so embarrassed and so stressful. And of course they lost my luggage. I’m still trying and fighting with this rubbish company to get it back. I said to myself - Never  again, no matter how low the fare is!

### "they are unresponsive"
Not Verified |  Tibilisi to Amsterdam. This is one of the most shocking, scummy and poor airline I have ever flown with and I travel a lot! We booked flights with this airline to Armenia and then we had connection with this airline on our way back to UK via Amsterdam. They didn't informed us about cancellation and they didn't care to apologies or even show any curtest towards their customers. Very unreliable changing times of their flights all the time so please if anyone buy flights with this airline always check few days before flying. As an airline they are unresponsive and will refuse to pay money back for cancellation or just lie to your face about it. Their English is extremely poor so is Russian so I'm not sure what other language you can communicate with this airline apart from Georgian. The food on the plane was disgusting. And we haven't received refreshments at all not talking about the water which you would think would be basic human right. The entertainment on a long flights is non existent and staff does not bother. On our flight back stewardess was sleeping all the way to Amsterdam at the back and if anyone was trying to use toilet at the back of the plane other stewardess was barking at people and could not be more rude and annoyed with people actually being on the plane.

### "delayed at Tbilisi for 6 hours"
Not Verified |  Tbilisi to Gatwick. We are currently delayed at Tbilisi for 6 hours. We have tried to get the basics, like water and somewhere for the young children to rest. But we are getting fobbed off. The two airline reps have now disappeared. Its seams they are happy to deny even children the basic rights of water.

### "don’t take this airline"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tbilisi. Hilariously poor and incompetent airline. Even though we were the only flight leaving Gatwick past 11pm, somehow they managed to delay the flight by 1 hour due to a busy airport. Which was obviously just an excuse as we saw that the pilots and staff hadn’t made their way onboard until 5 mins after the flight was scheduled to leave. Even though it was a flight from London to Georgia, the staff didn’t speak English beyond conversational. During the delay, we had no communication or offer of anything To keep us warm in the aircraft that had the air con on at midnight. During the flight the staff seemed completely uncaring and incompetent of the people on board. Even though it is cheap, don’t take this airline.

### "crew were very pleasant"
Check in was late opening and the agent was very unfriendly. However there was no queue. Tbilisi Airport is very easy and quick to navigate through, and Georgian Airways use a third-party lounge (Prime Class) which you see as soon as you get through passport control. The lounge is fantastic. Boarding was very quick, but no priority boarding was offered. The aircraft was changed from an E190 to a CRJ200, which was quite old and rather uncomfortable. The business class seats were European short haul style (ie normal seats), with very little legroom, and even less width. For a 30 minute flight it was fine, but I wouldn't have wanted to spend any longer on it! The service consisted of a pre departure bottle of water, and a drink during the flight. I obviously don't expect a meal on such a short flight but some kind of snack would have been appreciated, but they didn't have anything! The crew were very pleasant and spoke good English. No communication from the pilots however. We left and arrived early. For a short hop I'd have no problem flying Georgian again, though I would think twice before booking a longer trip.

### "strive mightily to avoid them"
Gatwick to Tbilisi. I purchases tickets in August, for a November flight. We were arriving from the US to Gatwick, and were to connect same day from Gatwick to Tbilisi. Georgian Air decided sometime (September? October?) to change to a fall schedule, which did not include a monday flight to Tbilisi. Georgian Air never emailed or called. We learned approximately 3 weeks prior to our late November flight, that we would be arriving in London on a Monday, but could not connect to Tbilisi until Wednesday. Georgian Air never 1) attempted to place us on another carrier for same Monday, 2) offered a partial or full reimbursement for the flight or expenses or inconvenience,nor 3) apologized at all. Georgian Air placed me on the Wed flight and said “all is fine, your flight is good for Wed”. This cost me 2 hotel nights in London (not cheap) plus train tickets to/from Gatwick to hotel, plus food for 2 days, AND we missed the business meeting that we were flying to, anyway. For a 5+ hr flight, they rattle around for the first 2 hrs, then wake you more than an hour prior to landing, for no apparent reason, so don't plan on getting to sleep any significant amount. The crew is friendly and seem very competent, but the airline is apparently disorganized and has no idea how to compensate clients when they cost them unbudgeted funds. I may have no options but this airline in the future, but I will strive mightily to avoid them.

### "absolutely shocking"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tbilisi. Horrific experience. We booked in January for a 50th birthday - Georgian cancelled our return flight with a week's notice. No apology. Refused to rebook us on an alternative carrier despite this being in their T&Cs. Said they could not book us on Baltic Air - even though they have a code share. offered us very slightly over half the total that we had paid as a refund, giving a precise sum that we could expect - so we went ahead and paid more to book a return flight with Baltic ourselves. Georgian then paid only 577 euros out of the over 800 euros that they had said they would pay, and claimed the 800+ was a mistake. How, when 500 was only 1/3 of what we paid originally? They were also exceptionally rude on the outbound flight, refused to serve one of us a meal, no idea why. The food was truly appalling. And the flight was 2 hours late. All in all, absolutely shocking and I would not touch them with a bargepole.

### "cheap low-cost airline"
Pros - Direct flight from Barcelona to Tbilisi. Competitive prices. Aircraft is comfortable. Cons - Can't choose your meal, No in-flight entertainment. Aircraft is rather small (Embraer 190), yet comfortable. Can't beat direct flights and good prices, other than that it just feels like a cheap low-cost airline, but still my preferred option for my location.

### "I expected better"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tbilisi. Not a good airline. Flight was expensive and I expected a better experience on board. There were seat back screens but they weren't on for either of my flights. No meal choice and food was the worst I've ever had on a plane, no fresh ingredients. The only drink was water or alcohol, tea, coffee, lemonade - no juice or other soft drinks. On the plus side, both flights were on time and smooth with good take off and landing. I picked them because the flight was direct, but wish I'd taken an indirect route on a better airline and for much less money.

### "Very impressed"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tbilisi return. First flights on Georgian Airways. Very impressed. Check in at Gatwick and Tbilisi was polite and efficient. Take off from Gatwick on time. Staff efficient but a little austere (probably language barrier). Food was good. Seat was generous with good legroom - especially on way back. Return flight delayed 1 hour but we were informed of this immediately on check in. Staff on the flight back were very good. Good food and drink. It is true there is no inflight entertainment but who really misses this on a 5 hour flight. Read a book! On the return I spent most of the time looking out of the window or dozing. At the height we were at you could see the cities of Romania, Bulgaria, Germany and so on lit up. Very entertaining . Plus clouds illuminated by lightning. I have not seen this from above before.

### "flying was like 25 years ago"
Not Verified |  Tiblisi to Gatwick. I've already written one review of Georgian Airways which was submitted prior to my first flight with them but I've now returned from Tbilisi. I'd say that if you want a taste of what flying was like 25 years ago then Georgian is your best bet. There is no IFE, no choice of menu, unsmiling steward/hostess service, and unintelligible safety and pilot announcements. On the plus side leg room is good and both flights were on time but there is nothing special or even average about the service and the airline which would make me recommend them to anyone. The head office service is no better than the cabin service so it took numerous phone calls after arriving in Georgia as well as a one hour visit to their head office to sort out arrangements for alternative inbound flights, as referred to in my first review. No one replied to our emails and FaceBook messages and no one returned any of our calls despite promising to do so.

### "ignorant customer service"
Not Verified | Four of us were due to to fly Gatwick to Tblisi 30/06 and return 09/07 but on 21/06 they emailed us to tell us that our inbound flight had been cancelled and asking to to contact them urgently about changing our return flight to either 7 or 11/07. We replied to their email 3 or 4 times without reply, we called their London sales agent who couldn't do anything except forward our emails to the Georgian head office but again there was no reply, and we called them in Georgia but either no one answered for up to 30 minutes at a time, or didn't know what to do when they did answer, or said they would call back but never did. I also tried FB messenger and received a reply saying that my message would be passed to the right department but again there was no real reply. Right now one day before departure we don't know if we have been re-booked or what we will have to do about booking more accommodation to match the later return flight. I have never experienced so poor and ignorant customer service from any organisation let alone from an airline. They cancelled our flight but have made it all but impossible to contact them or to help us re book.

### "seat pitch was good"
Tbilisi to Prague. After having read the reviews, we were expecting the worst, but there was no reason for that. Tbilisi airport is new, clean and easy to navigate. Check-in was swift and although we had a connection on a different airway, with some magic the agent was able to label our luggage through to our final destination. Safety screening and immigration only took a couple of minutes and also boarding was swift and organized. Seat pitch was good and seats comfortable. Flight attendants were friendly. The food was nothing to write home about, but in an era where lots of airlines let you even pay for water, who’s complaining. We did not drink wine as it was still early morning, but the brand they served is good. The further uneventful flight departed and arrives only a couple of minutes after the scheduled time.

### "completely ignoring my messages"
Kiev to Tbilisi booked for June 2018. It's terrible how they treat their clients. The airline just canceled the flight and do not answer any of my letters for two weeks. I wrote three times on FACEBOOK page - where they promised me to answer my letters but still no answer. I planned the trip for my mother. She has been dreaming about this trip her whole life. That's terrible how they behave with the customer. They're completely ignoring my messages.

### "unprofessional for an airline"
Tel Aviv to Tbilisi. I had an issue that I have not experienced in the hundreds of times that I have flown, which Georgian has failed to resolve. I booked a ticket and when I arrived at the ticket counter, they were unable to find my reservation. I dug further and found they cancelled it and made me buy a new ticket at the desk at a higher price. I find this suspect as I bought a ticket on another airline that same day and had no such issue with payment or ticketing. As a result, I was overcharged $80 having to buy a new ticket at the gate because they failed to properly issue my original. To make matters worse, all documentation and forms I have submitted to the airline to receive a refund for the difference between my original reservation and my gate ticket price have gone unanswered. I think both to be very unprofessional for an airline with international presence.

### "would also not recommend"
Service inconsistency. Flying two legs with Georgian Airways from Prague to Tbilisi and from Tbilisi to Moscow. Cabin crew was very efficient and pleasant. We were served a very good food. Overall a very pleasant experience. Unfortunately, flight from Tbilisi to Moscow on Boeing 737-700 was very different, nowhere close to the previous flight. I felt, this must be a different company. Food was absolutely terrible, cabin crew was mostly invisible. The plane was also old and not very clean. Given the service inconsistency, I would hesitate to use Georgian Airways again and would also not recommend.

### "worst flying experience"
Tel Aviv to Tbilisi. This is the worst flying experience we ever had. First the flight is rescheduled for 4 hours earlier and we get the notice on the same day.then they fly us to Kutaisi instead of Tbilisi and just leave in the airport with zero information. No agent in the city. No information when can we expect the flight. They say - you can take a taxi on your own. This is officially the most ignorant, unrelevant and low service airways ever. Never again!

### "helpful and nice staff"
Tbilisi to Yerevan. This is a short trip with Georgian airlines. The flight time is just 25 minutes from Tblisi to Jerewan. Check in opened 2 hours before departure, helpful and nice staff. Transfer with bus to the small Canadair regional jet aircraft, nice interior just one air hostess. Mineral water was served during the flight and the captain gave information on the flight via the loudspeakers. Nice flight with great views.

### "seats that don't exist"
Yerevan to Tblisi. First at the Yerevan airport check-in counter for Georgia Airways flight to Tblisi at 15:40, there were two counters. One of the counter system broke down leaving only one counter operational. We were behind the queue with the non functional system, and had to join the other one. We waited 50 mins. Then the counter lady issued us a ticket with seats no 14A and 14C. As we boarded the plane, we found that there were no seats 14A and 14C. The rows ended at 13. It almost became a joke as I've never boarded a plane that issued tickets with seats that don't exist. Luckily there were some spare seats at 13.

### "cabin service was kind"
In C class from Vienna to Tbilisi and back, connecting both ways on OS from/to New York. Both flights left right on time. Their C class is a comfortable 2x2 with ample pitch. Cabin service was kind and the food (aside from the main courses) pretty tasty. Too bad about the clueless check in staff in Tbilisi, who couldn't issue connecting boarding passes (on a codeshare!) or explain how to get boarding passes in Vienna, several passengers with tight connections were quite nervous. It took half an hour and a supervisor to get a reasonable explanation. Other than that, Georgian Airways is a nice airline.

### "crying and anger at this situation"
My girlfriend and I were booked to fly Georgian Airways flight to Paris to get on our connecting flight to Madagascar. My girlfriend wasn't allowed to fly out of Tblisi where Georgian Airways claimed she needed a transit visa to fly through Paris on the way to Madagascar. We had no intention of leaving the airport in Paris and simply wanted to board our next flight. We were told by the staff that they were scared she would try to run off in Paris and they would have to pay a fine and basically treated us terribly for the 6 hours we were there. My girlfriend has an Armenian passport but she's currently held visas to the US and Europe. This whole story of transit visas is ridiculous and I've never heard of such a thing. We phoned two French embassies, and both agreed there was no case for a transit visa. So after not being able to fly and losing our tickets and 2,000 euros which the ticket seller refused to refund (because a transit visa is not needed and isn't a valid excuse!) we went back down to Armenia and had to rebuy last minute tickets for 5,000 euros, and we flew to Madagascar with Air France via Paris without any transit visa or any hassle and went on to join our holiday. But the agony, the tears, the money, and overall inhumane treatment at Georgian airways was more then I can bare. The staff really treated her like she was some form of criminal. The money I lost on this trip is not nearly painful as all the crying and anger at this situation and it ruined the whole mood at the start of this wonderful celebratory trip we were about to undertake. Now Georgian Airways won't even respond to complaint emails.

I recently flew from Vienna to Tbilisi and back. Both flights were operated by a clean CRJ aircraft. Both flights departed and arrived on time. The flight attendants were very kind and spoke English really well! Food on board was great! Both flights were fully packed with passengers. Seats were a little cramped but still relatively comfortable. There was no in-flight entertainment on-board which was to be expected since both flights were operated by a small CRJ aircraft. Overall I was very pleased I would definitely recommend flying Georgian Airways.

Amsterdam - Tbilisi - Amsterdam. 737-700 one way and 737-500 return. Aircraft clean enough and all on time. Ok. Low price airline. As good as most of the European low cost airlines.

We flew from Amsterdam to Tbilisi and it was a nightmare. Service for food and drink was way below average. The selections of drinks and the food were horrible. Flight attendants are nowhere to be seen unless they are serving the one drink and meal. I got sick on the airplane and almost passed out my husband could not find an attendant. Then when he did they couldn't understand or help me. When we landed we were surrounded by emergency crews ambulance and fire and again flight attendants were nowhere to be found. Pilot did not communicate at all and we were left in runway for about 35 minutes. When we saw a flight attendant I asked an English speaker to ask what was going on. The attendant just kept repeating "everything is fine" and disappeared again! I never found out what had happened but I will never fly this airline for lack of professionalism and service.

A failed connection in Vienna meant a FIM from GVA to TBS via CDG with the CDG-TBG on Georgian Airways (AirZena). Transfers at CDG are best avoided and the new security checks on the numerous items of hand baggage meant a delay to what could have been an on time departure. Despite the delay and a 2 1/2 hour scheduled transfer my hold bag did not make the connection. An efficient GA person at TBS handled the matter well and the bag arrived the following day on Lufthansa's flight via Munich. Onboard the best that can be said about the flight attendants is that they are charming. Unfortunately the charm was mostly spent on a couple of travelling friends who hung around the forward galley and chatted for much of the flight. IFE has been abandoned - along with the Chariots of Fire theme tune to the safety briefing thankfully which is now presented in a rather amateur fashion by the crew. The lack of professionalism extended to the safety checks and the service - a full glass of red wine splashing down the aisle due to a lack of attention for example. Food (sourced in Paris) was adequate when it came but there were no hot towels and all drinks required a call rather than a regular service. All flights to western Europe are on 1 of 2 B737-500s or the B737-400. Seats in business class are 2x2 with a reasonable pitch and the cabin was clean. My recommendation is bring your own IFE an apple and your choice of drink shut out the sights and sounds for the 4.5 hour journey and enjoy.

CDG-TBS and TBS-AMS. Brezhnev era service and operations with old 737-500's. With simple changes in mind set they could improve a lot. I have heard that they are selling this airline. In the meanwhile when travelling to Georgia I recommend flying BMED Lufthansa Austrian  KLM or Turkish.

I just flew Georgian Airways (Air Zena) between Vienna and Tbilisi and return to Vienna and was impressed with the service and equipment. I was in a rather new 737 that looked like it was maintained and clean. Even the food was decent a chicken dish that was quite tasty. One thing did concern me and that was during the 3.5 hour flight back to Vienna from Tbilisi the pilot on more than one occasion was milling around on the passenger side of the cockpit and on a number of these occasions the door to the cockpit was open and all of this was within feet of the forward lavatory. The pilot seemed more interested in chatting with the flight attendants then he did with flying the plane. But all in all it was a good experience. My bags arrived in Tbilisi from Vienna which I am told is a feat sometimes.

I have used them on six occasions - new and improved! I flew with them some 5 years ago. My what a scare! The plane was very old old enough to have condensation running down the inside of the window. The passengers were smoking and a little too active for being several thousand feet in the air. Now it is 100% better. No they are not like our typical airlines in the states (besides maybe southwest - which I love due to their low prices). But for a very small country who is trying to build their independence I think they are making great strides.

I am often flying with Airzena from Vienna and I find the flights quite comfortable and the crew friendly. The food is below average but eatable. But considering 3 hours of flight and price of a ticket (USD 500 to 700 for return ticket) it would have been nice to have a better service more internaitonal choice of newspapers larger variety of drinks offered to passengers (wine is no longer offered to economy class passengers) and better selection of movies during the flight. Looking back at the last five years I was using this airline to fly to Georgia their service has become visibly worse.

Flew Air Zena economy class PRG-TBS on 08.06.04 and on 11.06.04 TBS-CDG on both occasions in B737-500. Seating pitch fine and both planes well maintained. Departures on time on both occasions. The IFE consisted of a video and sound system but neither worked on the outbound flight. The hot meals on both flights were nothing special but a hot meal is becoming increasingly rare these days. As the only alcoholic drink available on the drinks trolley was one - yes one - bottle of beer it had long gone by the warm and friendly if quiet cabin crew reached me. The flight crew were silent throughout on both flights; for my part I appreciate announcements from the cockpit once in a while just so that you know someone is there. The cabin crew could take stronger measures to ensure that passengers remain in their seats as soon as the plane touches down. Some passengers retrieved their outsized cabin baggage from the overhead bins very shortly after arrival at TBS and blocked the aisle with the same. Evacuation in an emergency would not have been easy. Overall by no means the worst but by no means the best.

I have flown several times with Airzena from Amsterdam to Tbilisi Georgia. This is a funny airline - the only one where one gets a stewardess sleeping besides you in business class on a early morning flight from Tbilisi back to Amsterdam. This has happened already twice. Since the crew is sleeping one can or has to serve him/herself - you can go to the kitchen and pour yourself a drink. Don't trust stewardesses doing it for you!
