### “staff are rude, unprofessional”
Sat here at the airport with a 6 hour delay, they do not provide water as per IATA guidelines, the staff are rude, unprofessional and lack knowledge of airport rules and regulations, when I asked the staff with aircraft authority the airline operates under, EASA or UK CAA they didn’t know. It’s an absolute shower and I would strongly recommend that you travel via ferry or swim, it would be faster and the experience superior, disgusted with the airline and the airport, stay away.

### "Reliability at this airline has plummeted"
Reliability at this airline has plummeted since 2022. As a regular user of the “service” I now experience frequent cancellations, and am aware of passengers being bumped off planes. The small fleet is overstretched and so the cascade effects of prolonged maintenance or any crew unavailability are significant.

### "Disappointed is just understatement"
Not Verified |  I haven’t boarded just yet. Flight was cancelled by the airline. Been really looking forward to the flight as I’m visiting my family that I don’t get to see that often. What’s shocking is that in order to change the ticket I need to pay even though airline is the one who cancelled the flight and customer service is not available. On the phone queue for 3 hours already and no answer. I’m lost for words. Is there anyone at all who is willing to help or we just cash in these days! Disappointed is just understatement!

### "continue to gouge the customer"
Gatwick to Guernsey on an ATR 72. This is a small plane, very small. So small in fact I banged my head upon entering the cabin. I'm 6ft tall and couldn't stand upright, seating was okish, the seat was comfortable enough but legroom was very restricted. Cabin crew were friendly enough and the flight was fairly short, around 45 minutes. Guernsey to Gatwick on an Embraer 195. This is a bigger aircraft, legroom was a little better but the seat was considerably more uncomfortable. Cabin crew were a little surly and again the flight was short, 30 mins, and uneventful. Aurigny, I believe, are the only airline that flies to Guernsey from the UK, so having a monopoly they aren't too concerned with customer service. BA, to my surprise, gave complimentary hot drinks and a breakfast bar on their Belfast city - Heathrow route. Aurigny charge £2.50 for a small cup of basic tea/coffee and if you want a breakfast bar or muffin with that the price rises to £3.50. Now consider that my BA ticket cost less than Aurigny. If another airline starts flying to Guernsey then they might start giving out complimentary hot drinks, until then they will continue to gouge the customer.

### "treated me like a suspected terrorist"
Not Verified |  Flown this route return 4 or 5 times. Of course, a visitor to Guernsey has no choice, the airline has a monopoly. The flights themselves were only an hour, and uneventful. Aurigny flight team is usually OK. Not rude, but not terribly friendly, either. My last trip, the Guernsey airport staff was a very bad dream. They treated me like a suspected terrorist (I'm a past-middle-aged solo female traveler.) Kept me until the plane was completely boarded. I was the last one allowed on board. They opened my suitcase and removed every single item. They turned my book upside down and flipped the page, looking for who knows what. I fully expected sniffer dogs at some point. Since the trip itself had been stressful (horrendous weather, hotel room robbed), this last insult was so upsetting! I was finally allowed on the plane, but fighting tears. The flight attendant was nasty and gave me a "look" for holding everyone up.

### "this airline refuses a refund"
Gatwick to Guernsey booked for late April. I am a US citizen who planned to vacation in the UK. With the Coronavirus, we had to cancel our plans. Every business that we preplanned and prepaid with has refunded every dollar even-though all our tours were labeled “non refundable“. Delta also refunded every cent! Aurigny, is the only exception. They told me use my travel insurance because they are not giving me a refund. Can you believe at this time, with this world pandemic emergency situation that this airline refuses a refund. Its not like I merely just changed my mind. Im not allowed to get to UK to take this flight from this airline.

### "disappointed in this service is an understatement"
Aurigny has a monopoly on flights in Guernsey so you have no other option that to book with them. The staff on board the flight look miserable, like they do not enjoy working there at all. The checkin staff at Gatwick were ok but the checkin at Guernsey was bad, such grumpy staff. We were 2kg over on checkin which was quoted as going to cost 20pounds! We only had 3 carry-on bags (out of our limit of 4) and the plane wasn't full, so common sense would say just let it through. Instead we had to take the 2kg out and make a 4th carry-on bag. So the weight is still in our entitlement but what a pain! Then on arrival to Gatwick our brand new expensive Samsonsite suitcase had a huge gash on the front of it! I was shocked. There was no person at the baggage info desk at Gatwick (South Terminal). So when I got home and had a customer feedback email from Aurigny, I answered it straight away and told them about the problem. I got no response. I emailed Aurigny again after I returned home from my holiday only to be told: "The online Survey that is sent out does not come from Customer Services. All claims have to come to this email address, and we have checked, and we definitely didn’t have any emails from you until yesterday. I’m afraid on this occasion we would have to recommend claiming through your travel insurance. To say that I am disappointed in this service is an understatement. I sincerely hope I have never have to fly on Aurigny ever again, nor would I ever recommend the airline! take the ferry from the mainland or fly to Jersey with another airline and then transfer to Jersey via ferry!

### "cancelling Leeds flight is regular occurrence"
The flight was scheduled from Leeds Bradford to Guernsey at 14.15 on Monday 13 February and was cancelled once we had checked in baggage. No reason was given but we were bused to Manchester where we boarded an alternative flight at 1915. It was notable that there were no adverse weather conditions and regular travellers on the flight indicate that cancelling the Leeds flight is a regular occurrence in order to fill the Manchester flight - this seems a method of marketing the Manchester flight! Surprise surprise the Leeds Flight was also cancelled on Monday 20 February!

### "where's the consistency"
We flew from Gatwick to Guernsey and no problem with hold baggage or cabin baggage. However, on our return, at Guernsey check in, our cabin baggage didn't fit in their tester 'box' (despite being bought as hand baggage size), so we had to take out the laptop, iPad and sat nav and put into a carrier bag. Other people were checking in with much larger rucksacks and hold-all whose owners weren't even asked to test if theirs fitted the tester box! If our bag was too large, then fair enough, the measurements were on the Aurigny website but where's the consistency and why wasn't it picked up in Gatwick? Not happy when all we can see in departures are massive 'hand baggage'!

### "recommend this airline"
Norwich to Guernsey with Aurigny Air. Online service very good, when I was booking my seats 2 months after booking the flights I noticed I had spelt my wife's name incorrectly, but 1 email to aurigny put that right with no extra charge. The flight to Guernsey from Norwich was on time and landed early, the same when coming back. The flight had 36 people coming back so about 80% full, complementary drinks are served which made a nice change. The flight crew kept us informed through out the flight. I would recommend this airline.

### "return flight was a shambles"
We had booked our flights and prepaid for selected seats in February 2016. We chose to sit on row 19a and c on both flights. Flew out from Manchester to Guernsey on 2nd August 2016, flight had slight delay but nothing too bad. Service onboard was rushed, drinks and duty free served very early into the flight, then cabin crew sat and chatted for the rest of the flight. The return flight was a shambles. Upon arriving at Guernsey airport we were asked if we would like to change our seats, I declined this offer. Upon boarding at the gate I was given different seat numbers from those I had chosen and paid for. I explained to the gate staff that I had chosen my seats prior to the flight and wished to sit on those seats, the gate staff looked at me and told me to sort it out with the crew. Upon boarding the aircraft the stewardess was heard to say that the seats we had been allocated were in the same area of the plane, so could not see a problem. I stated that we required our chosen seats, which other passengers were sitting on. She did ask these passengers to move, which they did. If we had accepted the alternative seats, there was infact passengers sitting on these too. Again the drinks were served very early in the flight, but this time there was an announcement stating there was no hot water so only cold drinks could be served. Quickly after this came the duty free. The cabin crew spent the rest of the flight chatting to a passenger who also worked with the airline, talking very loud so that announcements made by the pilot could not be heard. I have flown on many airlines in the past, both scheduled and chartered. I feel that the price charged is very high, considering it is only a 70 minute duration, and the service offered is extremely poor. What is the point of giving passengers the option to pre-book and pay for seats it their request is not provided? I can now understand why Aurigny Air is receiving such bad press recently.

### "not the sort of service you'd expect"
Left Guernsey on time 7.30am with clear beautiful skies. Midway through flight there was a loud bang, cutting a long story short, we were all told an engine had blown and were going to make an emergency landing at Stansted on the one remaining engine. The stewardess, who was great, talked us through the crash procedure, hands on head and when told to brace lean forward. All very disturbing and scary. We landed safely but not with twists and turns and were greeted by 5 fire vehicles. We were told to collect our luggage and meet at a Menzies counter and a coach would take us on to Norwich. No one came with us, we waited in front of a monitor to see where our luggage was for 40 minutes, luckily another passenger found ours. We then struggled to find the Menzies counter. A lady briefly appeared telling us they were still trying to get a coach. After 40 mins we were told to go to stop 34, which again a few of us failed to find easily. Boarded our coach and arrived in Norwich 4 hours late without anyone greeting the coach when it arrived. We were not even offered a cup of coffee to calm our nerves, one lady said to me it was like they were blaming us - not the sort of service you'd expect after such a traumatic flight

### "need to change the way their website works"
I booked my flight with Aurigny Air via skyscanner from London to Guernsey, or at least I thought I had until I arrived at check in and was informed that my flight destinations were swapped. When I went to the help desk to change this she told me it would cost £125! (more than my initial flight). After I paid this I wondered how I could be so stupid to book the destinations the wrong way around, to which the lady told me that it happens all the time because Aurigny Air's  website always changes the destinations so the outbound flight is from Guernsey (even if you have been linked to Aurigny Air's website from another website like skyscanner with specific flights already selected.) When I arrived at Guernsey and told some locals they agreed that it happens all the time and they have never heard of Aurigny charging customers to change the flights as it is a fault of their website. As for the actual flight it was pleasant and I enjoyed the complimentary drink (even though the journey is only 35 mins!) and newspaper, the staff were friendly and polite and seats were comfortable. Just be warned when using skyscanner to book your flights through this company as they really need to change the way their website works - this seems to be a common and very expensive problem!

### "things always go smoothly"
Always fly with Aurigny Air to and from London Gatwick and things always go smoothly. Unfortunately you can't always rely on the weather in Guernsey but Aurigny are very good at helping in these situations, complimentary press and drink onboard for the short flight. Staff on board (cabin crew and officers in the cockpit) very friendly, first officer very friendly telling all the information on flight time, weather, height etc over the tannoy.

### "cost is diabolically high"
Southampton to Alderney. Some positives. We left on time and arrived on time both out and on return. Check in was fine but having checked in on line, this was and is a complete waste of time for this route currently. The plane is very noisy so take ear plugs and space is also at a premium so not much room. The flight is about 45 mins. The cost is diabolically high and for anyone to suggest this is a cheap flight they are clearly on something. We paid over £410 there and back with 2 travelling. I can get to the States cheaper than this. They say there is a customer focus attitude. A week before or flights we were rung up and told our return flight was cancelled and so we had been moved onto a flight 2 hours previous. We asked about compensation and clearly the customer focus attitude was abroad on that day, because we were told that we can cancel if we wish. What are we going to do - walk? We could of course fly with another airline but of course there isn't one, so they can do what they like. I was advised that that they also forced the shutdown of a local boat shuttle service to Guernsey, where you could get a Flybe flight to Gatwick or Stansted.

### "have been a good airline"
Been going with Aurigny Air for years now to fly over to Guernsey and they have been a good airline. Did have a delay in 2015, our flight from Gatwick to Guernsey was supposed to fly out at 10:00 and was delayed till 12:30 so we got the minibus to the plane (as my relative is disabled) got to the place and the plane wasn't even there and was still in Guernsey so we came back into the airport and then got called back down at around 3 - we didn't get any vouchers. A 5 hour delay is nothing compared to other reviews about Aurigny however the flight back was peaceful and the new jet makes the journey quicker - even had a chat to the pilot and cabin crew whilst waiting on the plane to get the minibus and they were all very friendly and pleasant

### "urgent training required "
Aurigny Customer Service staff must be the worst in the world, the recent fog caused some delays at U.K airports, whilst still on the island having a meal before my flight at a local restaurant I heard that there was flight delays so I telephone Aurigny to find out how long etc, I was told no all is well get here on time. Turned up for my 5.15pm flight at just before 4pm and was immediately told story five hour flight delay nothing we can do, went to customer services - who were useless. Whilst I was speaking to a man there, a lady in the back ground put a leaflet on the counter in front of me and said "its all in there" and went back to her seat and sat down, the leaflet was about delays, great customer service. We went upstairs and ordered some snacks and drinks and just as I paid, tannoy announced that our flight was now leaving ASAP and was going to Liverpool, not Manchester and that a coach would be there waiting to take us to Manchester. We left everything, checked in and then sat for over an hour in departures. Finally arriving at Liverpool guess what no coach and no one aware of this arrangement, eventually a Liverpool airport member of staff said she was arranging a coach for us, some people asked if a taxi would be paid for by Aurigny and they were told no, now near 10pm and most of the passengers now left making their own way to Manchester the member of staff returned and said she may have a coach for us, and then said where is everyone. Well they have all gone was the reply and we are off too, thanks for the help. Aurigny`s objective was just to get shut, thanks to them I had to make my own way to Manchester at 11pm collect my car and then drive back through the thick fog getting home at near 1am, it would have been safer for all just to get the next safe flight out. When I telephone Aurigny for a refund for the taxi I was told no chance, not our fault and once off the island not our problem and that they are not part of the EU rules. When I tried to put my point I was then told by the young girl on the phone that she was now terminating the call. After a couple of calls I have now been told that I am getting my Taxi fare back but thats it, no compensation for the delay at Liverpool as we were off the island and not their problem. Customer services at the airport and on the phone score nil, urgent training required nothing complex just the art of communication would be a good start, how to talk to people.

### Aurigny Air customer review
We flew Ryanair to Stansted to connect with this flight. Ryanair late and baggage took 30 minutes to get to carousel which meant we were late for bag drop (minimum one hour for domestic flight). Rang Aurigny to see if we could get our bags processed 50 minutes before departure time. No go and no assistance. I was in the middle of booking flights for the next day when a staff member Menzies Aviation came out, and asked if he could assist us. When we explained the situation he told us the flight had been delayed and he would see if he could get our bags on. 2 minutes later all sorted no thanks to Aurigny. Our flight left 40 minutes late anyway and as we have now found out their flights had been delayed by fog. So why didn't the "customer service" person at Aurigny know that and also offer to see if we could join that flight? Maybe it was because she had no customer skills and spoke to me as if I was trying to put something over her.

### Aurigny Air customer review
We had a weekend trip to Guernsey from Gatwick. Both flights were late. On the return flight, seated at the back of the aircraft I was subject to the flight attendants' conversation grumbling about their job and their employer. I feel a little put off from making future leisure trips to Guernsey, as this airline is quite expensive, suffers delays, and does not provide the warmest service.

### Aurigny Air customer review
A great no frills, low cost airline. I highly recommend for little inter-island hops around the Channel Islands. However I am prompted to write a review today due to really appalling customer service via telephone this week. A tetchy member of staff, a very poor line (or as I suspect chin to mouth piece) a stroppy, irritated response when I could not hear well, a curt reply to my inquiry and the phone going dead before I could scarcely say thank you and good bye. Courtesy costs nothing. I await my next flight in trepidation and am giving a high score for previous trips and polite, well mannered staff.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Flew from LCY to GCI return. Outbound: Quick and easy check in at LCY, straight through security then to departures. LCY can get quite busy in the mornings but managed to find a seat without any problems. Bused to the aircraft. Onboard great friendly service, complimentary drink and duty free items offered. Flight time approx. 1 hour. Return: Check in at GCI can be a bit slow espicially if there are a couple of other flights departing around the same time. Same friendly service on board for the return trip. The aircraft used is the smaller version of the ATRs they have in their fleet but offers the same cabin layout as the bigger ATR aircraft, the seat pitch is exactly the same. This is Aurigny's newest route and is a great alternative to Gatwick and would highly recommend this for anyone starting or finishing their journey in central London. If you book in advance the fares are reasonable and once you factor the train cost to Gatwick the fare is not much different. LCY is a great airport to travel through, quick, easy and hassle free compared to the bigger London airports.

### Aurigny Air customer review
We flew to Gatwick from Guernsey on 24th April excellent and early flight and great crew but we waited an hour and 10 minutes from leaving the plane to retrieving our luggage. No one to ask in the CI luggage reclaim area you couldn't go back nor leave the area. Unacceptable I am afraid. We would have understood had their been a security alert or another problem but nobody communicated with us. Luckily we did not miss any on going connections but come on how difficult is it to unload a plane and get bags through in a quick manner?

### Aurigny Air customer review
Flew from MAN to GCI and then from GCI to BRS over Easter weekend. Not bad value considering they pretty much the only way of getting to Guernsey. Free bag soft drink and newspaper but you would want to be incredibly short to have any hope of being comfortable in these seats for any amount of time. The crew on board we very professional and pleasant to deal with and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Flight from GCI to BRS was operated by VLM on a Fokker 50 that was as old as the hills still it had a lot more legroom than the ATR on the previous flight. Nice service by nice crew on a short flight.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Flew the first time with Aurigny from LGW to GCI and return. All flights were on time aircraft still looks very new comfortable seats with enough leg space flight attendants doing their best to offer free drinks and the Guernsey Press within the short flight time and 20 kg luggage was included in ticket price. Overall it was a surprising good value for money and I felt well-cared all the time will definitely recommended this airline.

### Aurigny Air customer review
I fly Gatwick-Guernsey-Alderney or Southampton-Alderney return about eight times a year. The service is excellent value for money (considering the costs of operating old small planes) always a friendly smile at Southampton and in Alderney. More a community bus service than an airline except the new Embraer 195 used on Gatwick-Guernsey is very sleek and professional. You spend longer waiting for bags at Gatwick sometimes than actually in the air - so tend to stick to Southampton (plane to train personal best so far at 3 minutes 40 seconds). Fantastic.

### Aurigny Air customer review
I flew GCI-LGW-GCI in November. 5 minutes early on departure. Arrival into LGW early. Even the bags arrived quickly. Cabin crew under pressure to serve the free drinks but got there. On return the only slight delay was the need for the long taxi down to the end of the runway at Gatwick. On time arrival. On E195 super plane 31m flight. Bag delivery in GCI could be improved though very slow. I have travelled 30+ times on Aurigny this year. Never let me down they always get me home.

### Aurigny Air customer review
I flew from Jersey to Alderney via Guernsey and experienced delays. Not really a problem as had been warned by telephone of the delay in Guernsey and the fact that it happened in Jersey was immaterial. Everyone was perfectly friendly and civilised. However a few days later I flew from Alderney to Gatwick via Guernsey and while the flight was fine and everything on time I found the ground and cabin staff to be offhand at the very least and was made to feel as if I was an idiot when I undid my seatbelt to pay for my drink and when I asked for information on arrival in Guernsey. I really think that as a small airline if they want to attract customers they should give their staff better training in their general approach. Just a smile and a pleasant way of speaking would be an improvement on a sigh and a grimace.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Flew on the new jet from Gatwick to Guernsey and back last Thursday - a trip I often make. New Embraer 195 aircraft is now being used by Aurigny. Flights both ways on time and very quick coming back in the evening from take off to landing was just 31 minutes. That meant a difficult job for the cabin crew to get drinks to everybody in time but they're obviously used to it and completed the task with a few minutes to spare. As always with Aurigny a great and friendly service only quicker now!

### Aurigny Air customer review
East Midlands to Guernsey on an ATR-72. Nice to have a proper airline service with a person to check in your bag plus complimentary drinks and newspaper on board. Aircraft clean and presentable departed on time but arrived slightly late due to strong head winds. Flight a little bumpy in parts. Cabin crew service efficient and with a smile. Good flight price. Would fly with Aurigny from my local airport again.

### Aurigny Air customer review
My wife and I had gone to Guernsey for a weekend so we could do the G-JOEY flight having seen voted best small airline by which magazine makes them look good. The weather was a bit poor and they do say if there is bad weather the flights might get cancelled so as is was awful we were not to sure if the flight would go ahead. Twenty minutes from departure the clouds broke up and sun started to appear which was a relief but then the flight got cancelled we were taken out of departures and that was it. We were told that according to the metro logical forecast the weather was not good but had Aurigny ops looked out of there window it was sunny and as we were only having a twenty minute trip on the plane And I saw no problem weather wise. However the truth came out accidentally let slip by a member of staff that the plane was needed for the 15.20 Alderney service to depart late at 15.55 which is why the trip was cancelled where as our schedule should have been a 15.45 departure. We were not the only passengers that had travelled from mainland Uk just for this flight and felt let down by the airline after paying to fly to Guernsey for the short flight. Having contacted the airline and no reply yet why they need twenty eight days to reply I will never know for a small airline sadly now I will possibly not get to fly this aircraft as it is due to come out of service.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Me and my wife use Aurigny often as our daughter grandchildren and son in law live on Alderney. The staff are friendly and polite. Only get delayed when there is bad weather on the island. Only criticism is the price of tickets could do with more offers as we fly from Southampton.

### Aurigny Air customer review
We have just used Aurigny Air for the first time flying from East Midland to Guernsey. We have flown over the last 6 yrs several times a year with Flybe - no more. flight was on time going and coming back in fact we made it both ways ahead of time both ways staff were smart polite and professional. What was also nice was the complementary drink and free local paper.

### Aurigny Air customer review
30/8/2013 from Stansted on flight no GR437 to Alderney via Jersey and Guernsey and returned on 3/9/2013. Impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of staff second to none. The only blip on the horizon was at the information desk in Guernsey where expecting the usual smile in answering a simple question was completely the opposite small moan in what was first class treatment. We shall certainly travel with your airline again and tell our friends to do the same.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Flight cancelled out of Guernsey due to fog - put on a flight 28 hours later (which was 30 mins late taking off). Staff totally disinterested - no offer of practical or financial help - just told to claim on travel insurance. To cap it all we were placed right in the middle of a noisy football team when we finally got away.

### Aurigny Air customer review
The user requested that this review be withdrawn due to pressure being exerted on them by the airline.

### Aurigny Air customer review
I am a devoted traveller (LGW and back every week for many weeks in the year and I always travel Aurigny if I can) and I always book my family on Aurigny. However my families experience with delayed or cancelled flights in the last 6 months and the experience of friends is beginning to make me seriously doubt my loyalty. Their chairman mentioned a few months ago that the reliability was going to improve and it hasn't. Reliability is crucial to an airline. Aurigny is vital to Guernsey.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Jersey to Guernsey 08.03.13 as always you cannot fault any part of the trip. A fun start to the day to prepare oneself for the evening return with the blue spotted one to Southampton - maybe. Anybody visiting the Channel Islands for a short break should take a trip on a Trislander.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Travelling Manchester to Guernsey GY671 on 19 December 2012. The 17.10 flight was delayed until the next day due to bad weather. Aurigny kept us informed arranged coach transport from and to airport to Crowne Plaza Hotel with very good Evening meal and Breakfast. Next morning offered a drinks voucher at the Airport as we could not take off until 11.45.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Flew to Alderney from Southampton. A very pleasant short flight friendly captain. Aircraft is too small for safety demonstrations so you have to watch a short film in the departure lounge. My partner left his passport and mobile onboard and they phoned us a few hours later to inform us they would be ready for collection on our return flight. As the aircraft is very small it is not at all comfortable but a good inflight magazine. Cost of the flights was high considering the short journey time.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Like all budget airlines Aurigny charge over the odds for credit card booking. £3 per person to encourage you to reserve a seat is a joke - they automatically allocate seats not next to each other upon web check-in - meaning I was at the back of the plane and my partner at the front. Plane's are very old. Leg room OK but wherever you are in the country (we were flying from East Midlands) it's never usually much more then an hours flight. Overall the flight is a means to an end.

### Aurigny Air customer review
SOU-ACI-GCI-JER return. Every leg of this journey (entirely on Trislanders) was a pleasure. No delays from Southampton and pilot was friendly. The same pilot flew us on to Guernsey where after a short stop we changed aircraft for Jersey.

### Aurigny Air customer review
GCI-MAN-GCI. No queues at check-in desks. Flight on time. Free drinks on board. Helpful crew. Bussing at Manchester due to customs requirements. Baggage handling at Manchester very slow. On return no check-in queue plane pushed back 5mins early. Good value for money free baggage too.

### Aurigny Air customer review
EMA-GCI return. Both legs on time. Friendly ground staff and onboard ATR 72 aircraft. Excellent updates from the flight deck and cabin crew offered free drinks & newspaper which is unusual these days. Free hold baggage included in ticket price which is good value. This airline puts many of its bigger rivals to shame.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Check-in at Manchester was awful we waited 20mins to check-in. The check-in agent couldn't change my seat no other staff to help. Flight late departing no announcements and no gate staff to ask with a scrum to board when finally called. Aircraft clean but seating cramped and seat broken and kept reclining - after the cabin crew asked 3 times for me to move it she finally listened that it was broken. Cabin crew were not very friendly and on arrival waited 15mins for baggage - GCI airport is tiny and no other flights in so cant understand the wait. Return flight delayed - and on arrival parked at the terminal and yet had to be bussed around the airport. Overall dated airline.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Excellent flights to Guernsey & return. Attentive staff. ATR72 aircraft ideal for route. In flight free drinks welcomed and puts rivals to shame.

### Aurigny Air customer review
STN-GCI-STN. Overall package was professional and good value for money. The ATR -72 used felt like a white-knuckle ride for much of the journey - don't know if these aircraft are affected more by the turbulence. Attentive and cheerful FAs on both sectors and good updates from the flight deck. Only reason for not awarding more marks was a 2hr delay on return leg not entirely attributable to Aurigny and well dealt with. This airline really puts some of the larger carriers to shame regarding their standards of customer care.

### Aurigny Air customer review
STN to Jersey. Everything on time check-in sluggish at both ends but inflight service important to this airline. Free tea coffee or soft drinks and polite cabin crew though some announcements difficult to understand.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Gatwick - Guernsey. Showed up only slightly early for check in. Thought we were in for a shocker with the wait but luckily it was for the check in desk neighbor Viking airlines. Auringy desk (of course) had nobody there. Plane was clean. Service fantastic. Free paper was a nice touch and best airline tea.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Jersey to Guernsey the early flight. Everyone who likes to fly should fly this route. The Trislander is a real plane and you get to see it all happening from start to stop. Excellent value and a good experience all round.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Gatwick - Guernsey Return. ATR72 clean and tidy. Both legs on time. Seat pitch tight if you are tall but acceptable for 45 minute flights. Complimentary soft drink cabin crew working fast to complete full service in tight time constraints. Overall a good regional carrier but with one irritating gripe. There is a £3 fee to choose your seat in advance this under the current climate is not too bad. However if you book a fully flexible ticket and subsequently change your flight although there is obviously no fee for changing your flight you will be expected to pay the £3 AGAIN if you want to choose a seat on the new flight. If you are on a flexible ticket you should really only have to pay the fee for choosing a seat once.

### Aurigny Air customer review
LGW-GCI. Very good flight no add-ons like FlyBe etc. Good price online check in free drink and a new ATR72 great value.

### Aurigny Air customer review
Return trip from Guernsey to London Stansted. Check In staff helpful and polite free 20kgs baggage allowance and on time departure. Cabin staff excellent. ATR aircraft (even the 2 new ones) are small and quite loud but okay for a 1 hour flight time. Free drinks and newspaper on board is a lovely touch.

Gatwick to Guernsey. Couldnt check in online as we had bags and a child which the system doesn't cater for but no queue at the Gatwick check in and the process completed in a couple of minutes. Flight on time. Free soft drinks and tea/coffee and a copy of the local paper was a nice touch. Brand new ATR72 - spotless! On arrival we waited just 5 minutes for our bags. On the return again no queue at check in on time and comfortable. Excellent value for money.

Flew to Guernsey from Gatwick. A great start to the New Year with no security queues at Gatwick (wish it was always like that) and a great flight on Aurigny. You get a choice of free soft drinks on board including tea and coffee but this excludes hot chocolate so I stumped up a £1 and had a hot chocolate and a free orange juice. Smooth flight on board the ATR72 though I thought the aircraft looked a little tired. Chatting to the cabin crew I learned that Aurigny is getting two new ATR72 aircraft in March so that should improve matters. Much the same experience coming home again that evening. All in all a good (short) trip to a wintry Guernsey and great value for money.

London Gatwick - Guernsey and return. Smooth check-in in both directions with pre-reserved seats. Smooth flights operating on time. Seats comfortable enough for 1 hr flights. Non-alcoholic drinks provided service efficient. Overheat lockers on the ATR72 are very narrow.

LGW-GCI. Used the new online check-in which was simple and saved a lot of time at the airport itself. Walking out to the aircraft wouldn't be fantastic on a rainy day. Flight time was just 40 minutes. The first impression of the ATR72 was that it was quite old and worn and noisy. Loads very low with 7 free rows in front of me and many behind too. Staff weren't unpleasant but I can't say they were particularly great either. Just average. Free drinks and arrival was especially easy. We were outside the terminal at Guernsey within 5 minutes of the engines being shut down.

GCI-LGW-GCI. Flights on time both ways. Complimentary tea and coffee and soft drinks which is rather rare these days and no charge for hold baggage. Cabin crew ok but nothing special. Aircraft first generation ATR72 which are rather tatty inside and my seat was covered in crumbs on the return flight rather noisy and a lot of vibration compared to jets and newer turboprops. I believe Aurigny are purchasing 2 new ATR72-500 which should be an improvement they certainly need to update the fleet. Reasonable fares as long as you can book well in advance otherwise the price is extortionate.

GCI-MAN on ATR 72. Flight 20 minutes delayed due to late inbound (25 mins) but we were kept informed. Watching ground staff from the departure lounge one could see a very focussed and motivated group working together to reduce the delay. This is how it should be done but maybe it is easier for a small airline.

Southampton - Alderney. Pilot just rolls up switches on and off we go for a great real flying experience. Superb flight on Trislander each row of seats has its own door and seats are comfortable enough. Great flight on a clear day flew over Southampton and Isle Of Wight straight down over a sparkling sea to Alderney. No catering or ife as it is too noisy and no aisle so unable to hand out drinks etc. If you want to experience real flying in a propellor aircraft an aircraft built like a brick wotsit and flown by super experienced pilots you must try this short hop.

Bristol - Guernsey return. Wonderful Flights comfortable seats 2x2 enough leg room to remain comfortable for the short 55 minute approx. flights. Little delay on Outward journey but nothing to cause concern or interference with the trip. Usual sea fog caused return flight to have a delay of around 1 hour 20 minutes nothing anyone can do about natures elements and Sunday Maintenance of the aircraft has to meet States regulations. Return flight was as comfortable as the Outward journey staff equally friendly. Would not hesitate to recommend Aurigny to other travellers to the beautiful Channel Islands Good to see the airline growing and modernising since the States took it over. Only downside to Air Travel between Islands as in to do day trips to different Islands via plane is the horrendous Taxes and Fuel Surcharges which made any chance of us visiting the other Islands impossible on price which is a shame as other Islands lost out on tourist spending which is important to the economy of the Islands.

MAN-GCI-MAN.They use atr 72 on this route certainly more comfortable than the saab 340 used previously. flight only 70 mins catering minimal crew friendly and helpful. ticket pricing is now more realistic for the distance flown than a few years ago. all in all a good means of getting to a wonderful island.

Bristol to Guernsey - a 45 minutes flight. Top marks - it could not have been better if we were royalty. Will be using again in a few weeks going back for another wonderful holiday in Guernsey.

Flew GCI-LGW 19th April with Aurigny. Very smooth check in at Guernsey followed by a comfortable flight to Gatwick. Ground and flight staff friendly and efficient. Nice 2x2 seats on ATR 72 makes for a more comfortable flight than alternative 146 aircraft and seating.
