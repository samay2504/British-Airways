### "ask for 100 dollars more?"
Not Verified |   I paid a lot of money for my relative to fly with you and you are asking for 100 dollars to a flight that's already been booked week ago? 975 USD from Cap to Nassau, Nassau to USA! How dare You ask for 100 dollars more? Your responsibility is to take care of your clients not to charge them 100 more because there's a lot of people.

### "Delay flight without a reason"
Long check in process. Delay flight without a reason. Not working online reservation system. Consistently lying personnel. Wrong baggage information at their website.

### "super bad airline"
The worst airline in the world, they leave super late, they don't give explanations, your time is not important to them. Don't travel with them, super bad airline.

### "choose to sit anywhere"
I'm totally confused, I have paid for an upgrade to sit in the front row and priority and when we boarded the plane we were told the seating was ”you can pick and choose to sit anywhere”. This was complete chaos and families were not informed in advance as we had kids onboard and we could no longer sit with one another. Bags have now been displaced, the flight crew couldn't tell you who was sitting in a certain seat in case of an emergency, not to mention our flight was over two hours delayed.

### "Absolutely ruined our vacation"
Absolutely ruined our vacation. Spent entire day on both ends of vacation fighting with Bahamasair staff about our fully paid, prebooked flight from Orlando to Nassau. We spent 10+ hours sitting waiting on a flight that never left Nassau to arrive in Orlando. There were little to no updates on flight status. The staff at the gate were rude and very unhelpful. We asked to rebook our return flight for a day later due to the loss of our day because of the severely delayed departure. We were told it was no problem and given 4 new seats on a return for a day later to make up for the lost day at airport. After our wonderful vacation in Nassau, we arrived to airport 2.5 hours early for our ticketed flights only to find out we were booked on a full flight and had to be on standby, with no other departing flights for that day. We were stuck and had connections that would be impacted if we didn't get to Florida that day. So, after 1.5 hours of waiting for a customer service rep to try to bump other passengers, we were told we would not be departing that day. We were forced to purchase $1400 one way tickets on another carrier just to get to our other connections. The staff at Orlando who overbooked us on a full flight should be fired. It's unacceptable to be so careless with people's time, money and vacation/holiday time. Overall we spent 2 full days in airports unplanned which took valuable time off our vacation.

### "worst communication I've seen from any airline"
Not Verified | Our flight from Nassau to Great Exuma was delayed 1 hour, then they changed the gate without letting anyone know, almost half the plane was running to the gate for final boarding. On the return from GGT to Nassau we were delayed 2 hours with no explanation and no communication. I've flown all around the world and this is the worst communication I've seen from any airline. Not run very well in my opinion. Management needs to look at improving themselves. I would look at Western Air next time we come to Bahamas.

### "The worst customer service ever"
They charged me 25 USD for a checked-in bag and then it arrived ripped off on the side to FLL. It was just 5pm however a guy at the baggage claim said that they closed and that he is the only person related to the company at the airport at the moment. He made a claim for me and said to send it by email that he indicated. Well, nothing was happening for a couple of months until I wrote to a contact email from their official website. Again, a long wait and many emails, and in the end, they issued a 75 USD travel voucher for a damaged nearly new suitcase that I got for over 200 USD. Plus, I live in Mexico and went to the Bahamas once, and don't see myself going there again anyhow soon, so their travel voucher is useless. I wrote them about that and haven't heard from them ever since (a few months passed). The worst customer service ever, try to avoid this airline at all cost. And well, don't trust them with anything more valuable than 25 bucks duffle bags.

### "First of all, late as usual"
Not Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Nassau. First of all, late as usual. Air conditioning did not work. The mask policy is outdated. When are you people going to get your act together. Nothing in the Bahamas works smooth if it even works at all.

### "Will never use again."
Not Verified |  Nassau to Miami. Awful airline. Will never use again. We took 7 flights in total on this holiday around the Bahamas and Bahamasair was easily the worst! Destroyed husbands bag that had been in excellent condition before and been fine on all our other flights around the Bahamas. Contacted Bahamasair who refused to cover cost of replacement. My family were split up at the gate when boarding. We should have all been allowed priority boarding with the baby as we were all travelling together under the same booking. Had to wait for other family so didnt board until have the plane had already been allowed on. Baggage check in refused to allow a checked bag for my baby even though my ticket said I had 10kg. Was forced to pay an extra £35. Flight time on my ticket was an hour earlier than the I was told at the airport. Would have made it very difficult to make my connecting flight. Fortunately the connecting flight was delayed. Understand delays happen but this was a complete flight time change that I had not been notified of

### " Submitted my form 7 months ago"
Not Verified |  My family and I booked a flight with them for June 2020. The Bahamas was on lockdown due to COVID so the airline cancelled our flight. According to their refund policy involuntary cancelations are issued full refund. Submitted my form 7 months ago and have been waiting to hear back ever since. Have sent multiple emails and phone calls. Just tried calling again and people would answer in English and when I began talking started speaking a different language and put me on hold again. They finally disconnected me after an hour of waiting. Avoid this company! The idea of a little bit of savings isn’t worth the hassle of dealing with them.

### "Will never use again"
Nasssu to Miami. Awful airline. Will never use again. We took 7 flights in total on this holiday around the Bahamas and Bahamasair was easily the worst! Destroyed husbands bag that had been in excellent condition before and been fine on all our other flights around the Bahamas. Contacted Bahamasair who refused to cover cost of replacement. My family were split up at the gate when boarding. We should have all been allowed priority boarding with the baby as we were all travelling together under the same booking. Had to wait for other family so didnt board until have the plane had already been allowed on. Baggage check in refused to allow a checked bag for my baby even though my ticket said I had 10kg. Was forced to pay an extra £35. Flight time on my ticket was an hour earlier than the I was told at the airport. Would have made it very difficult to make my connecting flight. Fortunately the connecting flight was delayed. Understand delays happen but this was a complete flight time change that I had not been notified of

### "100% unacceptable"
I fly MVP Gold weekly on Alaska Airlines for work and pleasure. I know a good airline, and I know a bad one. BahamasAir is a customer communication mess, and worse than any other airline I've ever experienced. You show up at the airport, they don't tell you where the plane is, how long it will take, or if you'll make your next flight or anything that a modern-day airline does without question. Then, knowing the plane is delayed, they don't post the flight delayed until the flight is due to board. To make it even more ridiculous. There is no one at the gate, and the customer service line goes to a voice message. I asked the ticket counter to see if they could get us another connection but she said she could not see the flights. I asked if the airline used the internet and or any sort of modern communication available in the 21st century, she shrugged her shoulders and said no. How can an airline be so unorganized in this day and age and still be able to operate? If you're from the US, save your money and time if the Bahamas is on your list. We could have been on a beach in Italy faster than flying from Oregon to the Bahamas. Costa Rica is faster, Hawaii or anywhere for that matter. This is a mess of an airline and business. At a minimal timeline need to be communicated with reality. The overall Bahamasair experience is 100% unacceptable.

### "your flight will be late"
Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Nassau. If you even remotely care about being on time, do not fly with these guys. It is a 100% guarantee that your flight will be late, you will get no infomation about it and the airline will not care one iota that your flight is late.

### "not recommend even slightly"
Nassau to Freeport. Terrible airline. I emailed them for clarification of whether we'd be able to fly to Freeport after the hurricane as I was told by separate sources I would not be able to and they just ignored my emails. I asked several times and got ignored. But every time I contacted them with a fresh query, someone would respond until I again asked about whether the flight would go ahead and then they'd go silent. They rebooked our flights twice, each time not telling us (you have to go to their website and login to your booking to find out). One time I had to call them to check because their website wasn't letting me login so I couldn't check the status of the flight. Then the ground crew who checked us in at Freeport airport were rude, unhelpful and incredibly unprofessional. Would not recommend even slightly. However you might not have much choice as not many airlines fly to these small islands.

### "really took care of us"
When I tell you the reviews was so discouraging and negative but go against all odds. The flight from Freeport to Fort Lauderdale was peaceful and safe. It was 3 members in my party. We were scheduled to return to the US on Sunday but do to hurricane Dorian on the way we had to leave the resort in a hurry. All the airlines we're booked! The only thing available was Bahamasair and I'm so grateful and took a huge leap of faith and booked. The aircraft took off on time with no delays, no turbulence and the pilot and team we're all will dress and pleasant. The Bahamians really took care of us. The flight was maybe 25 minutes with safe landing. When I read many of the reviews people were complaining about delays. Remember delays not denied. Thank you Bahamasair.

### "they would not credit me"
Orlando to Nassau. Do not trust these people or do not waste your time talking with them as to them it is all transactional and not based on customer service. As a million mile on a US carrier I was shock even with a non-refundable ticket they would not credit me and my because of this storm. All they would do is offer a discount and that we had to still use the ticket with in 6 months.

### "we deserve respect and communication"
Not Verified |  Bahamasair is the worst airline you can ever imagine. After waiting in line for a ticket for 6 hours, we did not get to Nassau until the next day. We spent over 24 hours in an airport because of Bahamasair with no explanation. The staff were very rude and have horrible communication skills. This may come from the top tier. After flying to Nassau, which was not where we were flying, Bahamasair could not get us to where we booked our flight, to Eleuthera. I’ve emailed this company multiple times, and they never replied back. Customer service is ideal when running a company. The fact that is airline is government based and represents the country. We may not live there, but were paying to visit, we deserve respect and communication. Get it together Bahamasair, which I guess I’m saying this to the government since that who owns them. Save your money and time, fly Silver Airlines or anyone else but Bahamasair.

### "I feel very safe with them"
Not Verified |  Freeport to Nassau. I see a lot of negative reviews and I’m really not sure why. I’ve flown Bahamasair my whole life, and while they’re not the best in the world I feel very safe with them. I experienced a slight delay my last time flying but I trust every delay with any airline is for a reason and put my safety above impatience. I’ve only flown on their newer aircrafts within the past 6 months I’ve been flying more frequently so I can’t really remember what the older planes are like. But the new ones are great, clean and bright on the inside. The crew are kind as most Bahamians are, the flights I take are always under 45 mins and completely stress-free. Like I said I don’t remember what the old planes are like so I only speak for the new planes. But I prefer them to a lot of other airlines I’ve been on. (Including American ones) I know Bahamasair pilots to be very talented fliers and that’s what’s most important to me. It’s just a plus that the interior looks nicer now, and since I don’t experience any extreme delays I really have nothing to complain about.

### "has to be the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Miami to Nassau. It has to be the worst airline in the world. You check in, wait at the gate, but no plane in sight. Suddenly all passengers run to another gate and onto the landing strip, where we wait for another airplane. No information is provided at anytime. We believed that it was just bad luck and that the return flight would be better, but it turned out even worse. I'd rather swim to the Bahamas and back than traveling with Bahamasair.

### "ruined the end of our vacation"
Nassau to Miami. I ordered four tickets with Bahamasair, but when I tried to checkin the day of the flight only two of my reservations showed up. When I called Bahamasair, the supervisor sent us on a wild goose chase calling our credit card company and forcing us to get to the airport extremely early. The stress of not knowing if we would be able to leave the Bahamas completely ruined the end of our vacation. When we got to the airport the staff at check in could not care less. Luckily Jetblue had an extra two seats to Fort Lauderdale (which cost an extra $500) otherwise we would have been in serious trouble. If I could rate an Airline lower than 1 star I would.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified | Orlando to Nassau. December 24th made the 3rd and final time I will ever fly with this airline. Prior to this trip my other two flights were delayed upon departure as well as the return trip. Each way was delayed by at least 2 hours. On the first trip once we finally arrived in the Bahamas we were forced to sit on a hot plane for at minimum 30 minutes due to issues with the jetty. Our trip on December 24th was delayed for 4 hours with no explanation. We were due to arrive at 4:15pm and didn't land until around 8:30 pm. We had to sit on the plane for an additional 15 minutes due to, you guessed it, problems with the jetty. Take my advice and avoid this airline at all costs.

### "The worst airline ever!"
Our Bahamasair from Nassau to Orlando was 12 hours late. we arrived at 23.00 pm at Orlando! Therefore we missed or connecting flight LH465 from Orlando to Frankurt which departed at 8.15 pm. During our 12 hour stay in Nassau we did not receive any information about the delay and no help at all regarding connecting flights. The customer service did not react at all. Maximum confusion at the airport without any gate information. Arriving at Orlando the ground representative of Bahamas Air was unfriendly and unwilling to help. This was our worst experience ever when traveling around the world. The worst airline ever!

### "Terrible customer service"
Nassau to Ft Lauderdale. Awful airline. Avoid at all costs. Terrible customer service. 90% of the time, your flight will be delayed. Planes are old. The cheap ticket is not worth it!

### "Terrible customer experience"
Nassau to Ft Lauderdale. Bahamasair is the worst company I've ever flown with! Stay away from it. Both of our flights were rescheduled (the first one postponed by 3 hours, we arrived in Nassau by night instead of enjoying the afternoon there as it was planned). Please note that this flight was delayed on top of it. Our return, 3 days after, apparently got canceled (tho it still appears on the airport panels?) and landing location changed to a further airport! Now waiting in the boarding room for my return flight but the aircraft 's got a mechanical issue. No information from staff members! Terrible customer experience to avoid absolutely!

### "Stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Nassau. This is the worst airline I have ever flown, delayed 5 hours going and 3 hours leaving. No bad weather on either legs in both locations. No communication whatsoever from any airline personal. No one even comes around while the gate continues to read on time. Stay away from this airline.

### "airline is disorganized"
Nassau to Fort Lauderdale. I was on flight 205 leaving Nassau, Bahamas at 3:45pm on Monday August, 20, 2018. Upon arrival i was told my flight was delayed and I would be given an update at 7pm and to have a seat. That means it would take 3 hours just to tell me what was going on with my flight! I sat down and noticed a lot of people that were waiting for the same flight suddenly dissapeared. I went and asked and then was told my flight moved to a different gate. So I walked all the way to the other side of the airport to this other gate. I get to the other gate and was then told I would have to wait again because they were boarding another flight! I am 32 weeks pregnant and not only was the airline staff rude and unwilling to help me. But the way they were choosing who they would let on the flight, after everyone from the previous flight boarded really made me angry. So instead of allowing young children and their parents and a 32 weeks pregnant woman first priority. They were just choosing people randomly, so if you didn't get lucky, God knows when you'd get on the next flight home. I met a woman that said she was there the day before and her 1pm flight was delayed as well. She told me that it wasn't until 2am they told her to go home and here she was waiting again hoping to get on a flight. The whole airline is disorganized. They have absolutely no order. I will never fly Bahamas Air again. The country is beautiful but their airline needs a lot of work.

### "Extremely disorganized"
Never again will I fly Bahamasair. Extremely disorganized. Told they only have 5 airplanes and 2 are out of service yet they did not delay any planes and refuse to find new flights for customers. FYI you can keep your $10 to Wendy's. If we get out at 9.30pm it will be a miracle. Agents at counter area completely incapable of communicating to the masses and their attitudes are only making every other passenger even more angry. They even stated "you can get your voucher at the managers office because I don't have time for you.

### "staff were very friendly"
Wanted to leave this review for two major reasons: 1) The reviews I read about the company were quite outdated and was not sure what to expect and 2) The number of bad reviews created a wrong source of expectation prior to my flights. My flight was a return one to Havana, Cuba (about 45-50 mins flying time). Even though the feedback for Bahamas Air was quite negative, I must say that it was much better than with other companies I`ve flown (WizzAir, Ryanair). The only negative thing was that the flight was delayed about 40 mins in each direction which is not something uncommon with flights generally. The staff were very friendly and for such a short fly they also served some snacks. I must outline that the crew even went the extra mile since they don`t offer hot beverages on-board but were kind enough to find some for us. There was plenty of seats since the flight was half full. I didn`t experience anything mentioned in the previous reviews like bad customer service, safety hazards during the flight, lost or delayed luggage. If this was something that might have been the case in the past, seems that the airline significantly improved.

### "The crew were very friendly"
A short pleasant flight from Nassau to Havana. Bahamasair is a typical holiday destination airline. The crew were very friendly, aircraft relatively new. Complimentary snack during this short flight was a nice surprise. Even for the economy class, there was enough legroom even for bigger passengers. Check in very easy and friendly. Will definitely fly with this airline again.

### "staff need customer care training"
Freeport to Fort Lauderdale. Beware of travel delays and counter staff that need customer care training! My wife and I are veteran travelers and understand airlines are not always on time. In such situations, we expect timely information from staff about the rescheduling of departure. On Dec 16th the staff did not provide timely information and were extremely discourteous to passenger when they approached the counter. We made the effort to help a passenger in which English was his second language and he had an important connection to make. We heard the staff berating him so we decided to help him and learn more about is connections. Thus, we became the next individual to be insulted and berated because it was said it is the fault of the young man because did not book 3 hours between connections. We were leaving two hour late. We listened to other passengers from Freeport familiar with Bahamasair they reported it was common place for the airline to be late. Understand late is not problem, it is the courtesy with which the staff in addressing the connection concern of passenger affected by delays.

### "great customer service"
Great customer service from Bahamasair. Departed Nassau to Fort Lauderdale before scheduled time. Very professional. Check in was a breeze. Quick baggage arrival in FLL. Continue to do well. The aircraft was clean. The pilot did a excellent job in take off and landing. We arrived early which was great because I had to be at work same day

### "I am on my own"
I was trying to fly from Freeport Bahamas to Deadmans Cay via Nassau. I was on the 0730 flight out of Freeport to Nassau then the 1400 flight to Deadmans Cay. The plane in freeport was delayed till 0930 am which was fine because I wouldn't miss my next flight. So we arrived in Nassau to find the flight to Deadmans Cay was delayed till 3.30 pm. This was normal for Bahamasair. But here is were I started to get upset - 330pm arrives so they walk everyone out to the plane. There, some problem so they walk everyone back into the building. They call us again sometime around 4pm and board the plane. They then explain to everyone that the plane doesn't have the paperwork ready and we wait on the plane anther 30 min till it arrives. So after the 3 hr delay were on the way. The pilot rides around the airport for seems like an hour, only to tell us they don't have light to be able to fly. After being messed around all day I figure Bahamasair would try to make everything right. But Bahamasair now tells me it isn't their falt and I am on my own.

### "service was awful"
On a 35 minute flight from Miami to Nassau we had an hour delay on the way in and 3.5 hours delay on the way back. No explanation was provided at all. Company did not even provide bottled water for the longest delay despite the fact that all the shops in the airport at Nassau shut down at 6pm and there was nowhere to buy even water. Service was awful too with moody and bad attitude stewardesses. For a premium flight of over $300 for a 35 minutes flight, the experience is definitely not deserved.

### "smiling and friendly crew"
Nassau to Providenciales with Bahamasair. Amazing Service. Smiling and friendly crew. We flew on Bahamasair to come back home after a Christmas holiday. The flight was delayed a bit due but other than that it was great. The flight was 1 hour and 25 minutes. While airborne the flight attendant came around offering water, tea and coffee. I love to fly with Bahamasair.

### "customer service do not give updates"
Freeport to Nassau with Bahamasair. Initial flight from Nassau was delayed by 3 hours from 6:30 pm to 9:30pm and the returning flight was scheduled at 6:45pm and at 10:15pm I am still in the terminal. Customer service representatives do not even give updates and the airline does not seem able to stick to basic principles of time.

### "lacking in professionalism"
Just as most of the other reviewers stated, Bahamasair is just so lacking in professionalism. But there is not much competition, so they continue to perform without caring. We sat in Marsh Harbor this past Sunday for seven hours waiting for our flight to West Palm Beach to show up. No explanation and no help from the airline employees. (To be fair, they did give us an $8 voucher to be used at the airport café.) Of course we missed our flight out of West Palm to Boston - no help given to us for the inconvenience. Just so frustrating especially when checking in to the Holiday Inn West Palm to find other airline's 'distressed passengers' with credit vouchers to be used for food/hotel/expenses. Also, our flight to Marsh Harbor was delayed, but only by one hour - which I think is great for Bahamasair - hardly worth mentioning. We love the Bahamas but will have to avoid them in the future if Bahamasair is the only option.

### "surprisingly had plenty of legroom"
Flew Bahamasair round trip from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport on 03/22/2016 and 03/28/2016. Both inbound and outbound flights were on new ATR72-600. Slight delays (no more than 45 minutes) on each leg. This aircraft was very clean and surprisingly had plenty of legroom for a turboprop plane that seats 60 passengers. Other than on takeoff and landing, the cabin is very quiet once in the air. There was no need to use the Bose QC20 noise cancelling headphones. This is a rather short flight less than 1/2 hour.

### "how badly-run this airline is"
Words can not express how badly-run this airline is (especially after a natural disaster). Booked medical trip to Miami on Fri to pick up critical medicine unavailable in Nassau. Hurricane changed course on Wed and hit Bahamas on Thurs. By Wed noon, all offices were shut and supermarkets empty of stock. In their rush, Air Bahamas forgot to update their flight schedules. I had the "joy" of trying to convince the booking agent in the US that my intended flight very early on Fri morning would not fly because they checked and the web server gave them "normal status" for this flight. Urging them to check with the weather station was a fruitless exercise. Hurricane hit Thurs morning; went to airport at 5 am Fri. Told to come back at 9am when flights would resume. Came and was told that I could catch a plane to FLL at 11am. Thought that this was sufficient time. Plane took off after noon and took hours to get through US Customs. Barely made it to the pharmacy before it shut during the weekend. Coming back was another story. Supposed to fly out on Fri night. Had to stay Fri night at dodgy hotel at my own expense. Spent all of Sat going from one gate to another, having to go through security each time. No meals or drink provided by airline. Finally, late Sat night, we got news that we could board a flight to Nassau. All lined up and then told we could not board because someone forgot to turn on the landing lights at Nassau airport. Another night at a bleak hotel at my expense. Returned early Sun and spent another day going from gate to gate, trying to get on a flight. Finally, around midnight, a flight was available. Spoke with people sitting in that particular lounge - they were waiting since 6am. Gate agents worked furiously to get everyone aboard - if I felt sorry for anyone, it was them. Took off around 1:30 and landed around 2am to a almost deserted airport, A security guard at Nassau airport asked me which flight came in, I told her "BahamasAir". She did not look surprised; she told me that they regularly come in that late. Complained to Bahamasair where I was passed from one person to another until I was given the email of one of the managers - sent her an email but, of course, no reply.

### "just don't seem to care"
Bahamasair is always late so if you don't mind sitting hours in the airport this is for you ! We flew Bahamasair before and it was delayed for 2 hours going and then 4 hours coming home. Doesn't help to check either because it was posted on time. So I said never again. So I did know better, but since they don't charge for you luggage we thought we would try one more time. My advice pay for the suitcase! Our flight delayed for almost 2 hours - I can understand some delays but we even asked and the guy that checked us he just smiled and said no, not delayed this time. Oh and they threaten to not let you on the plane if you are not there two hours before (we had that last time and we were the an hour and 45 minutes ahead) so we are there two hours before - only to go through security and 5 minutes later our flight is delayed an hour. It turned out to be one and a half. It is only a half hour direct flight to Nassau. Missing a luggage again. They will send it to your hotel - no big deal to them. We did get it, although not when they said we would. Flying back, get told as we check in flight is delayed an hour - even though it is posted everywhere as on time. They tell us our plane is at gate, just going thru safety checks and we will be boarding soon after the hour delay. I you enjoy spending 5 hours in a airport for a half hour flight this is for you. They just don't seem to care.

### "customer service totally lacks"
Fort Lauderdale to Grand Bahama Island with Bahamasair, and one of the worst I have flown. Customer service totally lacks. Only one flight on Saturday and our plane got delayed in Tampa, missed flight. Had to pay huge change fee and they did not offer a refund or help. Never use this airline!

### "unconcerned about our comfort"
West Palm Beach to Marsh Harbour with Bahamasair. 3.5 hour delay getting out of Marsh Harbor on Saturday. Had to rebook and pay up charge on connecting flights. Staff kept telling us flight had left Nassau to come to MH but flight aware showed it had not left. They left our luggage in the rain and were slow to respond to our pleas to get them out of the rain. Staff appeared totally unconcerned about our comfort, our luggage or communicating truthfully with us.

### "I would rather swim"
Another example why Bahamasair monopoly structure lead to high prices combined with bad service. Second flight. Second delay of hours without any information. Before I have to fly a third time with Bahamasair I would rather swim the 200 miles to Miami. Quicker.

### Bahamasair customer review
Fort Lauderdale to Nassau, Bahamas. The flight was smooth and the flight attendants were helpful and professional. The landing was smooth and nicely done.

### Bahamasair customer review
My girlfriend and I flew round trip from Nassau to Cuba. Our return home was delayed for three days due to incompetence and failure to follow up on promises. On the way back, the flight was oversold and we were bumped off in Havana. There was no call for volunteers and no consideration of priority for those with connecting flights in Nassau or nowhere else to go in Havana. According to local staff, this had never happened before and they were completely unprepared to deal with it. They were eventually coaxed into arranging a hotel and were great about it - very embarrassed that it had happened, etc. It still took around five hours of messing about in the airport, however. We had very little cash left (because we thought we were about to leave) and as US credit cards don't work in Cuba, we were pretty much stuck and were not even able to contact the other airline that was getting us home from Nassau. A VP from Bahamasair, got involved. He told us to ask for him when we got to Nassau and he would sort everything out. When we got there he was unavailable and neither he nor anyone else had done anything at all. As a result, we wasted most of the day in Nassau airport then got stuck for another night in Miami before finally making it home 3 days late. To add insult to injury, the complaint process is absurd. After more than four months, Bahamasair eventually offered us a pittance for compensation, in travel vouchers - which I am unlikely to use as I will not subject myself to their appalling service again. 1/10 rating may seem harsh as they did provide us with accommodation and (limited) meals for part of our delay. Also the people we actually dealt with face-to-face were great. However the utterly incompetent way they handled everything pretty much trumps any positive aspects.

### Bahamasair customer review
I had a 9:10 flight out of Ft. Lauderdale FL to Nassau Bahamas on May 1 2013. The flight was 5 hours delayed without any explanation by the staff. In addition the attitudes of the personnel was unbelievable their apologies came only after it was mentioned that they did not apologize and when the flight finally was boarding they attempted to scold and belittle the passengers. On the returning flight the flight is still delayed. My flight was suppose to leave at 345 pm it is now 930pm I am still sitting in the airport with no idea when I will be leaving the Bahamas to get back to Florida. This is absolutely a night mare. Never again will I travel with Bahamas Air.

### Bahamasair customer review
We had an excellent experience. The check-in was prompt and efficient in Fort Lauderdale and Freeport. The staff were professional and helpful. We felt the cost of the flights were high but they are usually cheaper than other airlines offering the same service.

### Bahamasair customer review
Scheduled to leave Orlando to Nassua at 12.30. The plane finally arrived and we took off 5 hours late. Wasted half a day of vacation time they gave no explanation except there was only one plane being used and it was running behind. They gave us food vouchers but did not offer any compensation. This was my first and last experience with them.

### Bahamasair customer review
My family and I were going from Nassau to Orlando we arrived 4 hrs early to the line out the door with people for the same flight as us. We stood in line for 4 hrs when we got to the front it took them 30 mins to check two bags. Thankfully security and customs were a breeze. Arrived at the gate to find out our flight was delayed 3.5 hrs. We boarded the plane which was very dirty as we were supposed to begin takeoff we had to stop and refuel the plane. Completely inefficient and I will not be travelling with them in the future.

FLL-NAS-FLL and I found no problem with them aside from their ageing fleet of B737-200's. The flight attendants were very nice. Return flight was bumpy but decent.

We were picked up in Miami over 1.5 hrs late. On way home we got to airport over 2 hrs ahead of time and waited for our flight. Flight listed as on time and they boarded us to leave on time but then had to sit in a very hot cabin for over 1hr because they were waiting for late comers to get through customs. This made us miss all our flights out of Miami and when I finally got to Dallas missed any chance of getting home.

My husband and I purchased a one way ticket on BahamasAir as we were returning on a friend's private plane. We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure time and waited 1 hour 15 minutes to check in. Before we were issued our boarding passes (as there is no online or curbside checkin) we were informed that we must purchase a return ticket in order to be allowed on board. Not having any choice we purchased two refundable tickets at a cost of almost $600. We were informed that we can cancel the flight as soon as we land in the Bahamas and they would charge us a $15/ticket cancellation fee. Additionally our flight was an hour late with the board at the gate never indicating the time change. The crew on board gave us sporadic departure instructions - some after we were in the air (ie. turn off all electronic devices and my seat was broke! A couple of days into our vacation I spent a significant amount of time trying to call both the local and toll free number for BahamasAir. I kept getting disconnected or a fast busy tone - for two days straight. We finally went to the concierge of our hotel and pleaded for his assistance. He encountered the same problem but was finally able to reach the Customer Service Department. Once I got on the phone with the rep she tried to connect with the Reservations department and she could not get through as well. After explaining our situation they finally connected me with someone who was able to accept our cancellation (they did not even have a cancellation number to provide). Needless to say we lost a good 1/2 day of precious vacation time for which BahamasAir wants $30 in fees and 6-8 weeks to return our money. I read the complaints about BahamasAir before I booked. Since the main complaint was flights departing late but I figured a small delay would be no big deal since we weren't on a time schedule. I also like to give small businesses a chance when possible. We never imagined that this complaint would be nothing compared to everything else we experienced. On a positive note we all got to the Bahamas safely and they gave us a mint on our way out of the plane. I chalked this experience up to "lesson learned" - I just wanted to send out a warning to all of you out there considering this airline.

Ft. Lauderdale to Nassau. Getting the ticket and checking the bag was a breeze the fun began while waiting for the flight I was chatting and wasn't paying attention to the time however others were. No one bothered to tell us the flight was delayed although on the screen checking in it advised it was going to be on time. We took off an hour late. Also on our return trip we were an hour late. Never again.

I have never had a worse experience DCA to NAS. I purchased tickets through BA for a codeshare with USAir. Upon check in we were told that BA never transfered the ticket numbers to them and therefore they had no record of our reservations. There were 30 other travelers at the gate with BA tickets on this codeshare and all were told they had no reservations. We tried to call BA to rectify the situation only to have them cut us off 10 times. We never reached our destination we lost the money paid to our vacation rental and have yet to be refunded our airfare. No one in customer service cared one iota. Instead they blamed USair for the problem.

Miami-Nassau-Havana. Check in at Miami couldn't understand our tickets although I printed tickets that Bahamasair send to me. At the check-in in Miami they told us that we need to get off the plane before the connection flight and do the check-in again. When the plane took off we asked it from the crew and they said we couldn't do it again and we needed stay on the plane. When we arrived to Havana there was nice surprise for me. They had left my baggage to Miami! I wasn't the only unfortunate one they had left 18 baggage to Miami. I had to wait 4 days for my baggage and the airline didn't even send the baggage to me when it arrived to Havana. I had to pay taxi and go get it by myself from the airline. If you seek some email addresses from their website you see that there is none of them. They have just phone numbers so you have to call to them if you have any questions concerning your bookings or flights.

Miami-Nassau. In principle everything worked out fine. B737's are very old check in took enormously long time. Very strict on weight and size of carry-on baggage. Onboard the staff gave the clear message that they would really like to be somewhere else than on that aircraft. They were totally unmotivated and not offering service. Almost all the journey they were gathered in the aft galley eating. Otherwise the flight was nice with plenty of information from the flight deck.

NAS-GHB-NAS. I purchased my e-ticket online received receipt and e-ticket. Upon check-in at NAS the agent could not find a reservation for my partner and I. Fortunately there were two seats available and we were able to get the same fare. Apparently my credit card was never charged in the first place. How does something like this happen? And why wasn't I contacted? The flight going went on time and the crew were professional. On the return leg we arrived at the Governor's Harbour airport about 40 minutes prior to departure (mind you this is a tiny airport they don't even have a security check). We were immediately scolded and rushed and told that boarding was almost complete and we were "so lucky" to be getting on. The attitude of the workers was unbelievable here and left such a bad taste in our mouths. The flight took off about 30 minutes early and we ended up arriving in Nassau when the flight was supposed to be leaving Eleuthera. Never again.

I flew with Bahamasair from MIA to Long Island and back to Orlando. Despite the delays we were able to catch all our connecting flights and all the Bahamasair staff were nice and accomodating. Overall much much better than US airlines!

### Bahamasair customer review
Our experience of Bahamasair was quite an adventure! We experienced delays going to and returning from the Bahamas. The airline has simply not learnt the concept of time! The inflight snacks were Ginger Ale and Peanuts (that's your lot) and the staff were kind enough to literally throw the peanuts at you! If you need to go to the toilet then make sure you go before boarding the plane as you will be faced with a leaning tower of full bin bags in the toilet. There is a total lack of consideration for people's luggage as a female passenger found out to her cost. When you complain to the airport authorities upon arrival you are told " Chill man you're in the Bahamas! A great start to our honeymoon!

We were booked on a Bahamsair flight form George Town to Nassau the flight failed to turn up and we had to use another carrier. Had it not been for the kindness of the staff in Nassau we would have missed our flight to the UK. We are still trying to recover our ticket refund!! Never again! !

### Bahamasair customer review
I am absolutely disgusted with the service of the national flag carrier - Bahamasair. It is totally ridiculous that we are since centuries saddled with the level of service or lack thereof in delivering passengers to their destinations in a timely manner. We have heard enough excuses. We believe that this national airline is a complete failure vis a vis customer service and delivering the difference. The only reason that Bahamasair still has passengers on the family island routes is because of the monopoly that exists there. I fell in a Bahamasair trap a few months ago when I had to go from Miami to Freeport. I was booked on a nonstop flight UP244. At the counter I was told than they would not have that service and I would have to go via Nassau - even if I would need 5 hours for this trip. Bahamasair can spoil your vacation even before you arrive at your destination. And what is the Bahamas government saying "t is better in the Bahamas". A well known investor has another marketing slogan for the Bahamas "Look at it but do not touch it! I was glad to be able to catch a American Eagle flight same evening and a few minutes later only.
