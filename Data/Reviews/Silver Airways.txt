### "everyone was very efficient"
I was very concerned to fly this airline due to previous reviews and their current bankruptcy status. To my surprise, everyone was very efficient. The staff on the plane as well as the staff at check-in were very nice and informative. The departure time was maybe 10 minutes late due to taxing, but we did arrive on time at our final destination. Surprisingly, the seats were comfortable for their shorter trips. The ATR600 aircraft provided a smooth flight. I would recommend this airline for trips to the islands. Hopefully, they will come out of bankruptcy and survive.

### "most unreliable airline"
Not Verified |   Silver Airways (now United Airlines) - is the most unreliable airline I have ever had the experience of dealing with. Do not be conned into believing that because United purchased Silver that it will improve service. There have been repeated cancellations and delays I’ve experienced. Before you say I shouldn't be traveling on this budget, low cost airline - it is these airlines that have marketed themselves as convenient direct flight options into / out of smaller airports. The frustration and incompetence is not worth the stress and headaches involved.

### “gate personnel was as cold as stone”
Not Verified | We were just denied boarding our Silver Airways flight. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes before departure and they literally closed the gate right in front of our noses. It was within seconds. The gate personnel was as cold as stone and did not care that they just ruined our vacation. In 50 years of flying I have never experienced anything like this. Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. There is a reason they are in bankruptcy.

### " have yet to be reimbursed"
My trip to Dominica with friends from university for a wedding was ruined. Honestly, Silver Airways should not be in business. Silver Airways provides inferior service and is fraught with delays and missed connecting flights. The flight was an hour late leaving San Juan. However, it was 8 hours delayed. They begrudgingly brought boxed lunches of chicken. I am a pescatarian and had nothing to eat for 7 hours inside the airport. Eventually, when we were boarding, someone brought me a fish meal, which I had to eat while standing in line. Then, the flight was again delayed. I missed my connecting flight and had to overnight in San Juan. Beware of their 'so-called' hotel voucher for $150. All the hotels are more expensive than the allowance. More importantly, I am still waiting for reimbursement. Silver promised reimbursement would take 3 months, then made the same promise 3 months later. It is now 7 months later, and I have yet to be reimbursed. A complaint to the DOT has made no difference. I wish I had flown Caribbean Airlines. I booked through Delta, and Silver is their partner on that route. Silver does not recognize Dela's medallion status. Silver charged me $50 for my checked bag, which Delta waived. I would never choose to fly Silver Airways.

### "Service is not on this company’s radar"
After deplaning all passengers when they couldn’t close the door to the cargo hold, everyone was left on standby for over an hour. No announcements made in the terminal, no communication. Emails about the flight being cancelled arrived and sent all passengers into a frenzy around the only gate agent working. Most passengers weren’t able to be rebooked. A “lucky” three of us who checked in first were booked onto a flight that was scheduled to depart 6 hours after our scheduled flight, and we were told to stay close in case any cancellations happened on earlier flights. No accommodations, meal vouchers, not even a glass of water offered while waiting in a freezing cold airport all day, only to find the flight we were rebooked for, was running an hour late. No announcements made about this until the flight was already late for boarding. Service is not on this company’s radar in any way, shape, or form. Like most Caribbean based airlines, they just don’t care.

### "they gave them our flight"
We were on time but the people before us were delayed, so they gave them our flight. Then proceeded to not keep us updated for hours at the gate as they tried to figure out what plane to get us home in. They were so rude to people when they asked for an update it was just comical. One was "just look at the computer screen" as she turned around and kept talking to the other employee, and another lady asked why our plane was given to another group and she got the response "cause you guys were on time and they were delayed, that don't make no sense! Never again would I fly with this joke of a company. I should've read the reviews before wasting my money.

### “Terrible terrible airline!”
Terrible terrible airline! I arrive in San Juan and quickly checked Silver Airlines flight 125 flight status. The electric board flashed the flight was delayed by over an hour. That was then reduced to 45 minutes. As I was walking to the gate, well ahead of the posted boarding time I see the flight is boarding. 10-15 people in line, outside in the sun. The gate agent said those were estimated times and I would have to wait for the next flight. She then lies and tells me they tried to call me. My iPhone 14 DOES NOT have any record of call from Silver Airlines. Although there are people stacked up waiting to get on the plane they refuse to let me on.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Terrible service in plane and airport. Plane was canceled hours before anyone told use and after hours at the front desk we got a 150$ gift voucher for 5 people in our group and a I hope tomorrow will be better from the counter service. Next day flight delayed twice for over 7hrs with no time just a best guess and I hope it comes earlier. No respond from emails or phone calls trying to contact them after getting home 2 days late and missing our trip in Florida completely. Would just like an answer and some money back for unexpected expenses!

### "irresponsible and careless"
Not Verified |   Worst airline in this world. I travel a lot and this is the worst I have ever seen. I have had 3 different trips with this airline. Trip 1- Flight from PR to DR left late and then the one to return to PR was cancelled. They left us stranded in the DR and pretended for us to wait a whole week to fly back. Had to return home on the ferry and deal with the airline for months to get a refund. Trip 2- PR to St Croix, flights there and back were both delayed. In one they said it was delayed because they didn't have a flight attendant. This was all announced at the last minute. Trip 3- PR to Dominica. Flight was delayed 14 hours overnight and set to leave at 7am the next day. I go home to sleep (though they pretend that we stayed in the airport all night) and when I go to my 7am flight, it turns out they left early and didn't bother to email or say anything. They own website said the flight was leaving at 7. Never book with them. They are irresponsible and careless.

### "Do not fly in this airline"
Not Verified | They lost my luggage and were no help whatsoever went back-and-forth to the airport. Nobody there to help. Worst airline I ever been in. When I finally got home they found my luggage in the Bahamas and did not even get an apology and did not reimburse me for the $70 that I had to pay for the luggage to travel have to rebuy everything toothpaste, toothbrush, clothes, underwear. Do not fly in this airline. Read the reviews.

### "delayed over and over again"
Not Verified | Flight 141 at 6:10pm was delayed over and over again on June 4. Then after 10:30, it was finally cancelled. There was no help at the counter. The Customer Service line is useless. No one answers, and after you wait for 60 minutes, then it disconnects the call. I called first thing in the morning today, and they did answer the phone. I was moved to today’s flight at 6:10pm. Same route. Less than 5 minutes later, they emailed me a delay message for 7:15pm. And another delay, and another delay. Then 11:35pm with the flight arriving 23 hours later…. Now I received another message and the new departure is 9:15pm today. I have written and called and no one answers. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Horrible!

### "so delayed we couldn't wait"
The flight from Tampa to Pensacola was so delayed we couldn't wait. It was more than 11 and a half hours late. They would delay it an hour at a time, so you had to stay at the gate. They said it was a mechanical issue and had no word about anything. Another flight from the same place made it there faster than we did. They did not give a voucher, refund, or anything. Horrible communication and terrible planning.

### "did not offer the new flight rate"
Not Verified |   The canceled our flights and did a "free" rebooking. However, they did not offer the new flight rate that was over $200 cheaper. We had to book a room for an extra night at our hotel. So essentially our fun getaway is costing us more due to the airlines changing our flight days without compensation.

### "They don't care"
Not Verified |   We booked a ticket for my husband and selected an afternoon flight. The software for some reason changed the time on a “nonrefundable fare”. My husband was traveling for medical reasons and traveling every week. If he took the earlier time, then he’d have to miss his chemo-therapy. I immediately called to let them know what happened. The answer was that I could buy another ticket at a higher price. They don't care.

### "first and last time to fly with Silver Airways"
Not Verified |  It was my first and last time to ever fly with Silver Airways. When I departed from San Diego with Alaska Airlines, I checked my baggage and paid for it. I mentioned to the agent that I needed a seat assignment for the Ft. Lauderdale leg. She indicated I would have to do that with an agent at the gate. When the Ft. Lauderdale agent showed up, I asked her about my seat assignment. She was extremely rude, not just to me, but to everyone that walked up to the counter. She would not talk with me then but said she would get with me soon. 1.5 hours later, I walked up to the counter and gave her my information including the receipt for my baggage. She indicated that I was not in their system, no trace of my luggage anywhere. She told me when I got off the airplane, I should have gotten my luggage, gone to the ticket counter, and checked in again. They would have checked my luggage and I would have gotten a seat assignment then. She hand-wrote my boarding pass and said to me that she couldn't promise to find my luggage. At 68, and recently losing my husband of 31 years, I have found there is not too much to get upset about. Oh well, it all can be replaced, I thought. The flight was 2 hours late, 10 minutes before I boarded the agent told me my luggage was being put on the plane. Nothing much was said after that from her. She did follow through but she should not be working with the public.

### “the customer service is horrible”
Not Verified |  It has now been 8 days and my luggage has been lost and has not arrived. They have not helped me one bit and the customer service is horrible. All they have said is that they sent a message and to hold on until they find it. I keep calling with no update. This is unacceptable. I paid $35 to check my bag. It is no surprise that every review is 1 star on multiple sites.

### "There was no air to my right side"
Not Verified |  This airline flew from ELH to FLL, knowing that the equipment to control the oxygen level in the cabin was broken, as well as AC. Inside the cabin, it was very very hard to breathe. There was no air to my right side. AC was working on the left side of the aircraft, so if I turned left, there was a little bit of air but it was very thin. Plus it was very very hot to a degree everyone was drenched in sweat. Stewardess had their own personal handheld fan and they pretty much ignored our request to do something about it. When we finally got to FLL, the captain did not even communicate to the airport authority that the cabin's air level was very low, and took time to taxi and stop in the middle of the airway to "Wait till a gate opened up" Passenger started to get angry and were shouting at the stewardesses but they did nothing other than telling the captain "passengers are a little irritated". Someone should do something about this airline's practice.

### "they are a scam"
Horrible airline. Return flight from Eleuthera has been first cancelled on the scheduled evening and didn't fly either the next morning. Fortunately we have been booked on American Airlines in order to catch our long haul flight back to Europe. All we got from Silver Airways at the check-in counter was a voucher of USD 110 for the hotel expenses of the extra night in Eleuthera. Try to find a hotel in that area for two people for that price!! That's a joke. Back home we have sent the hotel invoice to Silver Airways as requested together with the voucher but have never been refunded nor have we ever got any kind of reaction from their guest relations. They have completely disappeared! That's a real shame! Do not fly with them, they are a scam.

### "I lost my money completely"
Not Verified |   This airline is a scam. I booked on Priceline. Silver changed the date of my flight. The date, not the time but the date. They would not provide me a refund but said I could book another flight with a credit, however I would be charged a change fee that actually cost more than my original ticket. Absolute scam. I had to drive to Nashville from Greensboro and back. I lost my money completely and was going to be charged more, because they changed my flight date. Do not book with this airline.

### "Stranded with no care"
Worst airlines ever! First and foremost, upon booking on Travelocity, you are tricked in to thinking you are booking with a trusted major airline (United) to find out this is some unknown start up airline and flies old propeller planes with fresh paint. Our flight was delayed 3 hours for repairs than finally boarded just to sit for another 30 minutes before we were deboarded due to repairs being incomplete. Then ultimately, canceled the entire flight and said you would get refunds in 7-10 days. Stranded with no care of how you will get to your destination. Horrible, horrible airline. Shame on United for allowing this fly by night airline to be associated with United and ruining their reputation as a trusted airline.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Absolutely horrible experience. Of the four flights that myself and a family member took to and from Nashville for a weekend trip from Greensboro, no flights were on time and one flight was canceled. I was forced to drive back from Nashville in a rental car because Silver decided to cancel my flight, while I was actively at the airport. Since Silver has no staff presence, an hour + wait time for their customer service phone line, and only one flight a day, I was out of luck. All our other flights were delayed, by anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. You have no idea what is going on at any time, they seem to have no ability to communicate at all. The relatively cheap flight is absolutely not worth the stress and hassle. Do not fly.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Drove 5 hours from Houston, TX to New Orleans, LA to catch a flight to Jacksonville, FL to make a family member funeral services. Sat at the airport 5 hours because the flight was delayed twice, then when it was time to board the flight they told my family and I the flight was overbooked, despite already having our boarding passes. Needless to say we never made the services. You would think since they knew the flight was supposedly overbooked they would have let people know ahead of time so they could make other arrangements. Instead they let us sit there for over 5 hours and then when it was time to board they told my family and I, as well as the other passengers the flight was overbooked by 20 people. Then they call the airport police. It has been a nightmare trying to get our $ back as well as hotel fees. Do not fly with this airline. I hope this same situation happens to every employee at Silver. Because I’m a firm believer that people really don’t care until it happens to them. Then maybe they would treat their customers better. This airline is a joke.

### "Very unprofessional"
Original flight time was supposed to be 10pm. They delayed the flight to 12.21am. I don’t think I’ve ever been on a flight with them where they are on time. On top of this they canceled my ticket almost an hour before we were supposed to take off. Very unprofessional. Now I’m going to have to pay way more to buy a last minute ticket.

### "the experience was horrible"
I booked the flight for September 15th, 2023. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8:30 PM. After several emails that kept pushing the time later it was determined that the flight was to depart at 12:30 AM. I got a call from someone from Silver Airways at about 5:30 PM and was asked to be there before 8:30 because TSA would close and they would not let any passengers in after that time. I got to the airport at the time I was asked to, and ended up waiting until 12:30 AM. At 12:30 AM when there was about 12 people for this flight, some passengers started to leave. They had received an email that they were rescheduled for the flight on the next day. I personally and some other passengers did not receive said email. Someone came to the counter and started checking everyone's confirmation to see if they were rescheduled. I was told by the associate that I had been rescheduled for the next day even though the plane was on its way and he stated that he could not put me back on the flight. That is the most ridiculous thing. Long story short. 3 passengers were not rescheduled and ended up boarding the plane at like 3:00AM. It is frustrating and this change did not work for me because I was returning the next day to Gainesville. I spoke to some other passengers and they expressed that the airline was delayed 90% of the time. I do not recommend anyone to book tickets with Silver Airways, the experience was horrible to say the least.

### "Pay the extra and book with a real airline
I booked two tickets from Gainesville, Florida to Ft Lauderdale, Florida for 9/15/23. Departure time was 8:30PM EST. At 12:30PM, I received an email from Silver informing me that the flight was delayed approximately 20 minutes. Over the course of the next 3 hours, I received another half dozen emails, each one showing an additional delay of 20-30 minutes. The most recent update I had was that the flight was scheduled to depart at 12:30AM EST. I was offered the choice of taking that flight, rebooking, or receiving a refund. I tried to contact customer service via phone but was only able to leave my place in line for a callback (as of 9/19 12:45PM, no callback by the way.) I also emailed customer service, but I still have not heard back. Because the TSA closed at 9:30PM, and there would be no additional flights out that evening from the airport, we decided to instead drive to our destination. On 9/16/23 at 8:07PM (almost 24 hours after the flight was originally supposed to depart) I received an email stating that the flight was cancelled. Still have not been able to receive a refund, nor speak to anyone from customer service. Pay the extra and book with a real airline, you'll save yourself a huge hassle.

### "cancelled 1 hour before"
Not Verified | This was the worst experience I have ever had flying. My return flight was cancelled 1 hour before the flight was to leave. The representative told me to go to Southwest Airlines and get the corresponding flight to Jacksonville and they would reimburse me the cost of that flight. I was given an email to contact for the refund. After a month of waiting on a response to multiple emails and getting none I tried several phone numbers only one got me to an actual person. In the end they will not refund the $260 Southwest Airlines ticket and they won't even refund their (silver Airways) ticket of $180, much less half of it $90, but are saying they will only give me a refund of $38.

### "my experience has been a very negative one"
Not Verified |  First time flying with this airline and my experience has been a very negative one. We had to wait at the terminal for 2 hours and then in the plane we had to wait and it was hot. Flight was delayed and due to this I was unable to get my car rental in Pensacola. I had to pay an Uber to my hotel and then next morning took another Uber from my Hotel to the airport to get my rental.

### "No one at the ticket counter to complain to"
Not Verified |  My carry on would not fit in the over head compartment. Handed it to the “stewardess” who looked like she could not care less. My suitcase was not sitting outside the plane and the pilot told me it would be taken in with the rest of the luggage. Wrong! No one at the ticket counter to complain to. Called the airline, waited 20 minutes to talk to someone who told me I was supposed to get a receipt from the stewardess when I gave her my luggage. Who does that? I didn’t check it.

### "Thanks for nothing"
We stand at the Gate desk, and now the staff paged us to let as last in the airplane. What a great start with silver airlines. Thanks for nothing!

### "What a disgusting airline"
Not Verified | Me and my girlfriend had a flight home from Nashville Saturday, July 30 or 31st. I believe I woke up in the morning several hours before the flight to prepare. About two hours before my flight it was canceled. So now on the flight I have to buy a primo rate ticket to get to my destinations with very little notice. Then I reach out to customer service and they tell me I will receive an email referencing my refund and I’ve heard nothing for 10 days. I’ve reached back and still get nothing, their business model is steel, customer money, make it convoluted and difficult to return their fare until they give up. What a disgusting airline. We are hard-working people.

### "Silver changed the departure time 3 times"
From time of booking to day prior (3 months) Silver changed the departure time 3 times. Day of I received an email that the departure time changed again. Luckily I was able to find another airline to get home. Over the course of the day I received 16 (sixteen) emails from Silver continually changing the departure time. The last email said the flight was cancelled No one answers at customer service nor do they call you back when you select “press 1 to save your place on line and have an agent call you back”. Their website takes you in circles and I was unable to select the refund option. I had to call my credit card company to dispute it.

### "whole first day of my vacation has been wasted"
Not Verified |  We thought we booked a flight with United and when we tried to check in were informed that it was through Silver Airways. Our flight was supposed to leave at 7.05am but then was delayed to 9.45am. At about 9.00 we were told that it was now delayed to 1.15pm. That’s already a 6 hour delay. It’s nuts. We were told it’s due to crew. I will never fly with them again. The whole first day of my vacation has been wasted at the airport. This is just not right.

### "terrible customer service experience"
I wish I had anything nice to say about them. We waited in line for two hours at the baggage check-in, only to arrive at the desk and was notified that our flight was canceled. They couldn't find anything same day, so they booked us for the following morning. They said they would not cover our hotel fees, nor cover a vehicle rental. They said if we wanted to "fight it" we could call customer service. We could not wait that long as we needed to get back to our jobs, so opted to rent a car and drive 8 hours home. We proceeded to call them and waited for 5 HOURS for them to call us back, in which they said there was nothing they could do to reimburse us. I asked to speak with the representative's manager, to which he snarkily said sure, and hung up on us. I have never experienced such a terrible customer service experience. The crazy part is, not once did any of these employees apologize for the inconvenience. It was such a miserable way to end an otherwise wonderful cruise vacation. Save your money and spend elsewhere.

### "worst customer service ever"
The worst customer service ever. The crew was so rude and loud, yelling over the intercom. I’ve never seen anything like it in my entire life. Won’t book with them again.

### "Deplorable service"
Not Verified |  The worst airline experience I have ever had. We were denied passage onto our flight because we were at the gate an hour in advance and apparently were supposed to be there 2 hours in advance for one checked bag. There was one rude employee working that didn’t even offer a different flight until I inquired about it. The only one available is at 9.30 pm and we live 2 hours from the Tampa airport. We were told that rebooking free of charge was a courtesy she was giving us and that she could take it away. This morning I was on hold for over an hour and was told by two different people to send an email. There was nothing else they could do. Deplorable service. Pay the extra money to get people who actually care about their customers.

### "Do not use this airline"
Not Verified |  Do not use this airline! Yesterday our flight was re-scheduled 3 times within the hour of boarding time and then cancelled at the last minute. From the Gate, all 10 of us had to go all the way back to the front desk (not the gate reception, they had no clue) and got no good answers from the attendant. Eventually the attendant said it was cancelled due to mechanical problems. I asked why the flight status has not been changed to cancelled on the monitors, no answer. I asked if they had other planes, or is it just the one, no answers and no apologies. We had to find the bags we checked in at the lower level of the airport, they were at another airlines carousel in the baggage claim area. We found them thanks to another passenger that found his all the way at the end of the lower level. We lost prepaid car rental, hotel and dinner events for three days since the next flight we found through a real airline is in 3 days. Customer Service does not have a number to call just an email so that we can get our refund. So far we have paid for two flights now (until we get our refund) and are stuck at home re-scheduling rentals, hotel, activities and also our work time off (employers are not very happy when you ask for a vacation extension). Horrible horrible service.

### "delayed twice now for a total of 6 hours"
Not Verified |  Never got notified that the flight was delayed 3 hours until we checked our bags. Got delayed twice now for a total of 6 hours and it's not weather related. We could have driven to Orlando faster.

### "unreachable via email or phone"
Not Verified | The airline canceled my flight five minutes after I was asked to check in. 24 hours prior to supposed departure. They were unreachable via email or phone after waiting online for over an hour. Anyone who rates this airline over terrible has to be related to someone that owns the company because they are the worst.

### "Absolutely terrible. Save your money"
Absolutely terrible. Save your money. They canceled my departure flight an hour before we were to board. I booked a new flight on a different airline. Then they canceled my return flight the night before departure. The tickets that last minute were exponentially more expensive. It made my whole trip difficult. Not worth the superficial savings, just don’t do it.

### "They used to be great"
Canceled both flights round trip went round and round with Travelocity and tried twice to get through to Silver but to no avail. Kept me on hold for an hour and never called me back when I left my number to keep in the queue for a call back. They used to be great, even during COVID. Now they are horrible!

### "Outstanding Workers"
We lost my flight due to a flight delay, yet my luggage had been checking already and it made the flight, but we missed it!! Trying to reroute our luggage back was a mission only made possible by the efforts of Silver Airways Baggage Customer Service. They both stayed on top of the matter, e-mail after email, text after text until my 3 luggages were found, and put on an airplane back to us. The luggages arrived separately and on different days! Both times I drove to the airport in Fort Lauderdale and they walked outside the airport to the Departure lane to bring me my luggages. That was outstanding care!! It saved me parking and time! These two individuals went above and beyond to make sure we felt taken care of and we felt like someone really cared about our dilemma!! Because of them I am grateful!!! Today we have back our 3 luggages after 10 days! Thank You for being Outstanding Workers!

### "delayed twice before being canceled"
Not Verified |  Today, I was scheduled to fly from GSP to MCO. The flight was delayed twice before being canceled, all unbeknownst to me -- I received no notifications, no emails, nothing -- there was no screen display for the flight at the gate, either, and the only reason I found out it was delayed was another passenger asked about the notifications they'd received. The flight was canceled after I got home to wait for the delay (again, no notifications). I called the customer service number to be on hold for over 40min before deciding to do the callback option. Four hours later: no callback. Silver customer "care" emails are initially answered by a bot. I contacted United and got a refund. Booked with another airline. What a shame. Flew this airline/same destination a year ago with no issues!

### "my flight had been cancelled"
I was scheduled to fly from Ft Lauderdale to Jacksonville. It was the last leg of my trip to Portland Or before I left Portland I was notified that my flight had been cancelled. It was rescheduled at a later time. When I got there the new flight was canceled. You can’t call these people they have no way to contact anyone. Ended up having to take an Uber to Miami to get a flight to JAX. Terrible

### "no representative available to speak with"
Departing flight was delayed but thankfully not cancelled. Three other Silver flights were announced as cancelled just before the departure times. Returning flight was canceled the night before. There was no Silver representative available to speak with when I tried to contact them.

### "flights are either delayed or cancelled"
Not Verified | This airline is absolutely horrible! Pay the extra money for anything else! Our flight was at 7:30 they delayed it 1 hour before we are supposed to take off. The delayed it to 12:45 didn’t get on the plane till 1 and it’s an extremely small plane! They over book the plane and end up telling people then can’t get on. They do this on purpose! 90% of the flights are either delayed or cancelled. I’m not sure how this airline is still in business! !

### "atrocious, awful airline"
This is an atrocious, awful airline. I would highly recommend anyone to avoid this airline at all costs and pay the cost for an actually functioning airline. I have no idea how this scam of a “business” is even certified by the FAA. Constantly delayed or canceled flights every single day in and day out. Complete intentional and likely fraudulent booking flights while not having the planes to fly them. One of the worst airlines of all time, should be permanently shut down.

### "They are late constantly"
Not Verified |  This is the poorest managed company I have ever dealt with. They are late constantly at pickup and drop off. I was on the first flight with three planes waiting and still a hour and half late. No notification until you get to the airport. The one flight crew lady continually slammed doors in the back of the plane the entire flight. I don’t know what she was doing because they only give out a small bottle of water. I would rather pay big prices than deal with them.

### "Won’t fly Silver again"
Flight was delayed 10 hours and when trying to reach customer service, I stayed on hold over an hour and no one answered. Finally left terminal to go to desk and they did offer to put me on different plane the next day and said it was pilot call out and they had to fly another pilot in. I needed to arrive quickly so stayed the course and when plane finally arrived, there was mechanical problem and no mechanic at airport so they had to call one ins. Finally boarded flight after 2 am after arriving at airport at 2:30 pm on May 31. Return flight was cancelled after waiting at MCO for 6 hours! Won’t fly Silver again. Poor communication, customer service, and reliability. The clerk at desk at MCO on June 7 for return flight was most helpful but airline not reliable.

### "worst airline I have ever been on"
Not Verified |  This was the worst airline I have ever been on. Our flight was supposed to leave at 3:30 and we left around 9:30. It wasn’t weather based it was just them be slow and terrible. Then we were boarding and we had to wait even more. Their reasoning “they forgot to clean the plane.” It blows my mind you can run something this poor and still have a business.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had"
I booked a non-stop round trip ticket to Pensacola from Tampa through United Airlines, only to be shuffled off onto Silver Airways, a company I’d never even heard of. The first problem occurred before my actual travel date, when I received an email informing me that my return flight time had been changed to two hours earlier, which meant I would be getting up at 5am to make the return flight. The REAL problem began when I arrived at the airport in Tampa to find that my departure flight had been delayed for at least 4 hours. I received no prior texts or email regarding the delay, and was forced to spend the next 6 hours at the airport, again with no updates except those on the terminal screens, as Silver Airways has no app, and there was no representative at the gate. The person I dealt with at the Silver Airway ticket counter was one of the rudest individuals I’ve ever met - bored, annoyed, and with no people skills whatsoever, sighing heavily when I asked for possible flight alternatives, with more concern for her 4 inch fingernails getting chipped by the computer keyboard than for a paying customer like me. When she told me there were no other flights that day, I asked about changing my return flight to a later time so I could spend more time at my destination, at which point she told me that I wasn’t even booked for a return flight. When I produced my printed confirmation email, she just said, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” When I asked if I could speak with someone else, she picked up the phone and called someone else, who evidently told her that the only return flight was already fully booked and I could make no changes. She then hung up before I could speak to that person myself. I went to the United ticket counter (since I’d originally booked with them) to see if they could help me, only to be told that I had to deal with Silver, as all in-state flights had been subcontracted to them. Stuck at the airport for the next 6 hours, I waited for the delayed aircraft to arrive with no more updates other than the terminal screens, only to discover that the aircraft was a small turboprop, which I would never have agreed to had I only known. Finally boarded the plane 4 and a half hours later than scheduled, having to drag my luggage across the tarmac and up a very steep, very narrow set of stairs - not an easy task for a 64 year old woman - with no offers of assistance from the ground crew standing by and watching me struggle. I travel frequently, all over the world, and this was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had - poor communication, unexplained flight changes, no flight app, and rude treatment at the ticket counter. Despite finally receiving a confirmation email regarding my return flight, I will be booking a rental car and driving 8 hours home to avoid the hassle and the sure-to-be-delayed flight in a turboprop. Do yourself a major favor and avoid Silver Airways at all costs.

### "They lied to us"
We boarded a flight from Nassau, Bahamas to Tampa FL which was due to arrive at our destination at 4:45pm. Due to weather the captain informed us they didn't load enough fuel to circle Tampa and wait for the weather to clear. We eventually arrived at 9pm but our baggage did not. We were told our bags would arrive by 1am. They did not. Then we were told they would arrive by 1pm the following day. We called and were told the supervisor was retrieving the bags as we speak. They did not. They lied to us. The flight the bags were supposed to be on was actually canceled. Now we have been told they will arrive later tonight. I highly recommend you to pay a little more and save yourself from being caught in the middle of this clown show.

### "not recommend this to anyone"
Not Verified |  I had a flight from SAV airport to FLL airport the day of May 21st, 2023 at 9pm. I arrived at the airport at 6:40pm at the silver airways counter. I was in line for almost an hour. When I got to the desk they told me that were no more seats available on the plane and that it was overbooked. They then said that the plane was too small. And then they finally said they were gonna change my flight for the the next day. This also happened to the other 23 people that were going on the plane behind me but I was the first one to arrive at the counter. They moved me aside and told me they were gonna put us all on the plane. They started to put everyone on the plane besides me and then they told me I wouldn’t be able to get on the plane. I was the only one that wasn’t able to fly that night on the plane. This is the worst airline in the US I have tried and would not recommend this to anyone. A review doesn’t describe how terrible my experience was or how bad this airline is. To be clear the “manager” was very disrespectful of my time considering I was the first one that arrived.

### "ruined my birthday trip"
Not Verified |  They pushed my flight back 6 times & told all the guest they could get on the next flight in the morning . Left me having to spend the night at a hotel (pay out of pocket) Come back the next morning and they pushed the flight time back 3-4 times before I had to book another flight with another company. Then all they would say is “We can get you on our next flight” which was like 2-3 days later. I ended up having to fly to Tennessee & find a ride to Alabama because no flights were going to Alabama that day. Missed work, ruined my birthday trip & I ended up spending $300+ on a last minute one way ticket to get home & a 2 hour drive from Nashville at midnight. The only thing they are offering is $100 towards the room which was $145. Then it takes 3-4 months to get that back.

### "worst airline I have ever seen"
Not Verified |  Silver Airways is without a doubt the worst airline I have ever seen in my life. I had a 10 PM flight from Jacksonville to Fort Lauderdale, a few hours before the flight I got a notice that the departure was pushed back until 11:15 another hour later I got an email stating it was taking off at 12:10. Finally I arrive at the airport at 10:45 to make sure I make my 12:10 departure time upon arrival at the airport they delayed it to 1:10 am. Once I arrived at the gate I waited there until which the worker at the desk stated to all of the passengers that the crew had timed out and they will be delaying the flight until 10 am the following morning. Many passengers were frustrated including one women who told the assistant at the desk that she had driven 3 hours and doesn’t have money for a hotel and hopes they can put her up for the night in a hotel. The same worker told the lady “There’s nothing I can do for you because it’s not our fault so it’s not my problem, you can sleep in the airport”. I was completely in awe of the absolute disrespect silver and their airline employees showed to passengers who payed a lot of money to get to their destinations on time safely. The following morning I arrived at the airport at 8:30 to make sure I will make my 10 am flight. I then was told that the flight was delayed until 12:30 pm. So after waiting 4 hours until 12 PM all of the passengers were seated at the gate and waiting anxiously. 30 minutes from our expected take off there were still no crew members at the gate, no pilots and the plane was parked on the other side of the tarmac. The pilots finally arrived but still no crew members at the gate. We continued to wait with absolutely no update of any kind and we’re further delayed passed our expected departure. After numerous attempts to contact silver airlines there was no response and it said there was nobody available at the call center and to try again later. I had tried 6 times to get in contact with no answer. We finally boarded our flight an hour later and the desk agents were rude and showed extreme levels of ignorance towards passengers who were trying to display their dissatisfaction with the entire process. Safe to say I will never ever fly silver airways again even if it is my only option. And I will personally never recommend the airline to anyone, in fact I will tell everyone I know to avoid taking this absolute joke of an airline. So poorly ran and very bad crew and workers all around. If I could give this negative stars I would.

### "finally refunded for the flights"
I booked a round trip with Silver Airways but could not fly with them either way. I received an email 2 hours before take off that it was cancelled. I booked a different longer, more expensive flight on another airline. An hour and half later, I received an email that my Silver flight was back on but I was already checked into the other flight. Then on the return flight, I began receiving flight delay emails at 2 am the morning of the flight then it was also cancelled. Again, I had book another more expensive and longer flight. Then to add insult to injury you cannot call and talk to anyone in customer service. There is only an email option to communicate with Silver. I sent multiple emails and over a week later, I was finally refunded for the flights I could not take but they cannot reimburse me for the additional $550 I paid in flights due to their fault and did not even attempt to accommodate me.

### "I will never fly with them again"
My plane from Silver Airways was supposed to leave around 3:30 pm. First there was about a 2 hour delay, then they just kept delaying for mechanical reasons. Once the plane finally got there, about 7:30 pm, they had to do more maintenance. Eventually they said the plane was inoperable so they were going to switch to a different plane so we waited until 9:45 pm when they plane landed to get us they decided to cancel the whole flight. I understand planes have mechanical problems and i definitely do not want to fly on a plane that’ does. I don’t understand why they told us they were going to switch to the other plane then cancel. It was ridiculous the lack of communication. On top of all that they gave us $12 food vouchers. We went to use them and the restaurants at the airport wouldn’t take them because silver airlines doesn't reimburse them for the vouchers and in my opinion that says a lot about this airline. I will never fly with them again.

### "No more Silver"
No more Silver. Arriving in FLL on time with United and then looking at the Board where connecting Gate for Silver is. A6 (see image) so we walked from C to A gates and waited. Nothing happens and I got worried, something must be wrong. Checking departure display again --> A6. Nobody from Silver to be seen. I spotted a first officer for Silver there at the gate and he was new and called Silver and not even he did get a quality response what Gate the Key West flight is leaving from. Boarding time and nothing so putting 1 and 1 together that this is not a Silver Gate at all and running back to where we came from C gates. At the Gate they told me this is your gate but we are delayed. I said why is there no indication nowhere about the Gate, the delay and so on. Then only the lady made an announcement. I asked why the wrong gate is still displayed. They have no control over the boards. I asked can't you call whoever is in control of the departure and gate displays? No answer. So after running around and 2 hour delay we finally got to board and left FLL. I forgot but you guessed it there was nobody picking up the phone from the Help desk or other Silver number. The bad thing this seemed to be the normal thing, so who cares...If it is like that just tell the passengers wrong displays and delays are normal and part of our daily business. Needless to say but even with United using Silver as a partner, there is no Silver for us in the future.

### "First and last time I will fly silver"
Not Verified |  First and last time I will ever fly silver if I can avoid it. Almost a 4-hour delay, with very little information as to why it was so far delayed. Once finally getting on the plane, it was extremely hot and uncomfortable. I am tall, this airline had absolutely no extra room. Fortunately there was nobody in the seat next to me, if there was, I genuinely don't think I would have fit.

### "Worse flight experience"
Arrive to New Orleans on time. I arrive there expecting a 3 hr layover. Instead it was due to delayed til 10:45pm. That would have been over 7hrs. No reason why, there was no one at checkin desk, I was stuck at terminal with other passenger who had no clue. I called, no answer, sometime the flight just disappeared. I didn’t not choose fly with Silver Airways. It was quick connecting flight. Why don’t anyone notified why the flight is delayed is beyond me. No excuses, just tell the passenger what’s going on so we can make plans accordingly, finally I was able to reach the airport operator about my situations and many others who was stuck on this flight. About 30 min before boarding finally some one showed up. Worse flight experience I ever encountered

### "No one cared, no sense of urgency"
Rude staff. We were asked to move because of the weight of the plane. We did to be accommodating. To our surprise we were placed in pretty much a closet size Space in the last row, no way to recline and no way to get any air. Not sure if it was broken but everyone around us was panicked, uncomfortable and fanning themselves furiously. The flight attendant was about as worthless as a box of rocks. Here and the other flight attendant spent the whole flight loudly gossiping with her rear end directly in my friends face sometimes resting it on her arm. No one cared, no sense of urgency. But hey, you get what you pay for right?

### "Do not use this airline"
Flight delayed three times into the late night - email only - no information. One person at the ticket counter handling all the people for previous cancelled flight. Cannot call anyone - nobody answer the support line, airport people don't know or support the airline. Once you buy the ticket you are on your own. Not enough staff and no management at the airport. We had to go to Southwest, who had a flight for us that night. They saved the day. We got to Tampa before the last Silver delay flight start time. Do not use this airline.

### "lack of doing their jobs"
I booked my flight to Orlando and back to Charleston, SC for a healthcare conference for Thursday, March 24th - Monday, March 27th. It was no problem with Delta to get to Orlando easily and smoothly but once Monday came, Silver Airways was a nightmare and continues to be. First thing, flight got delayed and delayed and delayed so we ended up with an email saying 7:12 pm flight out and then their website saying 6:11 pm the former delay prior to this. (Our flight time out of Orlando was originally 2:35 pm. That’s fine, flights get delayed I get that. No problem. So as we stood in line for over an hour, we began to realize we weren’t moving and still not moving much and we were going to miss our flight. The people all in front of us were angry because of the lack of service and common sense the Silver Airways staff showed. The lack of simple “I’m sorry that your flight is cancelled, but here’s what you can do” didn’t exist and when it was our turn and we had just missed the flight, this is about 7:15 pm now, we walk up and speak to the agent who has no idea what to do and says that. Literally says to us “I don’t know what to do and what you want me to do” excuse me? So after asking her what can we do? How do we re-route? She informs us in a nasty tone and attitude that they don’t do that. They didn’t help. They didn’t do a thing and refused to help. Then when I shared that I booked with Expedia, she said that’s not their fault or problem. I cannot believe this. The attitude. The lack of help. The lack of doing their jobs and no refund thus far. We’ve made a few calls and Expedia stated today at 5:00 pm, I needed to call the Silver Airways phone lines which both lines no one answers on. No one. The 801 # just puts you on hold while the 954 # is disconnected. Silver Airways, you owe me my flight $448.98 and a hotel stay since I had to go find out at another airline (American Airlines) to go home and had to wait the night out the Hyatt Hotel at the airport.

### "the worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  Why does United Airlines use this airline as part of their Star Alliance? This is the worst flying experience we’ve ever encountered! So many delays. So much misinformation. So much uncaring attitude & rudeness by the gate agents. We will never fly this airline again. This was the second flight on our trip. We didn’t know we were being passed off to this shoddy, sketchy airline. Shame on United Airlines for using this airline. Shame on Silver Airlines for your horrible customer service & continual delays.

### "Don't waste your time and money"
This is unbelievable. My flight was supposed to leave at 9:05 pm, the boarding time was schedule at 8:20pm. I got to the gate to the exact at 8:26 pm and the plane had already left. I didn't see anyone from the airline but the screen was showing that it was still on time. After a couple of minutes trying to know was going on, the plane wasn't there and no one from the crew. When I checked on flight tracker it said that the plane left 39 minutes earlier. At 8:26 pm the plane was flying. Today I still haven't received any answers. I had to book a hotel and another flight. Spoke with to guys in the counter and of them said that the pilot decided to leave early and the another who I decided to speak with him before leaving on my other flight, he gave me a supervisor phone number that never answers and there's not even a voice mail set up. Don't waste your time and money, please.

### "Never again!"
Had no issues with my departing flight. My arrival flight home however was a different story. We arrived more than two hours before flight and no one was at the window. Waited for over 45 minutes just to be told pit flight was cancelled due to the AC not working (I was able to check in online the day before with no issues). I was not offered any arrangements to stay overnight and told the next flight out is the next day as they only have one flight to Pensacola each day. Their genuine lack of concern makes me things that this happens often. This was booked with capital one points which showed it was booked under United. Never again!

### "Never ever again"
The plane was supposed to take off at 8:35 pm they have delayed plane multiple times and now taking off at 2 am. No other flights to change too nothing just a food voucher for 12$ a person. I mentioned they should have air mattresses for everyone and not some stupid good voucher. Never ever again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever, our flight suppose to be at noon and now is at 5, they keep changing departure time, no staff around and just no answers from anyone.

### "Avoid this airline"
No communication from the airline our flight was delayed. A text or phone call would have been nice so we could have arrived at the airport later. The check in agent was beyond rude and as unhelpful as possible. Told me I had to remove my laptop per TSA. I told her TSA allows laptops in checked bags and to please double check. She demanded I take it out and carry it on. She then takes my bag and slams it into the conveyor belt. Avoid this airline if at all possible.

### "first time and was impressed"
Not Verified |  I took this airline for the first time and was impressed. My bag was too large to fit in the overhead bin going from Ft. Lauderdale to Key West so they put it in the cargo hold which was no big deal. Seats are wider with more room even for a big guy like me. Very professional and very friendly as long as you’re polite which you should be to all people. Took off on time and water was handed out as it was a short flight. Very smooth and not overly noisy airplane at all. When we landed my bag was ready for me that was in the cargo hold as soon as I left the plane. The new planes they have really makes a difference and it’s good for any budget. You have a choice of which fare you want so choose wisely. I chose the escape fare as it was the lowest and most value for the money. You had to pay for the seat but for me with carry on and a personal item I was fine. If you have to check your bag expect to pay. Always read about baggage fees and cancellation fees so there are no surprises. On the way back my bag fit in the overhead bin because I came home with less. Just don’t expect too much. It’s just a commuter plane.

### "average hold time is 5 hours"
The worst airline I have ever flown with. I am used to budget airlines and no amenity travel so that is not the issue here. Although it was the most budget airline I have flown, the plane smelled terrible and there were old stickers all over the plane as if it was “tagged”. My first flight they delayed the flight by over an hour right before boarding. Odd but ok. My second flight they canceled the flight 45 minutes after their customer service number was closed. They asked me to fill out a form online in regard to my canceled flight. I did so and also called at 8 am the next day and didn’t get a representative on the phone until 5 pm. I was stuck in the city. Their website says that they cover amenities if the flight is delayed longer than 4 hours and a hotel room up to $100 if it is delayed or canceled overnight. I had paid $50 for a “change fee” for this flight. So when I finally got in the phone with a representative I was told that the couldn’t refund the change fee, they didn’t know what amenities were covered (and it would take 30 business days to get back to me), and that they could only issue a refund of 1/2 the price of the flight. I am still going back and forth with customer service because I was supposed to get an email that I could reply to directly for concerns and updates and I never received it. The average hold time for calling their center is 5 hours. I will never ever fly this airline again.

### "staff are unpleasant"
This airline is a JOKE. It's unreliable, the staff are unpleasant. Next time I'll just fly to Nashville on a real airline and then drive.

### "continually delayed from Orlando"
Second time using airline from Orlando to Huntsville. First trip with Silver was was delayed 3 hours, today’s flight has been delayed 5 hours and still counting. No updates other than incorrect gate changes. Status saying they are boarding and final call at wrong gate. Spoke with person at desk and she said there is a plane but could not tell us if it is in route. Just received message flight schedule scheduled for 1pm is now 7:15pn. It is 7.04pm and no plane to be be seen. Airline is awful at communicating updates and continually delayed from Orlando airport. Do not recommend unless you like being stressed all day! Boarded finally 6+ hours late.

### "I would fly with Silver again"
The other flights from MCO to EYW included long layovers and were expensive. My husband voted for giving Silver a try since it was only a little more than an hour flight. Still, I read the reviews before and after booking and was concerned. However, both legs of our trip were fantastic. The planes seemed newer and clean. The flight attendants were professional and polite. The flights themselves were as smooth as butter. This is a small airline, so it simply is not reasonable to expect big airline perks. There isn't a drink and/or snack service, but we were offered small bottles of water. Really, there wasn't even enough time on our flight. We were in the air a little over an hour and were spared a six-hour drive to Key West. The cost of our tickets was economical and probably not much more than we would have spent on a drive between gas, tolls and meals. I would fly with Silver again.

### "I would never recommend this company"
The first flight was over two hours late, getting to our destination. On the way back home., the flight was two hours late departed the gate again. Where I was finding out about the rescheduling, the girl at the desk was very rude, and did not seem to know what she was talking about. When we got on the flight, everything seemed Okay, to about the halfway point to our destination. Then the power came. The intercom said that if the disability was too bad too land, then, the plane would have to turn around and head to Tampa. As we arrived into Tallahassee, they started to descend the aircraft. Then all of a sudden they brought the aircraft back up again in a very jerking movement. Then they got back on the intercom and said that the plane would be diverted back to Tampa. Then I asked flight attendant, would they arrange hotel accommodations for everybody since we had to turn around? She said they would take care of the hotel combinations and then get everybody back on the plane, for the next day. As we arrived in Tampa pilot got back on the intercom, and made the announcement that the plane would leave you in Tampa, then head back to Fort Lauderdale. I asked the pilot and another flight attendant about the hotel accommodations, and they said that, they will not be responsible for hotel accommodations or to arrange for the return home flight. We would have to make all the accommodations ourselves. Those who want to get off in Tampa when they were refueling, would go ahead and get off the plane. And those who wanted to go back to Fort Lauderdale, would just stay on the plane. There were other major problems problems when we arrived inside the building. The ground crew told us, that we had three choices to make. Either get back on the plane and go to Fort Lauderdale. Or we stay in Tampa, and take our chances and fly out the next day on a flight that could only seat 56 people and they were already at least 30 people who decided to get off the flight. And, the last choice was., go back inside and go to the desk and request a refund for the meaning of the trip. They said, if you purchased your ticket through a website that was not the airlines website, then they would put a reference on your account, so is the agency where you bought your ticket from, can see it, and they can apply the refund. Once we got inside, we were told that those who bought tickets off of another website, would not get a reference on our account for them. Every bit of information that we’ve been told, what is wrong. They have no idea what they’re doing as a company they should not even be in business. We’ve also had other problems with the company in other areas that they told me something and it was the wrong information also. It’ll be the last time I ever step foot on their aircraft again. I would never recommend this company.

### "an enjoyable experience"
On time, clean. Employees helpful and courteous. Complementary water offered for this very short flight. Plenty of leg room. Not crowded. Overall, an enjoyable experience. Much much cheaper than competitors, which were experiencing problems.

### "I will never schedule with them again"
Not Verified |  First thing is you can wait on hold for several hours or you can have them call you back and still wait several hours. 2 days before our scheduled flight they sent an email which said our flight was canceled. It took most of the next day to be informed that our flight was not canceled. It was due to a system glitch. On our day of travel we are informed at the airport that our flight was truly canceled. Never received notification. I will never schedule with them again.

### "Worst experience I've had flying"
Worst experience I've had flying and I fly a lot. Received an email 3 days prior to departing that my flight was cancelled then a few hours later receive an email stating that was sent by accident. Fast forward to departure day get to the airport to find out my flight has been cancelled and they don't have another flight for 2 which would cause us to miss our hotel reservation and other flights plus a day or more of work.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever, they changed my flight and never told me anything. I sat at the airport for 6 hours and the flight was delayed 4 times. Do not travel with Silver Airways.

### "Totally unreliable"
Totally unreliable. Stay away at all cost. Cancelled my flight without obvious reasons. I wish I read other reviews before I book my ticket. I will never use this company again. One of the worst companies ever

### "Be very wary of this Airline"
I cannot believe this Airline is doing business legitimately. We had a return flight booked through United Airlines from Ft Lauderdale, FL to Tampa, FL in the afternoon. United apparently partners with Silver Airways. We were never sent a link or reminder to "Check In", so we had no way to do a mobile check-in. We called Silver Airlines and the Rep said "we can't tell you if it's going to leave or not" We then looked at the United App, it said "Delayed". The departure time now showed 4.5 hours later. We called United and the Agent said the flight WAS LEAVING AS SCHEDULED and didn't know why the SA Agent would tell us otherwise. But interestingly, United's App did show delayed. So then there's that. We called Silver Airways 3 times over the next few hours and they kept telling us they didn't know if the flight would leave or not but that we should just show up at the airport anyway. To quote her "just come to the airport and you'll be good to go. We don't know if the plane will leave or not. Sometimes they need to do an oil change. This is where I lost my head. Amongst other choice words, I told her I could rent a car and drive to my destination in 3.5 hours. I wasn't going to make a trip to the airport and wait for a flight that "may or may not happen". I need to know now if the flight is on schedule so that I can make alternative plans. How can you tell your passengers you don't know if their flight will leave or not? She put me on hold to speak to her supervisor, then returned and said, yes the flight would leave on time. This caused us 6 hours of confusion and angst. It ruined our plans for the day in Miami, since we didn't know if or how we would leave. In all of my years, I've had delays, cancellations, interruptions...yes, even oil changes....but I've never been told maybe it will go and maybe it won't. I'll just have to wait and see? I suspect something else was going on here, but I'm not sure what or why they would string passengers on like that. Be very wary of this Airline. If United or Delta try to book you on it as a partner airline, I suggest you politely decline.

### "really a bad experience"
Not Verified |  I will not recommend this airline to anyone. It seems no one wants to take accountability for anything. The ground staff was good but they input the TSA PRE CHECK was put in wrong so even though It said TSA precheck on my boarding pass but they did not allow me. Since the Airline was a partner of United we purchased our tickets with United Card so at least 1 bags can be checked in for free but no that does not work I had to pay $35 for the checked bag. When I returned to Orlando the bags took more then 1 hour to be on the belt so all the passengers were waiting for their bags. This was really a bad experience.

### "this has been the worst experience I have had traveling"
Not Verified |  Silver Airways is an incompetent/irresponsible airline. I left Boston on October 28, 2022, via JetBlue with a connecting flight in San Juan heading to Dominica via Silver Airways. Once I reached San Juan, I was told I would have to overnight in San Juan, due to the flight being cancelled by Silver Airways. In San Juan I had a conversation with the attendant at the counter and was told that my luggage would be added to my flight in the morning and it would be at my final destination. That morning my flight was scheduled to leave San Juan at 6am and was delayed. Upon arrival in Dominica my checked luggage was left behind in San Juan. I went to the counter, I barely received any help. I gave my information and I had to make several attempts on my own. I was forced to purchase and borrow clothes from family, due to the uncertainty of when I will receive my luggage. On my return back home, I had to borrow luggage to return home. I went to the airport two hours before the check in time to only be met with no one at the counter. The check in time was extremely painful after being in line for two hours. I finally made it through, we waited for over an hour on a hot plane and was only given a warm bottle of water, while sweating. This flight was delayed for over 4 hours. Upon arrival in San Juan, I still did not receive my borrowed luggage. Due to the delay, I missed my connecting flight with JetBlue and was rebooked with Delta. I was just handed a boarding pass with no direction as what to do. Rather than having a direct from San Juan to Boston. I had a connecting which added an additional 7hrs to my flight, which caused me to not be able to go to work. Overall, this has been the worst experience I have had traveling. I will not use or recommend Silver Airways to any family and friends. In the past I enjoyed visiting Dominica, Silver Airways has made me not want to visit back home, due to this traumatizing experience while traveling. After getting home to the US, it took a few days before my luggage was delivered to my family home in Dominica. Truly Silver Airway has no regards for their customers.

### "first and last time with them"
Not Verified |  The plane and stewardesses are fine, actually they're great. Just don't call the 800 number. They are rude! So rude they hang up if they don't like a question about anything. You call back nobody answers. I had an extra charge I wanted to ask about. Instead of answering it they hung up and I tried to call back. Nobody answered. They are out sourced too so I guess they are trained that way. But money is hard to make. Stealing isn't how I make money. So go with a large company. It does cost more but you ended up paying more with this company than I would have South west or any other respectable company. This was the first and last time with them.

### "our experience was very positive"
Not sure why all the terrible reviews, our experience was very positive. Flight there and back were on time and not travel issues. Staff was helpful and friendly. This is a small regional airline, but they fly non-stop routes that will save you a LOT of time and money. It's no frills but they got the job done comfortably. We would use them again

### "Really disappointed and upset"
Not Verified |  Really disappointed and upset. Me and my husband went to our honey moon. Until coming to the airport when a few moments earlier since we kept on getting a lm error on our check in. We waiting for a customer server and  no one was there. Then we asked some other customer serve that worked their if they can find us some from the silver airways. The airplane is boarding at this point and they tell us we can’t board as we late, when they was a guy who had his pass was able to leave and we tried to explain that we were unable to check in. So now we had to buy new tickets and we lost ticket from Puerto Rico to Seattle. That’s a 1,000 down the drain and they didn’t care. When we still had 35 min until boarding. So no me we not only wasted a day  now we have to stay the night at a hotel and so much other little things. When this was able to be avoided if they let us board when we had 35 mins more left when their websites was giving us an error. Everything was horrible they didn’t care whatsoever. The fact that no one is even at the desk. We would’ve made it according to them if we came 15 min earlier when we did and no one was their so we went and asked around. And even then we still had 35 min and they said they can’t do anything about it.

### "service is absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  Never provided information that there was a plane change (smaller aircraft) until it was time to board. Then they managed to get us on board but didn't state that the same problems would exist at our first stop (Orlando). They overbooked and had passengers from another flight waiting to board our flight. Why would an airline fly you out of your home airport and leave you stranded in another city purposely. Then they advised us to rent a car and it would be reimbursed. That was a complete lie. Customer service is absolutely horrible. And by the way I booked through United Airlines and was told the flight would be serviced by Silver

### "so disappointing in so many ways"
Horrible flight from Orlando to Ft Lauderdale NO AIR CONDITIONING. Once airborne the inside cabin rose to 90 degrees. People were sweating in their seats. The flight crew gave out room temperature water. Upon landing, they opened the back doors and left everyone standing and waiting 15-20 min while they took off the luggage from back of plane. The temperature rose to over 100 degrees, children were crying, elderly ladies were feeling faint, we put water on them and were fanning them with the emergency brochures. When we repeatedly asked if we could deplane first as people were getting sick - they said noand the baggage people continued unloading at a slow pace. WHATS WORSE: They loaded up the plane with people moments after we got off for the next flight. And they would experience the same horrible flight. This is so disappointing in so many ways. NEVER FLY SILVER AIRWAYS! !

### "discounted customer service"
Not Verified |  I made a mistake and figured I would save 100 dollars and book JetBlue and Silver Airways on my return trip from Colombia - huge mistake. Literally 2 hours before my flight is supposed to leave and the Silver Airways employees aren't even at the kiosk. I guess discounted plane tickets mean discounted customer service.

### "been a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  I booked a round trip flight for a friend from San Juan to Santiago and back for her to attend an event. The flight has been cancelled twice. The first time they gave me a new date but never sent me the notice. I only learned of this because I tried to change the date myself. And thank God the event was changed to September, so I changed the flight Now this second time it's been four days since I got notice that the flight has been cancelled again and I still haven't got an answer from them regarding a new flight day. And also, the fact that I am hard of hearing. They have never answered my emails except with an automated message and when I tried to reach them through Instagram they answered me that I needed to make a phone call! I had to ask another friend to make the phone call for me. It has been a horrible experience. I'm never using this airline again.

### "regret booking my flight through them"
Not Verified |  Silver Airways is the worst possible airline to fly with. I had an issue with my boarding pass, called them at 10:30, saved my place in line and got a call back at 16:30. They were not helpful at all. I then had a second issue, the boarding passes didn't have pre check which I specifically called to make sure of as well even after the KTN numbers were added at the time of booking. They assured me everything was fine but no. I had no pre check and no time to wait at the counter since I specifically counted my time and was going straight to the airport from work. Not only that their customer service is mediocre but they also hung up the phone on me as I was speaking! Spend 100$ more and save yourself the trouble. I seriously regret booking my flight through them.

### "no one is keeping us to date"
Not Verified |  1.45 canceled to 3.15, then 3.45 and then our original plane died. Changing planes with a 5.30 projected departure or will it be a boarding time, nobody knows because no one is keeping us to date. We will have a 1/2 to a whole day lost because of this airline. Like most other airlines, they don’t care! They have your money, it’s all that matters to them. There is no more customer service. June 19, flight 93 to Key West from Fort Lauderdale.

### "Total SCAM in my opinion"
Not Verified | Charleston to St. Petersburg. Total SCAM in my opinion! We just spent over THREE HOURS ON HOLD with them today because we couldn't transact via their website. The 'help window' on the site referred us to their call center. However, NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE THERE FOR HOURS! This isn't the first time this has happened to us but it will be the last. We have other flights booked in December and I'll be switching to another airline. And they delay flights, which is why we had to cancel. They're not like the big guys. They admitted to us that they didn't know why the flight was delayed or if it would even take off today. Therefore we had to cancel all the legs today AND tomorrow. Our entire family vacation airfare just cost us double. We had to rebook in order to guarantee making it to the cruise on time tomorrow morning. And oh yeah, no luggage refunds either - even though this is all their fault. And it cost us $50 cancel fee per ticket. Basically $100 bucks per ticket. Never again with these guys. Can't believe they're still in business.

### "questioned my lack of a negative Covid test"
We were scheduled to fly Ft Lauderdale FL to Eleuthera, Bahamas. Upon arrival at the airport, we presented the ticket agent with our travel documents. My husband had his passport, Bahamas Travel Visa and a negative Covid test. I had my passport, Bahamas Travel Visa, a letter from my physician, and an exemption letter from the ministry of travel of the Bahamas granting me an exemption to the testing requirement as I had recently recovered from Covid. One ticket agent questioned my lack of a negative Covid test and another agent ended up stamping us approved after some discussion. We cleared security and proceeded to the concourse where we had lunch and checked with the gate a few times to make sure flight was on time etc. As we approached the gate 45 minutes from departure, we were being paged. At that time, we were told that the airline's safety officer was denying us travel because I did not have a negative test to produce. We had to go back to the ticket counter, where one of there agents saw us approaching and recommended we check with Bahamas Air. Bahamas Air sold us a ticket which got us to Nassau where we had to overnight and then connect to Eleuthera the following day. This new ticket cost us over $700, plus over $300 to overnight in Nassau and the loss of a night at our rental in Eleuthera at $1000.00 per night. Silver Airways flies passengers on domestic routes all day with no Covid test so this decision was clearly not based in any logic or safety. The reason you no longer test until negative is some people test positive for up to 3 months. I never had one symptom but continue to test positive. This was arbitrary and punitive and I believe it was escalated to Silver Airways Safety Officer by the one ticket agent.

### "they need to be shut down"
I had a flight from New Orleans to Jacksonville. They canceled my flight after 10pm the night before i was supposed to leave, no explanation as to why just an email to contact customer service which closed at 6pmEST. I ended up spending $483 to book a last minute ticket so that I could get home. I have called customer service and no one ever answers the phone after sitting on hold for 2 hrs. Also if you do the hold your place for a call back no one calls back. No refund no nothing. This is ridiculous and they need to be shut down.

### "Too good to be true. This airline is a scam"
Not Verified |  Booked my ticket and was so happy for such a low price for non-stop. Too good to be true. This airline is a scam. Checked in to flight and was prepared to leave the next morning. Later the night before got an email that it was canceled with no reason and no rebooking and no refund. Crazy. Sent several emails and called to find out the customer service closed early. Spent hours trying to find another ticket on another airline. The next day called customer service and asked for a call back. 7.5 hours later got a call. No empathy no offer of a rebooking. Claims I will receive a refund in 10-15 days but refused to send an email invoice verification. Then was told to go on manage my trip. I asked them to hold on while I did that and they hung up the phone on me. I can only assume that the FAA will shut this operation down.

### "My flight was cancelled without any reason given"
I was returning home from a trip to St. Croix. Delta partnered with Silver for this leg of my trip. My flight was cancelled without any reason given. This cancelation caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was told there was reservations made for me at the Marriott Courtyard in San Juan as I was going to have to spend the night. Long story short. They issued me hotel, taxi and meal vouchers. None of them were accepted with the exception of the taxi drivers and they probably won't get their money either. I had to pay for my hotel as well as my food. I sent an email to their customer relations department but from reading their so-called "customer care plan" I won't hear from them in another 60 days. From reading the complaints on this site, I think we should all ban together and file a class action for our troubles.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  I hate doing this but I felt this is the only way JetBlue will hold the "sister" company accountable for the horrible customer service and just down right bad airline. I do not understand the reason behind JetBlue add this Silver Airways. JetBlue has always been great BUT then I had a connecting flight with the Silver Airways (that I had no choice in picking) since I did it with JetBlue it was all or nothing so I feel it is JetBlue's fault as well for doing business with an airline like Silver and not care about the service and delay and time wasting they are putting on JetBlue customers Unfortunately I did not think to look up Silver because I love JetBlue and thought they must be just as good. I landed in Fort Lauderdale at 5:38 am Sunday in Terminal 3, Silver Airways was in terminal 1 I had to walk 8 minutes out of the airport only way to get 1 to do the security check again. My gate the display never changes for hours then when we notice nothing is going on we asked and we were told that the pilots had to sleep and that the flight would be delayed until 9:50 am so we wait our tickets said departs 8:15am we did not board until 10:50 NO One said we are sorry or nothing on or off the plane. We had to walk out and up the stairs into the plane no one told us anything. Long story short was suppose to be home at 9:35 am I got in at 1 PM, and then wait on luggage.

### "Will never fly again with Silver Airways"
Will never fly again with Silver Airways. The cliche “You get what you paid for” holds true for this instance. The issue wasn’t the fact that it was delayed twice and then cancelled altogether, but that passengers weren’t notified until last minute. We were stranded at the airport for 10 hrs, then to find out that the next scheduled flight was not at 10:30A, but 3:30PM. I lost 12 hrs of work ($512), had to take a rental ($192 + $58 for gas), lost the $89 of the air fare. All because Silver Airways does not care about it’s customers. The front line workers were excellent, but this company has a poor leadership. They follow the “I guess it sucks for you. Figure it out. No refunds.” Not good business. Keep your customers informed. They will understand. But what you don’t do is leave them in the limbo. I couldn’t get anyone at Customer Service, no one was at the ticket counter, and just had to cross my fingers and hope for the best.

### "By far the worst airline"
By far the worst airline, compared to them Spirit is a 10. Before spend you money and booking with them you should think twice. Sat in the airport for over 6 hours with them lying about a weather delay while watching other airlines take off.

### "I just want my money back"
Not Verified |  Silver Airlines and Travelocity is an absolute joke. Booked round trip Seattle to Fort Lauderdale. Got a message that they had to change the first leg of the return flight, but it landed after the second leg departed. Obviously, that won’t work. Tried for a week before my trip to get in touch with someone that could help but kept getting the run around. Various customer service agents promising to call back and fix it. Rude customer service agents that wouldn’t transfer me to a manager. I heard nothing back after multiple messages, emails, and online chats. Ended up having to book a one-way return flight home from Florida, which was significantly more expensive. I just want my money back. But I can’t get anyone to help. This is beyond frustrating and a time suck that I don’t have time for. Don’t book through Travelocity or with Silver Airways.

### "This airline is a joke"
This airline is a joke. Went to check in in Jacksonville had one young girl behind the counter with a line out the door of people with issues or trying to get checked in. Computers were down-" so could not print boarding passes. Paid for 2 bags to be checked, but only brought one. Could not refund the money. Told to call Customer Service- went to voice mail. stating they were not open. (Friday 9am EST). Sent email to their customer service and no answer. Return flight was delayed by over an hour, "computers down" at that airport as well. Tried calling the Customer Service number for bag refund again- on hold for over 1.5 hours before I hung up.

### "Silver Airways should be out of business"
On the morning of April 26, 2022 my wife, Daniele, and I were scheduled to depart Dominica for San Juan at 8:15 am on the Silver Airways flight that was scheduled to depart at 8:15. From San Juan we had connections on to Philadelphia and Montreal, our final destination. The PHL connection was at 1:00pm, so plenty of time (3 hours in San Juan) to clear customs and make the flight. We arrived at DOM airport at 6:00am and checked in and were in the departure lounge by 7:00 am. The Silver Airways Saab 340 was there on the ground, visible to all. There was no boarding call for our flight. Time went by. People got impatient. Finally, 4 hours later, at noon we were told to board the flight. There was no communication, no reason given, nada. We, and many others, missed our connecting flights. In our case we had to get a room at the airport hotel and get up at 2:00 am in order to catch an American flight to PHL at 5:00 am. The unofficial reason for the Silver flight delay, supplied to us by airport staff members in DOM, was that the Saab 340 is not authorized to take off on a wet runway - it was raining lightly much of the morning of April 26. If so, and no other excuse was given to us by Silver, then this is the most absurd thing I've ever heard of in 50 years of flying, much of it in undeveloped parts of the world. Simply put, Silver Airways should be out of business.

### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified | Orlando to Greenville. Terrible airline! Checked in day before and chose seat (as usual). Stayed night in Orlando to be sure we arrived at airport early. Arrived 2.5 hours before flight and were told at check in counter that the original plane had "mechanical problems " and that the replacement plane was smaller and we no longer had a seat for the scheduled flight. Did not receive any communication prior to coming to the airport about the change. Was told that seats were given on this new plane in order of check-in and arrival to the airport. So that means every seat was taken over 2.5 hrs earlier - really? I doubt it! Had to rebook with another airline for the next day - which means another trip for our family home and back to the airport. After reading the other reviews and our experience we will NEVER book with this airline again - unreliable.

### "Customer Service is non-existent"
Flew Silver Airways as a partner flight with Alaska Airways (Ft Lauderdale to Jacksonville). We boarded and had to deplane the aircraft 3 times before they canceled our flight. They advised that the first two attempts were aborted due to mechanical problems but provided no reason for the issues with the third try. They removed the checked baggage from the plane and dumped them on one of the baggage carousels. As my wife and I were trying to make arrangements to get back home we were notified that the flight was back on. We collected our bags and took them to the the Silver Airways ticket counter and rechecked them. We then went back to the boarding gate finally getting on the plane and departing Ft Lauderdale. This was 11 hours after we were suppose to have originally left. After arriving in Jacksonville we went to retrieve our checked bags and discovered one had not arrived. There was no one at their counter to file a missing baggage claim. I had to go behind the counter and retrieve their local phone list, calling all the numbers until I finally got someone to come to the desk and process my lost baggage report. The next morning I received a call from the Fort Lauderdale Airport lost and found department advising they had my missing bag which they would hold for 30 day. I have tried to reach Silver Airways using the only phone number they provide and have emailed there customer service department and have not been contacted except one time. I was called back by a representative who barely spoke English who I provided all the pertinent information to regarding the missing bag including that the bag was located at the Airport lost and found and the lost and found claim number . I also provided the claim number for their lost luggage report and was advised they had no record of the report being filed. I was put on hold and then they hung up on me. Haven't heard a word since and have had no luck getting through on their toll free number or customer service email. While sitting in the terminal that day not one of their flight got off on time and at least on other flight was canceled. All were due to aircraft problems. If there and any option never use this airline. Customer Service is non-existent.

### "pay a little more for a company that cares about their customers"
Flight was to depart at 9.15am and boarding to start at 8.45. I arrived at the gate at 8.50 to find no one at the counter. The boarding agent came back to the gate at 8.55 and told myself and another passenger we would not be permitted on the plane as the door was already closed. She cancelled my flight and put me down as a no show so that I could not get a refund. I have reached out to their "guest relations" numerous times with no response. This company is by far the worst. Save your money and pay a little more for a company that cares about their customers.

### "they barely gave us any information"
First off plane had no A/C so it was hot. They had to wait 2 hours to board while they tried and failed to fix it. We finally board and after sitting on the tarmac for 45 minutes and they decide to turn the plane around because some lady is hot and wants to get off. Sat back at the gate for another hour until finally taking off 4 hours past our initial take off time all because their planes don’t have air conditioning and they”re unorganized. This whole process the entire plane was left in the dark about what was happening they barely gave us any information.

### "Never fly with this airline"
Never fly with this airline. They "overbooked" our flight from San Juan to Vieques, a small plane that could hold no more than 10 passengers. We were supposed to fly via Silver on our connecting flight from San Juan to Vieques on our honeymoon but they booted us from the flight because of apparent "overbooking". They gave us a "voucher" to stay at a hotel in San Juan over night but the hotel proceeded to charge our credit card anyway. These rats are only out to scam people and steal your money. If you can fly with Cape Air instead (if traveling to Vieques) they are much more reliable and professional.

### "book with another airline"
They do not have a customer service department. Our flight was continuously pushed back and caused missed connections. I tried multiple times to contact customer service and could not reach anyone. The planes were dirty and basic. Please do not waste your money and book with another airline

### "a very disorganized and poorly run airline"
Our trip was booked 18 months ago. Upon arrival to Silver Ticket counter, we received our boarding pass as stand-by with a murky explanation. That was our first indication of something is not right. At the gate we encountered a crowd of passengers. We stood in line for 2 hours and were told that their equipment was downsized from a 70 passenger to a 50 passenger plane. Out of our party of 8 couples 5 couples made the flight. We stood for another 2 hours to be told that they did not have available seating for the next 5 days! Upon reclaiming our 3 pieces of checked luggage, we only had 2 and filed a claim for the lost 3rd suitcase. Silver Airways is a very disorganized and poorly run airline. Save your time, energy and aggravation and do not fly Silver Airways.

### "fly with a real airline"
I never even got a chance to fly Silver. They cancelled my flight, offered no alternate flights after the abrupt cancellation, and refused to answer the phone when I called customer support for a refund of my ticket and overpriced pet fee. After over five hours waiting in the callback queue, they called and immediately disconnected when I answered the phone. I called back right away and was put on hold for another hour. After five dozen loops of the same instrumental rock song, you'll never guess what happened...they dropped the call again. Save yourself the headache and fly with a real airline. Silver is quite the misnomer, as real silver is actually worth something.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
This is by far the worst airline I have experienced in my life. Went on a 15 min flight from Puerto Rico and they managed to misplace luggage for 80% of passengers on board. Our flight has already been delayed 3 hours for absolutely no reason. I filed a claim for my luggage and they gave me a phone number to follow up. I’ve been calling them non stop, no answer, will have to show up at the airport in person. Super annoyed.

### "airline is absolute garbage"
Not Verified |  This airline is absolute garbage. I have traveled my entire life and have flown between the states to St Thomas and have never felt the need to write a review. Each time I have used this airline there have been hours in delays, baggage loss, and no support or compensation. The attendants rudely yelled at passengers that were confused because they were given no direction getting of the plane on this specific trip as well. It once took me 4 days to reach a representative for my lost baggage. There are plenty of Great airlines to use, never use this as your option.

### "They are very disorganized. The most basic airline"
Not Verified |  We flew direct from Key West to Tampa. My fiancé and I checked 2 bags, identical bags, we get to Tampa and only his bag is there. We find some lady that nonchalantly tells us to go to the ticket counter. We tell the guy our bag didn't arrive. He asks for my id and phone number. Gives it back and says nothing else. So I say after a minute or two can we have an update? He says he's waiting to hear back from his supervisor. We go sit down and wait. 45 minutes later he comes back and says they don't know where my bag is and they are waiting to hear from Key West. He said you can leave and I'll call you when he hears back. 5 hours later no one has called. So I scour the internet looking for a number that actually works for the Tampa Silver Counter. Finally get someone to pick up and they still haven't located my bag. 1 hour later someone calls me saying it got left in Key West and will be to Tampa by 8.30. I say so do I just go to the belt? He goes no, come to the ticket counter with your id. So I go back at 8.30, there's a sign saying the ticket counter is closed for the night. I roll my eyes and go down to the belt and thankfully it's there. I emailed "customer relations" and he said my bag didn't make the flight because of weight restrictions, which is fine but why did no one tell me and it took 6 hours to locate my bag. They are very disorganized. The most basic airline. No wifi, no TVs, no drink service, no ramp to the plane, you have to walk outside forever. Just not worth it and the flights were $400 a piece. The company is low budget all around.

### "managed to misplace all of our 4 bags"
We booked through United Airlines and only discovered we were flying Silver Airlines upon arriving at the airport. It was a one hour flight to Key West from Tampa with 48 passengers. They managed to misplace all of our 4 bags and they didn't arrive until the next day. On our return flight they lost one on three bags. There was no one at their ticket counter, no one at baggage claim and no representative to be found anywhere in the airport. There is also no answer on any of their telephone numbers and the website doesn't give you help in contacting them. Don't fly them unless you have carry on only and don't care much about customer service.

### "never use Silver Airways again"
There is a list of items that went wrong when we used Silver for a trip from Ft Lauderdale to North Eleuthera. They delayed our flight by over 4 hours. Customer service was non-existent and it caused us to miss a connecting flight. Checked bags were damaged. The planes are gross. They should clean the planes at least once per day. We paid for front row seats and the attendant made us move to the back of the plane to rebalance. That money was never refunded because there is no customer service. I’ll never use Silver Airways again. Only use them if you absolutely have to.

### "Will never fly again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly again. Flights both directions delayed for hours on end for no reason. It’s clear that in Fort Lauderdale they have one gate so they have to juggle boarding flights, which ultimately makes everything else delayed. Currently on hour 2 of my delay back home with no end in sight.

### "The flight attendants were very sweet and welcoming"
Those leaving bad reviews should have done their research. If you want big comfy seating and all the bells and whistles stick with Delta and pay $$$$! I wanted an amazing affordable experience for my kids and I and Silver Airways delivered. Flying solo with 3 kids ages 1, 6 and 7, I feared the worst. To my surprise it was the exact opposite. The lady at check-in was very friendly and helpful. I was able to change my seats and she even gave all the children toy flamingos. Boarding was very fast and easy. I ended up taking my stroller all the way to loading. The flight was not very loud as we sat in the very back. Seats were big enough to hold an infant comfortably the whole flight. The flight attendants were very sweet and welcoming. The plane was warm at take off and landing, but during flight cool and comfortable. We experienced some turbulence due to weather which had no affect on my children. Once we landed my stroller was waiting on me outside the plane. The fact that I could fly 4 people for $260 and have overall great experience is priceless. I will definitely fly Silver Airways again and I suggest you do too.

### "Save yourself the headache and fly with a reputable company"
I was a little leery about this company because of all of the one star reviews, however, it was the only nonstop flight for a trip I was going to take so I took it. I unexpectedly needed to change my flight for the way there to another airline — and that’s where the problems start. This airlines website is unusable, it takes at least an hour to get anyone on the phone, and no one you speak to knows what they are doing. I was finally able to exchange my flight (other airlines you can do that online!) For the flight home with them, their check in service was horribly slow. There was only one woman manning the counter, and she was talking to her friend on the phone the whole time making the process slower. Every other airlines check in counter was moving fast. When I got on the plane, the airplane was small with no extras like other airlines. I can’t even say you get what you pay for, because I paid the more than the bigger airlines! Everything is worse though. This company has an extensive list of FAQs and terms of service online but they try to sneak ones that contradict those in a link when you book. A super sketchy practice, and then they also don’t even follow those terms. They expired my travel funds when they should not have have expired. This is a sketchy company with terrible customer service. I’m not a crier, but I’ve cried both times I’ve had to call this company from sheer frustration. Save yourself the headache and fly with a reputable company instead.

### "no delays or other issues"
Not Verified |  Despite all the negative reviews, we booked through JetBlue and we had no delays or other issues on both our flights to and from Exuma. The flight staff didn't do much, but offer bottles of water, but we were in the air for 1 hour, no issue for us. Boarding was on time and fast. On return to FLL we were unloaded into a bus and taken to customs and it again was a smooth process and were in customs in 10 to 15 minutes. It's a small aircraft and only in air for short period of time, not sure what people expect for this type of flight.

### "They lack experience, customer service, professionalism"
Not Verified |  First time flying with Silver Airways. Booked the flight because of their association with JetBlue. Biggest mistake! I knew something was wrong when there was only one ticket agent at the counter attending the guests to check in their bags. She took her time and looked a bit stressed. In addition, the departure time and gate information did not match the ticket sent to me. I asked about it and she said it was a mistake. Fast forward, we board the airplane and it was hot! I don't think that the temperature got to tolerable state ever! We land at FLL and my bag was not there. It was left at JAX due to weight limitations. This was never disclosed my the agent in JAX or in their website. I was told to file a claim with their Guest Relations team. They do not have a phone number. It's only an email. They denied the claim! This is an airline that should be non existent. They lack experience, customer service, professionalism, and appetite to excel. It is a joke! People complain about Spirit, this is that airline but on propellers with about a third of their employees and experience. Run! Don't waste your time or money!

### "This is unacceptable!"
Cabin staff was friendly. The gate staff in Pensacola were friendly and informative. However, the staff in Tampa at the gate was horrible and did not keep us up to date. She was coming at the passengers like they were committing a crime over not wearing masks and smoking which I did not see anyone not wearing a mask that wasn't eating nor did I see anyone smoking. She was very aggressive with her little announcement. The ticket booth opened up later than the rest of them in the morning and there was not much seating offered at the Pensacola gate. The cabin is tiny and seats are very uncomfortable even for the small duration of the flight. It was hot and we were offered warm water. The worst part of this was that the flight was delayed due to weather in Tallahassee so they unloaded "8" suitcases so that the plane can fly. Nobody was notified. We were all just standing around waiting and I had to start asking around. Silver did not have an office so we had to go to the ticket booth to ask and submit a claim even though my name was not on the list of 8 ppl given to the staff. This is disheartening as I learned that some of the fellow passengers had important medication in their checked bags. If bags must be removed they should certainly ask about who relies heavily on items in their bags to LIVE! As it is frustrating to not have my luggage my life doesn't depend on it. The removed luggage was placed on a Delta flight that was not arriving until almost midnight. This is unacceptable! I would pay 3x more for a better experience from a flight in the same state.

### "did not even put my baggage on the plane"
TSA did not even put my baggage on the plane and i am two states away. very unprofessional and when i tried to contact it took over two hours just to talk to someone. Literally called baggage 84 times.

### "Never fly Silver Airways"
Not Verified |  First the flight was rescheduled 6 hours from original departure time. Flight was faster than expected. (That's OK) we had to wait on the plane for an hour to disembark. With an additional hour to wait to go through customs. Never fly Silver Airways.

### "not display TSA on your boarding pass"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately, we had to go through another bad experience because you all do not display TSA on your customer boarding pass. Why do you even ask for it? The first one was for my daughter that was traveling alone for her first time back in September of last year, and she had to go through a search, and now today my wife had to go through an extensive search which you can imagine how uncomfortable she was. The last time I called and spoke to one of your employees regarding my daughter, she seemed bothered by my call with no care of the issue, but she did confirm that my daughter's TSA number was in the reservation and that she had NO clue why it doe not print on the boarding pass but that she will report it. (I'm sure she did) Now eight months later, the same thing happens to my wife but worse. This is the same thing my daughter went through. If this is something that you do NOT support, then you should say so, but I'm sure when we contact the FAA or TSA, they would say otherwise.

### "incompetence and lack of professionalism"
Not Verified |  My horrible experience started upon arriving at the check in on Saturday morning at the Nassau, BH airport. We arrived at the check in counter and the representative said there was a terminal change last minute. We then walked all the way to the other terminal with our luggage only to be told that they had no idea what was going on and they weren't sure where we were supposed to go. We then waited 40 minutes to finally get an answer and had to sit there until they were finally able to figure out how to print our boarding passes. We finally get on the airplane and proceed to sit on the tarmac for almost an hour! The pilot came on the speaker and said they were waiting for paperwork. We didn't take off until 2:46pm even though we were scheduled to depart an hour earlier! This was totally preventable and not caused by weather or anything out of their control. As I mentioned, we specifically chose this flight because it was a non-stop direct flight from NAS to FLL. We had an important event to get to in FLL and planned on getting there by 3:05 pm as advertised. We were then told that we had to make a stop at ELH airport to pick up other passengers at a different island! This was also the complete opposite direction of our final destination. We did not pay for a flight with a layover, we paid for a direct flight and the attached boarding pass even shows that. After a very hard landing, we were told we had to then exit the aircraft at ELH airport so they could re-fuel. Once we got off the plane, we were told we had to go inside and get re-checked in since we got off. The man at the ticket counter had no idea what was going on and didn't have an answer for us. After waiting another full hour in the airport which had no running water for us to use the bathroom, we were finally able to get new boarding passes. We didn't depart ELH airport until 5:16pm! We finally landed at FLL airport at 6:28pm and then had to wait in a 2 hour customs line since we arrived at a much busier time of day. The original flight was scheduled to last 1 hour and 10 minutes. It turned into a 4 and a half hour journey simply because of Silver Airway's incompetence and lack of professionalism. We missed the event we flew in for, which ruined our travel plans. I will NEVER step foot in one of their airplanes ever again! This was 100% preventable and not caused by any outside forces. If you choose to cancel another flight, it's your problem to fix it. Diverting a plane that is a non stop to go pick them up was not the answer, especially last minute with no notice! Avoid at all costs! They didn't even respond to my complaint email right after our trip.

### "travel plans are ruined thanks to them"
Not Verified |  I have not actually flown on Silver Airways. My family were scheduled to fly last April which of course was the beginning of the real shut downs on travel. Obviously, things were going on that following up on the ticket was not top of mind. In November, I had enough bandwidth to go back to revisit. At first I was told it had been refunded and was sent a receipt with the date of refund and the CC# that I had paid it on. After some research, I found it had not been refunded. I then emailed guest relations as another avenue since I was not getting anywhere with the initial rep and asked what was going on. I was told via email that the money had actually been put in a travel bank with a user ID to login and check. After multiple attempts at requesting a password, to no avail, I called back to find out what was going on since the date I was hoping to travel was fast approaching. The rep on the phone discovered that the User ID I had been provided was in fact not me. Days pass and I'm given a new User ID and successfully manage to log into the travel bank only to see that there was nothing in it. I ask what the status is once again through email and am told it should be resolved in the next few days. Three days after the date I was told it would be resolved by, there is still nothing in my travel bank and the prices keep going up beyond the value of my former ticket, which, if they had done this correctly in the first place, would have been covered by my balance. Now, it is looking like I have to cancel the trip again because of their incompetence. I don't have my money and I don't have a flight. It's appalling. I'm actually trying to book another ticket with them (lawd knows why) but I can't even do that. And sadly, they are the only player to the destination. So now my travel plans are ruined thanks to them. They also cancelled my sister's flight that she had managed to rebook without another option, so she may also be screwed.

### "I have been given the run around for my delayed bag"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! For three days now after landing, I have been given the run around for my delayed bag. I received only one bag. Customer service is poor. Had me on hold for over an hour. Have stories that my bag wasn’t transferred from other airline. Now I am in a country with no clothes to wear. I will not be flying with them again.

### "customer service is beyond atrocious"
Worst experience of my life. Silver airways delayed our flight four hours and wouldn’t tell us till ten minutes before we would board. We still have a three and half hour drive to the keys Where family is. The tickets were expensive and we have not had anyone talk to us at the desk also. It is not worth the price of the ticket. I  recommend not doing this airline. Your flight will never be on time and the customer service is beyond atrocious.

### "charged us a 200.00 rebooking fee!"
Worse customer service! We had to rebook due to the virus and they charged us a 200.00 rebooking fee! I Called and was told I had to email guest relations which I did! I finally got a returned email stating that they will not return my rebooking fee do to I called them to rebook our flight (because they dragged their feet on cancelling flights back in March) today I received an email stating that the case is closed and I am still waiting for my flight refund Plus the rebooking fee, (I was told it will take up to 90days!) I’ll never fly Silver AirWays this would have been my first flight with them and now it’s my last. I wanted to give them a zero in the rating but it wouldn’t let me.

### "I never made it to the plane"
Poor customer service and anti-consumer policy should lead you to not take this airline or book with them anyway. I never made it to the plane because of Hurricane Isaiah in Ft. Lauderdale, my destination. CSR refused to refund my money so I had to file a claim with credit card.

### "worst customer service experience"
Absolutely the worst customer service experience I've had with an airline. I booked through one of their ticket agencies, which instructed me to contact the carrier (Silver Airways) to make a change to my flight. The rudest customer service rep you can imagine hold me they don't make changes, those have to be done through the agency they contract with. I told her that the agency told me I had to make the change directly with Silver. She said "that's not our problem", we don't work with the agency. I asked her to clarify her comment that Silver "doesn't work with agencies" and she went silent. Then she repeated that "it's not my problem, you have to deal with the agency". She then refused to allow me to speak with her manger and hung up on me.

### "never fly this airline ever again"
My friends and I had booked these flights to fly from San Juan to Saint Thomas on April 24, 2020, and back on April 26 2020. As you can see, all travel is banned around the world, including PR and USVI. Silver Airways refused to offer us refunds saying the flights aren't cancelled and the representative was extremely rude, telling us she doesn't know if and when the flights will be cancelled, and if not we'll be offered a refund for a trip we are not even making. When my friends and I travel to PR and USVI when all this is over, we'll make sure we never fly this airline ever again.

### "use all the possible dirty tricks"
North Eleuthera to Fort Lauderdale. Avoid traveling with Silver Airways at any cost! We booked tickets and a flight was cancelled by the airline putting me into a very tough situation. It is almost 3 days I am trying to call them and refund money, spent almost 4 hours in total listening call waiting music - and there is no result. Moreover they use all the possible dirty tricks to push you to give up - hanging up the phone call in the middle, the operator told me one name at the beginning of the call and then another one when I asked who I am speaking with, etc. I have a complete feeling that I am talking to some fraudsters who only want to grab your money. Apparently Silver Airways just making money during Covid-19 pandemic, it's not just bad service, such behavior should be illegal!

### "The worst airline and customer service ever!"
Not Verified |  San Juan to Saint Croix. This airline is the worst. Had to cancel my flight because of the pandemic and was told I had to pay 50.00 really because I booked my flight in January and not March! My travel partner called to cancel and they refunded her 100% and we booked at the same time, people are not canceling because we want to. This is unfair! The worst airline and customer service ever! Will never use them. Shame on you Silver Air.

### "continue to charge $50 change fee"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Key West. There is a national pandemic that has caused travel restrictions across the world, there has been complete state wide shutdowns and people cannot travel. This airline has to audacity to continue to charge the $50 per person change fee for you to cancel or change your travel plans. Never again Silver Airways, you may have got $100 from me but it will be the last penny you ever get from me.

### "delayed long hours"
Not Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Tampa. Both ways, to and from, delayed long hours. If we were given more warning than after getting to the airport, each way, then we could have spent more time with family. Attendants are rude and look miserable. I will never fly this airline again.

### "Absolutely no problems"
Fort Lauderdale to Georgetown. After reading these bad reviews, we were apprehensive about flying this airline. The night before our flight, could not print boarding pass. Anxiety grew. I called and had to leave a message (it was late Friday night) within minutes got a call back, flight was verified. Next day, went to airport, check in was quick and painless, flight was ten minutes early, staff was courteous and friendly- same on way back! We flew on a newish ATR 46. Absolutely no problems.

### "really unfriendly staff"
Nassau to Bahamas. This airline is a bad joke. More than 5h delay and really unfriendly staff. They still force you to be at the airport in time to check-in your luggage. Just insane. Unfortunately not possible to give no star.

### "This airline is a joke"
Bimini to Tampa via Fort Lauderdale. This airline is a joke. I should have known when I tried booking the ticket, their website didn’t work. Waited on hold for an hour to book because we had to go to Bimini and there are not a lot of options. (would recommend booking a private plane as we learned when we got there). Lots of changes, no notification to passengers and crazy, inept and unfriendly staff. Currently waiting for any kind of update on our flight to Tampa. When I asked for information on our flight they acted like I was at fault for not knowing, stating I couldn’t trust what was posted on the flight departure board. Will not fly them again and wouldn’t recommend anyone else does.

### "Will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Tampa to Key West. Just a really horrible airline. Flight delayed, left the area, came back to find out it reverted and left with no call, text or warning to us. Missed our flight. Incompetent staff unable to assist in anyway after ward. Nothing ever on time. Will never fly them again.

### "charging for all luggage"
Freeport to Fort Lauderdale. Silver Airways books multiple flights a day, but when it comes to flying they make everyone wait for one flight (I’ve been waiting with a baby for over 3 hours and we still didn’t even board). Silver Airways is charging for all luggage even for the stroller (no matter on the size). I had to pay $60 for check in bag and a stroller (my flight we’re supposed to be only 50 minutes). I had to wait for a long time and they do that so they get a full plane. This is unexpected behaviour by the airline. Also, gave me and my just turn 2 yr old different seats. I wonder how that would work. The flights are overpriced for the services and the wait time.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Great Exuma to Ft Lauderdale. Avoid this airline at all costs. Currently sitting in airport in Georgetown Exumas because my scheduled 9:40 am flight has been “combined” with a flight leaving at 2:40. It is a running joke among the local in Georgetown regarding Silver’s almost daily practice of combining partially full flights to save on cost with no notice to the customer. What is ironic is that the only reason we booked on this airline is because we had vouchers due to an even worse experience out of Eleuthera earlier in the year. There won’t be a third time.

### "flight got delayed by 8 hours"
Ft Lauderdale to George Town. Our flight got delayed by 8 hours and we are still waiting to board. The reason for the delay was because they couldn’t get the aircraft ready and I found that just unprofessional. I saw some customers asked about updates of the flight and the staff simply grabbed the microphone and told all passengers to be patience, without replying to the passengers who were asking. We lost a day of travelling in the Bahamas, a long with being late to pick up our car rental. We will never fly with Silver Airways again, totally the worse of the worse out there!

### "Airline is terrible"
Fort Lauderdale to Tallahassee. Airline is terrible second time in the last 3 months that the flight is delayed and they fail to Let us know any information. Leaving from Tallahassee I had to wait 8 hours and now 3 hours. Avoid at all Cost.

### "I was very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Tampa to Pensacola. I was very disappointed with Silver. They were very incompetent and rude! Several of us were encouraged to let the workers put our carry-on bags in the cabin. We did so and were told they would be right outside the aircraft when we arrived. We we arrived the workers were incredibly rude and told us there were no more bags and he didn’t know what to tell us but we needed to head inside. When we went to check on our situation at the baggage counter, the Silver office was closed with the light off, so we headed to the ticket counter. All the other airlines had someone working but there was no one in sight for Silver. We waited for 45 extra minutes before they realized they hadn’t unloaded all the bags and they magically appeared. There were no apologies or anything. I’m happy I wasn’t in a hurry and in the long run, I’m just glad I got my stuff back, but I was appalled at how the workers handled the situation and how rude the guy was. I heard 3 of the other people with the missing bags mention how rude he had been to them too!

### "canceled my flight days before my trip"
Not Verified |  Fort Walton Beach to Orlando. They canceled my flight days before my trip this weekend and gave me no other alternatives. You have tied up my funds all the while other airlines would cost me over $700 this last minute. The customer service took over an hour to get someone on the phone and would not help me with re-booking a flight or changing airlines. They have ruined my trip and now I am choosing to eat the cost of my activities and hotel due to your horrible service. I hope this business goes bankrupt before it steals anymore money and leisure from people. Deserves a negative score

### "Never use them"
Orlando to Key West. Horrible company! It’s funny because the other review right behind mine was the exact same issue! My wife and I had a flight from Orlando to Key West. We arrived at the airport after checking in to our flight the day before. We picked our seats and got a confirmation and when we arrived at the airport apparently either the flight didn’t exist or was canceled .. and we never got a notification or anything. They didn’t have a single person at their flight check in. We waited for about 30min before we gave up and rented a car to drive the 6 hours. We spent over 3hrs on the phone trying to get a refund! And it still is not resolved. Horrible company. Never use them.

### "working on getting a full refund"
Orlando to Key West. After 5 hours of being delayed they canceled the flight with no alternative flight option provided. Knowing we would have to rent a car and drive 6 hours to our destination we asked what type of compensation we may expect. The rebuttal to that was “leave us alone we’ve had a rough night just like you and if you don’t leave us alone will make sure you don’t get on any other flight!”. I’m working on getting a full refund from silver as I type this review

### "This airline is worse than a joke"
Not Verified |  My wife and I were scheduled to fly to Abaco, Bahamas on October 10. With the destruction from Hurricane Dorian that trip was obviously impossible, I contacted Silver Airways 3 times via their website and 2 times by phone within 5 days of disaster to request refund/transfer of tickets to new destination. I did not get any response. Finally sat on phone (hold) for 1.5 hours to get customer service agent. I was told I couldn't get a refund because their flights to Abaco had not been canceled yet! They would not transfer our tickets to another destination for the same reason. I asked when the flights would be canceled (to get refund/transfer) and was told 1 hour before the scheduled flight! Had to purchase new tickets for another destination - could find no other options except for charter for $3860/pp. After purchase of new tickets I asked to talk with a supervisor and the rep hung up saying they were too busy! I just checked Silver's website and they are allowing people to book and pay for Abaco as of 9 am CDT on 10/4 even though there is no airport to fly into! This airline is worse than a joke. They are a scam! I will never use them again. Will be getting on phone (and hold no doubt) to try again to get our original flight purchase.

### "most uncomfortable flight"
Never again! We only flew with this airline because it was the cheapest route, and I promise we will always pay a premium from now on to never fly with Silver again. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. That’s fine things happen, I get it. But we had absolutely no communication from the staff to even say there was a delay. They just kept us waiting. All you have to do it make an announcement that the flight is delayed .. easy. I then called ahead months before to ensure that my husband got a window seat. Which was an additional charge to choose your seats. Upon boarding the aircraft (finally) we noticed they did not allow 5 passengers to board because apparently they had switched aircraft and now the new aircraft didn’t have enough seats for everyone ... are you kidding? So those 5 people just randomly got kicked off? I am not sure. But luckily we got in the flight and found that our seats, which we paid extra for, had been given away to another couple. The desk agent had hand wrote on their boarding pass and crossed out their old seats and gave our seats to them by hand writing in.. wow professional much? So we got moved to a row that didn’t have a window. Of course. The flight takes off and I can assure you it was the noisiest most uncomfortable flight of my life. Thank goodness I had earplug to drown the sound out. The seats were also ripped and run down. Not surprisingly the returning flight with silver was also delayed. Not shocking by now. So after all of this chaos and horrible communication we will never fly with this terrible company again.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Key West to Fort Lauderdale. This was my first time flying Silver Airways and I was pleasantly surprised. The hot pink airplane with the flamingo tail was actually very comfortable and it looked very new. The seats were very comfortable, reclined, and the leg room incredible, they even gave me bottled water for free. This was the best 40 minute flight of my life. Check in at Key West was pleasant and the only flight attendant was actually nicer than I expected. I am not sure what all the negative reviews are about but my experience was very pleasant and I will fly them again if I can or if my company books me another flight.

### "noisy and uncomfortable"
Not Verified | Tampa to Nassau. Never again will I fly Silver Airways. Extremely noisy and uncomfortable. Staff are not friendly or attentive. Our first flight was overbooked. Our flight back was overbooked too! It was changed from 3:15 pm to 12 pm! Then it was changed till the next day. Then it was changed back to 3:15 pm on the same day. Waited at the airport for hours with no proper information or explanation. My friends had a similar experience on Silver Airways. Please don’t fly them. Please use other airlines with a proper service if you don’t want to be stressed like us on these flights. Very disappointing.

### "I would fly them again for sure"
Orlando to Key West. Silver Airways did a great job. After reading reviews I was wondering if I made the right choice. I was very pleased. Our flight to key west was on time and way better than driving from Orlando. The return flight was half empty. Left on time and our stewardess was very polite and let us move to a better seat. Nancy then spent time talking with my wife and I about flying and what a great place Sliver was to work for. It was a little warm but that’s with smaller planes on a runway. There’s only some much they can do about that. The gate people were nice and pleasant. Overall I would fly them again for sure.

### "I will not fly this airline anymore"
Tampa to Pensacola. Worst airline, cancelled all flights because of Dorian then just offered an airline credit for a future flight. Rescheduled flight for the first available and has been delayed so far from 8.20 am departure to a 1.20pm. Don't fly Silver Airways if you need to be somewhere in a timely manner. Going forward I will not fly this airline anymore.

### "thank the 3 Silver Airways employees"
Not Verified |  I just wanted to thank the 3 Silver Airways employees that helped me and my family and 2 additional families on 08/30/19 get a hotel and a flight back home during the pre-hurricane Dorian process. The 3 Silver Airway employees helped us from 5pm to 9pm on 08/30/19.

### "Bad customer service"
Not Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Exuma. This was a horrible flight, never again will we use this airline. You put us on a plane, took us off that plane and then delayed our flight for four hours. Bad customer service!

### "experience turned into a nightmare"
Orlando to Fort Lauderdale. The agent who added check in bag over the phone was superb and very customer centric. However, when I reached the airport to drop bag , my experience turned into a nightmare and it spoilt the entire trip and the memories of my stay at Orlando. The agent was extremely rude. Didn’t want to answer questions and when I was just giving a feedback he got angry and egoistic and told me that he didn’t want to check me in. I had no option but to just stay calm and politely request him to go ahead. My fault - I had handed my credit card for extra luggage and was just trying to understand the airlines policy. He got irritable and asked me why am I asking him. Then I said that other airlines have different policy I wanted to understand silver airways. I had already handed my credit card for payment but wanted to know the reason for extra weight charge more then extra bag charge. He got flared up and told me to fly another airline. I politely told him that I am just trying to understand the policy. He said no I was arguing and I shouldn’t ask him. I said can I speak to supervisor, he said he is the one over there and then he got angry and said he doesn’t want to check me in and gave back my credit card. I told him I have already given the card but for future I was asking but anyway I requested that please check me in. He then took card again, i waited and collected my boarding pass. I am not the type of person who likes to raise voice or let someone’s ego affect me but this incident left a very bad taste.

### "Every leg of trip was cancelled"
We booked online direct through Silver Airlines website (not through a travel agent) and paid in full for 4 round trip tickets from Huntsville Alabama to North Eleuthera, Bahamas leaving June 30 and returning July 9 for a total of $2164.72. Every leg of our trip was cancelled and we never flew on a Silver Airlines flight. When our Huntsville flight was canceled we drove to Orlando to catch the next flight. When it was canceled we drove to Ft. Lauderdale to catch the next flight we were moved to. When that flight was canceled we were told it would be 2 days before we could get put on a Silver Airlines flight to our destination of North Eleuthera where we had rented a house and a boat June 30-July 8. Since we had already lost 2 days of our vacation, we agreed to let Silver Airlines customer service at the Ft. Lauderdale airport put us on a Bahamas Air flight roundtrip to Nassau. We then had to pay out of pocket to get from Nassau to North Eleuthera ($914.98). We also had to pay out of our own pocket for a hotel in Nassau ($338.14) for the night because our flight got there too late to connect to our final destination. We requested a refund at the Fort Lauderdale Airport once we returned from the Bahamas and was told we had to email the customer relations team for a refund. We have not had any response to our request for a refund other than an automated message that our email was received. The email was sent 7/29/19. How can a company continue to operate like this and not take responsibility? We are not going to let this go, I will continue to use all resources I can find to get my refund.

### "staff was friendly and helpful"
Tri-Cities to Tampa. In my experience the staff was friendly and helpful, flight did leave and arrive on time at my destination, it was a morning flight. This is my first experience in a prop plane with only 12 rows of 3 seats, definitely not like flying in a jet that most of us are used to when flying commercial airlines. After saying all this I want to encourage others to write positive reviews for this airline and other businesses, not just negative, even small amounts of positivity goes a long ways, let's add to them.

### "haven't gotten the refunds"
This is the worst airline ever. Had a flight scheduled from Orlando to N. Eleuthera. Flight was delayed multiple times because of not having an available Flight Attendant. After 6 hours the flight was finally cancelled and we were booked on a flight the following day to go from Orlando to Ft. Lauderdale and then to N. Eleuthera. The next morning at 6:00am, the flight to Ft. Lauderdale was delayed to the point of missing the connecting flight. Silver Airways said we could wait until the NEXT day or rent a car out of our own pocket and drive to Ft. Lauderdale. So we rented the car, barely made our flight leaving from Ft. Lauderdale but managed to reach N. Eleuthera a day late. We were told upon leaving Orlando that we would be reimbursed the flight cost from Orlando to Ft. Lauderdale and that it should hit our account within the next few days. Upon trying to leave N. Eleuthera, our flight was again delayed a dozen times and then ended up being cancelled. We were put up in a nice resort but by the time they had cancelled our flights, there were no restaurants open forcing us to eat at the resorts extremely expensive restaurant. We also had to extend our rental car to the next day so that we could reach the airport. We ended up being booked with BahamasAir and JetBlu for the trip back. Both airlines have always been fantastic so no further delays were experienced. Upon reaching Orlando, we again spoke with the ticket counter about getting our refund for the flights from Orlando to Ft. Lauderdale. After some time we were finally told that the refunds should be processing and should hit our account in 7-10 business days. Still haven't gotten the refunds and based on reviews, we consider it unlikely that we will get them or the refunds for all of the expenses the cancellations and delays ended up costing. I will never ever ever in my life fly Silver Airways again.

### "the flight was very enjoyable"
My first time traveling with Silver Airways to George Town, Bahamas and I must say the flight was very enjoyable, the flight attendant was very professional. Our flight was delayed due to a issue with the plane so we had to wait for another one. Once we were able to leave, the captain apologized as soon as everyone was settle on the plane and explain to us why we were delayed. Which is not a problem at all. I would be safe and delayed then having a flight with complications in the air. We were all very thankful, not a problem at all "Great Job Captain"! The sound from the plane actually smooths you and in no time you are asleep. I could not believe I slept all the way there. I look forward to traveling with them again real soon. The flight attendant shared that they have all brand new planes coming out in the next couple of months. I look forward to the new plane experience.

### "absolute worst airline"
Key West to Tampa. Silver Airways is the absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown. I have an expensive carry on bag that I always travel with. I was allowed to bring it on plane on original flight. On the return flight, an extremely rude and unprofessional flight attendant forced me off the plane to give ground crew my bag. Another gentleman entered the plane with the same bag and told me just to put my purse in my duffel carryon bag. I tried but she wouldn’t let me off the plane and wouldn’t offer to ask the ground crew to bring it to me. Then she came back to my seat and threatened to kick me off the plane in an extremely confrontational manner because she said I called the baggage handler a name. That never happened! There was no reason to be upset with him. I had no issue with him. Completely made that up to throw her weight around! All of that and there were empty compartment bins all over the plane. Worse than that is the condition of the planes. Felt and sounded like riding in a tin can. Pieces were broken off inside the plane and bathroom light was broken. Told to use our flashlight on our phones to see in bathroom. Steer clear of this low budget, high priced airline with extremely unprofessional employees abusing their power! There were people who had been waiting over 8 hours for flights in terminal and none of the employees could tell you an accurate status for your flight. My departure time changed 6 times in one hour fluctuating from 1-3 hours late!

### "8 hours unable to leave the gate"
This airline has provided some of the most awful customer service I've experienced in my life so far. They strung us along at a gate all day- changing the story and not providing by updates. We waited over 8 hours unable to leave the gate to even eat since we had no information- then finally the flight was cancelled without any actual explanation (along with almost every other flight that day). I was traveling with 2 small children as well. And we had to then get our bags, except that they were lost. The desk people were rude to everyone throughout the experience. The next Day, the new flight was also 2 hours delayed and once we boarded we sat on the tarmac another hour with badly functioning ac in the Florida summer heat. Terrible! Next time I'll pay more to avoid this awful air line. Flight also cancelled on our return trip & had to overnight. 2 previous vacation days wasted because of silver air. Also no functioning ac on any of these planes unless you're in the air- and you may never get in the air if you're taking silver.

### "Customer Service has a lot to be desired"
Not Verified |  Huntsville to Orlando. Booked our flight well in advance, to have them 11 hours before the flight was to leave to cancel! And of course they sent the text message after hours so you couldn't talk to anyone! I called this morning to talk to a Silver Airlines Representive and was told since I booked thru Expedia to call them and they hung up on me! No explanation, no nothing, just hung up! Called Expedia, they will try and refund my money but can't refund my return flight from Orlando because its still a running flight! What? If I can't get there I can't come back? Never again will I ever fly Silver Airlines! Consumer Beware - Customer Service has a lot to be desired. Pay a little more and fly another airline!

### "they really upset me"
Not Verified |  I don't leave many negative reviews unless I'm really upset. And they really upset me and my family. Delayed leaving Orlando no big deal. Coming back leaving Eleuthera got to the airport building at 12 for 2:15 flight. Sat out in the heat until 5:30 before they cancelled us and 4 other flights back to Florida. We knew it on Flight Tracker before they told us. Yeah they had to put us up half way down the island. Yeah they rebooked me but flew out of different airport 45 minutes away. Had to use taxis dropped $125 doing that. The "vouchers" they give you were only accepted by the airline that rebooked us and the room at the resort. The meal vouchers and taxi vouchers are worthless nobody wants and doesn't accept them. So we spent an extra day that I didn't really have from work getting back. Some people we met at the airport were on there second day of trying to leave and got stranded again.

### "find another carrier"
This airline is a joke - I'm not sure how it stays in business. It is habitually late which is verified by many of the local Bahamians and even the Customs staff in the US. Our flight from Marsh Harbour to Fort Lauderdale was over two hours late and as a result we missed our connecting flight to PVD. Had to spend the night which cost me an additional $500 (traveling with a family of 6) plus a lost day of work. Silver would not agree to provide us with a voucher. Please, trust me when I tell you to find another carrier - you'll be glad you did.

### "lousy and dysfunctional"
Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. While trying to book with United I was sent to this poor excuse for an airline. They literally don't care that they are so lousy and dysfunctional. Their employees must have to go through training to teach them how to stay calm while being cursed out by annoyed passengers. Once you are at the gate you are at their mercy. Our plane was delayed a few times, and giving passengers updates was not their concern. The plane I was on was filthy and I felt like I was flying in an aircraft that was on the verge of losing a propeller or wing. As we took off (finally) I looked over and another passenger was doing the sign of the cross. Do not fly with these people unless you enjoy sittting at an airport gate with no idea if you will ever make it to your destination. Trust these reviews!

### "the flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Pensacola. My flight was supposed to be from Orlando to Pensacola. I arrived at 4:45 PM for my 6:45 PM flight only to tell me the flight was cancelled because no flight attendants showed up. So now I have an 8 hour drive home, on little sleep, because I have an event early in the morning and staying overnight in Orlando isn’t an option. The company was unapologetic and made no attempts to assist, whether by providing a rental car, etc. Absolutely would NOT recommend! !

### "Zero notification that it was cancelled"
Booked a 7.15 am flight to Pensacola. Got up super early, returned rental car, etc. went to check in to find our flight was cancelled. Zero notification that it was cancelled and even the monitor stated on time. Reason: no pilot. I’m a nurse. Could y’all imagine showing up to the hospital and me saying. Sorry. No nurse today. No. We take extra patients, we work extra shifts etc to meet the needs of our customers. The best they could get us was an arrival in Pensacola at 5.25 pm tonight. So here we sit with our luggage that we can’t even check in until 2 hours prior to departure. Happy first day of vacation. Thank you Silver Airways our hard earned vacation day at the airport was great. While in line I heard this is typical of this airline.

### "girls working were fantastic"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Key west. Our fight was delayed because of weather last night 6/9/19 just want to say the girls working to get everyone on the flight were fantastic. So was our pilot what a nice guy thanks for getting us back to Key West safely. If my battery in my car was not dead when I got to it it would have been a perfect night. Thank you

### "Epic failure of an airline"
Fort Lauderdale to Key west. Worst airline ever! Our flight was delayed over an hour from Fort Lauderdale to west palm, but the board kept showing “on time”. No weather conditions, plane was sitting there for hours. No info. The staff didn’t have a clue what they were doing. Once we started to board, they said “oh sorry, wrong flight”. It was a disaster. We literally got on the flight and didn’t know if we would make it to the right destination. The flight attendant actually made a joke that we were going to Cancun. She got it! Coming home we are now delayed an hour so far, I’m sure it will continue throughout the night. Epic failure of an airline. Never again! !

### "forfeited for being a no-show"
Worst travel experience ever and I travel a lot. This was my first and last time using Silver Airways and/or Priceline to book. Due to an accident I was in on the way to the airport, I was too late to check in for my outbound flight. They would not make an exception despite being at the airport in time to still catch the plane. I rented a car and drove 4 hours to Ft Lauderdale. Then when I tried checking in for my return flight, it was cancelled. I was told it was forfeited for being a no-show without notifying them even though I stood at the counter with two of the workers. They told me I had to call Priceline to get the flight reinstated and Priceline told me I had to call Silver. I spent all day on the phone with both and got nowhere. I ended up having to rent another car to drive all the way back to Tampa that evening. They will not give me a flight voucher even for the return flight. I did everything I could that day and nobody would help me. So I spent over $500 total for a flight ($350) and rental cars, and spent 8 hours driving in one day.

### "disappointed in this airline2
Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Pensacola. Very disappointed in this airline. I flew round trip and I did not see them get not one flight out on time. One hour to 2 hours delay. Not being informed until after departure time has passed. The staff at check in also act like they have no clue how to do there job like they are all in training. I had to deal with this experience leaving Pensacola and returning. I will not choose silver airways again.

### "by far the worst experience"
West Palm Beach to Marsh Harbour. This is by far the worst experience traveling in my life. We have been held here for 24 hours with excuses that the plane is broken, the pilots are resting, the flight crew is on its way, we are getting another plane, to we aren’t really sure if we can get you there. The corporate office is literally a group of useless individuals giving people false information. I would start at the top down and fix this before these poor people are out of jobs due to their performance. The only reason this airline is still here is due to supply and demand. Do not use them. Read the other reviews.

### "delayed an hour for no reason"
Key West to Fort Lauderdale. Flight was delayed an hour for no apparent reason, In absolutely clear weather. This was from key west to Fort Lauderdale. Then, traveling from Fort Lauderdale to Tallahassee our second flight of the day, flight was supposed to depart at 5:20. Ended up not departing til 7:26. Reason the pilot gave: “yeah, we got tied up in the Bahamas”. Aka, biggest load of BS ever. Again, the weather was completely clear. Was supposed to Land in Tallahassee at 7:25, ended up being 10pm. Not happy at work today. You get what you pay for. Still, not even cheap considering our flight was $368.

### "don’t know what is going on"
Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. We landed in the FT Lauderdale Airport on JetBlue to catch a connecting flight. We are flying from FT Lauderdale to Orlando. Flight was supposed to leave at 6:55pm and it is now 8:23pm and we have not taken off and have no updates. The board is still reading On Time 6:55pm. I understand there is bad weather but when you can’t update people of what is going on then there is a problem. All attendees don’t know what is going on.

### "waiting on a flight attendant"
Not Verified |  This was by far the worst airline we have ever flown. Flight was delayed 6 hrs due to “weather”, meanwhile every other airline came and went seamlessly. Many asked when the flight will depart and the answer was never clear. They would come on the announcement and announce boarding in 15-20 minutes. Then 40 minutes later say due to weather it will be pushed to 8:00 - ultimately finding out the reason it was pushed back was not due to weather but because they were waiting on a flight attendant. The airline has learned if they say due to “weather” they do not have to provide amenities or ticket refunds to the guests.

### "the worst airline ever"
Tallahassee to Tampa. Easily the worst airline ever. Both flights delayed over 4 hours. In beautiful weather, they are already delaying flights 6 hours in advance. This tells me they are running by the seat of their pants and don’t have enough planes that are working. None of the workers know what’s going on and even when they do, they forget to tell you updates. Oops forgot to add another hour to your delay”. Don’t fall for the Cheap fares... it comes at a huge cost and you will be held hostage. Good luck with customer service. Next time I will drive instead of flying with this circus show.

### "was the worst experience"
Tallahassee to Tampa. This was the worst experience that I have ever had with an airline. The flight you Tallahassee was delayed 30 minutes without any notification. The return to Tampa was scheduled to depart at 6:05PM the same day. The flight was delayed 4 times with a total of 5 hours delayed. We did not receive any alerts to inform of delayed. They gave. I reason for any delays and when I went to ticket agent they insisted that I contact reservations. After being on hold for quite a while I was told they could not offer any explanation or compensation and I needed to speak with ticket agent. I would not fly Silver Airlines ever again. I have spent 10 hours at this airport and could have driven home in 4 1/2 hours!

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Tallahassee to Boca Raton. Worst airline experience ever! No notifications at all about anything. Severely late flight departures and return was cancelled. Terrible customer service. Still trying to get a refund for my cancelled flight. The only positive thing I can say is the pilot landed us smoothly and safely. Which of course is most important.

### "Thanks for nothing"
Not Verified |  Daytona Beach to Bahamas via Ft Lauderdale. I can understand having delays when there is bad weather, this airline cannot seem to show up on time, ever. The staff seemed nice enough but, they don't have any issues with just leaving you sitting in the airport for hours upon hours upon hours. We were delayed 5 hours on our flight to our vacation destination and then coming back, we were delayed again another 2 hours. If that's not bad enough, my luggage ended up in Pensacola FL instead of Daytona. I was told that it would be returned to me the next day. Someone would call and they would deliver it to my home. That never happened. No customer service number to call. The one number I was given to call and get an update on my luggage, no one answers. The other number I finally found just keeps you on hold until you can't stand the music any longer. I give them a zero, big fat zero. You can't get a hold of anyone. They have a website with a form that has questions you can't answer in order to submit your complaint. It wouldn't matter anyone, it says plain as day they can take up to 60 days to reply. Thanks for nothing Silver Airways. I will never fly with you again. The worst customer service I have ever had.

### "worst airline ever"
Literally the worst airline ever. Said there was a delay in our flight to key west when we arrived at the airport. Thinking we had a four hour window, we left the airport to grab breakfast and were back in an hour and a half. Meanwhile with zero communication the flight reverted and left with all our luggage and only other flights out all booked. This was a birthday weekend 4 months in the planing. and I had to spend $300 to purchase a ticket on another airline and leave 6 hours later. Tampa Friend couldn’t afford to buy another ticket and went home. Now at key west airport for return flight. Flight delayed two hours. Sitting in an airport again for hours because we don’t dare leave.

### "airline is horrible"
Not Verified | Pensacola to Tampa. This airline is horrible. Booked a flight to take kids in a cruise and there wasn’t a flight crew ? Really. A 0920 flight leaves after 2 pm and because there is no flight crew. Guy at gate said it "happens all the time". It happens all the time? How is that possible? To have a flight crew to fly a plane that you’ve booked months in advance. And they text you 2 hours before you are supposed to leave. I will never ever fly this low rate airline again. They ruined my family vacation and all they said was you can have a $200 coupon! No accountability for people and they could care less. If they didn’t have a flight crew they should have announced it the night before I could have driven. Do not use Silver Airways. Ever. Not if you wan to get where your going the day and time you planned

### "So unprofessional"
Fort Lauderdale to Key west. This was my first and obviously the last time I’ve been flying by Silver Airways. 4h delays for the flight of an hour and there was no reason for it. Weather was perfect! So unprofessional, I didn’t show up for work and lost my money and my time sitting at the airport. So poor!

### "never fly this airline again"
Tampa to Tallahassee. I travel a few times a year to Tallahassee on business. Not once have I ever made a trip up and back without a delay on at least 1 leg of the trip. If they rate airlines for on time flights these guys would be at the bottom of the barrel. Today was the last straw. I’ll never fly this airline again! My 4:30 flight was delayed to 5:11, 7:45,8:00 and then 8:22. It took over two hours for a notification on my phone app to even show up. The gate agent could care less, had zero empathy and was useless as far as getting any information out of. Steer clear of this airline. I will rent a car and drive this trip next time. It will be cheaper and I will get there faster.

### "choose a different airline"
Not Verified |  Freeport to Fort Lauderdale. Flight was originally scheduled to leave 5:35 pm, arrival at Freeport airport 3:30. It was delayed due to “scheduled maintenance.” Delayed again 7:30. Questions asked, “ maintenance.” During this time the Freeport airport closes at 6. There’s no food, drink, store, nothing opened. Finally 8:35 flight cancelled & rebooking begins for the nxt day. Pilot had flown his allotted air time & couldn’t make the 30 min flight back to Ft Lauderdale. Silver Airline couldn’t calculate that before making us sit in an airport & wait for 6 hrs to do nothing? Spend the extra money to choose a different airline. They aren’t cheaper, they charge $39 per checked bag.

### "we’re still waiting"
Fort Lauderdale to Bimini. Still waiting to board this flight which was supposed to leave at 1PM. The whole time the board said that it’s On Time. 1 PM came and went with no announcements. Finally at 1:50, I get a text message saying the new departure time is 2:30. It’s 2:38, and we’re still waiting. I get that you cannot always foresee delays. However, you should keep your passengers informed and make announcements. Customer service is severely lacking. It also seems to me they are over scheduling out of one gate. Doh! Just got a message that the flight is delayed to 2:55. No announcements at the gate though. Surely you guys can at least make an announcement when your scheduled departure time is up.

### "An atrocity, never again"
Fort Lauderdale to Pensacola. They are operating many flights out of 1 terminal. They were running very behind today. After we waited over 2 hours to board, they announced that the plane was overweight and asked 3 people to get off. No one volunteered, so since we were last to check in, we were the chosen ones. We have 2 children who are 6 and 8 years old. No flights available for next 2 days. They wanted me to take a van for a 9-10 hour drive which we declined since the reason we flew is because we didn’t want to drive in the first place. Took over 2 hours to get another flight after much haggling. An atrocity, never again.

### "extremely rude to me"
Not Verified |  I arrived 15 minutes late for my flight at12:15 pm because of insane traffic and rental car issues. Just as an airline can not be held responsible for mechanic issues and flight becomes delayed. Someone who is 15 minutes late should not be penalized to not be able to board the plane. The check in agent was rude and told me the door had closed and nothing could be done. And then the plane was delayed for almost 2 hours at the gate. I lost over $400.00 and I’m on disability. So it took a while to save up that money for my son and I to take a flight. Then when I called customer service they were extremely rude to me and said because I booked with Expedia they said to call them. Expedia called Silver Airways and was told by Emma they would figure out a way to make it right. When I called Emma the woman who answered refused to let me speak to her or a supervisor. I paid $700.00 to fly from Orlando to Freeport then over to Fort Lauderdale. Because I couldn’t just cancel my other travel plans in Fort Lauderdale the 26-28th. I will always fly with Bahamasair and never Silver Airways again. Their customer service is the worst I have ever had to deal with. Do customers ask for a refund when they are delayed ever though mechanical flat tire issues are not their fault.

### "4 hour delay today"
Tallahassee to Fort Lauderdale. Horrendous company. Do not make mistake of flying with them. Today 4 delays, no notice. Lady on my flight waited all day yesterday into the night and her flight never left, so she is back today. 4 hour delay today means I lose 10,000 dollar cruise because they did not fly. Was told delays due to flight crew rest. Delays are, in fact, due to the fact that they have empty planes so they are punishing us with intentional delays. United should sever all ties with Silver. We will never fly with Silver Airways again, no matter what.

### "managed to lose my luggage"
Not Verified |  We took Silver Airlines from Key West to Orlando. It was not a large aircraft so it should not have been a challenge getting all the baggage into the aircraft. Yet, they still managed to lose my luggage. There could not have been more than 25 or 30 bags and my bag was appropriately tagged. It boggles the mind how workers can be so irresponsible. Is it laziness? Is it stupidly? Moving an appropriately labeled bag from a baggage cart into the belly of an aircraft has got to be one of the World’s least mentally challenging jobs. When will airlines like this began hiring people who CARE about passengers personal belongings. I am convinced this airline holds no one accountable otherwise their workers would concentrate on what they are doing. Disgraceful!

### "extremely poor experience"
Orlando to Huntsville. We had an extremely poor experience with Silver Airways. After being delayed on our flight to Huntsville for more than two hours, we were told that we would receive a weather update tonight at 7:45. We left at 7 to walk around and we came back to our gate at 7:40 and the plane had already boarded and left. When we asked the gentlemen managing the gate, he placed blame on us, and refused to make it right, as did his manager. After speaking with the desk, the manager gave direction to not take care of us. They both seemed completely oblivious to our plight. I am a manager at a supermarket that has customer service as their foundation and am completely disgusted with the lack of help I was provided with tonight. I am now paying out of my own pocket for a hotel because Silver has placed the blame on me despite boarding before the time we were told. I am also having to use an additional day of vacation because of the inefficiency of silver.

### "Bad customer service"
Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. We arrived early on time and we were told that we are in a waiting list because the weight ratio. I think this is ridiculous that now we can’t fly. Did you guys oversell the flight to Orlando? We requested for a manager and never arrived. Also, in the ticket there is no print indicating the information about the weight ratio. First time I here that. Bad customer service.

### "Customer service was horrible"
Orlando to Huntsville. Customer service was horrible. The  women working at the Silver Airways at Orlando international airport at 4:00 on 11/21/18 were extremely rude. Never flying with this airline ever again, I'll stick with Southwest where the employees are willing to serve as much as possible.

### "should have flown with Southwest"
Arrived early to TPA thanks to SuperShuttle, had three and one half hours to kill, checked a bag with some tools and clothing that would not make as a carry on. Direct flight to Nassau, well my bag did not make it. Filed a claim, walked around with an attendant looking at other peoples bags, confirming mine was not there. Was told it might come in the next day and to contact the airport attendant and they would send it to the hotel. I contact "Guest Relations" via email as you cannot talk to anyone except to make a reservations. They reply with a generic form, telling me that they will get back to me eventually as they get a bunch of emails. Still almost one day later, no reply. Called the NAS attendant, he tells me that he has no idea if the bag will come in today and to call him after 2:00 pm to see if I will get my luggage. Can't plan anything, can't speak to anyone at Silver to get any confidence that it will show up at all, have a job to do this weekend and my tools are in the luggage. I should have flown with Southwest, at least there you can talk with a human being and feel that "Guest Relations" actually gives a rats butt. And in retrospect, would have been cheaper.

### "flight always being late"
Not Verified |  Eleuthera to Orlando. I don’t usually write negative reviews but I’m so tired of Silver Airways flight always being late. It’s impossible to make any plans when your flying with them. I’m flying often from Bahamas to the states and 75% of the time Silver flight is late. I’m looking for other flying options cause this is ridiculous. I would not recommend them to anyone.

### "We had a great experience"
Not Verified |  Tallahassee to Fort Lauderdale. I must say I was quite concerned with booking with Silver Airways after reading the reviews. We had a great experience. Walked up to check-in had boarding pass in minutes and efficiently provided tags for our carry-on bags. Gate agent and baggage handlers were efficient as well. Stewardess was friendly and provided water. Every person we encountered was polite and courteous. Granted the weather was good and we did not encounter delays. Weather impacts all airlines and the key here is understanding that you are getting on a small plane and the process is different. Would fly Silver Airways again in a heartbeat.

### "offered no assistance"
Not Verified |  After a week in Bimini, Bahamas with friends in family, we were scheduled to fly to Fort Lauderdale on Silver Airways. We had hotel rooms booked in Fort Lauderdale for that night and flights booked on a different airline to return home the next day. While waiting at the Bimini airport for our flight, we were continuously told our flight was delayed by 15 minutes. This went on on for a few hours until they finally told us the flight was cancelled. At this point we had no other way off the island as it was too late to make other arrangements. This was the beginning of a very stressful and expensive travel nightmare. 1. We had to pay for an extra night to stay in Bimini 2. Lost the money for the hotels we had booked in Ft. Lauderdale 3. Had to pay to for a boat ride back to Florida, a 2 hour cab ride to Fort Lauderdale, 7 new plane tickets to Canada as we had missed our next flights (difficult to find and expensive as this was the last day of Spring Break). In addition, we returned home a day late missing school and work. For all our stress and the thousands of additional dollars spent? Silver Airways took no responsibility, offered no assistance, support or compensation. Dealing with customer service was so horrible I eventually gave up.

### "had to cancel my entire trip"
Tampa to Marsh Harbour via Ft Lauderdale. All 4 of my legs were changed! A long awaited vacation to the Bahamas and a much needed relaxation had to be canceled on my end because Silver kept changing each of the legs and it went from flying out one day, to then a day later, and I would miss the connection. Also the return was changed and I would’ve missed the connector. So I had to cancel my entire trip due to all these changes.

### "shivering the whole way"
and what a joke. They cost over 1000 with fees and luggage. Then you find out you are flying on a Saab turbo prop plane that is so small you must “load balance” seats before takeoff. The flight out to Pensacola was so cold we were shivering the whole way, asked for a blanket, no. They only serve you 1 bottle of water, no other choices drinks or snacks, keeping in mid this is a 2-hour flight. Now that we froze on the way up we packed our jackets for the trip back. That was a wrong choice, the a/c was broken on the flight back to Orlando and everyone was waving their safety flyers to try to keep cool. The flight attendant made a point that she was there mainly for our safety and then the safety announcement came on stating all large electronics like laptops needed to be stowed for takeoff and landing. Ironically the passenger next to us was on his laptop from the time he boarded the plane until after we landed. The flight attendant walked by him 10 times and did not make him put it away for takeoff or landing, so much for safety comes first. This was on flight 55 on June 3rd arriving in Orlando from Pensacola at 10:15pm. Will never use this airline again.

### "chaotic and unprofessional"
❌ Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Tallahassee. We were supposed to board at 6:50am for a 7:20am flight. However the flight crew didn’t show up until 7:24. At 7:45am they began boarding. The entire flight walked out onto the tarmac where there was utter confusion. Finally they made us go back up to check in because apparently they were not communicating with the ground crew and the plane was not ready. It was chaotic and unprofessional. I’d expect this in a small third world country but not here in the US. Absolutely unacceptable!

### "worst flight I’ve been on"
West Palm Beach to Nassau. Absolutely terrible customers service in West Palm Beach. The women workers were very rude and rushed everyone on board after being delayed for an hour! The worst flight I’ve been on.

### "she refused to check me in"
Ft.lauderdale to Tampa. Worst customer service ever. Not only did the lady at the desk not want to let me in with still 1.5 hour before the flight took off because she “assumed” I would not make it to the gate spent over 3 hours on the phone trying to speak to someone. Wasted over 45 arguing with the lady at the check in counter debating whether i would make the flight or not. I was coming from international and was supposed to take this flight to get me to my destination which never happened they never gave me my money back or try to find me a different flights the day before Thanksgiving it was the worst experience I’ve ever had. Pay the extra bucks and go to a different airline like southwest. It’s funny to me I’m a frequent flyer and I have seen so many times different airlines call the gate and let them know that one of their passengers are on the way stuff happens you know so many times I seen this happen this woman and man refused to call the gate and let them know the situation. I still had 1.5 hours to make the flight but she refused to check me in.

### "nothing could have been better"
Tampa to Key West. Fun group, easy flight and friendly staff. We got here in an hour, no issues. We were really terrified with the bad reviews, but probably very few satisfied people take the time to write a review. But seriously nothing could have been better!

### "infuriate you with negligence"
Tampa to Tallahassee. Silver Airways is thee worst airline I've traveled on! Leaving, they got me to Tampa late and I missed my connection to Nassau, had to stay overnight and arrive a day late, but wait it gets worse. Now returning 8:50am flight from Tampa to Tallahassee, flight delayed until 10:30a, aircraft needs for maintenance. Then that time comes and delayed yet again, now it's 11:27am! Another aircraft altogether has to now get us home. Pathetic and ridiculous airline to say the least! Whatever you do, never fly with them, they will ruin your scheduled plans and infuriate you with negligence!

### "delayed by 2 hours"
Orlando to Key West. The flight was on time on the website and on the gate throughout till the boarding time and then it was displayed delayed by 2 hours. We had to reach airport 3 hours early because it was a holiday season. We spent the entire day in getting ready, traveling, spending time at the airport. The attendants didn’t even know if the flight is departed from the origin.

### "no customer service"
Orlando to Ft Lauderdale. I would give this airline a negative rating if I could. They are terrible. Will check next time before I let United book me on this connection. Our plane didn’t show up and then when they found us a plane they could not find a crew - really? And they are so unapologetic so I assume this occurs on a regular basis. They have no customer service.

### "Why would anyone use this airline?"
Our checked in bags were not put on the plane despite having checked in 2 hrs 30 mins before departure. No other passenger bags arrived in Orlando so no bags were loaded in Key West. Arrived in Orlando with no bags and had an international connection. Arrived back in Ireland with no bags. Still waiting for it to be sorted. On the same flight 3 people asked to give up seats. But on the flight 2 of those seats were taken up by Silver Airways employees and an empty seat. Disgraceful behaviour to have paid passengers left in Key West when a seat available and employees taking up 2 others. Changed our flight the previous day over the phone directly with Silver Airways. Showed up for 10.20am flight and told we were not booked on it and would still have to wait for later flight at 4.20pm. Wasted a full day, no excuse or apology given. Also witnessed many other passengers having problems on check in. Witnessed another passenger who was there at least 1hr 30 min before her flight being told to wait to the side while a supervisor was called to speak to her as she had not checked in on time! Key West airport is small and you can walk from check in to get security done in a total of 20 mins. Supervisor did not show up and passenger missed her flight and was visibly upset. Staff unhelpful and did not seem to know what they were doing. Have flown many airlines over the years and this airline is the worst by a long way. Staff unhelpful, no skills for customer service. Finally of the 4 flights from Silver Airways that day 3 were delayed by at least 2 hours. Why would anyone use this airline?

### "never fly them again"
Orlando to Key West was cancelled after waiting 3 hours. Ruined our vacation. We decided to drive all night to get to Key west. We go to fly back and three flights are delayed or cancelled. After reading additional reviews this is clearly an ongoing theme. Will never fly them again.

### "uncomfortable seating and general unpleasantness"
My family and I flew Tampa to Exuma via Fort Lauderdale on vacation and from the start, I knew this would be our last time flying on Silver Airways. From rude employees to being forced to weigh our nonoverweight bags three times, to having flight attendants continuously proclaim their disbelief that I was 20 and not 12, the flight from Tampa to Fort Lauderdale was not off to a great start. From there, we had a six hour flight delay into Exuma due to maintenance problems, none of which was updated on the airport computers. Flying back from Exuma, we reached another 4 hour delay, missed our connecting flight and were stuck in Fort Lauderdale for the night. The hotel had none of the airline's information on file. In the Fort Lauderdale airport at 5:30 am, we were told that no reservation had been made for us to proceed to Tampa and were told to drive to West Palm Beach Airport for a 7 am flight. This isn't to mention the uncomfortable seating, warm water, and general unpleasantness of the airplane.

### "Silver Airways is horrible"
Silver Airways is horrible! Our flight to Key West from Orlando was delayed almost 4 hours. The plane was extremely hot and unpleasant! On our way back to Orlando, the airline was threatening my wife and I that we would not be able to board due to our check in time which was 1.5 hours before departure. They stated, it was due to weight restrictions. No employee from the airlines advised us this. The plane was hot once again, and now we are in Tampa waiting on another pilot. Horrible service!

### "has been a complete disaster"
Tallahassee to Fort Lauderdale. Thank you Silver Airways for ruining our honeymoon. Got to our destination and our luggage was lost. They assured us it would be on the next flight & they would deliver it to us within two hours. That of course didn't happen. We called and left several messages not getting a call back for several hours. It seemed like they were purposely ignoring our calls. They finally called us back 7 hours later to let us know that our bags were in Tampa and then had the nerve to ask us if we wanted to go pick it up! We have been stuck not able to do anything for the first whole day of our honeymoon & had to cancel all reservations we made. Not to mention how extremely uncomfortable the entire flight was. I don't think I've ever been so uncomfortable on a plane before. This has been a complete disaster. First & last time we will ever fly Silver Airways.

### "rebooking was not for next available flight"
How to ruin your first day of vacation: Book flight with Silver Airways 8 months in advance to secure seat. Receive email indicating that flight is cancelled but with a rebooking on a later flight. Leave home at 6am to connect into FLL for flight. Discover at airport that the Silver Airways rebooking was not for next available flight. Further discover that there is a flight at nearly the original time that you are not on, and that has empty seats. Call airline, which asks for full fare or expensive change fee to leave at original time. Get blamed by airline for accepting the rebooking when what I really did was trust you to put me on the next available flight. Sit at Gate C8 watching plane leave at originally scheduled flight time with empty seats to destination. I'll never fly Silver Airways again.

### "crew were pleasant, friendly, helpful"
Tampa to West Palm. After reading other reviews for Silver Airways, I was apprehensive. I had to wait for a wheel chair because the one the had was broken. I found the ground staff to be very efficient on getting me through security and aboard my flight in a friendly, timely manor. I have mobility issues which they patiently assisted me up (and down) a small set of steps. The aircraft was clean and for a small aircraft surprisingly comfortable. The air crew were pleasant, friendly and very helpful. I felt like I was in good hands. Would I fly with them again? A resounding yes.

### "avoid at all costs"
Ft Myers to Key West with Silver Airways. Sitting and waiting due to mechanical problems. Same thing happened a year ago and ended up driving to Key West. I will never take this flight again. They provide no information on what is happening, when or if we will ever leave. Avoid at all costs.

### "everything messed up again"
Key West to Orlando with Silver Airways. My flight here was cancelled due to not enough passengers on board. So they decided to stick ten other passengers and I in a cab from Fort Myers and drive us to Key West, a 6 hour cab ride. Now I'm trying to leave Key West and everything is all messed up again. If this flight leaves going to be a miracle, I'm never going to make my connecting flight. Joke of an airline

### "just isn't worth the hassle"
Don't fly Silver Airways, if you can help it. They are the United affiliate that takes their passengers to Key West. Silver had mechanical issues, delayed our flight home, through Fort Myers, and ultimately cancelled our flight - thus making it impossible to make our connection from Ft. M to Denver. Instead, they rerouted us to Orlando, only rebooking one of our seats from there to Denver. I had to scramble for a standby seat on a flight that departed 4 hours before my wife's flight. They also managed to book her in First class for the Orlando to Denver leg (we'd paid for 1st Class to begin with), but I got placed in economy on my flight. They refuse to reimburse us for the difference in the ticket value, actually they refused to communicate with us about this at all. Their customer service phone number is "No longer in service. Since they are the only way to fly United to Key West, I'd recommend flying Delta. It just isn't worth the hassle dealing with Silver.

### "worst customer service"
Avoid Silver Airways - I only fly it because it has non stop flights on the Pensacola to Orlando route and no one else does. Almost every time the flight is delayed by hours. Last night it was cancelled. I understand things happen but all the time? The worst thing is the customer service. Flights are normally ok. You always must walk outside the airport to get on the plane. When it rains you get soaked unless you have your own umbrella. The customer service reps don't like confrontation and often hide and make us wonder what is going on. 4 hours to a cancel flight and no offer of dinner voucher or even a bottle of water.

### "Flight was comfortable"
A short flight from Orlando to Key west with Silver Airways. Staff kept us updated before departure. The cabin crew on both outward and return flight was attentive and very pleasant. Flight was comfortable and recommended.
