### "no checked baggage allowance included"
When booking my ticket it was unclear there is no checked baggage allowance included. When we got to KUL and discovered this, we went to the counter for assistance and to purchase the baggage fee. I was shocked to be told they charge 48MYR per kilogram. On my 19kg bag this was going to cost 912MYR. That's over $215 USD — my original ticket only cost 139MYR ($33USD). The person at the desk was extremely unhelpful and was unapologetic about the fee. I ended up booking another seat on the exact same flight (this time paying extra to get the checked baggage allowance), for a total price of 216MYR ($52USD). There is no justification for ripping customers off like this when I can purchase a whole new ticket with the baggage for less than 1/4 of just the fee they wanted to charge me. I know they are the only airline available on some routes, but if you can avoid them at all, do.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service from Batik Air. We flew from Lombok International. They didn't open check in until 75 minutes before the flight. We were flying to Surabaya and then on to KL. I was given one boarding pass. I asked if we needed another for our second flight and was told that, no, I didn't - I could use the same one, which seemed odd. I was told my bags would be checked through to KL. When we went to board, I asked again about the boarding pass and the person told me something different - that we needed to go to a transfer desk and get a new ticket in Surabaya. I asked about our bags again. He said they go all the way through. We landed in Surabaya. We were told we needed to retrieve our bags. I said we were told they were checked through. . I waited in line at the transfer desk to get a new ticket and we were told that we have to take a 25 minute and $10 taxi ride to get to the other terminal, then to go to a transit desk there to get our new tickets. Then to wait in line to drop off bags again. The woman at the transfer desk blamed the Lombok employees. Once we got to the new terminal, we were able to drop bags and get a new ticket at the same time (different than what I was told). The womam there laughed when I told her we were informed we could use the same boarding pass and that our luggage went straight through. Beware of Batik Air. The employees clearly don't know what they are talking about. Not one person mentioned we needed to change terminals or check back in, which seems like important information to provide people. And the luggage misinformation, too, is ridiculous. I'm glad we triple checked so we got our luggage before we took the 25 minute taxi ride. Also, this was the first time I've booked two flights on the same airline that didn't mention *self transfer* when booking, which is common if you book two different airlines, but not when it's the same airline. And honestly, it's just plain dumb. First and last time flying them. I'll take AirAsia any day.

### "The worst airline"
The worst airline, do not fly with this airline. I flew on 14th April from Kuala Lumpur to Perth and we were delayed. The aircraft had an electrical fault. Then I arrived to airport on 27th April to return. The attendants at desk were the rudest and unprofessional I ever met.

### "no explanation from pilot"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to fly from Jakarta to Penang but upon landing at Penang, our plane circled 3 times then enroute to Langkawi, pilot just announced that the plane will divert to Langkawi and after we landed in Langkawi, no explanation from pilot. I asked the stewardess but she only say due to bad weather in Penang, but the stewardess didn’t announce to all passengers. After a while pilot just announced that they will prepare the flight to depart in another 45 mins and still they let all the passengers without any aircon and feeling hot.

### "flights were delayed"
Flew 4 flights with Batik Air in last few days around Indonesia and only the Labuan Bajo to Denpesar departed on schedule. All the other flights were delayed. The issue always appears to be that Batik Air cannot get the aircraft’s first flight of the day off the ground on time and then the delays just compound. We shouldn’t have even been on them having booked with Garuda who then changed its schedule at late notice.

### “worth paying more for better service”
Batik Air's airport staff closed the check-in counter earlier than scheduled. When they reopened it, it was already too late to check in. The staff was unhelpful and falsely claimed to have called our names, even though we were present and heard nothing. We had to purchase another ticket to Jakarta because of this. Also, when we were heading to Bangkok, our flight was delayed by almost an hour with no notification or compensation provided. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this airline. It's worth paying more for better service.

### "frustrating and disappointing"
Terrible experience with Batik Air – never again. I was charged for a ticket, but when I arrived at the airport, they couldn’t find my booking in the system. I had no choice but to purchase another ticket just to make it on time. The airport staff were completely unhelpful and told me to email customer service instead. I did – and waited over a month for a response, only to be told to call the service centre. When I called, they told me to email again. Seriously? I’ve been pushed back and forth with no proper support or accountability. The call centre staff were rude and offered zero assistance. This whole experience has been frustrating and disappointing. Never flying Batik Air again. Malaysia Airlines is way more reliable and professional.

### “it was delayed again”
Terbang ke Manado kena delay, pulang dari Manado kena delay lagi dari jam 13.00 jadi jam 17.00. Tiba-tiba jam 16.30 dikabari lagi delat sampe jam 19.20 - Flying to Manado was delayed, returning from Manado was delayed again from 13.00 to 17.00. Suddenly at 16.30 it was announced that it was delayed again until 19.20.

### "flights are frequently delayed"
Not Verified |  The flights are frequently delayed but it’s a small price to pay for clean aircraft, ample seat pitch, kind crew and the lowest fares. My flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur was on an A330 with plenty of legroom and good meals. Online check-in yields a good seat for me and their use of KLIA T1 makes for an easy and relaxing journey,

### "the worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  I recently had an awful experience flying with Batik Air, and I can't stress enough how disappointed I am. My original flight was already rescheduled once, which I could accept as it was only a 1-hour difference. However, just one hour before the new departure time, they rescheduled it again – this time by a massive 3 hours! This was completely unacceptable. I chose this specific flight time to align with my plans at the destination, and now my entire schedule is messed up. It feels like the airline couldn’t care less about their passengers’ plans. To top it off, there was no real assistance or communication to explain what was going on or offer alternatives. First time flying with Batik Air, and it will definitely be my last. By far the worst airline experience I've ever had. I am beyond frustrated.

### "experience has left a sour taste"
Not Verified | I recently flew with Batik Air and had a very disappointing experience. I initially booked my flight assuming I could easily manage my baggage, but I was charged per kilo for my luggage on the first leg of my journey. When I tried to add a bag for my upcoming flight, the system failed to recognize my return booking The lack of transparency and efficiency is frustrating and unacceptable for an airline that markets itself as customer-friendly. I urge others to be cautious when booking with Batik Air, as their baggage policies seem designed to catch you off guard and extract additional fees. This experience has left a sour taste, and I will think twice before considering this airline again.

### "ordered gluten free meal"
We specifically ordered gluten free meal 2 months ago when we booked the ticket in business class as husband is a diagnosed coeliac. Then we called to confirm twice that the meal would be available and told yes it will be on the flight. Then we received an email telling us the meal will be available. So, we get on the flight and told no its not available. My husband could not eat anything that was available on the plane. Considering the price we paid, we deserved to get the flight we were promised and were not. As well as the seat not reclining, lumbar support just sticking out or footrest working, no power on outlet, no entertainment and no food. On an almost 6 hour flight all they gave us was a Sprite. And we took off 30mins late, no reason why.

### "weight checked for my hand luggage"
I've never got weight checked for my hand luggage and they checking it on a flight to Bali, I don't know why they choose only this direction but anyway I don't recommend this airline. During the flight only one toilet was working. I paid 450 MYR which is worth 100$ for overweight.

### “level of unprofessionalism is shocking”
Not Verified | I recently had a highly frustrating experience with Batik Air, and I feel compelled to share my story to warn others about their customer service and policies. I booked a flight from Malaysia to Australia and immediately noticed an issue with my wife’s ticket. Her surname was listed as my surname instead of her maiden name, which is what appears on her passport. While I selected “Mrs” as her title during booking, I suspect Batik Air’s system mistakenly changed her surname. I’ve booked other tickets recently with different airlines and didn’t encounter this issue, so I believe this is a system error. I contacted Batik Air’s customer support as soon as possible, but representatives were unavailable at night. I emailed the next day, provided passport confirmation as requested, and waited. For an entire week, there was no follow-up. Frustrated, I called Batik Air’s Australia customer support on my day off, as soon as they opened at 9:00 AM. After waiting 30 minutes, I was told by a representative, Reapi, that I would need to pay AUD $77 to amend my wife’s surname. When I asked to escalate the issue to a supervisor or manager, I was rudely told: “I don’t have a manager I can get for you now; he starts at 1 PM.” “Do you want to use the ticket or not?” “How do you want me to transfer the line to a manager if he’s not here?” Frustrated but determined, I called back at 1 PM, as advised. This time, after waiting another 90 minutes, I spoke with a representative, Ulai. When I asked for a manager, he claimed no manager was available and said he was the decision-maker. His tone was dismissive, and he said things like: “This is your fault. You either pay or don’t travel.” “I don’t understand why you won’t pay AUD $77. If you don’t pay, your wife simply won’t travel.” This level of unprofessionalism is shocking. Dismissive tone, refusing to escalate my issue, and resorting to emotional blackmail are unacceptable behaviors for customer service representatives. If Batik Air’s policy is to treat customers as mere policy-bound transactions, I’d suggest replacing staff with AI bots—they’d at least lack the rudeness I experienced. To clarify, I wasn’t asking to change passengers or make a complex adjustment—just to amend a surname to match my wife’s passport. The policy of charging AUD $77 for changes over three characters is unreasonable and feels like a deliberate way to exploit customers for simple corrections. As a loyal customer who has flown with Batik Air frequently since marrying my Malaysian wife, I’m deeply disappointed. I had planned to use Batik Air for the foreseeable future for our trips between Malaysia and Australia—potentially over 10 years. However, this experience has led me to decide never to travel with Batik Air again. I will also share my experience with family, friends, and all online users that I can reach out to caution them. Batik Air’s disrespectful representatives, lack of professionalism, and rigid policies have cost them a loyal customer. I hope this review serves as feedback for the airline to address these serious issues.

### "wouldn’t travel Batik Air again"
Not Verified |  Paid for pre selected front seats but at check in we were advised those seats not available and were allocated the last seats in the plane. After many emails and being informed they would refund our money, this still 7 months later has not been honoured. Be wary as I believe this is common practice with this airline. I have travelled on far better low cost airlines and wouldn’t travel Batik Air again.

### "extremely disappointed"
My second times with Batik Air and the experience is extremely disappointed. We purchase economic flexi package with pre-selected seat and foods all paid, but the services was not given both thru and flow trips ! With multiple follow up and call Batik customer service after more than 1 month, Batik Airline still did not provide any explanation and compensation. Our trip from KL to Dubai on 15/11 - when checked in our pre-selected seat 4A & 4B was given out and they put us on the last row 29 and the airlines officer said you have to check in earlier no pre-select ticket, the officer is unaware on our ticket paid with seat booked. We do not argue just take the seat and on board as there are no more seat left. After we on board, we waited almost an hour no foods serve when we asked, the stewardess mentioned all foods are served and our name was not in their distribution list?? We explained to the stewardess but it was bad experience to argue with stewardess on food, stewardess don’t feel like entertain us as not their responsibility to do so since our name not on the food distribution list. Our order food include main course, drink and dessert all gone not served for both 2 travelers. Stewardess asked us pay to buy and complaint later, we insisted no and they served us with whatever left at cabin. We are worry the trip back from Dubai to KL encounter similar problem, we immediately emailed customer services what happened on flight same day after we reached Dubai. We kept email to rectify after 4 days only Batik customer care replied our emails to double confirm our air ticket paid with these selected seat and complimentary foods. This time 21/11 we checked in with our selected seat but unfortunately, when on flight similar issue happened again, stewardess again mentioned no food for our air fare. We are really sick with Batik services the responsiveness is slow and no corrective action plan taken. We shown the email reply by Batik Customer Care, the stewardess again claimed that our name not on their food distribution list? Worst pre-alert email sent to avoid similar issue happen but it still happen? After the trip back to Malaysia, we lodged in complain in Batik website, through email to customer care and Call direct, after all these non stop action for more than 1 month, yet there are still no reply and explanation and compensation on this. This is such an unfair treatment to customer for long waiting time and collected payment without giving the services? We have no way to reach Batik Airline for an explanation/compensation in this matter, hence we hope with this review Batik Airline top management realized there is this poor customer experience and they could look into the case seriously to improve the Batik Airline service. Other than this case, the seat is comfort and flight punctuality is ok.

### "I decided to upgrade"
I decided to upgrade and paid 7000 THB to business class from Bangkok to Bali on 14.12.2025 on 1350 hr. The airplane was old. Plus, I did not even get offer for a meal or coffee. The flight attendants are the laziest from my experience. All I got was 2 breads with a small bottle of water. At Bali all business class passengers including me were lost. How can it be that you pay more to get worse? The response of staff was non professional and slow.

### “extremely unprofessional and unhelpful”
I had an extremely disappointing experience with this airline. I took a connecting flight from Singapore to Malaysia and then to Kathmandu. Before checking in my baggage, I explicitly emphasized to the counter staff that I did not want to experience any baggage delays. They assured me there would be no issues. After reaching Malaysia, I boarded the next plane to Kathmandu and reconfirmed with the airline staff that my baggage was being transferred. Again, I was assured everything was in order. Upon arriving in Kathmandu, my bag was nowhere to be found. I waited for hours at the conveyor belt, only to realize my baggage was left behind. What made this worse was the airline's complete lack of effort to contact me. There was no way to reach their customer service—extremely unprofessional and unhelpful. My bag arrived two days later, but I was not informed of the time or flight details. I had to personally seek help from the staff at Kathmandu Airport to locate it. Adding insult to injury, the airline offered me a mere 50 Ringgit as compensation for the inconvenience. Due to this delay, I had to cancel my planned transportation and trek to Everest Base Camp, incurring additional expenses and wasting precious time. When I emailed the airline requesting reimbursement, they simply ignored my messages—further showcasing their unprofessionalism. Additionally, even before boarding in Singapore, the ground staff were rude and unprofessional toward passengers. This airline has demonstrated a consistent lack of care, professionalism, and customer service. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. Take this airline only if you’re willing to risk ruining your trip. I will be lodging a formal complaint.

### "lack of care for their constant delays"
Not Verified |  As expats from Australia living in south east Asia, we often fly with low budget airlines, we often fly through Malaysia etc. Every other airline we have flown with, there has been no problem, even when there have been delays, cancellation, etc. there has always been ample support and respect. With Batik air we have experienced the total opposite. The lack of care for their constant delays is appalling. Reading through these reviews, they are more likely to be delayed than to be on time. Unless you are using batik air to fly to a single destination with no stop overs, and you don’t mind what time you arrive or depart, I would never ever book with them. Our delayed flight occurred 2 days in a row, incurring over $1000 in change of flights cost. It is more safe to spend extra money on airlines that have policies to ensure they support you. Batik air should be an absolute last resort. Do not waste your time. You will be disappointed. And if you’re not, you’re one of the lucky ones, not normal.

### "not recommended"
Flight delayed by about 100 minutes, no info received from carrier via email prior to departure. I could have stayed in bed for another 1.5h! Flight status function on airline website not working, shows flight as punctual. Flight itself nothing to shout about. Due to the non existing communication from the airline, not recommended!

### “cannot complain apart from the food”
New aircraft, B737-8Max. Better business class seats as compared to the old 737-8. Check in at Perth was curt and unfriendly. Boarding processes was good. FA's were attentive and responsive. Food was terrible, basically economy class food on a tray. They actually have IFE that works albeit extremely limited content. Ground staff at KLIA were good and overall I cannot complain about this flight apart from the food. It was a Business promo ticket so no lounge access. It really is a budget airline cutting costs at every opportunity.

### "Seats are terrible, old and dated"
Business class on a low-cost hybrid airline. Overnight flight. Boarding call was a mess. Seats are terrible, old and dated and the recline controls don't work properly. No IFE despite there being huge screens. Batik does not update their website and it's hard to manage your booking but easy to add on services like food etc. The app doesn't work so you can't check in and have your boarding pass on your phone. The attendants were pleasant and proactive, even offering me wine at 4am! The food was terrible, basically an economy class meal served in some china. I guess you get what you pay for. But I have to say the flight was on time and uneventful.

### "not being able to check in online"
Terrible, from not being able to check in online to the flights takeoff and landing. We waited 25 minutes in 30+ degree weather on the tarmac with no shade for a bus to take us to the terminal where we still had to wait another 30 minutes for our bags. If you have another alternative to fly with I would suggest you use it. Cabin crew were decent and cabin was clean.

### "expect airlines to be more transparent"
Not Verified |  In July this year, I booked family flight tickets from Canberra to Bali on Batik airlines for 13th December 2024. I just received a call (27th Sep) from Webjet informing me that the service is cancelled - Webjet knew about the change since 13th Aug, but decided to call me up today. On checking with local Australia Batik airlines contact number, I found that since last month no flights are operating between Canberra to Bali and they have no plans to resume this service in near future. I read newspaper articles stating that flights from Canberra to Bali were reduced from 3 to 2 flights per week, but have not found any information that all flights have been stopped. We booked tickets in July hoping to get a cheaper fare. I now have to book tickets again at a much higher fare, and Batik is only offering a refund, they do not give replacement flights from Canberra to Bali. We all expect airlines to be more transparent and help people in these tough times where every person is feeling the stress of cost of living pressures.

### "No respect for customers"
No respect for customers. My flight took off without warning 30 minutes before the announced departure time on 09/10/2024. No refunds and no help from staff. First and last time I choose this low quality company! Aucun respect pour les clients. Mon vol a décollé sans avertissement 30 minutes avant l’heure de départ annoncée en ce 10/09/2024. Aucun remboursement et aucune aide de la part du personnel. . Première et dernière fois que je choisis cette compagnie low quality !

### “the food was absolutely atrocious”
Worst flying experience ever, the food was absolutely atrocious, drinks served were minimal - just red wine, Carlsberg beer and vodka available, no comfort pack (eyeshades and earplugs), seat recliner and foot extensions did not work (pic of seat controls attached), no inflight entertainment. The food was bland and inedible, no butter with the bun - (which supposedly had custard inside! ), dessert was something brown which tasted horrible. The business class on this airline is seriously below what anyone would expect for the price charged.

### "Legroom was fairly generous"
Simple 45-minute hop from Singapore to Malaysia, in a new and modern Boeing 737 MAX 8. Seats were new and upholstered in a pleasing light-coffee-brown colour with a headrest. Legroom was fairly generous for a Low-Cost Carrier and looked to be comfortable for flights of up to 4-5 hours, definitely more comfortable than what AirAsia/Scoot were providing. Meals and beverages were for purchase, the cabin crew provided complimentary water. IFE screens were turned off. Despite the take-off time being delayed by close to half an hour, that was due to orders from ATC given that the weather was storming at that moment, and the crew made up for it as much as they could, eventually reducing the deficit to ten minutes.

### "the worst flight I've taken"
Took advantage of the recently introduced direct service between CBR and DPS. Within 5 minutes of boarding I wish I hadn't. The unsmiling crew were obviously exhausted having flown overnight from DPS on the incoming flight. Mistakenly I had expected Batik would base some crew in Canberra. I had also assumed that catering would be loaded in Canberra although that was mistake number two! We were served an inedible meal of very spicy chicken and rice at 8am which had been loaded in Denpasar the night before. This was the only meal service during the 6.5 hr flight. My seat was broken with no working USB charger and the aircraft dirty. Flight attendants hid behind the curtain for most of the flight glued to their devices. Not once was there any announcement by the Captain or First Officer. A family of four received an upgrade to business class after handing over $1,000 in cash. I then witnessed them being charged $15 for a tube of pringles ..... seriously! About 5 hours into the flight I asked if there was anything to eat to be told "no" and the only thing to drink was water. Our tickets cost over $3,000 one way for the two of us. This was by far the worst flight I've taken in any class of travel. Next time I'll fly from Sydney and not on Batik.

### "No lounge access"
No lounge access with a business class ticket. I am absolutely gob-smacked. Apparently, they have 2 class of business class. So what am I paying for in Business Class, I asked. For your larger seat and a meal, was the reply. Am absolutely appalled with this and I would advise everyone do not buy business class in this airline. Do not waste your money.

### "didn’t even receive answers"
The flight was cancelled, we never received our money back. We e-mailed many times and tried the whats app number. In the beginning we had some response but after a while we didn’t even receive answers from Batik Air anymore. We would like to warn people about booking with Batik Air.

### "no longer a full service airline"
Changed our departure date and return dates and flights with minimal notice. Informed by email that very morning before our flight that it was delayed by over 12 hours causing us to miss our connecting train journey the next day. Forced to get a full refund and book another airline leaving the same day. Return flight : changed 3 times forcing us to change accommodation and pre booked transport. Also re routed us to Bali with extending the flight by almost 2 hours. Not allowed off the plane in Bali. Cursory cleaning - single young girl with a brush and pan only collecting visible rubbish. By the way you are forced to throw out all water at the Boarding gate so cannot buy water for the flight. The air hostess refused to serve us water and insisted we purchase. One angry passenger got a cup after getting aggressive. I just shut up and paid up. Furthermore, with the repeated flight changes they lost our pre purchased meals. Then said they had nothing left except Green curry Thai chicken. Worse still they were reluctant to believe us and wanted proof which we could not provide without internet to open our email for the voucher. On the positive side: Plenty of leg room. Admin. staff willing to refund if you meet conditions. Note: they are no longer a full service airline now. Have to pay for luggage, seats, meal and water.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience. I travelled many airlines till now. But Batik Air such a horrible flight no one should travel. 2 days before my travel they cancelled my trip and made it for next day exactly 24 hours late. I replied please don’t do this, my son's schooling will be suffered and also we had not booked hotel for that day. I requested them at least give a days hotel stay, but no response. Then I appealed my agent, he said this airline is worst airline in the world. They never compensate or respond. Due to the fare being less than other airlines I opted this airline, but I had spend Rs 10000/- more for our 3 people accommodation and food. And we wasted a full day, and son suffered his schooling.

### "appalled with the behaviour"
My daughter was travelling alone and was booked on a Turkish Airlines flight from Athens. A delay in Athens meant she missed the connection in Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur. She was stuck in Kuala Lumper for 3 nights and was put in a hotel for this period. On her Batik Air flight, there were no meals provided which she was told would be included and the staff told her she had to pay. She had no money with her. She became ill on the plane and asked for a vomit bag and was told they had none on board and she should use the bathroom, she was so ill she couldn’t get to the bathroom. She asked for some water and was told she had to pay for it, as she had no money the staff would not give her any. When she arrived in Melbourne, she asked for assistance to get off the plane and medical assistance and she was told they couldn’t assist. To treat a young girl in this way is absolutely barbaric and I have never in all my years of flying heard of such detestable staff. I am appalled with the behaviour of your airline staff, and it reflects very badly on the management.

### "they have become worse"
Not Verified |   Batik Air few years ago used to be really good, and I was a regular customer flying out of Melbourne. However in recent times they have become worse. They constantly cancel flights, extremely unreliable you can't really use them to plan your trip because they will cancel and change your flight multiple times, they will even cancel an ENTIRE flight route. For example their direct flights from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur completely disappear and re appear on their website with different schedules all the time that's because they are using the same plane and rerouting it to different locations while sacrificing their customers who paid for their tickets! This is an extremely big problem

### "Batik Air is a great option"
Not Verified |   Took a 6 hour flight on the Batik Air Boeing 737-800 from Perth to KL, so a fairly small plane with only two toilets, but for the price its great value. A choice of hot meals were 25 MYR (~AUD 8) each to buy on board if you didn't pre-book. The food and drinks were not bad. The service seemed good even though they worked pretty hard - I believe there was only 3 flight attendants on board. The piloting and landing was good and hardly any turbulence was encountered. In flight entertainment and USB charging is potentially available based on the aircraft, but need to plan for there being none there. So overall, I've had worse service and worse food from Singapore Airlines while paying triple the price, so I think Batik Air is a great option on the Australia to KL route.

### "unsatisfactory airline service"
Not Verified |   In my extensive experience traveling internationally with various airlines, I have never encountered such an unsatisfactory airline service. I had booked flights from Phuket to Bali; however, we were unable to reach the airport due to severe flooding obstructing the roads leading to Phuket Airport. Despite our efforts to contact Customer Care for assistance in obtaining proof of our inability to show up for the flight, we were unable to receive any support. Professional customer care entails taking responsibility for any damages caused to customers. Their WhatsApp AI is terrible and no one answers the phone so it's just waste of time and energy! Never travel in Batik Air - I wish I had never booked with them and I will never book again.

### “Useless staff all round”
Not Verified | Don’t even think about flying with these guys. 1 hour delay from Brisbane to Denpasar, no leg room, have to pay for basic things like water on the flight after you have had to discard it if flying internationally. Muppet service crew and pilots made us board an hour early only to then start refuelling the airplane making us stay later than the original take-off time. Useless staff all round, avoid at all costs.

### "can’t operate properly"
This airline is very bad. Firstly they cancelled both my flight return from kl to turkey and that caused so much inconvenience as I have to rebook with another airline who is much costlier. This flight today from Kuala Lumpur to Perth they have told us 2 days (only 2 days in advance) that it has been changed to more than 24 hours later so we lost a day and had to pay one extra night hotel and lost 1 day of work. Now they have technical issues which have caused 4 hours delay in taking off. This is too much for the passengers honestly. Why operate why you can’t operate properly and cause people to suffer? Enough is this.

### “the worst full service airline”
Probably the worst full service airline. Absolutely doesn't feel like a full service airline but it definitely feels like budget airline. I have flown this airline many times and it has never been on time. One time, my flight was changed from ID 6588 (depart at 6:00pm) to ID 6576 (depart at 5:00) so I had to cancel some itineraries in the city to leave to the airport earlier. But when I got to the airport, ID 6576 was delayed at least 90 minutes to even later than the original 6588 schedule. Would stay away from this airline in the future.

### "chaos during boarding"
Yogyakarta  to Jakarta on their ex-Royal Jordanian A320. Check-in was a breeze and the staff was professional, but little did I know, I was given a seat that does not even exist. My seat was in row 13, but upon boarding, which was slightly late, there was no rows 13 and 14. This caused chaos during boarding with me having to negotiate with the cabin crews, ground staff, and the passenger who originally occupied row 12 as I was asked by the crew to be seated in row 12. Luckily, both the crews and ground staff were quick-thinking and professional, and offered a win-win solution that satisfied all the parties involved even though the crews and ground staff had no fault whatsoever. If anything, this was the fault of Batik Air for not standardizing their plane's interiors (Batik had multiple A320s with multiple configurations) and not providing the check-in staff with the correct diagram. That being said, I think the check-in staff should have known that the same aircraft, PK-BKF, had been regularly operating the route in 8 out of 10 occasions around the time I took this flight. Take-off was delayed by 33 minutes, and what could have been a 5 or 6/10 flight was turned into a 9/10 flight thanks to the helpful ground staff members and the cabin crews. They were fantastic. They could have been just a little more friendlier, but overall, they were professional, active, caring, courteous, and helpful. My seat had a headrest which is something not all Batik Air aircrafts have and increased comfort by a lot. It was, however, jammed in the recline position and covered with age-old grime. The cabin was also covered in some grime, but it was clean, comfortable, and in good condition considering it was almost 18 years old. The air conditioner setting was perfect. On this 50-minute flight, snacks and water were provided, which was delicious and greatly appreciated. There was also a Wi-Fi based in-flight entertainment which was speedy and had a lot of up to-date contents. Landing was only a tad late, and I arrived at CGK only to wait another hour for my bag to arrive. Overall, this could've been a 5/10 flight due to the slow baggage handling and the erroneous "ghost" seat assignment, but the in-flight experience was more than enough to forgive these shortcomings and turned the supposedly 5/10 flight to a 9/10, enjoyable flight. Batik might have made awful mistakes on the ground side of this flight, but how they handled them was worth a praise.

### “It’s too cold on board”
Terrible!! They delayed flight to more then 15 hours. Then they delayed boarding. They baggage cost is huge compared to AirAsia. It’s too cold on board and they have nothing to do but SELL me a blanket. Hate this conpany. Never again!

### "charged $99 per 20 kg bag"
No customer service or customer care. I booked a return to Brisbane and during the booking I failed to see they changed their baggage allowance. I called them to add baggage two weeks before my flight and was charged $99 per 20 kg bag. Then on the departure day the flight was cancelled with no offer of help or compensation. The flight was rescheduled for the following day and it was late. I tried calling the office in Malaysia but had no luck. Their app is useless like the airline. I would never fly with this airline again.

### “recovery was within 10 hours”
Credits go to the ground crew (Aliff, Daniel, lost and found counter and Hana, check-in counter), attending the request on my left I-pad in the front seat pocket of 46H Flight OD752 Tashkent - KUL on 13 May 2024, Arrival 1100 KUL. Their response on the request was quite prompt (5 hours) and the recovery was within 10 hours. Excellent. Kudos to all these guys. Reported by 3pm, 13/5/24 and received the item before 2pm, 14/5/24. Thanks to the Lost and Found team.

### "degrade itself to budget airline"
Not Verified |   Flight was first delayed from 1145am to 1230pm under the reason of “airport operational reason”, then further delayed without any notice, keeping everyone at the gate waiting in confusion. All until around 1pm, people were only informed that the flight was changed to another gate, yet no update was shown on the monitors, and when people reached the newly assigned gate, the gate was still not ready yet but catering to two other flights from Singaporean airlines. Disorder. Eventually the flight departed at 1.57pm, which was delayed over 2hours, the airlines did not offer free meal either as compensation suggested on Mavcom. On the flight, the stewardess was kinda rigid to repeatedly require passenger to SWITCH OFF mobile phones (flight mode is not even allowed). It looked like Batik Air is ready to degrade itself to budget airline following their retraction of free checked-in baggage service.

### "customer service is pathetic"
Not Verified | Worst airline. Never on time. Delayed my flight by 2 days and after that once we reach airport flight got further delayed by 2 hours making total waiting period of close to 8 hrs for me. Besides, customer service is pathetic and lousy. No prompt response and no compensation for such time waste. Request to all not to use this airline for Mumbai - Malaysia route

### “avoid using this substandard airline”
Would have to be the worst airline I have ever used. In the last 3 weeks they have cancelled flights without notification, when flights where changed the next 4 flights have all been a minimum of 1.5 hours late. When I missed my connecting international flight they at first said it was my fault until I showed them the cancellation of the the 1st flight and that the second flight was 1hr 20min late. And today I was supposed to leave Denpasar airport at 19.50 and its now 21.35 with no sight of the plane turning up. This is the last time I will ever fly with them and I am a regular traveller as I work in Indonesia. If you are looking at booking a trip in Indonesia avoid using this substandard airline.

### "Business class No wifi"
Cabin crew need to be trained, not ready to work. Economy class passengers entered business class cabin right after landed. Business class No wifi offered, very limited movies selection, no monitor provided. Return kudos to the staff, I requested for paracetamol or panadol & was informed it is not available but she did gave her personal fever pills. Economy class passengers entered business class cabin after landing.

### “Terrible experience”
Filthy and dirty airplane. I had to ask the flight attendant twice to come and clean the seat. Some white stains still stuck to the seat, so I asked to change seat which they approved. Looking around, all seats had some dirt and stains on them. Terrible experience, and hope to never fly with Batik Air again.

### "never be flying with Batik Air again"
This was my first and last time flying with this company. When I went to check in the man at the desk that checked me and was very rude and treated me like I wasn’t a human being. When I asked if he could help me move my bag over to get weighed because I just had surgery, he asked for my fit to fly letter and I said to him that it’s in my bag I just have to get it. He kept asking for it rudely and it takes me longer to do things just because I’ve had surgery. He started asking me about my surgery and what I had done even though I had showed him the fit to fly letter and it says it exactly what I had done. Then told me that I shouldn’t have a fit to fly letter. If I can’t lift my baggage, I explain to him that the surgeon advise me that I’m not allowed to lift anything over 5 kg for the next 6 to 8 weeks. He then got even ruder and when my bag had to get x-rayed, he threw my bag on, I didn’t understand why he didn’t just place it down because it’s heavy he had no reason just to throw it like that. Overall I will never be flying with Batik Air again. The staff do not have any kindness or respect towards . There was a lady watching this all happen and she could tell that I was on the verge of crying and she didn’t stand in to help me once. I understand people have bad days but I would never come to work and be rude to my customer you leave that problem at home.

### "Long waiting time at terminal"
Delayed for an hour. Attempted to fly twice but aborted due to technical issue. Had to u-turn back to terminal. Long waiting time at terminal without update or feedback from staff too.

### "such a negative experience"
Not Verified | My elderly parents flew from Perth to Kuala Lumpur via Batik Air. My father became very unwell during the flight. Despite having pre-booked their meals, by the time airline staff got to their seats there was no more food available. My father requested water, only warm water available. When disembarking he was unable to walk, my mother requested a wheelchair for him and explained he'd become unwell. This request was refused. Appalling behaviour, this has really put them off flying again. Such a shame they had such a negative experience with this airline.

### "re-scheduled my ticket absent-mindedly"
I had booked my flight ticket a way way earlier, about 2 months ago. I planned for return ticket from Kota Bharu- Kota Kinabalu and I supposed to go back from Kota Kinabalu to Kota Bharu on 5/3/24. There was no direct ticket so they gave option KLIA as my transit. Long story short, my trip from Kota Kinabalu to KLIA around 11am and my next flight to Kota Bharu supposed to be around 6pm so that I somehow can manage if the first flight going to be delayed and of course it was. Mind you, I purchased the ticket from their official website. And they suddenly changed the schedule without notifying me with no proper email or whatsoever. My first trip Kota Kinabalu to KLIA around 11am (no change) and without no common sense at all, managed to re-schedule my KLIA to Kota Bharu at 8.30 am on the same day! Earlier that my first trip. Was I suppose to swim all the way through Laut China Selatan to reach the KLIA airport? You tell me. And I purchased the ticket as round trip, not separately. I had tried calling the customer service hotline to no avail ofc, I had sent few emails regarding my enquiry but again, to no avail. I came earlier to the check-in counter at Kota Kinabalu International airport, but there was No definite answer. The staff nonchalantly informed me there was no flight at evening from Kota Kinablau but he asked me to go to check-in counter in KLIA once I arrived there. When I first arrived there, I managed to ask politely why they re-scheduled my ticket absent-mindedly and the staff talked to me condescendingly. Your staff tried to gaslight me like I am a stupid person but she is working with bad company. And now I have to spend almost RM800 at KL while awaiting for my next flight.

### “instead of 8hr transit we have 20hr Transit”
Me and my Husband had a flight on 27th February 2024 from Auckland to Kathmandu, we had an hour transit to Perth and Malaysia. We were about to check in at 4:30am NZ time for 7:30am flight. We reached airport on time then check the screen it says time has been reschedule and instead of 7:30am our time has been rescheduled to 1pm. No one came to inform us until then we received an email at 8am saying our flight timing has been changed from 7:30am to 1pm. The flight time was rescheduled for 1pm but when we took off its almost 3pm. We purchase extra meal for the flight but we didn’t get any meal as we don’t have the screen shot of want we have ordered, we use our USD currency to buy food. We reach Perth and we found lots of people having the same problems like us who stayed in airport for more then 10hrs due reschedule of the time and no one has been informed. We didn’t get new boarding time table display on the ticket, none of the staff know when we will arrive in Malaysia and when we are taking off from Malaysia to Kathmandu. We booked our domestic tickets for Kathmandu to our home but we never know what time we will reach to Malaysia and Kathmandu. Our domestic ticket has been cancelled as we didn’t know what time we will reach to Kathmandu. Our family has to stay in the hotel who came to receive us in Kathmandu and we were unable to tell them that how long will it take us to reach Kathmandu. We landed to Malaysia at 12am midnight, original timings when we bought the tickets we were suppose to land by 4:30pm. In Perth we were told we have 2 hr transit in Malaysia instead of 1.5hr we were okay as its only half an hour difference. Then we meet staff from Batik Air with few other passengers, he mentioned due some problem instead of 2 hr transit we have 8 hr transit now. It’s almost 24 hr but we were unable to reach our destination, the airlines didn’t provide any complimentary food, they didn’t even give us what we had purchased in advance. Suddenly one more staff from Batik airlines came to us and apologize that instead of 8hr transit we have 20hr Transit. The only reason me and wife travel to Kathmandu is for the wedding and it looks like we cannot make it to the wedding. I have mention this to the staff but looks like they don’t even bother. Then all the passengers start questioning and asking for refund. He said you can email and ask for your refund but it will take you almost 90 days for your refund. They he managed to get us into the hotel as we have to stay in Malaysia for almost 20hr. They did provide a meal for the day. We are still in Malaysia and hoping the time doesn’t change anymore. We were suppose to reach home by 27th 8:30pm Nepali timezone now it looks like we will arrive to Kathmandu on 29th Feb at 9pm if incase the new timings doesn’t change.

### "put me in a difficult situation"
Not Verified | As I needed to change my flight date they said I can't do this over the phone and I had to drive 2 hours to go to the airport so that I can speak to someone. After hours of being thrown around to different team they told me I have to buy new tickets and then later I will be refunded my unused tickets. I proceeded to do this and when I asked for my partial refund out of $1700 paid they only refunded me $70 because their admin fees were so high. I was never told any of this information prior and they put me in a difficult situation. Every time I called to speak to someone they would put me on long holds and each time they hang up the phone on me without resolving anything. This is a big scam of a company.

### "staff appeared indifferent"
Batik Air customer service is virtually non-existent. The staff appeared indifferent and unresponsive to my needs and concerns. They provide last-minute information regarding flight delays, causing unnecessary inconvenience. The in-flight services do not offer good value for money. The quality of food and amenities provided does not justify the cost,

### "aircraft was dirty and unkempt"
Not Verified | The aircraft was dirty and unkempt. Holes in the carpet upon entry into the aircraft. The seats felt unclean. The request for an aisle seat due to my senior age was ignored. The food was well below par and almost unpalatable, with most menu choices unavailable. I do not expect high-class provisions in the Economy class  but I do expect basic cleanliness and a meal paid for during the flight that doesn't taste like last week's afterthought. On a lighter note, the cabin crew were polite and friendly. I harbour no ill will towards them as they are not responsible for the condition of the aircraft or the poor quality of the food. Management should be ashamed.

### "one of the better LCC options"
Flight ticket includes a mandatory 20kg of checked baggage that costs cheaper than other LC carrier (Air Asia) 's buy-in offer. Leg room is OK, very comfortable. Access to gates in the KLIA 1 Main terminal (instead of the Concourse terminal) which is excellent to board the plane after immigration and to also quickly get to immigration after landing (you can walk straight to Immigration within 10 minutes after leaving the plane). Expect delays or rescheduling to happen. My first leg was rescheduled to be 1 hour later, but good thing is the airline informed almost a month in advance. Ground service was not consistent - my 1st leg to Hanoi was great but on the 2nd leg back to KL, the ground staff at NIA kept checking my backpack and complained that I would exceed my carry-on limit. I had to put my pack on checked and carried my laptop throughout the journey, and at the same time I was seeing many other passengers carrying their backpacks like nothing. I guess it's a thing for LCC that you'd get randomly targeted for bag-check 2. Food and drink has to be purchased which is expected for LCC however they're still quite pricey. 10% price drop could make purchasing much more sensible. My second leg back to KL was the first time ever I flew Boeing 737 MAX. I was feeling unease during take-off, but then it all went fine after that. Treat this airline as one of the better LCC options with checked baggage included. Solo/budget travel recommended only, or you have to go doing personal thing carrying many personal items (like I did). Don't choose this for leisure travel.

### "never travel this airline again"
My luggage was damaged by Batik Air and I reported in Sydney terminal, they have send me an email address to contact. I have sent several email no reply, I called customer service no reply. Food service only snack, no main course you need to purchase the main course. No cold water only lukewarm water. I will never travel this airline again.

### "Please avoid this airline"
Terrible. Delays galore. Hours of delays. No explanation, no apologies. Please avoid this airline at all cost.

### "I will never fly with them again"
They changed our flight over 6 times with no apologies or offers of any compensation. Every flight we took was delayed by at least 30 mins sometimes hours. There was no communication from their ground staff around change of gates or delays. Their subsequent replies and responses to our complaints via your post flight customer service were disgraceful & empty. I will never fly with them again.

### “No complaints here”
Not Verified | No complaints here. Friendly and helpful service. Nice food was only $7aud and one free Water halfway through the flight - which was on time. I would travel with them again - better than Jetstar.

### "still trying to receive compensation"
We booked with Turkish Airlines From Birmingham to Perth via Istanbul and Kuala Lumpur. The last flight was changed to Batik Air, Turkish Airlines was who we paid the fare to but they have passed the buck. Customer service does not exist On arrival in Perth our two bags were missing for 5 days. A year later we are still trying to receive compensation for £202.71 for the clothes etc. we had to buy until our baggage turned up. Over 80 Emails and phone calls they have not produced a penny. Planes are old and dirty no entertainment payment has to be made for food and drink.

### "experience was disgraceful"
Not Verified |  A truly appalling airline to say the least. In all my years of flying international with many airlines I have never experienced such a ridiculous sorry excuse of an airline. Upon boarding the aircraft, the air smelt like stale garlic noodles. An 11 hour flight (split in 2, Adelaide to Bali then Bali to Bangkok) I was served a complimentary 250ml water in a plastic juice like cup, fit for a 3 year old and a miniature bun that tasted like cardboard. Onboard meal from Adelaide to Bali was provided at a cost to the passenger. From Bali to Bangkok the same complimentary water and bun provided with nothing else ! No onboard entertainment provided. I am appalled that this airline has the right to fly with such below average service. The experience was disgraceful and poor and did not match the price they charged for their tickets.

### "look for another airline"
If you have another choice, you should just look for another airline. Instead of wasting time just waiting for a mistake made by the airline and must be borne by the passengers. From Jakarta to KUL delay until 3hours.

### "we can recommend it"
Not Verified |  We four of us family members reserved our tickets during November as Batik air offered a very competitive rate. The Cabin crew was very supportive, all ordered food received (cant expect more from a low cost air line) flight was clean and mostly on time. Enough leg space to sit comfortably. All baggage received intact. Initially we feared to travel Batik air but now we can recommend it to friends, even though the Perth transit was a bit of a hassle going through screening. Hope they will do better in time to cone.

### "Bogus flights at lower fares"
Bogus flights at lower fares are put in place to lure customers. These flights get cancelled or rescheduled at the last moment, forcing passengers to choose alternate flight arrangements from the same airline. Despite paying for extras (meals, comfy kits) - airline staff is reluctant to provide the same. They either give only after multiple requests or simply refuse and ask customers to follow up with the customer care team for a refund (which is another headache).Inferior flight conditions, not a single screen in economy class is working. Surprisingly, we have to prove that the airline has damaged our bag. None of the airline staff noticed that. Further, it's made impossible for customers to claim by asking for unnecessary documentation or reports, which no one knows where to obtain from.

### “I didn't get the service which I paid for”
It was a nightmare since I booked a Batik Airline ticket. Series of events. 1) I booked a ticket from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur to New Delhi, India for my 67 years old Mother-in-law and disabled sister-in-law. I intentionally avoided booking flight transiting from Australia to avoid any hassle (past experience relating to the transit visa and not getting wheelchair for elderly and disabled person). 2) After some time I got an email notifying that flight has changed from 29/11 to 30/11 and another stop Perth was added. 3) I called Batik customer care (the representative on call was too rude and unprofessional) and booking agent (Go to Gate) but ended up being a ball passed from one corner to another one. I was informed by Batik that all the Batik flights are routed from Australia and the booking agent hasn't provided the clear information on their website. Really! Forcefully, I had to apply transit visa for both the passengers. 4) In the meanwhile, I called the airlines again to secure the wheelchair assistance for 67 years old Mother-in-law having knee issues and for disabled sister-in-law, during that call I wasn't told that wheelchair assistance is a paid service with Batik. 5) On the travel date we reached to the counter to get the wheelchair assistance, but we were bluntly told to pay $90 PP to get the wheelchair (I heard this first time that wheelchair assistance is payable) otherwise passengers will have to walk by themselves. I ended up paying $180/- at the counter but wheelchair was provided only at Auckland airport, my mother-in-law and disabled sister-in-law had to struggle and walk in Perth, Kuala Lumpur and in New Delhi. I didn't get the service which I paid for. My mother-in-law’s knee is swollen due to all these hardships, and she is under doctors’ observation for last 3 days. 6) I was told by Batik representative on call that the passengers would not need to change the plane in Perth stopover (1.10 hrs only), we got ourselves assured that there will not be any hassle for the passengers as the wheelchairs have been arranged. However, after plane landed in Perth, my mother-in-law asked for the wheelchair, but she was rudely told there is no wheelchair and upon insisting and notifying that we have already paid for the wheelchair, she was told to take the wheelchair, if needed and get to other gate after security clearance. An elderly and a disabled person didn’t get the required wheelchair assistance for such a short period of layover (1.10 hrs) and they had to push themselves hard to reach to boarding gate for flight to the Kuala Lumpur. 7) The worst thing ever, I paid for food while booking the tickets and the receipt clearly shows the meal charges, however, both the passengers were refused to serve even water saying you must pay for it! Could you imagine an international flight without food, they had to suffer for the whole flight duration. 8) After reaching to New Delhi, they were again told that there were only 6 people on airlines list to get wheelchair assistance and My mother-in-law and sister-in-law’s name wasn’t there. This is a clear case of gross negligence and deficiency in services on Batik Airlines part. I am badly disappointed about the rude behaviour of airline people, ignorance, non-sympathetic behaviour, and the hardship, mental trauma, inconvenience and the hunger they felt during this period is unforgivable.

### "Don't book this airline"
Don't book this airline. We change our flight and paid which is normal. Then they change it back 1 week prior both flights were change. They don't have call centre for you to talk. They will ask you to email only. Both flights change back and they said its either you cancel your flight or refund. And refund will take months to get. Is that right? U pay for change flight and they will just change it back to the original flight with nothing. Then they change the flight going back to Melbourne as well. So you need to book additional hotel accomodation and take another leave and they wont care. Other airlines will compensate after 12 hours. This airline 24hours but nothing. My baggage was crushed on the flight so on next flight i asked the check in person if they can be more careful. He just smiled at me. That's it. No sorry. Or anything to assure you. Don't go to this airline. They will cancel ur flight anytime they want and wont care about your schedule.

### "Forced to bought new ticket"
Received notification that flight replacement and time change on 2:20pm but the flight was departed on 1pm. So missed the flight! Forced to bought new ticket.

### "fly them again if the price was right"
Boarding process was terrible, it was a free for all. Once on board, FA's were nice and helpful. The seats were worn and the aircraft looked tired. The flight left on time and it was quite uneventful. Food and drinks need to be paid for, so two FA's were in charge of an economy cabin and took forever to make their was from the front down to the back were I was seated. The price of food was reasonable and I didn't buy a hot meal as the flight departed at 2355 but the food eaten by my neighbour looked and smelt very nice. The seats were cramped and legroom was awful if you're tall like me. We landed on time and out bags arrived without any fuss. I would fly them again if the price was right.

### "never care about their customers"
I used Batik for my business trip from Jakarta to Semarang and return. My client paid the ticket. I had bad experience which they change the schedule for almost 3 times (Ticket from Jakarta to Semarang). And the experience happened again with a delay. This caused me canceling an important meeting. Batik Air and lion group never care about their customers. The worst airline ever.

### "Batik Air, never again"
No customer support at all. Flight rescheduled by Batik Air with no explanation, no further information. Booked and confirmed flight Melbourne to Bangkok with a layover in Denpasar on Nov 25. This morning I got email from Batik Air that my flight Melbourne - Denpasar has been rescheduled from Nov 25 to Nov 26. No word about connecting flight Denpasar - Bangkok. I sent email to [email protected] and got rejected several times with the message "The group customer_care only accepts messages from people in its organization or on its allowed senders list, and your email address isn't on the list. Even I registered my email and got booking confirmation on it, "my email is not on their list". Then I tried so called "24 hrs support whatsapp chat" and no one responded, no support whatsoever. Then I called their phones in Melbourne and Brisbane airports. The numbers are not in use, not surprise. So, there is no way I can check if I will have the connecting flight at all. Or this is their way to make customers buying another ticket. Batik Air, never again.

### "not received any refund till date"
Not Verified |  My tickets booked with Batik air were cancelled by the airline due to COVID 19 restrictions in 2021. However, after several follow ups via email and phone calls, I have have not received any refund till date. They are extremely unprofessional and do not care about customer service at all.

### "deeply disappointed and hurt"
Our experience with Batik Air was terrible, and it left us deeply disappointed and hurt. The issues we faced haven't been fixed, and we're not sure who's responsible for treating us so badly during the flight. They didn't even apologize or say thanks, which was very rude. First, there was no warning about the flight delay, and we were left waiting in the boarding area without any information. The plane's air conditioning wasn't good, and it made the journey uncomfortable for our baby and us. To make things worse, they sprayed something unpleasant when we got off the plane. We can't find any way to talk to them or fix these problems. It's not just about getting money; we felt disrespected and taken for granted as passengers. When we wrote to Batik Air, they responded with generic sorry messages and flight rescheduling terms and conditions that didn't address our concerns. Our journey was supposed to be nice, but it turned into a nightmare. Originally, we planned to arrive in Bali at 11 am on October 8th, with a 3-hour flight, then a 2.30-hour layover in Kuala Lumpur, and finally a 1.30-hour flight to India. But Batik Air made us suffer for almost 20 hours, delaying our arrival in Chennai, India, until October 9th. This was the worst flight we've ever had, with long delays, poor communication, and not enough help for passengers.

### “Highly unprofessional”
Beware before booking! Hoping to get refund back! Last minute reschedule of flight by 1 day! October 2023 We were suppose to travel from BLR to KUL to DPS on 15th Oct 23:55PM IST. We got an email on 13th Oct 8:35 PM IST, that due to unavoidable reason, they are changing the flight date from 15th Oct to 16th Oct. I paid 7.5K extra to get baby bassinet and seats together on KUL to DPS flight separately. All the effort and planning is gone down the drain. We had to rebook new Singapore Airline so that our travel is not impacted due to this pathetic airline. They customer care seems so local as if this is getting run from a single room. They say they will email the e-ticket but then forget and then you to have call them and mail them multiple times to remind. Highly unprofessional. Just before the travel, we will be paying 3X to get on the right flight and also fighting with Batik Air to refund all our money. They caused us great inconvenience but I wonder if they will pay us anything. This all is done with a family traveler (1 infant and 5 year old) Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic Airline.

### "outstanding customer service"
I flew with Batik Air on October 9th, 2023, for the first time. I had a substantial amount of luggage, for which I purchased additional weight allowance, and I also desired extra legroom. Surprisingly, the additional costs were more reasonable compared to other airline. From my first encounter at the check-in counter at 4 am, I had the pleasure of experiencing exceptional customer service from Matthew. He went above and beyond to assist. The outstanding customer service continued throughout the entire journey. Everyone I encountered was incredibly friendly and had a smile on their face. My flight took me from Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur with a one-hour layover in Bali. I had pre-purchased meals, which were promptly delivered, and I spent most of the flight comfortably sleeping in my seat. Since this was a smaller aircraft, it did not have onboard entertainment. However, in today's era where almost everyone carries their own screens, this was not really a requirement. Upon landing in Kuala Lumpur and clearing immigration, I was pleased to find my two suitcases standing side by side in good condition beside the luggage carousel. Having not flown in years, I was initially skeptical about using this airline for the first time, but I am extremely glad that I did. I wanted to express my gratitude and leave a glowing review of my fantastic experience, extending my thanks to everyone, from the airport staff to the airplane crew.

### "I had no major problems with them"
I've flown recently with Batik Air (September 2023) and it was my first time with them. I had no major problems with them - just a couple of minor ones. Given that it is a low-cost carrier, similar to all low-cost carriers, it's plus, plus, plus, i.e. meals, drinks, preferred seats, etc. The reason why I chose this budget airline over Air Asia is because the cost of the ticket includes baggage allowance.. My flights were from Hong Kong to Colombo, via Kuala Lumpur, and back. The outbound layover was 2 hours, the inbound layover was 5 hours. On all 4 flights, there were no delays, no last minute changing of gates, no lost luggage, the cabin crew were fine, the ground staff were courteous, polite and helpful in all 3 countries. I asked for window seats all the way, and got 3 out of 4. The minor problems: firstly, only the Kuala Lumpur-Colombo leg had inflight entertainment. But they do not provide headphones. If you have your own, bravo! Secondly, seeing we can not bring drinks on board, bottles of water should be free. I did not have any meals on the plane, so can not comment on the quality of their food. Would I book Batik Air again? With their prices, for a short-haul flight, yes.

### "Over fours hours delayed"
Appalling. Only use if you absolutely have to do so. Over fours hours delayed as airline decided to use our aircraft for another route. And then decided to use the next aircraft for yet another route. No proper announcements and no renewed timings given.

### "fly Batik air for this route again"
Return trip from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was great. Though delayed by 30mins for return. Flight were smooth throughout. Came with a 20kg free luggage and 7kg carry on. Rates were lower compared to other budget flights. Will fly Batik air for this route again.

### "I don’t fit in the seat, I’m too wide"
I'm a larger man. I was told I could upgrade to business class at least 1 hour before flight, at check in 3 hours before flight I was told by your staff that the staff had gone home in charge of updates. I then get in the plane where I am right now. On board. In row f. Near the window, I don’t fit in the seat, I’m too wide. I ask flight attendants to upgrade me. They said they can not but no one is in business class, there is plenty of room. I’m very uncomfortable and will need to stand up all the way. I can never contact your company by phone. This is wrong. Not happy.

### "The crew looked fatigued"
The aircraft crew asked me to leave my carry on bags just at the entrance door of the aircraft. The reason they gave was because the cabins were full. Why on earth would I leave my carry on bag at the final minute? Why would they allow the other passengers to have multiple carry on baggage that would occupy my designated space. I insisted on taking my carry on bag with me. Some of the crew members gave me rolling eyes and said try your luck. Is that a humane way to treat your client? Later found out some cabins were still empty. When I asked a crew that I wanted to purchase some food from their menu, she asked me to go at the front where there's been the sell of food. The crew looked fatigued. I was sitting at the almost at bottom of the aircraft. I walked all the way up to the front to buy chicken biryani. They told me there was no Chicken biryani left. I purchased Jeera Rice with Vegetable. Later they sold chicken biryani to the man on my side.

### "I won't be flying Batik Air again"
The pilots were competent, the crew pleasant but that's about it. I won't be flying Batik Air again, even based on price. Issues I struck include: 1) Batik Air website allowing me to book a connecting flight had too short a transit time so I missed the connecting flight and the connecting flight was the last flight of the day. Batik Air rebooked me next day fee free, it took 20-30min of waiting time to process but would not cover accommodation, 2) maintenance inside the cabin wasn't up to standard including a toilet door that had a door lock latch that wouldn't operate, seats which reclined when you sat in them without locking in the upright position, 3) incorrect information at the Batik Air check-in desk in Sydney who said I did not need to collect my bag in Denpasar it was checked through to Lombok. It took another 1-2 hours to get back into the International Terminal and retrieve my bag, 4) food service was poor with only noodle, biscuits or chips and when ordering Coke it was poured from a 2lt bottle into a paper cup. The only payment method was Australian Dollars and they didn't have adequate change which meant I ended up paying $1 more than the list price rather than them saying out fault. 5) in Denpasar they don't use aerobridges, so relying on buses to get to the terminal adds time required between flights, besides the inconvenience of stairs, climate etc.

### "a nice and positive flight"
This is the first time I booked a flight with Batik Air. I read the reviews after I bought the ticket and before our flight, we where a little concerned.. however, this was not necessary. I had checked something incorrectly when purchasing the tickets and after sending an email, this was immediately picked up and arranged by the office service team. We were able to check in online and choose seats 12 hours in advance. Everyone was very friendly and helpful at check-in and baggage drop-off. Our flight left on time and was not delayed. The plane was clean and spacious. We had been given seats near the exit and had extra leg room. [we were lucky that the plane was not completely full and the seat next to us was free] During the flight the stewards were also very friendly and helpful. We even had some entertainment choices. The only thing that was strange is that if you are not allowed to bring water on the plane, they should hand out water instead of selling small bottles water. What is also very nice is that afterwards, after booking your tickets, you do not have to pay another 20-40 euros for 1 piece of checked baggage costs for 20kg. We had a nice and positive flight and experience.

### "outstanding unprofessionalism"
Award of the worst company ever. I had no choices to book a last minute Batik Air ticket from Bali to Maldives recently with a stop in Kuala Lumpur. As expected, another time I got flight rescheduled! This is the 3rd time in a year I book a flight for my work and always got delayed / rescheduled / cancelled with Batik. Please do something! You’re making people lose time, energy and money with your outstanding unprofessionalism!

### "Gate changed 15 minutes before take-off"
Not Verified |  Gate changed 15 minutes before take-off, so all the passengers redid the security check. After we enter the gate, we waited about 30 minutes for the take-off. The flight was delayed for an hour.

### "Worst airline service ever"
Worst airline service ever. They will not provide any information on the travel requirements (such as transit visa requirement) even customer would have reached out to them they'll not be providing any information and if you could not be able onboard to aircraft due to the transit visa requirement they are not even ready to provide a refund or option for an alternative ticket. Such a pathetic service from the airline and the customer care service team.

### "worst airline I have ever traveled"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever traveled. Delayed, no internet, no entertainment. Food menu in front of us nothing available for an international flight. The tray was sticked with a tape which was opening regularly hit my partner’s head when she was sleeping on my lap

### "Stay away from them"
I flew Batik tree times this year and had many problems every time. Just consider delays as normal, they always wait for every other airplane in connection so you can easily expect hours of delays, just relax and enjoy your waiting. They board the aircraft and they just leave you there waiting for a lot of time, if you want some water of course you have to pay, like it’s normal to keep you for hours on the ground inside a plane with air conditioning not working. Do not pre-book meals, just eat something before boarding. First time they change the food I ordered with a different meal (not caring about food restrictions), second time they didn’t even sent the food, there was a miscommunication. The ground staff is very unprepared, every problem you have they say they can’t fix it but you can open a compliant, like it makes something. Batik is for sure the worst airline company I’ve ever tried. Stay away from them!

### "delay is part of the culture"
Not Verified |  I flew to Melbourne from Jakarta via Denpasar. The schedule was to have 3 hours transit time in Denpasar. Unfortunately the flight from Jakarta was delayed for 3 hours ground crews were not very helpful, they did not properly annouce when the air plane would depart. This airline is just the same with its group airlines, delay is part of the culture.

### "Do not fly Batik unless you have free time"
Not Verified | I chose 12:05pm to fly back to KL for a reason, and at my boarding time, I was told that the 12:15pm flight would board first - no explanation. When I insisted they said because the flight would be arriving late - no announcement. I think a regularly delayed airline is disrespecting their passengers, travelling is already a stress event to have them delayed EACH time (my flight from KL to Bali on 31 Jul was also delayed) is irresponsible. At least as a courtesy, you can announce it so we can let people know and the disruption of time is not extended to our family or colleagues expecting us at the other end. Do not fly Batik Air unless you have much free time

### "staff were also rude and uncourteous"
I have been flying for more then 20 years . This is one of the first flights that sells water in the aircraft. They should find some better ways to earn money then through this inhuman practice. First they ask passengers to empty the water bottle due to security reasons and then they ask for money in the aircraft. There was an inflight service in the Kuala Lumpur to Bali leg, when I asked for headphones, they refused. Why were they providing such services when we could not use it. The staff were also rude and uncourteous. I feel such airlines should be disallowed from operating.

### "the crew did an amazing job"
So my entire family of 11 members was flying back where my uncle suddenly fell ill and the crew did an amazing job in making him feel comfortable. They gave him blankets, medicine and even hot coffee. Further gave my aunt and sister a different place to sit so that my uncle can sleep and rest. Special thanks to Aira for the extra help. In general the entire crew of OD208 did an amazing job!

### "reputation for non-reliability"
Batik Air has a reputation for non-reliability as far as punctuality is concern, worst experience this time though. Flying in from Singapore to KL on 16th Jul 2023 was also delayed because of my arrival into KL. On the 19th Jul 2023, heading back also turned out to be a disappointment as the flight OD 807 was delayed by 1 hr 45 min.

### "Such a disappointment"
If you're thinking of flying Batik Air, you may want to reconsider the fact that their plane can have malfunction AC mid flight, and tell you to deal with it. On the 7/7/2023, between Singapore to Indonesia, AC was faulty. Every passenger was sweating throughout the trip with select individuals hyperventilating from the heat, and nothing else was offered for the fares we paid for adequate serviced planes that is supposed to be operationally ready for their customers. Have contacted customer support, and they refuse to make amends for passengers that had to endure this tiresome 2hr journey without proper air conditioning. Such a disappointment.

### "Late flight, late baggage"
The worst airline. Late flight, late baggage. Disgusting food onboard. Simply worst experience. In flight entertainment was not working.

### "Poor inflight service"
Not Verified |  No entertainment, left 2 hours late, lost my luggage for 4 days. Poor inflight service and on customer service when returned home even with numerous emails and documents relating to problems.

### "we had missed the check-in period"
Arrived at the airport at 6:45am for an 8:30 am flight- used grab to select the terminal however the driver took us to terminal 2 instead of 1. We waited 20 minutes for airport bus and only arrived at checking at 7:45. Was informed by the airline that we had missed the check-in period. We then asked if we could fly and our bags could be checked into another flight to which the representative said that bags have to fly with their passengers. The representative was not helpful and no alternatives were offered or assistance was given.

### "Last time buying anything from Batik Ai"
E Check in and Airport booth check in closed at 1:15 mark before departure, makes you join a long long queue which will cause you to miss the one hour close before departure. After queuing, plenty of time for boarding the plane with no check in luggage (50 minutes before departure), just needing the ticket, and Ground staff flat out refused to help. It seems as if they do not want you to board at all. Last time buying anything from Batik Air / Malindo Air / Lion Air, no matter how cheap the tickets are.

### "will never use them again"
We flew Malindo Air in June 2019 & it was a terrific airline. Little did I know it it is nothing like that now it is Batik Air (although our tickets said operated by Malindo Air). There was 5 of us flying, I originally booked for 4 & then added an extra person 1 month later, (still several months before we were due to fly). I called the airline to add the passenger to our other booking & was on hold for over an hour. Then I advised that since we were flying together could we be seated together, they said chose seats online. Works out they want you to pay $14.90 per seat to chose any basic seat. I advised that we didn't care where we sat, just as long as we were seated together. They said they couldn't allocate the seating until closer to the date, but would link our 2 bookings. So when seats were allocated we were surprised they weren't together. They did link our bookings, but then sat 1 person 21 rows away from the rest of us. And when I tried to call to have the allocated seats changes (after another hour + on hold) I was told they couldn't help, but check in would sort it. So 1 person sat at the other end of the plane. No food or drinks are given and they run out of food & drinks quickly. They refused to serve any tea or coffee, saying we had to wait until the seat belt light went off. It never did. There is also no inflight entertainment. So charge & download something to your device prior to boarding. Then only maybe half the baggage came out, with passengers checking other carousels trying to find their missing baggage. Approx. 15 minutes later suddenly the rest of the baggage final started coming out. Worst airline ever. We are all dreading our return flight & will never use them again.

### "confusion surrounding the layover"
Not Verified |  One of the primary concerns relates to the confusion surrounding the layover at Bali. We had confirmed not once, but three times, that my elderly parents, who are not fluent in English, did not need to disembark the plane during the layover. However, to our dismay, they were taken off the aircraft and instructed to obtain new boarding passes and seats. This unnecessary inconvenience caused distress to my parents, who were already facing language barriers and challenges navigating the airport environment. Furthermore, there was frequent changes in flight details were incredibly frustrating. The flight timings, transit arrangements, and layover duration were altered multiple times, causing significant confusion and inconvenience. Such unpredictability is challenging for all the elderly passengers unfamiliar with English and relying on clear communication and consistent schedules.

### "my experience was very good"
Not Verified |  My experience was amazing with Batik Air, flight was on time and staff were very helpful and answering all the questions. Our luggage were delivered in good condition and no delay in flight time. I guess I wouldn’t go for this airline again given all the bad reviews but just wanted to share that my experience was very good with them.

### "experience is not heinously bad"
Yogyakarta to Jakarta. Not the strongest of all starts for this flight as it was delayed by 35 minutes, causing me to feel anxious and panicked as this would mean missing my connection to Bangkok and eventually to Tokyo. The ground staff at Yogyakarta refused to rebook me to an earlier flight, but they kept their promises that my flight will leave before 3 in the afternoon, which is a good thing. The seat was comfortable for a 50-minute hop, and because I was assigned an emergency exit seat, more legroom is guaranteed. Crews were just okay; not rude but also not too friendly. Light meals were served for this 50-minute flight, which consisted of bread and a bottle of water. The biggest letdown was the in-flight entertainment - it used a system produced by an already bankrupt company that lacked content although it won in terms of responsiveness and layout. Their advertised Wi-Fi system did not work at all on my flight as the app kept on crashing and hanging. However, since this is only a 50-minute flight, I could not complain much. There are improvements to be made, especially in on-time performance and their in-flight entertainment, but aside from that, my experience is not heinously bad by any means.

### "a slow and painful process"
Twice delayed using this airlines. Delay was at midnight making it more difficult to secure an Uber. No boarding pass printing kiosk, need to queue with those who dropping their baggage. No separate counters. Making it a slow and painful process.

### "3 weeks to speak to someone"
Not Verified |  Old plane that was dirty and had broken seats. No option to checkin online. Return flight was cancelled and then 3 days after I returned home I received an email to say the flight had been rescheduled. Takes 60 days to receive a refund. Customer email doesn’t work. Took me 3 weeks to speak to someone.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  My first fly with this lousy airline, last minute flight delay 1st time 1hour 45 minutes, 2 announcement say 2 hours 15 minutes, boarding gate changed 16,18, now last 17 still don't know yet. We choose budget airline to save some cost, but after delay like this more money need to spend at destination place for pay car rental extra money for delay. Very disappointed, not recommended.

### "don't provide pillows or blankets"
Not Verified | Worst experience for an international flight. No food or drink is provided you have to purchase it. Aircon is high and they don't provide pillows or blankets.

### "lets try to be human beings"
I checked in and tried to reach boarding gate but lost my way so i return to check in counter. Sad to say got no help from staff at thw counter so i missed my flight. I hope other senior citizen gets assistance, lets try to be human beings. You will grow old too remember.

### "worst airline experience ever"
The worst airline experience ever. I will never fly with them again. 2 hours of delay on first flights, as there was no engineer available to sign the approval for landing, very uncomfortable seats, they ran out of toilet paper in both flights, in the first they didn't have even tissues, you need to pay for everything, even for a glass of water!!! This is egregious as airport security usually don't allow water to be carried on-board on many international flights. They don't offer anything for free and even the options for purchase are very limited and expensive. Cup noodles to eat, and water, coffee, tea, Milo (with hot water) and two options of warm soda. One bag of tea is AU$4!!!! As it was a night flight and it got very cold, I asked for a blanket and had to pay AU$9 for a piece of flannel. Needless to say that there was no entertainment system available. The absolute worst. Do not recommend to anyone.

### "bad and unnecessary experience"
Not Verified |  We came with our 10 Month old daughter. Staff at counter did not want to accept our Childs Passport. She said we need a visa for the baby. We told her several times that we double checked that it is the right passport and that we already entered Thailand and Malaysia with it. She asked her Boss and both refused to take us. We tried to talk to the manager that day. He didn't really talk to us. Also he told us we can't fly. They told us the passport has to be valid for Minimum one year. We had to discuss about two hours and nearly missed the flight. At the end the manager let us sign a paper we didn't even know what we signed because he did not talk to us. He let us board but we had to run and didn't know why at the end we we're allowed to fly. In Singapore everything was fine. So we are very angry with Batik Air for this bad and unnecessary experience. Plane was in good condition and staff in plane was very nice

### "disorganized and chaotic"
The check-in was extremely disorganized and chaotic. All the destinations were lumped together, resulting in people yelling, changing queues, etc. Several customers missed their flights, which could have been avoided if the airline had organized the check in counters by say, Langkawi, Singapore, Bali etc. but the airplane itself was clean and the crew was courteous.

### "never recommend this flight"
Not Verified |  The flight is mostly delayed and not on time. I had travelled in this flight from Bangalore to Malaysia and then Bali, and the same way back. Comfort level on the flight is also not up to the mark. Crew members don't attend issues the right way, take a lot of time to deliver food, especially if you get the seats around 20 and beyond. I would never recommend this flight. Not a smooth journey overall.

### "the worst airline I have travelled"
They change your scheduled flight even after their current flight is still active. They don't care about the connecting flight timings. They twice did that and i had to call and get us back on original flight. Even on the day we had to travel our flight was delayed and we barely catched next one. They do not provide water or food even on 5 hr international flight. Forget providing liqour. You have to buy it all in Malaysian Ringgit. If you buy in dollar they charge you more. Their swiping machine doesn't work most times. They don't even care to carry enough food to feed people even if they are willing to buy their severely overpriced food. Staff is very very rude. No headphones are provided even if the flight has entertainment screens. Nothing to cover yourself even if you are feeling cold. This has to be the worst airline I have travelled.

### "cabin crew were kind and helpful"
I flew with Malindo Air / Batik Air twice during my trip in Malaysia: - one in a domestic flight between Malacca and Penang (the airplane was an ATR) - one from Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo (the airplane was a Boeing 737-800). In both cases, everything went perfectly well: there was almost no queue for checking-in and dropping my checked luggage (it's worth noting that a checked luggage is included even in the cheapest prices, BTW), the airplanes were in perfect condition (they actually looked almost new), the space for legs was OK (even during the domestic flight, it was definitely wider than in the Air Asia domestic I also took during that trip). Almost all of the cabin crew were kind and helpful (and also elegant), and during the long haul flight there was even an individual screen (which is not the case on Scoot, for instance). Also, their prices were very competitive, even when booking hardly a few days before departure. The only negative things I noticed are: - their onboard menu was very limited, both for food and for drinks. It would be great to have more choices, - they didn't offer a Wifi option (even on long haul flights). Based on the other reviews I can read here, things can be hectic if there is any problem (rescheduled flight or canceled flight...), but if it's not the case then flying with them is a breeze and the price / quality ratio is great.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Worst airline I have flown in 40 years. This experience taught me a massive lesson in the pitfalls of saving a few bucks on a budget airline. Only about half the app functions worked. There was no notification given that we would have to pre-purchase meals 24 hours in advance. And they would not even give us free water - we had to pay for bottles. Then half way through the food “service”, their eftpos machine broke and they would only accept cash. At one stage, they said they couldn’t provide change. The check in process was a mess, and took over an hour. The whole time we were waiting to check in, there was another customer screaming at the (I use this term loosely) “customer service” staff about his lost booking. Staff were standoffish, vague and at times rude. Pathetic excuse for an airline.

### "airline needs to change many things"
When traveling with such airlines you know you cannot expect much. No high-quality service but at least the standard. Well...not with Batik I guess! To begin with, online check-in was not functional but that is not an issue. The check-in process in the counter was smooth. By the way, the airport in Bali is top class! When boarded the plane, it took literally 1.5 hour to complete boarding! They boarded people in groups every now and then. No announcements, no information, only some rumours from the flight attendants that the check-in system was broken. After departing with a 90 minute delay, and while there was no reference from the pilot and not even a typical apology, the flight service was also a delight. No surprise, you had to pay for everything on the plane but at least they should be accepting cards. It seems that Batik is an old fashioned merchant who asks only for cash and gives no receipts. The entertainment system is just typical. A collection of 10-20 movies, most of which were Indonesian, the rest mainly from Bollywood and a couple of Hollywood movies which I have never heard of. If you attempt to read the airline magazine you need to know how to read in Indonesian. No English. The same with many signs and guidelines in the aircraft. Very few were in both languages. The crew was not rude, but not polite either. It was always that awkward situation where they go only by the book when announcing things or when taking actions. When we finally landed, we were asked to stay in the aircraft for another 30 minutes for no obvious reason. Overall, the airline needs to change many things to become at least a standard service provider. I should mention here that the ticket from Bali to Perth (one way) was not at all cheap.

### "attendant kept ignoring my requests"
I never write a review for any product or service but feel forced to this time around. I was massively dehydrated asked for water 3 to 4 times but was never served water by the attendant. After 2 hours or so, I was served water by another attendant. I had to pay to get a blanket and the attendant never returned me the change despite requesting twice. Only when the flight was about to land is when I reminded her again and that's when I got the 45 dollars I was owed. It didn't look like she was planning on giving me the change had I not reminded her again. The attendant kept ignoring my requests and constantly asked me to wait.

### "Worst flight and crew ever"
Worst flight and crew ever. We booked flight from Semarang to Jakarta at 4.30 pm and we try to check in via web a day before. But we couldn't and pop up message show there is an error in our booking. We also try to reach the Customer Service but there is no response. Later on we got the info from our colleague that our flight was moved to another flight which 5 hour earlier than our booking, without notice. We have to rushed our check out from hotel so we could catch up the flight. But what happened later more surprisingly, we got the information that our flight was delayed about an hour. What else, after we board, we knew that our cabin wasn't available because already full with another passenger luggage. And what the crew do? Nothing, they just moved our luggage into baggage without confirmation. This is the last time we used Batik Air and also another airline from Lion Group.

### "Journey was pleasant"
Best part was the leg space between seats, planes were new & clean. Airline ground staff at Lahore airport was very courteous & professional, went out of the way to accommodate family with kids. Air hostesses were smiling & helpful. Food  quality was up  to the mark, served hot. Journey was pleasant.

### "surprised to see that are flight was cancelled"
Not Verified | I had a fine experience with Batik Air when going to Labuan Bajo, the landing wasn't the best but it was okay. When finishing are weekend and going to the airport on Sunday evening was it our surprised to see that are flight was cancelled. I got no mail or message from them telling me that my flight was cancelled. I can confirm that they had my Indonesian number and email address since they send my on both a message to confirm my flight and check in time on Thursday. So they had all my information, but now they are telling me that they have another number and e-mail address which is why I got no information. I get no compensation or no help to find a hotel around. Their system was wrong by sending the mail and message to the wrong message but they are making me believe that it is mine. Don’t trust Batik Air and always check your flight because they easily cancelled their flight!

### "Really bad Service"
This is my 1st time using Batik Air with Business Class. From Jakarta to Perth, transit at Bali. Really bad Service. At Jakarta the Lounge was so disappointed, the food is bland and cold, the soup pot lid were broken and they use like aluminum foil cover with tape, and the toilet was so dirty. Arrived at Bali the thing getting worse, they take Economy Class passenger at the Business Class counter, me and another 2 passenger end up standing about 45 minutes, until the passenger behind me go to complain and finally we can get our turn. Next, there's no Batik Air Lounge at Bali Airport, you gotta be kidding me!! !

### "don't book a flight with Batik Air"
My flight OD178 from MEL to DPS was cancelled because of technical issues with the plane when all passengers were waiting at the gate for boarding. The agent at Melbourne airport promised that I will be reimbursed for all costs that result from this, including hotel, meals and transfer and that I would automatically be booked on a flight the next day and that information will follow via email. For this reason, I decided not to go for the option of claiming a refund and booking a different flight. Well, I did not receive any information that day about when I would be flying. Also the service hotline was not picking my call until I gave up after more than 2 hours waiting on the line. I just went to the airport again the next morning and ended up flying with the same plane I was supposed to be on the morning before. I arrived at my destination 24 hours late. Costs for another night in Melbourne etc. resulted and I handed in all invoices to the Customer Care service email address that was mentioned on the flight cancellation letter I got at the airport. And now they are telling me that their terms and conditions state "Malindo Air reserves the right to cancel or change the planned departure, schedule, route, aircraft or stopping places of any flight for which fares have been paid, at any time and from time to time, for any reason, without notice to any Passengers affected thereby and, in connection therewith, the Carrier shall not be liable to any Passenger in respect of such cancellation or change, whether or not resulting from an Event of Force Majeure which includes but not limited to bad weather and Acts of God. If their agent on the airport would not have lied to me, I could at least have saved a few hundred bucks!!!! Customer Service only replies within more than a week not being a help at all. I'll probably end up loosing 500 Euros. Do yourself a favor and don't book a flight with Malindo Air or Batik Air or whatever they will call themselves in future.

### "I haven’t received my bag"
I had bought extra 15kg bag when I bought my ticket. However, in Melbourne they couldn’t check in my bags so they did manual checked in from Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu. I haven’t received my bag and it’s been 4 days. I am never flying with this airline. I keep on calling airport but no help till yet. This has just ruined my start of holidays.

### "no access to lounges in Jakarta"
The Business class passenger has no access to lounges in Jakarta for international flights. So they have to wait like the rest of the economy class passengers. The flight was delayed by 1 and half hours and no announcement was made. We only got to know when we went to the staff to inquire. There is no way in hell you can manage your booking online, so once you booked and paid you are at the mercy of their Customer Service which doesn't care.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. The website doesn’t work properly, manage booking or check in or change bag allowance. Planes are never on time. They’re too cheap to pay for the airbridge, so you have to board via bus. When I arrived at my destination all of my clothes inside suitcase are soaking wet. So they must’ve left my luggage in a huge puddle for quite a long time in order for that to happen. Baggage takes forever to come out. The food is terrible. And there are no monitors in the back of the seats for entertainment. It’s not worth saving the money to fly on this airline.

### "a terrible experience"
The worst airline to travel. The staff at airport, especially Amritsar airport the staff don't know any rules for traveling to a country and try to educate others needlessly. I didn't understand their policies, even food was requested on my ticket but i didn't get any food in a long flight. The attendants only served water in small glasses and left the person if he/she was asleep. No entertainment source used while flying. Overall, a terrible experience.

### "worst airline I've ever used"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I've ever used. Staff have problem with everything, what the passengers need. Once food is in the price of ticket, once you must paid extra. Nobody ask you, if you need something to drink or if you want a food You must buy a water and everything. Definitely last flight with Batik Air

### "I will not recommend Batik Air"
Not Verified |  Very bad service, first of all checkin time is rigidly maintained, from six 0'clock in the morning, don't show up before that. I bought a business class ticket and expected my luggage to get a priority label. They didn't, as I found out in Jakarta, after waiting for almost one hour for my luggage. In Solo you shall not pass, into the executive lounge, although also being a Garuda Platinum Member. The girl was quite adamant about that. But there are no first class planes form Solo, so who is going into this lounge? Family, friends? Checkin, together with economy class (pushing as always). No service personel detected at Soehatta. I will not recommend Batik Air.

### "never flying with this company again"
Flight makes 1h30min of delay before departure without any email notice. Flight attendants were impolite and giving orders instead of asking politely. During flight when i asked if they had a food menu, i was told they did not have food anymore. When my husband asked, they told him they had noodles. We couldn't pay for water as we only had our bank cards (which they didn't take) and money in euros which they also don't take!). My husband needed his meds and although i have nicely asked for a free cup they did not give me one. When we landed we were without explanation for 15 minutes or so in the plane for no logical reason. I am never flying with this company again.

### "Moved flight three times"
Worst airline. Moved flight three times with no regard to connecting flights, visa expiry, personal need to arrive on the day. Not flight delays, complete three times date changes on the flights. We regret to inform you that your flight has been changed to xx date? Never seen this happen before. - Customer care doesn't pick phone, nor replies to mails. - Cannot cancel online. - Extremely rude staff at Subang airport when you go to their counter. They keep shuttling you from one point to another point. No answers, no responsibility.

### "Do not recommend to anyone"
The worst airline experience ever. I will never fly with them again. 2 hours of delay on first flights, as there was no engineer available to sign the approval for landing, very uncomfortable seats, they ran out of toilet paper in both flights, in the first they didn't have even tissues, you need to pay for everything, even for a glass of water. This is egregious as airport security usually don't allow water to be carried on-board on many international flights. They don't offer anything for free and even the options for purchase are very limited and expensive. Cup noodles to eat, and water, coffee, tea, Milo (with hot water) and two options of warm soda. One bag of tea is AU$4.As it was a night flight and it got very cold, I asked for a blanket and had to pay AU$9 for a piece of flannel. Needless to say that there was no entertainment system available. The absolute worst. Do not recommend to anyone.

### "flight seats were average"
Not Verified |  I flew Batik from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and my flight was delayed by 3 hours. Being a full service carrier, Batik offered no onboard beverage or meal service. The flight seats were average, and the crew were courteous. No inflight entertainment.

### "when food received it was trash"
Not Verified |  Previously food was given free and quality was very good and tasty, now food must be purchased. Further purchase food are sucks and very small portion. When order looks good, when food received it was trash. Picture deceiving. Look at attached Picture vs Real

### "for the price I paid, they impressed me"
Manado to Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta onboard ID6281. Ground staff at both Manado and Jakarta were all friendly, communicative, and very courteous. At first, they announced that the flight will be delayed for 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting for only 10. Upon boarding the ex-Batik Air Malaysia plane, I was greeted by a somehow-cold cabin crew and a pretty hot cabin. Then, I figured out that my plane had no in-flight entertainment screens at all. I was about to be disappointed but it turned out that they offered Wi-Fi-based in-flight entertainment through the Tripper app, which was very sublime with never-seen-before options. The absence of the music selection was covered by e-magazines, vlogs, and podcast selections alongside TV shows, games, movies, and many more. Some lags still happened, but this was miles better than their old IFE system (I'm referring to the old ones installed in older A320s and 737s, not their newer PK-LU* A320s). The seat was good enough for a long flight like this. As the flight progressed, the cabin crews became even friendlier, communicative, and attentive, although they were not as friendly as on my previous Batik Air flight. They could have been friendlier by explaining the food that I had - which I assume was a delicious, nicely presented grilled chicken with sautéed beans and carrots and a chocolate muffin. Overall, for the price I paid, they impressed me in several aspects including their new Wi-Fi based in-flight entertainment, but they obviously still have several rooms for improvement.

### "not flying again with you guys"
Batik air has been the worst airline for me. The rule as per the Batik Air website states that you need to carry a certificate of fitness from the doctor in case you are pregnant for more than 28 weeks. Also double confirmed from customer care about the rules. However, to my surprise, when reached at the airport counter, the check in staff doesn't want to listen and started to point out at a board on her desk. When I asked that, if I am supposed to check the rules coming to airport every day, she said yes. Later when I called the customer care and asked again, the answer was same and handed over the phone to her supervisor to make him understand but still the staff, as mentioned earlier, made their own rule of getting check up done by airport doctor. The doctor just checked BP and oxygen level which assured him that my wife is fit to fly. Certainly, not flying again with you guys.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  I have flown 3 return trips with this airline this month. One trip was a business meeting in Jakarta, my 8am outbound was moved to 10amwhilst I was in the air the return was brought forward 2hrs from 16.30 to 14.30. Terrible customer service. When I tried to bring flight 6 forward to return early they attempted to charge me full price to downgrade from business to economy.

### "underhand business practices"
Sent many emails trying to cancel our flights as the trip was cancelled due to the pandemic. Batik Air ignored them all and even refused to acknowledge we did not take the flight or provide us with a no show letter for our insurance company. I am shocked by the appalling underhand business practices they use.

### "trying to get a refund"
Not Verified |  I was due to fly on 15th April 2020 with Batik Air, on the 13th March 2020 I received an email advising they cancelled the flights (note this was before the Australian COVID-19 Restriction were put in place). I have been trying to get a refund from the airline for nearly 2 months, they've disconnected their customer service line in Australia and every email I send is met with a generic response saying refunds may take up to 30 days (despite the fact it has been 52 days so far and I have yet to receive anything).

### "better options available"
I booked a roundtrip flight from Taipei to Jakarta. A few weeks after booking I received two emails stating the flights were canceled (no explanation why). I figured they would automatically refund my fare so I waited a bit, they did not refund my fare. I emailed their customer service twice and never received a response so I called the phone number listed on the Batik Air website, that phone number took me to Malindo Air who then gave me the phone number to Batik Air. Once I was able to speak with a customer service representative, I was told since I was canceling the flight I'd only receive a 90% refund. After explaining to her that the flight was canceled by the airline and that I felt I should not be penalized for a flight I didn't cancel, she told me it was company policy and I would only receive a 90% refund. Okay, silly, but I was over it, I just wanted some sort of a refund. She said the refund would be processed in 15-30 working days. She then told me I needed to provide the full credit card number I used for the original booking, even though she had it. I had an issue with this request for obvious security reasons, but complied and gave her the number. After providing my credit card number, I figured all was good and settled - wrong. I was then told I'd receive an email I needed to send them a copy of my Passport. Why I asked? She said it was company policy. One more questionable security violation, in my mind. Why do I need to provide them with the information they already have to refund an airline fare for a flight they canceled? Short story long, avoid Batik Air at all costs, there are better options available.

### "flight attendant is nice"
Makassar to Surabaya. Extremely long queue on Check-in Counter. The check-in counter staff working slow. Great boarding time, on time. The flight attendant is nice. The meal is good

### "Seat was very comfortable"
Denpasar to Jakarta. At gate was driven to the aircraft by van. Hand luggage taken onto the air by staff. Shown to my seat 2F by cabin crew. Seat was very comfortable and was asked if I would like juice or water. Once airborne the cabin crew handed out hot towels and headsets. Food was delicious served with bread roll entree dessert which were all delicious. Entertainment had a good variety also. Looking forward to flying them again.

### "Would fly with Batik again"
Sorong to Jakarta. I flew Batik Air from Jakarta to Sorong return. I had a great flight, Batik was on time in both directions, they were not pedantic about the luggage weight. They allow 20kg and I was over by 3kg (due to all the diving gear I was taking), and it wasn't questioned at all. I was very grateful for that, sometimes the airlines can be uncompromising in this area. I haven't anything negative to say about them. Would fly with Batik again.

### "Disappointing and very expensive flight"
Disappointing and very expensive flight with Batik this time. Not sure what is happening on the Perth to Bali route, but extra competition has recently come in with CitiLink starting the route with Airbus A320. Very surprised when my flight cost me close to $600AU for this time of year. Flight from Perth to Bali was fine, usual standard of service that I'm generally quite happy with. Return flight however was total opposite. People were very late, people were juggled about in their seats. Basically crew were triple checking everything. As an ex pilot, I think that something was amiss with the weight and balance of the aircraft on that flight. Flight took off over 30 minutes late, lots of ground staff checking things. Strangest thing, a fairly healthy and young man was moved out of the exit row, because he was having some pain with a tattoo that had been recently done. Cabin crew moved a young woman into that seat, who quite honestly, would never have been able to remove that window if an emergency had occurred. Same on the other side, the men took zero notice of the briefing, but still the cabin crew just let it happen. Lastly, just a bit of a heads up for travellers, take into consideration what you expect to take as carry on. I'm all for the airlines charging a lot extra for this service. People take it too far. On my flight I'm surprised the overhead above me did not drop open. Have some consideration people! As for Batik cabin crew, you need to be more conscientious about how you move your passengers around.

### "still recommend the airline"
Jakarta to Lombok and Bali to Jakarta with Batik Air. Both flights are punctual and good. Both flights served with good food and friendly staff. Although the Entertainment needs to be improved with more content since the aircraft I’ve flown on both flights are operated by the plane with older IFE with limited Entertainment choices. But Luckily, I Played my games in my computer instead. Batik Air needs to improved more to compete with Garuda Indonesia and other full service carrier to be called as a real full service carrier. But I still recommend the airline.

### "a big step up from Lion"
Manokwari to Surabaya via Makassar. Checking in was chaotic with staff happily serving all those that jumped the queue and went straight to the front till I loudly protested them doing so twice. Flight left 20 minutes late due to check in not completed on time. Once on board things improved with decent entertainment and courteous crew. However headsets had to be purchased for money and the girl serving my row gave us a random meal while passengers in other rows could choose from two. Meal on the first leg if the flight was good though. On the 2nd leg it was just 2 cakes. Despite departing Makassar on time we somehow reached Surabaya half an hour late. Overall Batik is certainly a big step up from Lion but the crew needs more training.

### "attendants can't help me"
Jakarta to Denpasar. It's started from self check in, it was not very good. I can't print the boarding pass, and need to wait in long queue just to print the boarding pass. Inside the plane, i can't find the empty slot for my cabin baggage. All slot are full, the flight attendants can't help me so much. And i think, they didn't care with that. They just said to put under my seat, which i took that option and make my entire flight uncomfortable because lack of leg space. Despite all of that, their entertainment in flight is good, sensitive touchscreen and full of movie content.

### "it was a good experience"
Kupang to Jakarta. The check-in and boarding process was smooth and fast. The crew were kind and helpful. For in flight entertainment, the IFE was responsive although limited choice of new movie. The food was okay. The flight departed and arrived ahead of schedule which was good. Overall, it was a good experience.

### "have to pay for this hand carry"
Jakarta to Surabaya. The service from Batik Air is very bad, I always travel using the same hand carry luggage for the past 7 years, I have taken Citilink, Garuda and others. There have never been any problems. This time I was questioned, even though the size of the suitcase could still be put in the place they provided, but it still forced me to go back down to the check-in place to put this in as luggage. I have to pay for this hand carry as excess baggage with a very expensive amount. Staff cannot provide solid reasons, why this suitcase can be oversized while this suitcase is enough for hand carry. Pelayanan dari batik air sangat buruk, saya selalu travel menggunakan hand carry luggage yang sama selama 7 tahun belakangan ini, saya naik citilink, garuda dan lain nya tidak pernah ada masalah. Kali ini saya di permasalahkan, padahal size koper masih bisa di masukkan di tempat yang mereka sediakan, tetapi tetap memaksa saya untuk kembali turun ke tempat check in untuk memasukkan ini sebagai bagasi. Saya harus membayar handcarry ini sebagai bagasi berlebih dengan jumlah yang sangat mahal. Pelayan sangat disrespectful terhadap customer dan tidak bisa memberikan alasan yang solid, kenapa koper ini bisa kebesaran sementara koper ini cukup untuk hand carry

### "was a pleasant experience"
Jakarta to Singapore ID7155. The check in and boarding process was fast and the staff was kind and nice. The flight departed and arrived on time. The cabin crew was efficient and polite. The food for this flight was sandwich and muffin served in a box. Both food was quite good in taste. The in-flight entertainment for this flight was rather new and different from the previous domestic flight that I have with them. This IFE was better compared to their old one and it was responsive. The movie was somehow updated with some new selection. Overall, it was a pleasant experience with Batik Air.

### "flight attendant are nice"
Makassar to Jakarta in 2018. Great airline, clean cabin. The flight attendant are nice. But the check-in queue is very long, took a lot of time. The food taste good. Long wait for baggage.

### "flight attendant are nice"
Surabaya to Makassar. Finally, a flight for home, and i choose this airline, Great ground staff. Clean cabin. The flight attendant are nice. Crowded flight. Great take off, and good landing. no delay.

### "No Entertainment and no meal"
The fare was almost double the budget carriers. It advertises an inclusive meal and onboard video entertainment. The trip from Jambi to Jakarta was expected, however the meal was simply a bread roll snack. Not unexpected on the short leg. The next leg however was late, almost 50 minutes and obviously a replacement due to the change of gate. The aircraft appeared older and the onboard entertainment system not working. The meal was simply a bread roll, however this time it had what appeared to be a small sausage inside it. Hardly a meal! Late, No Entertainment system and no meal.

### "never fly with them again"
Worst airline that I ever had to fly with. I was connecting from Dubai to Denpasar via Jakarta. There was a one hour connecting time and my flight got delayed but I did arrive at the check in desk 28 minutes before the flight. They won't let me check in because the counter closes 30 minutes before departure. Then they won't refund my ticket, and they won't admit it was their mistake. I asked to speak to the staff and was denied, I asked to speak to a manager and was denied. I felt scammed by an airline. The reason this whole ordeal happened is that on their website, they claim that you can do an online check in for your flight, which was the premise on which I bought a flight with an hour connecting time. However, I tried to do the online check in but kept getting a system error. I tried to do so 2 days before my flight, 1 day before my flight, and 11 hours before my flight and kept getting the same error. I finally discovered why I had this problem. This is an airline with two online check in websites, both are legitimate and active, one works and the other does not. If you type batik air online check in on google, you will arrive at this website (https://www.batikair.com/en/Checkin), which does not work. The one that actually works is (https://checkin.batikair.com/dx/IDCI/#/check-in/start?locale=en-US) In conclusion, do not fly with this airline unless you have absolutely no other choice. It's a scam. And in case they miss up, as with the above, they won't admit it and you will lose every single penny you paid them. Will never fly with them again.

### "my airline of choice"
Another good flight with Batik. I go backwards and forwards between Perth and Denpasar quite often, and Batik is still my airline of choice for this route. In both instances, flights were on time. Was allocated an exit row on both legs (thank you) so was very comfortable, even though on the way home the aircraft was full. Cabin crew very helpful and attentive, especially on the way home, given that the flight was more or less a 'red eye'. Seats are a little uncomfortable in the lumbar area, could probably do with some extra padding, but can be ignored for a flight of this duration. Seat back in front of me was a little bit on the dirty side, nothing too bad. A lot of passengers seem to miss the fact though that this is not the airlines responsibility; it is down to the ground handlers who clean the aircraft during turnaround and down time. Still a nice baggage allowance with Batik as well. I sincerely hope that they continue to maintain their operations on this route. Will be more than happy to fly Batik Air again.

### "Take alternatives if possible"
Not Verified |  Labuan Bajo to Jakarta. Cancellation with no prior notice and terrible support. At checkin we were told the flight is canceled and we can go the following day. Only we had a connecting flight from Jakarta. Only solution they came up with was to give us a refund (not even total, because it is their policy not to refund fees!) and have us book a garuda flight ourselves, which was obviously more expensive due to short notice. Stupid procedures and very unreliable. In a previous flight they have lost our luggage for a couple of days of uncertainty. Take alternatives if possible!

### "our flight was canceled"
Lombok to Jakarta. Terrible airline but can’t say as I didn't actually fly them. This is because our flight was canceled without notice. After significant hassle we were put on Lion Air (which was not a favorable experience). I asked ground crew if they notified passengers of cancellation and they said “some of them”. Horrible service. Never fly with them.

### "experience has been above average"
Surabaya to Jakarta. We arrived at the airport extremely early, but didn't have to wait for check-in to open since Batik air had a counter for all flights, check-in went smoothly and quick. The departure domestic terminal at Juanda was average but had the basic essentials like a clean toilet and plenty of restaurants, we soon boarded our A320 aircraft with really friendly and warm staff, got to my seat, which was a window seat. I was honestly surprised that our aircraft had an IFE on this short flight. We departed on time and meal service soon started, a complimentary meal/snack was served. On this flight, we got a Banana bread and water. The IFE on this flight was really good and up to date, had plenty of movies, however, remember to bring your own ear-phones since they are not provided on this flight. The crew on this flight were really nice and friendly, they kept checking on the cabin and offering water. We landed on time. Overall my experience with Batik air has been above average, I would not hesitate to book with them again, probably my favorite airline in Indonesia, hopefully, they keep expanding and one day become an international airline.

### "Warm and hospitality"
Yogyakarta to Jakarta. This airline gives good service, while checking-in all staff were helpful and friendly. Warm and hospitality starting from the ground next to the air and back to the ground. Passenger service assistance staff will always guide us.

### "customer service is a disaster"
Booked domestic flights from Jakarta to Sorong and back at Batik Air online through their website. Because of a family emergency, I had to cancel the flights at short notice. Several attempts at the specified e-mail addresses or also via the Singapore call center failed: 1 e-mail address was obviously no longer valid, there was no answer to another, another call was sent to me in a batic mailbox. Air call center in Singapore referenced. In my telephone attempts (not exactly cheap from Switzerland and because of time shift cumbersome) I either reached a non-competent person or stuck in the queue. Overall, the customer service at Batik Air, at least as far as communication is concerned, is a disaster. Anyway, I will not try to book with this airline. DE: Hatte bei Batic Air online über ihre Webseite für Januar 2019 Inlandflüge von Jakarta nach Sorong und retour gebucht. Wegen eines familiären Notfalls musste ich die Flüge kurzfristig stornieren. Mehrere Versuche über die angegebenen E-Mail-Adressen oder auch via Call-Center Singapur schlugen fehl: 1 E-Mail-Adresse war offensichtlich nicht mehr gültig, auf eine andere gab es keine Antwort, bei einer weiteren wurde mir Anruf in einem Batic-Air-Call-Center in Singapur verwiesen. Bei meinen telefonischen Versuchen (nicht gerade billig von der Schweiz aus und wegen Zeitverschiebung umständlich) gelangte ich entweder an eine nicht zuständige Person oder blieb in der Warteschlange stecken. Insgesamt ist der Kundenservice bei Batic Air, zumindest was die Kommunikation angeht, eine Katastrophe. Ich werde jedenfalls keinen Versuch mehr machen, bei dieser Fluggesellschaft zu buchen.

### "Batik is very good value"
Jakarta to Jayapura. Comfortable flight with decent food and a good selection of movies. The only minor problem was that headsets were not provided and had to be purchased from crew for 25.000 Rp. With the fare very similar to no-frills Lion Air, part of the same group, Batik is very good value.

### "recommend the Business class"
Makassar to Jakarta. The flight is fine, the staff is very friendly and the food is ok. Flying with Batik is a hit or miss because on my flight the IFE is said to be out of service, and the power outlet wasn't working. So it's a pretty boring flight. But for the Business class, it's on the cheaper side so I can recommend the Business class.

### "Don't fly Batik Air"
Pekanbaru to Jakarta. Don't fly Batik Air. Starting from the ground service it is the worst. Actually we got no choice as we ran out seat of Garuda Indonesia . The boarding process is the worst out there , there were no specific boarding call for business class passenger, passenger with kids etc . The plane is quite a new A320. At least we took off on time but landed a bit off schedule due to traffic congestion at Jakarta . The service was quite friendly , it offers you a snack box consisting of a pizza bread and a muffin which is surprisingly , quite tasty. There were no hot drinks or soft drinks service as they told us bad weather, however during most of the flight, the weather is pretty fine except when we were about to land in Jakarta. Back to the seat , to my surprise again, the aircraft is equipped with Inflight Entertainment. However the selection is really bad though the screen is very responsive. The seat is also hard unlike Garuda Indonesia which the seat is so much better than Batik. Pricing wise, the ticket is also an overpriced $160 Sing dollar. With that amount of money, I could have flown Silk Air to some parts of Indonesia otherwise. Please think twice before you book a Batik Air flight.

### "still good value"
Jakarta to Jayapura via Makassar. Comfortable seats and good selection of movies, though no free headsets provided. Food quite basic, with only a glass of water for drink. Overall, still good value.

### "still hope that they can improve"
Jakarta to Surabaya. I travelled with Batik Air for more than 10 times for business trip and this one supposed to be a premium version of the sister, Lion Air. It's not as good as you think it will be. Let's say from 10 flights with Batik Air, 2-3 were delayed, and 1-2 flights without in-flight entertainment. The seat is quite comfortable, bread & water is good enough and cabin crew service is okay. I personally feeling okay to take this for domestic flights but still hope that they can improve the flight experience.

### "you will be disappointed"
Jakarta to Singapore in business class. The planes are new. Pilots seem reasonable competent, but service and food? Not even close. To fly from Sorong to Singapore, all on Batik, it will have taken me more than 30 hours. Plane was late in Sorong by more than one hour and then the ground staff couldn’t figure out how to speed up the passenger loading so we were another 45 minutes. We didn’t make up time in the air or in Makassar so were late to Jakarta and I missed the connection. To be fair the staff picked me up at the plane and made an effort to catch the flight, but we only had 7 minutes so it was wasted effort. We ended up at the customer service. While pleasant, no one spoke English, which was not really their fault but given they serve international customers, I would have thought English speaking was a requirement. After two hours I finally got my luggage and a car to take me to a local transit hotel, the Ibis. There are two at the airport, the Budget and Styles. They put me in styles. I would give the hotel less than 1 star. I left and paid for my own room at Ibis styles. Really, for business class, they use a very low quality hotel? They don’t even put their crew there. They were at styles! I was picked up at the hotel on time in they hotel car, as mentioned, part of Lion Group, they wanted to take me to terminal 3, which was the wrong terminal and then dropped me off at the wrong side of the terminal. Again, not a huge deal for a budget carrier, but if you think you are going to compete with Garuda, not even close. I will avoid Batik if there are other better airline options. Fortunately, today is Tuesday and my next flight is not till Saturday. I have not done a review of an airline before, but I knew little about the airline. I feel that I experienced quite a number of facets about the airline and it is clear what they can and cannot do. If you have to be somewhere or have tight connections, or expect major airline quality, you will be disappointed. If you expect Budget plus, then you will be satisfied.

### "No frills in business class"
Not Verified |  Bali to Perth. No frills in business class apart from more leg room and wider seat. No choice of meals or drink. Economy passengers using overhead lockers for their luggage and would stand in business class going to the lockers and while waiting to use the front toilet most annoying for crew to get meal service. Why pay for this class when you get the same in economy. No lounge access in Bali.

### "Delay after delay"
Not Verified |  Manado to Jakarta. Delay after delay, plane left two hours before time so we had to wait 6 hours, we already booked a hotel but couldn't use it because of our delay. On our way back the plane was one hour delayed, we missed our transfer to Istanbul. We had to pay for other tickets and had also to stay two more days in Jakarta instead of going home. We made a lot of costs, I sent a lot of mails to Batik air but don't get an answer.

### "will never fly Batik Air again"
Denpasar to Perth. No inflight entertainment at all. Food was the worst I have tasted. From 21st June 2018 it is to be a full service flight. Only water and Pepsi were available and both were warm. Staff speak very little English. The plane wasn't cleaned before boarding. The only complement I can give Batik Air is the leg room. We will never fly Batik Air again.

### "food was just edible"
Perth to Denpasar. Checkin at Perth airport was fast and friendly. Business class passengers are invited to use the Qantas Lounge. A simple breakfast was available. Boarding called after the Queues had reduced so no waiting. On boarding friendly welcome but not shown to seat. Offered pre-takeoff juice. Departure was on time. After seat belt sign turned off, blankets and Sony headsets were offered for entertainment and meal service commenced choice of vegetables with rice or chicken with rice. Tray was presented with cut fresh fruit chocolate cake hot meal and a glass of water, metal cutlery provided, food was just edible. No coffee or tea service, apparently no milk available on board anyway. Meal trays were cleared away quickly. No further service offered. Entertainment was ok 18 English language movies plus a number of foreign language movies. Could not access music. No alcohol offered and not available only water juice and Pepsi were available. Call bells were answered in seconds, crew were smiling but not engaging. Indonesian arrival forms only provided after being asked. Seat comfort was excellent and although not lie flat the seat was fully adjustable. Arrival on time. Remote stand used a private mini bus for business class to terminal. Arrival formalities completed quickly and luggage appeared around half an hour after landing. Batik Air although marketed as full service and clearly they are not. They are priced lower than the other Indonesian carrier operating the same route.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
Flying from Kota Kinabalu to Jakarta with Batik Air, ticket was booked easily, but i could not do mobile check in so i had to make line up at counter check in. I sat at 11A which was at emergency exit windows so its really spacious. Breakfast served was fried rice and hot tea. Flight departed and arrived on time. I enjoyed the flight.

### "food inedible and unappetizing"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. No web check in allowed. E-ticket information provided and boarding pass PNR was different . Cold food was served on flight and was inedible and unappetizing, the only food edible was the cupcake. Aside than this no complaints on seat space, entertainment kit (at least most of the screens are functioning compared to Malindo Air.

### "Delays are unbearable"
Bali to Jakarta. Delays from this airline are unbearable. Passengers were not informed upon check-in. They are only informed when it’s supposed to be boarding. Airlines delays usually between 30 min to 1 hour. However, this airline delays may have to wait more than 2 hours without any assistance or compensation for the delays. Food provided on plane also not edible and I wouldn’t recommend to eat any of the food provided.

### "it is such a hassle"
First time flying with Batik Air from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta and it is such a hassle. You have to check in at the counter, since online check in is unavailable. During check-in at the counter, the queue is unorganized, which caused confusion. I needed at least 30 minutes to just to get checked-in. During the flight, the seat was okay and looked dull. The seat incline is the same as other low-cost airlines seat. During meal time, there are no options and I received pizza like bread and a muffin with a cup of mineral water. It is terrible.

### "food was not that great"
Surabaya to Ambo. This morning flight was quick to board but passengers had to take the shuttle bus to the plane as it was parked away from the airport. The plane left the parking bay at 0727 and took off 6 minutes later. There was slight turbulence while the plane was descending into AMQ. Other than that, the flight was smooth. The food was not that great, and there was no choice.

### "how low the price was"
Denpasar to Jakarta. I was worried about this flight considering Batik is in the Lion Group, but I was satisfied with this last minute booking with Batik Air. Boarding at Denpasar was on time, and the crew was friendly and greeted everyone as they boarded. Some kind of pre-made sandwich was served but I didn't eat it. Clear announcements were made in both English and Indonesia. Arrived on time. Considering how low the price was for a same-day booking, I am very happy with Batik.

### "definitely book with them again"
Jakarta to Jogyakarta. A great flight with Batik. I booked this flight two hours before departure and I was very satisfied with the experience given the low price. Flight left on time and arrived in Jogja 30 minutes late due to storms on arrival. I'm thankful for the generous baggage allowance. Crew was friendly and attentive. Would definitely book with them again.

### "service OK for low airfare"
Banjarmasin to Jakarta. Batik Air is semi full service airline from Lion Air. Good Leg room space. Free baggage 20 kg. Free meal and drink (only snack and drink in 1 hour 35 minutes flight). Free IFE/AVOD. Free magazine (read onboard only). Their service OK for low airfare.

### "I think the service is okay"
Jakarta (Halim Perdanakusuma) to Yogyakarta. It was a Monday morning flight, so it wasn't crowded both at the check-in queue and the boarding room. I got a little high price compared to another airlines in the same route. But it is no problem. Batik Air gives enough legroom, except if you are more than 180 cm tall. And they give you a little snack (some bread), and a bottle of 330 ml mineral water. I think the service is okay. Unfortunately, the IFE in this flight was inactive. But I don't care about IFE as long as it is a less-than-two-hour flight.

### "would never recommend them"
Denpasar to Perth. My friend and I flew with Batik Air from Perth (Dec 29, 17) to Bali return (9 Jan 18). The service going to Bali was dreadful. There were two stewards and consequently it took over two hours to get a meal (they only had one choice as they had run out of the second choice.) It was a tiny pile of spaghetti with three thumb size “meatballs” on top. Nothing else! It was 6pm when we left Perth. We asked for a cup of tea but they had ‘run out’ of milk. There were screens but we were not offered headsets! On our return flight, my friends suitcase had the zip ripped out when it was going through the X-ray machine in Bali and after much confusion and no solution from the staff at Batik Air in Bali, we had to carry it onto the aircraft and put it in the luggage compartment inside the plane. They confiscated all her toiletries because you are not allowed oversized creams etc inside the plane. This mishap caused the plane to leave about 30 minutes late. The steward made no attempt to show us where to sit so we just sat where there were empty seats. Once again, there were only two stewards (although on this flight the plane was not full). There was no safety demonstration from the staff and no checking of seat belts, upright seats or ensuring bags were secure. It was freezing and when I asked for a blanket, I was told they were only available to Business Class passengers, however after I insisted, she relented and gave me one. The food was once again, disgusting, and again, they had run out of milk. I asked for coke and when I took a sip, it was hot!! This from an airline that boasts ‘full service’ and for tickets we payed $700+ each for. I will never travel with Batik Air again and would never recommend them.

### "disappointed with the service"
Bali to Perth. My flight was OD on friday 29th December 20.40pm. I was very disappointed with the service and the way your crew even thought about looking after the pasengers. We were being taxied out when we hit a bump and was told we had a technical problem. After sitting in the plane for just under an hour we were on the way. On the runway we went back because of technical problem. This is OK I have no problem with this, as we were unloaded and taken back to the waiting room is where your staff were shocking and I was disgusted how we were treated. You took our water when we left and when we asked for some you told us there is a shop go and buy some. Most of us only had Australian and only took credit cards. went up stairs to change but they were closed. After 2 hours I asked if we were on your plane would I be aloud to have water. After many complaints we got a little water and a couple of biscuits. After another 2 hours they take us to a hotel so after sitting there for over 5 hours they finally decided to make a decision. We waited for another hour because there were no busses. After another hour we got to the hotel which was full now we had to go to another hotel this 4 am and they were going to pick us up at 7am.

### "luggage shell is broken"
Jakarta to Singapore. While Batik Air is ontime and have comfortable seating with video on demand entertainment system, the staff on the ground seems to be quite careless when handling my luggage (see photo) as my luggage tag card and luggage shell is broken.

### "commend comfort levels"
Denpasar to Perth. This is the second time that I have flown with Batik Air, and I am more than happy with the service. The aircraft was reasonably empty as I was flying on New Years Eve, however I commend comfort levels of their 737-900ER. The flight was very smooth, and we arrived into Perth early. Staff were all pleasant and very well presented. My fiancé has also flown Batik Air a number of times, and has also given her approval.

### "flight attendant happily welcomed me"
Flew Jakarta to Surabaya. I arrived at Jakarta Soekarno Hatta terminal 1C early to try and avoid the lines, I ended up lining up in a line that wasn't even attended and no one had the decency to let me know that I was lining up at the wrong counter, there was no sign! I had to ask the check-in worker on the other side and she told me "that one isn't even occupied". I asked for a window seat and was lucky to get one. I headed to the boarding gate and boarded the aircraft. We boarded using bus and stairs, the flight attendant happily welcomed me. I got to my seat and we took off on time, soon meal service commenced and we were handed the snack bag with water, inside the snack bag was Spaghetti meatballs with pizza which surprised me because it was only a 1 hour and 30 minute flight. I finished my water and requested for more water but the flight attendant said "sorry, there isn't any left". 5 minutes later the Flight Attendant came with a bottle of water and said "here you go". I was amazed that she remembered. We landed at Surabaya Juanda international airport on time. I was pretty happy about how a small Indonesian airline has such amazing services, I would definitely recommend flying Batik air. Keep up the good work!

### "not too bad a service"
Flew Batik Air from Sorong to Jakarta on November 23rd. The flight took off on time and landed in Jakarta on schedule. The business class seats are comfortable, however there is very limited services onboard. however the cabin crew were helpful. Baggage arrived within 15 minutes of landing. Overall not too bad a service.

### "IFE good but the choice is limited"
Jakarta to Surabaya. Flew with Batik Air in the peak of holiday traffic. Taking 20 minutes for check in, but I can accept that due to holiday season. Because this is a short distance flying - the meal is only bread and water. The bread is very dry, and have no desire to eat that. The IFE is good but the choice is limited - the seat is quite good. Smooth take off and landing.

### "flight attendant was attentive"
Flew Jakarta to Batam with Batik Air in Business Class. I'm was the only passenger in business class on this flight. They use Terminal 1 Soekarna Hatta to check in - but business class passengers get a small lounge in Terminal 1 C for Batik Business Class only. The flight was good. Take off was smooth, but landing was not due to bad weather in Hang Nadim Batam. The flight attendant was attentive since I was the only one in the business cabin. The meal they served was good, but a little bit salty for me. Overall its good - their price for business class is very competitive.

### "two satisfying experiences"
Flew Jakarta to Semarang on ID6352, operated by a brand new A320. Ground service started out well, boarding was announced nearly ten minutes early - remarkable in the midst of busy CGK operations at 7pm. The flight itself, though, was unremarkable. Crew were okay - they get their job done well, but didn't seem polished. Sitting in the very last row of the A320, the seat had no recline, although pitch was perfectly acceptable for a short flight - 31 inches. However, what stood out was the IFE - or the lack thereof - which were offered on older aircraft but not this one. However, the return flight, ID6341, on a BSI-equipped 737, was a completely different story. We pushed back fifteen minutes before our scheduled departure time. Pitch was impressive for a 737, at 32 inches, giving enough legroom to stretch out all the way. The seat remained largely the same as on the departure flight, leather-clad, good, but not great. IFE was offered this time on a high-resolutiion 9 inch screen, although the screen flickered occasionally throughout the flight. However, the crew especially shone on this flight - they approached those of the world's most prestigious airlines, being professional, attentive and friendly. Meals on both flights were the exact same - a piece of bread - just adequate for a shorthaul hop. Overall, two satisfying experiences, after which I will strongly consider them for future domestic flights within Indonesia.

### "The food was horrible"
Semarang to Jakarta. Batik Air have IFE on most of their fleet, which was good and the screen was responsive. The FA were okay although not as nice as the other Indonesian full service airline (they aren't as rude as Lion or Wings in the same group). The food was horrible, I know it was hust a short flight. I got a piece of strawberry jam filled bread and a mineral water, no additional drink that we can choose. The seat pitch was really good.

### "passengers are well served"
Jakarta to Manado, the flight was on time. Flight attendants provide good service. during the trip, the media presented quite well. The food served is also varied, with characteristic flavor. All passengers are well served even though the ticket price is not too expensive.

### "Disaster begin at check in"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. I took Malindo Air flight which was on Batik Air aircraft. Both airlines belong to Lion group. Disaster begin at check in. I can describe it as chaotic and highly inefficient. Served by Lion staff at Denpasar Airport, Batik open 4 counters. However only 1 check in staff was available for first 90 min. It took ages to do check in. Slow, incompetent, rude and unhelpful staff. Total mess. Information about code share was not displayed on screen so many pad we're confused. Flight supposed to start board on 10.20 pm. Question on 11pm what time boarding will start - answer - we don't know, check in is not over yet. Delayed departure for almost an hour. Food on board limited, enedible. Drinks - water and carbonated drinks. No water in lavatory, FA provide bottle of water to flush toilet after use. 6 movies in entertainment system available in Engish. Never again.

### "recommend Batik Air"
Jayapura to Jakarta via Makassar. I arrived in Sentani Airport on 21 Aug 2017 at 2.45 pm with no ticket. Approached ticketing service area and found a man sitting on Lion/Batik Air desk in front of a computer. I asked for available ticket to Jakarta for Batik Air flight at 5pm. The man said I need to go inside the check in area and pass through security and scanning and he told me to tell that no one is attending me here so I need to go inside. I thought, so weird. When inside, I went to their ticketing service and a lady who attend my request was very quick and professional and I got my ticket there after I need to go out again to go to ATM to pay her in cash because she can only accept one particular bank card. The plane was late to arrive in Sentani for about 20 minutes. The boarding process was smooth. The cabin looks new, nice leather seat, and I think a bit more spacious then Lion Air. The inflight entertainment screen was wide with responsive touch screen and easy to use. Short range of movie selection, lot more of Hindi/Tamil movie than I would have expected, and no music selection. Meal service is fine. The food is average to low. Only water, tea, or coffee. Landing and arrival was smooth. They took us on a bus to arrival Terminal 1C in Soekarno-Hatta Intl Airport. I was in confused that no sign of my flight in Baggage Claim Area. So I need to ask to one of the ground staff just to receive a non-caring answer as she just pass my question by calling out to another ground staff which apparently more knowledgeable of the baggage claim situation. I went to the designated carousel and it took ages for the carousel to start to get my luggage. I would recommend Batik Air but Lion Air group until now is still my last option for my flight.

### "seats were filthy"
Terrible customer service with Batik Air both at check in and during the flight from Makassar to Merauke. Food served during the flight was terrible, full of cholesterol and calories. Seats were filthy. It looked like a fairly new airplane, but inflight the screen was not working properly, and inflight entertainment was terrible.

### "unfresh hotdog for dinner"
Jakarta to Bali. I only got tea, a slice of cake, and unfresh hotdog for my dinner on this 2 hour flight. Flight entertainment needs to improve. And we got hard landing when arrived at Bali.

### "Such a bad service"
Jakarta to Lombok. It started when we had to enter the aircraft. It was only announced in Bahasa so we didn't know where to go. A gate was indicated but not correct. Finally we found the ground staff to ask for it and luckily we did otherwise we were on the wrong plane. In the aircraft itself, the tables were dirty. Not very pleasant to eat your meal in such circumstances. Also no headphones. But the worst thing of all, my son forgot 2 books in the plane. After being back home, I contacted Batik Air. First they told me to call their lost and found. After sending some more emails they contacted the lost and found themselves but no books. I put in a complaint as this means they ended up in the bin. But no answer anymore. Such a bad service.

### "it was unimpressive"
Surabaya to Jakarta. I have been on Batik and it was unimpressive. This flight was unsatisfactory. Batik uses the old terminal at Juanda which was crowded and very hot. Boarding was ok. The airline provides entertainment but there is no headsets! The FAs distribute food and water using an old dirty cardboard. During the flight the entertainment system crashed many times. Lion Group must fix it or it will be abandoned by customers.

### "Meals were very good"
Flying with Batik Air from Jakarta Halim Perdana Kusuma to Padang and return flight from Padang to Jakarta Soekarno Hatta. Ticket booking was very easy and so was mobile check in. However flight departure from Jakarta to Padang sector was delayed about two hours due to Presidential aircraft movement. It is understandable since Halim Perdana Kusuma is a military based airport. Meals for business class were very good for both sector. However, inflight entertainment is not installed.

### "flights were really pleasant"
Jakarta to Jogjakarta return with Batik Air. Both flights were really pleasant but there were some problems. When I checked in on 29/12 the person informed me that my flight back to Jakarta will be changed, not to CGK but to Halim Airport! That was surprising and scaring, because that means that I have to travel from Halim to CGK (2 hours by Damri bus). In CGK I have to get a connecting flight from Jakarta to Dubai. This was realy a very nervous time. But the staff was very understanding and finally provided me a new ticket (a print) of another flight from JGJ to CGQ! I checked in and went to the lounge. After having a snack and a coffee a lady called me and she brought me to a car to bring me to the plane. My flight back to CGK was also with some problems . When I checked in they couldn't print my boarding pass. I waited for about 15 minutes and than the lady told me that someone will bring me to the Lounge and after that they will hand me a boarding pass. It was a great business class experience. I bought my ticket for the price of an Economy Class ticket. Salute for Batik Air and staff at the airport as in the aircraft.

### "good cabin crew"
Jakarta to Yogyakarta with Batik Air. My original flight was from Soekarno Hatta International Airport, but one week before that flight I got my departure moved to Halim (smaller airoprt also in Jakarta) with another flight. The problem is I couldnt make web check in because of that so I couldn't choose my seat. When I came to the airport and checked in manually, my new ticket hadn't been issued by the airline, so I had to wait about 20 minutes in front of check in counter. With many people around the terminal caused by holiday traffic, it felt uncomfortable. That was the only bad moment with the airline. Departured on schedule, good cabin crew, clean airplane with flight entertainment so I could watch movies or just play games. Also got chocolate bread and mineral water as a snack. In the end, the plane landed smoothly in Yogyakarta.

### "the cabin crew were ever courteous"
I have flown on Batik Air 3 times between Singapore and Jakarta. My experience on board their flights have always been pleasant. Cabin crew service was good, hot meals delicious, flight entertainment was up to date, and the plane was new. 2 days ago, I boarded Batik Air ID 7521 from Jakarta to Surabaya. As usual the cabin crew were ever courteous, pleasant and helpful. I have traveled on some of the major airlines for my work but this trip was even better. Not feeling that great after the long journey from hotel to airport and the long wait to board the plane in an airport that need a major renovation, I decided to head to the restroom to wash up before the plane takes off and there a cabin crew who not only ushered me from my seat but also opened the door of the restroom for me and checked on me when I was seated if I was feeling better. That little thought was the "wow" factor that sets Batik Air apart from most airlines in the region including some national airlines. The plane diverted back midway due to Surabaya runway being closed for repairs. The crew, both cockpit and cabin were very apologetic. I understood from the other cabin crews that they had been flying Jakarta-Solo-Surabaya-Jakarta earlier. That must have been tiring for them but they still put on a good show and the sincere smile they wore on their faces made the inconvenience most bearable especially with their hands clasp and apologizing to every passenger when they re-boarded the plane. With the fares and the commendable service they offer, I would give the national and budget airlines a skip. I strongly recommend any travelers travelling to and within Indonesia to give Batik Air a try if they have not been on one.

### "it was a great experience"
Kupang to Jakarta return. The outbound flight departed 30 minutes delay but arrived on time. The check in was smooth and ground staff were nice. But during the boarding process, there were something wrong with the ground staff that counted the number of people boarding the aircraft and they kept counting and checking the boarding pass which caused all the passengers to wait for 1 hour in the aircraft. Despite that, the seat was comfortable for the 3 hour flight and the cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food was just ok. The IFE was responsive but it lacked of content. I hoped Batik can provide more movies to watch in the future. On the return, ground staff was kind and check in and boarding process went smoothly. The flight on time which was the reason why I liked to fly with Batik. The cabin crew was kind and the food just ok for the flight. Overall, it was a great experience flying with Batik Air.

### "flight was smooth all the way"
This was my first time with Batik Air from Makassar to Ternate. The plane was new, everything was shiny. However, the lead stewardess announced before the flight that the inflight entertainment was inoperable, which frustrated me. The flight was smooth all the way, no turbulence encountered. Landing at Ternate was a real sight to behold. Food presented was okay, but needs to be improved.

### "choice of watching movies"
This was my second time on Batik Air. It was an afternoon flight from Ternate to Makassar. This time, the in-flight entertainment system worked, so I had the choice of watching movies while flying. The movies were the latest. I asked for the Ikan Balado or chilly-fried fish, but it turned out to be too dry and I did not eat it.

### "flight was enjoyable"
From Jakarta to Kupang on Batik Air Boeing 737-800. The flight departed and arrived on time. The cabin crew and ground staff were friendly and efficient. Food and beverage selection for the flight was good enough since the ticket was slightly above LCC so It was acceptable. The seat was comfortable and there were enough space. The IFE was responsive but needed improvement on the content. Overall, the flight was enjoyable.

### "flight attendants did their job well"
Flew Jakarta to Medan with Batik Air. I was curious to try their Business Class. 1 day before the Departure, they contacted me to offer me a personal assistant at the airport, which I thought was a nice touch. The Check-In was fast enough in peak season situation. Food and beverage selection in the lounge was fair enough since the ticket was not expensive so I thought it was acceptable. Boarding commenced on time and due to the aircraft being parked at the other terminal we had to use a van to get to the aircraft. Starting the flight with a typical Business Class refreshment, their veggie juice is great. Flight attendants did their job well, meal and beverage on this flight was good and entertainment was good enough for a 2 hrs flight with the screen being very responsive! After arriving, I headed to baggage claim and saw that my bag had already been taken off by the staff.

### "the worst experience I've had"
Jakarta to Bali via Surabaya. Absolutely the worst experience I've had with an airline. Jakarta to Surabaya was a horrible 7 hour journey, followed by a 3 hour delay to Bali without any announcement made. The plane smells and had trash across the cabin. Cabin crew unfriendly and had no idea what was happening. We had to wait for a good 10 minutes for the bus to come to take us to the plane due to no air bridge (see photo).

### "maybe fly Batik Air again"
First time flying with Batik Air.The cabin crew was nice, but a passenger ask "Is this plane going to Ternate (TTE)?". The cabin crew said "Sorry, maybe you have entered the wrong plane. The cabin crew don't know if this plane heading to Makassar (UPG) with the transit passenger who going to Palu and Ternate. I explain where this plane going to the cabin crew. The cabin crew just said sorry. The in-flight entertainment was good, but maybe need to add more movies. The in-flight food was good and delicious. Next time, maybe will fly with Batik Air again.

### "not properly trained on hospitality"
Singapore to Jakarta. What kind of "full service" airline sells headsets for its own entertainment system? Then when I want to purchase the headset, the FA keep looking all around the plane for it. They only serve water, coffee or tea, no juices at all. The food was mediocre, nothing special. The FA were not properly trained on hospitality. Furthermore, the FA failed to provide custom and excise form that is mandatory for anyone coming to Indonesia.

### "a very pleasant experience"
First time for business class on Batik Air, from Jakarta to Padang. Was impressed with cleanliness of aircraft. While the lounge was not as plush as I expected, the legroom on the aircraft was excellent. We pushed back on time but were slightly delayed due to congestion at Jakarta airport. 10 mins late up in the air. We were greeted by two staff with hot towels and were offered a pre flight drink or juice. There were five of us in the business cabin. Three in my party. My daughter slept through an hour of the flight. Staff were attentive but not intrusive and were diligent. The quality of the meal was sufficient but I didn't like the tuna - real metal cutlery and crockery was also welcomed. Flight was smooth, ife screen large and clean. Overall a very pleasant experience, would fly again. No foot rest. No blanket. No music.

### "seats and legroom were comfortable"
Jakarta to Surabaya with Batik Air. It is a brand new A320 aircraft. Check in was fast and smooth, with 20kg baggage and we got the seat that we had check in earlier. Boarding was very early, before the boarding time. The cabin crew was very friendly and helpful. The seats and legroom were both comfortable. The plane was clean and tidy. The IFE system was responsive but it has not many updated movies, it was ok for us since it is only short flight, but it should have more content for the longer flight, During the flight I was offered a complimentary drink and some bread and snacks. We touched down 20 mins ahead of schedule. Overall, it is a very nice flight with Batik Air and will definitely fly with them again.

### "will fly with them in future"
Kupang to Jakarta with Batik Air A320. The ticket price is very cheap and slightly above LCC in Indonesia. The plane was new with lots of leg room in economy class. Nice leather seats but they should provide better headrest for passengers to make the seat more comfortable. The food was quite nice. The staff on the ground and inside the plane were friendly, kind and well-dressed. The IFE is very responsive but it has limited content, maybe because Batik AIr operates mainly short flight. The flight was very on time with arrival around 30 minutes ahead of schedule time. Overall, I am more than satisfied with Batik Air and will fly with them in future.

### "flight attendants were very helpful"
Flew from Kupang to Singapore via Jakarta with Batik Air. The aircraft's were very clean but the seat in economy class should have a headrest as it is uncomfortable for long flight. The IFE should have more option in movies as it is not very interesting for the movie that they offer. Despite that, the flight attendants were very helpful and always had smiles on their faces. The food was good for the both flight. The legroom for A320 is also very big. Overall, it is a nice trip to fly with Batik Air as it is affordable as the price is between low cost carrier and full service airlines.

### "first and last time"
Jakarta Halim Perdanakusuma to Lombok with Batik Air. Worst airline ever! Jakarta Soekarno and Jakarta Halim airport are situated 1 hour away although both are in Jakarta. So I departed from Soekarno to Halim to catch my flight to Lombok. Upon arrival, I was then informed there are no flights to Lombok from Halim. No emails regarding the change was received too. The staff tried to help but the most was a transfer back to Jakarta Soekarno and the earliest flight out. No hotel was offered. First and last time using Batik Air.
