### "poor and demeaning service"
Extremely poor and demeaning service. Frontier consistently sets the bar at its lowest when it comes to customer experience. Both gate agents and flight attendants were rude and unprofessional. We took a connecting flight with different crews. The attitude was identical: condescending and dismissive. It truly felt like being unpleasant is a job requirement.

### "I wouldn't consider them cheap"
Not Verified |  We bought two tickets at a certain price and within 5 minutes it doubled. We sat across from each other on the plane. You advertise cheap flights, and I wouldn't consider them cheap. The prices keep going up and you don't get anything but a glass of water.

### "nice and helpful"
I paid for the “Business Bundle”, got front row seats, two check in bags included. Check in was super nice, boarding was done efficiently and crew were nice and helpful. Two short flight, seats were comfortable enough, extra leg room helped. And both flights were on time too! I knew I was flying on a low cost carrier, but I was completely satisfied! Best of all? Bags arrived real fast on the luggage belt in Tampa!

### "never, ever again"
Not Verified |  Tried to get home for the anniversary of my God mother passing but unfortunately the airline had other ideas. Flights from Vegas to Orlando got delayed and resulting in me missing my flight to Ohio. The next available opening was the next day at 3. Flight attendants treated it like it normally happens. In fact they showed more effort in pushing that credit card then they did treating their customers like humans. I stood in line to speak with someone for an hour due to the line of people who's flights were missed were almost stretched to the spirit terminal. I asked for a flight back home seeing they didn't have any Ohio flights The next available flight to Vegas is at 7:35 pm. which was a solid fix ? No! And you would think this is when customer service kicks in ... absolutely not their staff is nonchalant and rude. I watched them call security on people who were trying not to get stranded, i watched them raise their voice and strug off customers Who were stuck in another city as if no one mattered. This is by far the worse flying experience I've dealt with. And now looking down at my ticket. I'm 6'1 280 lbs and they assigned me a middle seat,  like after completely destroying my day this they want my knees next. This airline is the worse... never, ever again.

### "entire experience was a nightmare"
I recently had the worst travel experience with Frontier Airlines on my trip from IAD to SFO with a layover in Atlanta. My first flight from IAD to Atlanta was delayed by 2 hours, which was frustrating but manageable. However, things went from bad to worse when my connecting flight from Atlanta to SFO was delayed by another 3 hours. After finally boarding, the crew suddenly announced that the flight was canceled! To make matters worse, we had to walk what felt like miles through the airport just to reach the ticketing desk to check on hotel accommodations and rebooking options. After all that, Frontier refused to provide a hotel stay, even though they suggested a flight for the next day. And the alternative flight they offered was completely unrealistic, adding over 18 hours to my trip! This entire experience was a nightmare — horrible customer service, ridiculous delays, and zero support when things went wrong. I will never fly with Frontier again, and I highly recommend others avoid them unless you enjoy stress, exhaustion, and disappointment.

### "the worst airline out there"
Not Verified |  Third time I've flown Frontier and once again thry confirm that they are, by miles, the worst airline out there. Delay after delay after delay—which turned out to be a result of poor paperwork from their staff, and zero communication. It isn't so much the delay as it is the clear lack of interest in thr frustration of their passengers. It doesn't matter if they delay a wedding or cut a well-earned vacation short. To Frontier, the only thing that matters is you paid them already. After that, you may as well be wind.

### "no refund has been received"
Not Verified |  I purchased the return flight ticket in Feb 2025 for a return flight on May 22, I was notified on Mar 4 the flight had been cancelled and I could request a refund on their website which I did and they confirmed was received and processed with an up to 7 day wait. I waited 10 days, no refund I called their customer service and was told the refund would be processed again, with another 7 day wait...10 days later no refund, I called again and told their system shows the refund was sent on March 18, it is now March 28 and no refund has been received and they will do nothing else to verify on their end why I have not received a refund and as far as they are concerned the matter is final!

### “Choose anyone but Frontier”
It's been many, many years since I've been encouraged enough to write a bad review for anything (maybe a decade?). So for me to take the time to sit down & actually put this out there is something. This was our first/only & last time flying with Frontier. We fly 6-10 round trip flights per year & are somewhat savvy travelers. Upon checking in, the employee told us we could save $25 if we download the app & do it on our phones, vs going to the desk or using the computer. So we did. I had an option to select one bag 41-50 lbs, and one check in bag. I selected one of each (and my wife's eyes verified indeed I selected those). $75/ea, checked out & paid $150. Checked my bag & headed to the gate. While in the line to board a few people from the ticket scanner, the employee behind the desk came over & randomly asked to see our tickets. She reviewed them & said we never paid for the carry on. We both insisted we did, downstairs through the app. She pulled up our reservation & said we paid for one "oversized' bag & no carry on & we owe an additional $100 or we can't board the flight. She was extremely dismissive, condescending & abrupt with us. We protested quite firmly, insisting we selected everything on the app, I showed her my credit card receipt & said I don't have an oversized bag. She said since she can't verify it if it's my mistake I still need to pay $100 more. We got into a back & forth, not happy to be taken advantage of like this. She said it's not her problem & if we don't pay her we can just stay in Tampa. Unbelievably disgusting attitude & customer service. They called over their supervisor to try & resolve it. I explained we used the app, I selected the carry on & we don't understand how this breakdown could even happen. I said my bag was 48 lbs which can't be overweight & he said there's the problem - we recently changed it to now anything over 40 is overweight & an additional $75, I was about to let you through until you told me that (every flight I've ever been on is 50+). When I selected it in the app none of this was clear, it did not say I was paying $75 for the bag & $75 extra for those 8 pounds (in which I would've just moved 1 thing into my carry on & dissolved that issue). We ended up paying $250 to bring 1 suitcase & 1 carry on! Our flights were $118 each so the luggage more than doubled our flight cost. This system is a total sham, I gave up & paid the $100 extra. Two employees not directly involved (as at this point there were now 5 employees here watching) came into & told us in the Jetway they felt bad & don't agree with how this system works but it's out of their hands. They came onto the plane & allowed my wife & I (who were separated) to seat together & said hopefully that makes us feel somewhat better. I did some research to discover that the employees at the terminal receive a commission (it's $3-$5 each) for every person they can find boarding to make pay extra for a carry on. A guy in front of us in the jetway told him they made him pay $100 to bring his playstation onto the plane! This whole system is fraudulent, from the unclear app to the extraneous fees. Choose anyone but Frontier, we will never fly with them again.

### “Their policies are inhuman”
I had a horrible experience in the Orlando airport and was never given a boarding pass via the website, once I checked in online. I looked all over the site to find where to get my boarding pass, and found nothing. My dad looked also and found nothing. I hoped I would get it emailed to me, but didn't get that either. When I went to drop off my bags, I was told I had to pay $25/person ($50 total) to have our boarding passes printed. This is outrageous since I was not able to get it on my own. Once at the gate, after paying hundreds of dollars in up-charges for a checked bag, I was stopped at the gate and told I had to pay another $99 for my backpack that fit under my seat, because it didn't fit in the ridiculous "under seat space" reference frame outside the plane. It is obvious that all this company does is find ways to weasel out more money from people. I did NOT need to use the overhead compartment for my bag because it DID fit under the seat, because their reference is HALF the size of what is actually under the seat. The whole point of a "carry on" bag is that it takes overhead space, which mine did not. Their policies are inhuman and I will never fly Frontier again. I also found out from other passengers that this flight was giving away FREE carry-on bag allowances for many of the passengers!

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Frontier is the worst airline ever. 6 years ago I said I would never fly with them again and ended up having no choice this past week. We flew from Slc to LAX for a cruise and then back to Slc. We paid an upgrade for the 6 of us to sit together on both flights. We had 3 adults, 1 minor, one infant, and my son with Down syndrome. 2 of us were able to sit together each way. I’ve never seen an airline work so hard to keep group of travelers from being together. They care more about the animals pictured on the tail than the people flying. The price to check a bag or have a carry-on is ridiculous. One of my checked bags was damaged on the first flight then about completely destroyed on the second. With what I paid for checked bags and seats that were supposed to be together I could’ve had 6 first class seats on Delta. It was so horrible I wish I would’ve cancelled the cruise and lost all that money and not given frontier extra money for a bunch of lies. Never again Frontier.

### "turned into a nightmare"
I was in good spirits getting ready to return home in New York after a wonderful Carnival vacation in Trinidad. But my return flight turned into a nightmare with Frontier. Upon approaching our stopover airport in San Juan, we were turned back to Trinidad where the plane refueled and took off again to SJU. By this time, my connecting flight to JFK had left and Frontier’s customer service desk informed me that there was no flight until 10:45am the following day. So, we were stuck in San Juan for 12 hours without any compensation, food or hotel vouchers. To make matters worse, the Frontier staff at SJU's agent desk assigned me a seat in the very last row (Row 35) on the next flight, even though I pointed out to her that I had purchased upgraded seating which had me on Row 2 on the cancelled flight. I had to insist that she use her noggins until she finally gave me a seat in Row 6. I took the risk to try Frontier for the first time but this is what happens when something goes wrong with one disruption on a budget airline; there are no usually backup planes available to continue your journey until the next day or whenever they can. Trying to save a few dollars with this airline is not worth the aggravation and inconvenience.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. 4 hours delay which we weren’t informed of until after we arrived at the airport. The flight before us also had a 4 hour delay. No explanation given. The seats were tight and uncomfortable. A checked bag was an an additional $70. Any carry on over a small personal bag was extra. Snacks & non-alcoholic beverages were additional. The flight ended up costing the same as another airline that included WiFi, free checked bag and a carry-on, snacks & non-alcoholic beverages.

### "The worst experience"
I’m a frequent flyer and was forced to fly frontier because of timing issue. I assumed it would be fine. The worst experience I’ve ever had traveling! It is the most primitive and unpleasant airline. At most airports you are forced to board and deboard outside regardless of weather or temperature. They offer no complimentary snacks or drinks. The only thing worse than flying frontier is their customer service (or lack of). To be treated like a human fly any other airline!

### "had to pay for my bag again"
Not Verified |  I flew from Orlando to Ponce. I had paid for a carry on, when I got to the airport my bag was too big for carry on (maybe 2"). I told the attendant to have it check in. She told me that I had to pay for my bag again and it was going to be an additional $104, even though I had already paid $75 for the bag. I had no choice as they would not allow me to travel unless I pay. When I call customer. service I was told that's the company policy. Said she can email me the policy for me to read and that I should read before flying with them.

### “flight cancelled without my knowledge”
My flight was cancelled without my knowledge on March 5th. But I never got an email, only email I got was telling me to check in for my flight that I couldn’t even do. I kept getting an error message for no reason. I called customer service at noon March 6th, they said they can’t help me and to go to the airport early and check in at the counter with the agent, my confirmation is suspended for some reason. I said okay, came early to the airport 6:30pm. I get to the agent she’s saying she can’t help me because I don’t have my physical card but I’m showing the receipt and card info on my own personal bought phone that has my name on the card and everything. She said she’ll call some department, can’t help me, I tell her get me a supervisor cause she had the audacity to say I wasn’t getting a refund for a flight I never cancelled or missed. Now the supervisor came said I would get a refund 7-10 business days. My issue is her not giving me a receipt showing it was cancelled and I would get a refund.

### "I will not fly Frontier again"
We flew from Minneapolis to Denver, and we had to upgrade our seat, because they had my husband 3 rows up from mine. These tickets were a good deal. Then we flew from Denver  to Minneapolis. We had to upgrade our seat again. About the time we were going to board the plane, they said we had to check our bags, so I tried the app so I wouldn't have to may $99 X 2. Can't use the app when you it close to your flight time. We didn't chance anything about our bags. They are the same one we flew from Minneapolis. If you think you are getting a great deal, think again. It would have been cheaper to with Delta. I called Frontier Airline, and they said they would give a voucher for the bag charges. It is good for 90 days. We don't fly very often. They also said they couldn't refund the bags cost for cash, even if they were at fault. They blamed the airports. The moral of the story is that if a deal seems too good to be true buyer, be where. I will not fly Frontier again. They only want to make money, and they don't take responsibility for the wrong doing.

### "Do not ever fly this airline"
Today we arrived at the airport to find that all of their Orlando flights to Boston are delayed from noon until 7:30 pm due to crew regulations. In fact all of their Orlando flights are "delayed" for this reason. The gate agent was rude and refuses to speak with any of the Orlando passengers. They will not even try to get us on alternative flights to nearby cities where we could at least rent a car and drive to Orlando. Do not ever fly this airline, they are a crusher of dreams. My daughters are crushed. But I guess if you are the CEO you never have to fly your own airline and so you don't care.

### "your check in staff sucks"
Booked tickets for 9 February 2025, was told we missed the gate closing time when we still had 30 minutes. Was convinced to rebook for the next morning at an additional cost which we did, we (wife & child) also had to book a place to stay the night. Flight was delayed and attendants refused to let us on because we had already re-booked on the insistent of another other attendant. Guy was rude and not willing to help even though they allowed other passengers to board. We have never experienced serious like this before and we travel quite a bit. Staff feel they are entitled to treat client with disrespect, they were not doing is a favor, we paid for your service. The sad thing is that your cost is good and we had good service on the plane but your check in staff sucks and they are the face of your company

### "horrible baggage policy"
Horrible experience, horrible customer service, horrible baggage policy. My bag is in perfect size meaning that I bought the bag according to the domestic personal item bag size requirement and the person who was at the gate didn’t even check if it fits or not. She just claimed that it doesn’t fit and charged $80 extra. She didn’t even listen anything was very very rude. I am utterly disgusted. Never going to fly with frontier ever again.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience at the gate. The lady told all of us to check our carry-on bag sizes, and multiple other passengers, including us, had to throw out stuff. The staff was not understanding at all and dismissed all of our comments and concerns. When checking my boarding passes, the lady dismissed my question about where we were seated, and when I asked her if everything was okay, she responded with attitude, "I'm okay. Are you okay? It was the worst experience I have ever had, and I never flew here again.

### "Completely unacceptable"
Terrible airline and experience. First they delayed our initial flight while waiting on staff causing me to miss my connecting flight to my final destination. When I attempted to rebook instead of rebooking me on the first available flight they left with only the option fly out the next day, causing me to miss work while also refusing any type of voucher. Then the following day they don't get my bags on the correct plane and now I have to hang around the airport for 12+ hours to wait for my bag to arrive. Completely unacceptable

### "not even get economy service"
Not Verified |  Up front I have to say I fly First Class 90 percent of the time. I decided to try Frontier as I have not used Frontier in over a decade. I decided to try their business class. It is European business class and knew that going in it is not very service oriented. We arrive early to ensure no problems. 2 and a half hours early, I was told we could not drop our bags until 2 hours before the flight. Industry standard is 3 hours. Not looking forward to the rest of this experience. Bottom line don’t fly Frontier if you are use to any kind of service, you will not even get economy service from this airline. The price deference between a Delta flight and Frontier is not that much different. For a few dollars more you will have a better experience.

### "Very firm on restrictive bag policy"
Very firm on restrictive bag policy design to trick people into paying absurd fees at the gate. People are pulled out of line to have bags checked. Seats are very uncomfortable with very little leg room. Seats do not recline. There is no wifi or free food/drink service. Choose another airline.

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is a horrible experience. Everything is a hidden fee, they charge for services you don’t receive, the plane ride was uncomfortable, seats don’t recline at all. I will never fly frontier again, you couldn’t give me a ticket to fly with this company ever again, I’d rather walk.

### "a horrific experience"
Not Verified |  This is my first time using this airline. It was a horrific experience. We boarded late. Once boarded it was extremely hot on the plane. Then, we were asked to get off, so that they could fix a problem. Then, we were boarded again. It was so hot still. Customers began to panic, because we could smell fumes from the plane. One customer yelled let me out. She got off, and a flight attendant got angry and told passengers that anyone else wanting to get off needs to do it now. We arrived about three hours past our scheduled time for arrival at Newark airport. They did not even provide bottled water. We could only have a few cups of water. I will not be traveling with this airline again.

### “Just don’t do it”
Not Verified | This is one of the worst airlines I’ve ever done business with and I will never fly Frontier again and I will tell everyone I know to never fly with them. No WiFi, small planes, and excessive bag fees. Lesson learned. Just don’t do it.

### "more money every step of the way"
It really is amazing how an airline that is so inept is still operating in the airways. Not only is their system outdated, but their policies are structured to con you out of more money every step of the way. The cheap upfront price is appealing but you make up for it with fees and the inevitable purchase of another ticket because it’s highly probably you will miss your flight. Flyer beware.

### "had the most horrible experience"
Not Verified |  I had the most horrible experience flying home on Frontier yesterday. I was traveling home with my 3lb dog yesterday after spending some time with my mom. When I got on the plane with my dog in the appropriate TSA carrier and my puppy was also secured with a leash that attached to the carrier. I erroneously had the top of my dogs carrier not zipped. When I got on an a steward very rudely yelled at me that the carrier needed to be zipped. I complied with his request and zipped the bag closed with one hand, not realizing I didn’t zip the bag all the way closed. The bag was still 5% open. I get halfway on the plane and another stewardess said it needed to be closed all the way. Not realizing, I say the bag on an empty seat and proceeded to close the rest of the bag. The stewardess then told me I had to go back because the male steward wanted to see me. I back tracked and went to the front of the plan where he told me I could get off! I politely asked why? He said I told you to close that carrier. I told him I did, but didn’t realize a small part still remained opened. He yelled at me well that’s not what my co-worker said. He called his coworker to the front and she confirmed what I said. I couldn’t believe how rudely I was talked to and treated after being a customer for years and over a 3lb puppy. Frontier needs to better with how they treat their customers. I wasn’t unruly or anything, it was a mistake of trying to close a pet carrier with one hand, while trying to board a plane. Not sure if I will ever fly with them again, or refer them to anyone else. I guess you get what you pay for.

### "so unimpressed and disappointed"
My boarding time was 7:20 I got to the airport early so I could check my bags in and enjoy the city before my flight I was told I couldn't check my bags in until 3 hrs prior to boarding ok I pay for the luggage storage I come back around 4 ish I was told I wouldn't be able to check my bags in until 6:15 and one of the agents was like 5:45 they went back and forth. I said forget it because 3 hrs prior to boarding is 4 something if I'm waiting till 6 that leaves me no time to calmly go through tsa eat relax and charge my phone which was dying. Which in fact was the case when I got back to the counter the line was tremendously long, mind you I just needed to drop my luggage off that was already paid for and tagged. tsa was backed up so bad this day I was still in line when the boarding process began which stressed me out because I suffer from anxiety and if I were to miss my flight Frontier doesn't do well with compensation. So for people like me who like to plan ahead and be cautious of how the airport works it's very unproductive to have a 3hr drop time from the flight's takeoff time and not the boarding time. I was panicked and hungry by the time i boarded the aircraft and I do not appreciate my time being wasted when I followed all the guidelines and requirements Frontier asked of me before even coming into the airport. I did everything I was supposed to do and your company failed to hold up their end of the bargain. I understand people use your company for the low fares but when the service is horrible and my time isn't valued I'd rather pay a higher price for convince and a smoother process. I was so unimpressed and disappointed by the careless attitudes from the workers at the front desk

### "unprofessional and unempathetic"
Not Verified | I was traveling back home with my 4 and 6 yr old sons from San Juan to St Louis but had a layover in Orlando. Frontier made me miss my connecting flight because they were circling in the air for an hour unable to land. By the time I arrived to the gate they had shut the doors and told me to go to the help desk. The help desk told me the next flight out wouldn't be until the next day at 930 pm. Over 24 hrs later!!! The man at the help desk said "well do you want me to book it or not? Very rude, unprofessional and unempathetic! I had him rebook me and now I and stuck on a bench with two small kids, no blankets, lost suitcase and the help desk disappeared and will be returning at 1:30 am. My mother and I spent 2 hours on the phone with Frontier customer service supervisor but not much help!

### "the worst one I've ever been on"
Not Verified |  This airline is by far the worst one I've ever been on, it's even worse than Spirit. In this specific airline, where they check your boarding passes before going into the plane, they force you to check your bag in the size limit thing. Our three bags fit perfectly good but they charged us $390! That's like a price for another airplane ticket!

### "This airline is really bad"
We waited 3 hours to check in for a flight in Boston. We were sold a ticket to Santo Domingo connecting in Orlando. We purchased a pet ticket for our dog to fly in the cabin. We'll when we went to board our connecting flight they told us they don't allow dogs even though it's paid for and on my boarding pass. Now we are stuck in Orlando looking for another airline. They refused a refund because it's posted on their website. We have lost a day of our vacation and they could care less. Manager was rude and customer service useless. This airline is really bad.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service, rude staff, they make money off charging you for everything, your personal item. Everything they can squeeze a penny of you, do not fly Frontier.

### "additional $296 for all our bags"
I had to buy a last-minute ticket at 10 pm the night before we needed to fly home due to an incorrect booking by my elderly mother. We had never booked with Frontier before and thought they would have the same carry-on bag policy as every other airline. Minutes after booking, we went online to check in to find they only allow one small bag (smaller than a backpack), and every additional bag is $74. We had two roller bags that Alaska Airlines allowed us to carry on to our destination. Frontier was charging us an extra $148 for these same bags. After reading the dimensions of their approved small bag, we realized that both our backpacks were too large, even though they would fit under the seat of any airline. This means we needed to pay an additional $296 for all our bags. I called to cancel the flight, and even though I had booked a few minutes earlier, they told me that I did not meet their cancelation requirements and I would need to pay a $198 cancelation fee. On top of that, they won't refund the remaining balance back to your card, but instead force you to take a credit with their shady AF airlines. Never again will I book with Frontier or their affiliate Spirit.

### "overcharge for everything"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Frontier airlines again. They falsely say discounted airline but then overcharge for everything. You pay high dollar for your checked bag and are only allowed 40 pounds. Mine was 3 pounds over and I was charged $100 more. I had to wait in the check in line for almost an hour because there were only 2 employees working and one of them was on and off her cell phone and not helping people. Then the flight attendants on my flight from Indy to Denver, were so unprofessional. There was a 23-minute time frame where they had the front bathroom blocked off for the pilots to use the restroom. However, 20 minutes of that time was spent with the flight attendants laughing and flirting with one of the pilots. They were not checking on passengers and I had to "hold it" to the point of pain because they wouldn't let me use the bathroom. With everything I had to spend on my tickets, bags, seats, getting a bottled water and a small bag of chex mix....I paid over double what I would have paid to just book with a regular airline that includes everything! I paid extra to sit in what I thought was their "first class", but still didn't get a complementary beverage or snack! Lesson learned for sure!

### "disregard for customer rights"
Not Verified |  In May 2024, I was flying from DFW to LAX with Frontier Airlines. After boarding, we sat in the airplane for over 45 minutes with no activity. Eventually, they announced that the flight was overbooked and couldn’t take off until the situation was resolved. I voluntarily gave up my seat under one condition: that I receive a full refund. However, it has been nine months, and Frontier has yet to issue my refund. Despite filing a dispute with my Bank of America credit card company, there has been no resolution. This experience has been extremely frustrating, and I would caution anyone against trusting Frontier Airlines. Their lack of professionalism and disregard for customer rights is unacceptable.

### "The absolute worst experience"
The absolute worst experience top to bottom. I interacted with 5 employees throughout the process. 4 of them were rude. They have a draconian personal item policy. If your backpack does not fit in the tiny box, they charge you $99 for a carry on at the gate. I flew Spirit here on a last second flight and they were way better. I used the same backpack and they considered it a personal item without issue. The rudeness continued on the flight. Condescending tone vs simple communication.

### "Such a disappointing airline"
Such a disappointing airline. I'd never book any ticket from them. I paid $70 for a check in Luggage, went to the Airport on time and waited in the line 1 hour 10 minutes prior to the boarding. Nobody was there to check us in or to take the luggage. Then after 20 mins someone came and said you can't drop off the luggage because they closed drop off 60 minutes prior to boarding. But we were there 60 minutes before but nobody said nothing. Then we had to throw away the luggage we paid for and put our stuff on duffle bags and rushed to the boarding. We were Late and eventually we missed the flight for that day and for the trip. Such an inconvenient, disappointing service I'd ever have in my life. And it says this is a budget friendly airline which is a lie too because you have to pay for luggage, for seat and everything separately. Ultimately it's the same as other airlines. Not recommended at all. It will destroy your vacation mode.

### "try to extort money from passengers"
Not Verified |  They always try to extort money from passengers. They deliberately seat your party in different far off seats which forces you to purchase seats of your choice (Even if 2 people are traveling). The staff is extremely rude, disrespectful and spiteful. They basically treat you like second class citizens if you’re not buying carry on luggage. On one of my trips, I was a carrying a tote bag which fitted in their personal item bin without any struggle, however their rude staff asked me to flip the tote bag and place is horizontally hoping that it wouldn’t fit so they could charge me. They were not successful but it’s telling about how they treat their customers. You’re better off never flying this airline even if costs a little extra. Never again!

### "Do not fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Frontier is the worst airline . Frontier had my flight gate wrong on the app, wrong on the flight board and blame me and the other passengers for getting to the appropriate gate late. The lady at the gate was rude, no one answers the phone, no one helped. Do not fly Frontier.

### "had a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  On November 30, my family and I had a terrible experience with Frontier Airlines. We were charged extra fees but received no proper service. The airline staff separated our seats and ignored our concerns. Later, they forcibly removed us from the plane without explanation, violating passenger rights. We were left stranded and had to buy new tickets by Delta Airline for ourselves, with no help from customer service.

### “Very unprofessional”
We had a horrible experience with the check-in process on December, 1st with Frontier Airlines at Denver. We wanted to check a skibag and additional ski shoe bag, which we already paid for. We just needed an additional tag for the ski shoe bag and were sent to the check-in counter (away from the bag drop area). We then had to wait for 2 hours just to obtain the the additional bag tag and drop the skibag. We almost missed our flight as result. The check-in counter was just staffed with two people. One of the agents was extremely rude and yelled at customers. Very unprofessional.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is the worst airline ever. The entire process of getting a boarding pass and checking a bag is done via their App, which you have to download. The app doesn't work , they do not have kiosks at JFK airport. They do not answer their telephone, but ask instead if you would like to receive a text and chat electronically. They charge you 25 $ to get passenger assistance (that is, speak to a person at their counter to get a boarding pass). They charge you over 50$ for a carry-on bag. Their employees are insufferably rude. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again.

### "Poor management practices"
Not Verified |  Delayed departure due to repair issue and no catering supplies on board. This flight was the first of the day. There was ample time overnight to accomplish the minor repair that delayed departure and to load catering supplies. Poor management practices. Plus, they nickel and dime you to death.

### "I was charged $100"
Not Verified |  I had a small Carry on item & I was denied my free small carry on and I showed my military ID. Leaving Jacksonville I wasn’t charged. I was charged $100 when I was checking in on my flight at 4pm to Illinois. I was told it wouldn’t fit in the overhead,

### "pay extra to sit together"
Not Verified |  This is my first time flying with Frontier. We booked the flight together and wanted to sit together. We were told that we had to pay extra to sit together. This is the very first time I was told that I have flown very frequency. I would not want to fly with them. Customer service is not friendly. They are extremely rude and disrespectful.

### "last and final travel with Frontier"
Not Verified |  I was charged at first even after selecting one-way baggage for two-way. I did reach out, but no satisfactory customer care support was received. After this, I was somehow made to believe (unlike the truth because of the bad interface on the mobile app/website) that I chose the two-way, which I clearly did right in front of the agent at LGA, but still got charged double. Next, when I was returning, I was not sent any check-in information or emails. App check-in was closed indefinitely. I was then charged by the agent at DFW $25 for check-in, which was not allowed to me in the first place. Then, during baggage, a personal item was harassed at LAS on boarding even though there was no problem boarding from DFW with the same item by the Frontier staff. I think my last and final travel with Frontier and forget recommending. I will ignore when I see Frontier, to be honest. I over paid and kept suffering after overpaying for the lack of technology, customer care support, and unprofessional staff.

### "This company is the absolute worse"
Not Verified |  This company is the absolute worse, they offered me a $15 voucher for a mistake they made. I’ve been at this airport goin on 22 hours to try and get home to North Carolina, they had us board a plane that they did not do preventative maintenance on so we didn’t leave for 2-1/2 hours before the connecting flight. We arrived in Denver and they would not allow us to board our connecting flight although the plane was still here . I have a funeral to attend that I will miss or be extremely late to thanks to Frontier ! They offered me $150 voucher for the future that doesn’t even cover carry on bags, this is a disgrace and I’m never flying with them again

### "truly terrible experience"
By far the worst airline I’ve ever travelled on (and that include Spirit and Avianca). Charged $99 for my carry on. Staff was miserable and rude. Seats were unbearable and don’t go back. Had to get on a bus to exit the airport for some reason. All around a truly terrible experience. The only reason I’m giving it a 2 is even though we were delayed I did arrive:

### “Customer service is terrible”
Not Verified | Customer service is terrible. No phone number works for assistance. The only thing that works is recording the things they do and placing them on social media. That's the only way to get assistance. The so called chat is doesn't even have AI to answer questions.

### "I have never been so upset"
I have never been so upset in my life! I have a flight booked to leave in 1hr. This flight still shows on my app as coming up but guess what, this flight does not exist and I can not reach anyone that can help me!! It's my birthday and I'm going to see my son with reservations already made and I'm stuck having to purchase a last minute ticket with another airline for an outrageous amount. I have tried everything to reach Frontier. I have no idea if I will have a flight home from Denver because no one will help me at all.

### "completely shocked and devastated"
Not Verified |  This was my first and last time flying with Frontier Airlines. My friend and I had purchased tickets at $230 each from Cincinnati to New York LGA. We arrived on time, checked in, and I even asked at the gate if I could upgrade my seat. The gate agent told me the flight was full, so we waited patiently until boarding. When it was time to board, my friend was allowed to enter, but I was told to "wait a few minutes. Confused, I complied, assuming there was a standard protocol or procedure happening. After a few minutes, they closed the doors, leaving me stranded. When I asked what was going on, they claimed that the flight attendant didn't allow me to board because I "smelled like alcohol and appeared drunk. This was an outrageous accusation, I hadn't had a single drink that day and what more than three weeks before. To make matters worse, when I called my friend, she left the plane to be with me (as she had just arrived in the U.S. and was uncomfortable flying alone). The flight attendant had the nerve to scream at her, accusing her of being "drunk" too just because she chose to leave the plane in solidarity. I was completely shocked and devastated. Because of this horrific experience, I missed work on Monday, costing me $400 in lost wages, and I had to pay for my friend's unused ticket as well. We'd driven two hours from Lexington just to catch this flight, only to be left humiliated and abandoned at the gate. Since same-day flights cost nearly $1,000 each, I had to shell out more money for a hotel just to take a different flight. As if things couldn't get worse, Frontier's customer support was absolutely useless. When I asked for help at the airport, the Frontier staff coldly threatened to call the police if we "kept asking for help. This experience left me financially drained, emotionally scarred, and completely disillusioned.

### “For a short 2 hour flight, It’s awful”
Purchased flight for my daughter with Frontier because needed to book her pet in cabin. Round trip flight Dallas to Denver costed over $500, similar to other airlines. Her 3pm departure was delayed to 6pm, 6pm was changed to 10pm, 10pm to 12am and finally the 12am got cancelled and rebooked for next day. We had light rain, nothing major. Another family member was flying out of same airport at same time with American Airlines and had no problem departing and arriving on time. My daughter waited 10 hours on her plane, that got cancelled! For a short 2 hour flight, It’s awful!

### “Disgusting attitude”
Disgusting attitude of the lady at the gate checking bag sizes. Asking you to check your bag size in the bag size checker is one thing, but speaking to you badly is another. If I spoke to her with the rudeness she is speaking to your customers I would probably be removed from the flight. To top it all off I get on the plane and there are overhead lockers which are completely empty, but I was made to pay an additional 65 US, an absolute joke. She is not good for your reputation and needs to either go on a customer service course or find another job. Do yourself and your brand a favor and get rid of her!

### "Totally unreliable"
Not Verified |  Frontier is a joke. I've been dealing with their nonsense for years and it never changes. They are always late. Never leaving on time, never arriving on time. Totally unreliable. Yes, they have cheap fares but you will more than pay for it with your wasted time and frustration. Completely incompetent and an absolute joke of a company. Futhermore, they do not care and do not want to get better.

### "refuse to refund"
Absolutely horrible airline. They overbooked the seats and denied us at the gate. They couldn't find another departure flight for us at the check-in desk. We were told to submit a form to get refunds for the return flight but later they denied everything and refuse to refund or give credit for the return flight.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. They don't know what communication is. They changed the gates at the last minute and announced 5 mins before closing time. No message. No mail communication. None whatsoever. When asked why they have communicated, nobody responded. When I was persistent for an answer, they denied entry to the flight. When asked why, they said because they can and there is nothing I can do about it. Their staff won't speak to you when spoken to. They talk at you, not to you. At the end they denied entry to my flight even though I was there 40 mins prior. Didn't issue a refund. They think they can treat anybody however they want without any repercussions. I am writing this at 1AM at the airport. I have to sleep here till next morning. I had to book another flight which cost me a fortune. Frontier airlines is the worst.

### "the worst airline to fly"
This is about the worst airline to fly. Customer service is a zero. All they are concerned about is making money which is not even worth the troubles. They are nothing to write home about. No human relations, no compassion. Staffs are frowning faces, they are not organized. Customers complaining every here and there. What a shame. Will never fly it again. They are not actually cheap after all. You pay the remaining through your luggage.

### “Haven't flown since and never will”
Not Verified | Frontier has the longest line to check bags, I was standing in the hour long line and they didn't announce that they were calling bags for my flight to be checked first/skip the line and then denied checking my bag so I couldn't take my flight despite being plenty early and my flight being delayed. I called customer service who was EXTREMELY rude, got passed around from one person to another and after an hour they hung up on me. Haven't flown since and never will.

### “closed the gate and wouldn’t let me board”
They tried to charge me for the same baggage on my fourth flight, even though I had flown with it three times before without any issues. When I refused to pay, they closed the gate and wouldn’t let me board. This airline felt more like an animal transport truck than a passenger service.

### "I was overcharged $780"
Do expect to be overcharged. Do expect unfriendly employees. Do not expect vouchers for hotel if flight is changed. Do expect the flight to be changed. Do not pay for any bundle as it is not honored. I was overcharged $780 because of a canceled flight that was not refunded or reissued. I had to buy 2 one way tickets to get home.

### “shockingly rude and belligerent”
I am used to flying Frontier once a week and I am always baffled at the negative reviews because of the baggage policies. I mean, you should know what you’re getting into with an ultra low cost carrier. I bought a hard-shell bag that I know for sure fits in their compartment and even though they make me measure regularly, which is a hassle, it fits. However, after what happened this last week, I will never fly them again. I was in line boarding flight 4112 from Phoenix to Cincinnati on Thursday 10/17. The two gate attendants were directing almost everyone to measure their bags, as per usual. But they were incredibly, shockingly rude and belligerent to customers. One young girl’s bag hung out by about a strap and she opened it and took out a sweater and put it on, the flight attendant started screaming at her “you’re not allowed to put on any more clothes”. Pretty sure that’s not a rule. The other attendant was harassing a man who barely spoke English that his bag, which was super light, was going to need to be paid because “it’s not the weight you’re paying for, it’s the space”. He barely understood her so she aggressively pushed him and his wife and kids in the direction of the bag sizer. Then starts screaming, and I mean literally screaming, at everyone still in line: the gate is about to close and all of you all still measuring bags are not getting on! Mind you, this is a full 20 minutes BEFORE the scheduled gate close. We all just stood there, shocked. So this man from before pays for his bag and gets on, but his wife and kids were stuck in the line behind us, and the gate attendant closes the gate door behind him! When he realized what was happening he opened the door from inside the ramp to get back out to his family, and of course the alarm goes off. She starts loudly cursing “What would you do that for” and pushed him aside, gets his wife and kids out of the line and tells them to wait for the supervisor. So we all get on the plane, since she now had the door back open. As we file past her, one customer tells her, in a very nice tone “look, I know your job is stressful, but there is no need to treat people like this, we are all just doing our best”, to which she responds “I really don’t give a F…”. Poor man was shocked. So we all get seated and after a little while, the open-the-door-guy and his family get on board, so I assume all is well. WRONG. When the flight landed, 5 cops were waiting for him at the gate because “he opened the door and that’s a TSA violation”. I don’t know what happened to him from there but this was NOT his fault, the belligerent flight attendant was completely at fault for closing the gate door for literally no reason, 20 minutes before the boarding closing time, separating him from his family. I would have opened that door too, to get back to my family. Based on what I saw and heard, I will never fly them again. In fact, I fly once a week for work and I just rebooked my flights through the end of the year on American. I’m out the Frontier flight costs, but I don’t care, I will not give them another penny of my money or a minute of my time. I know we are all supposed to “obey orders of the flight attendants”, but you don’t mysteriously give up your civil rights because you are in the air or because a flight attendant is having a bad life. Never, ever again.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
This was an uncomfortable flight with seats that did not recline. There are only snacks for sale and I was charged $79 at the gate because my bag (which I bought specifically for this trip based on allowed personal item size) would not fit in their hard, metal unforgiving sizing bin. Just know this, if your bag rolls or is a duffel you will be asked to try and stuff it in the bin and if it doesn’t fit you will be up-charged or denied boarding. Staff was nice enough. Then stuck at gate waiting for sky bridge to dock for 20 minutes. Never flying Frontier again.

### "worst experience I've ever had"
This was the worst experience I've ever had. I flew out of Seattle to Nashville with a 6hr layover in Denver. Last night, every frontier employee was rude and had an attitude. They changed the gate shortly after the posted boarding time. I sprinted to the gate but made it there at 551am. They also didn't do a last call. The flight itinerary says the gate closes at 550. The lady said they closed the door 6 minutes before I got there, which would be 545. I pointed out the fact that they changed the gate last minute, didn't do a final call, closed the door early, and explained that it was necessary for me to be on that flight because I needed to make it to my dads funeral tonight, and the lady said, "That's not my problem. You need to see customer service to get re-booked. So now I'm in line for customer service so they can charge me another $200 that I don't have so I can miss my dad's funeral. Worst flying experience I've ever had,

### "Absolutely the worst service"
I purchased this ticket for my boyfriend. We got up early and got to the airport by 5 am. Bf got on the flight. 30 minutes later bf texts me that the flight is being diverted and chicago isn't being accommodating. Plane gets refueled. 10:08 bf texts me that he's landed and is off the plane and he's waiting to board. It's now 645pm and he has been given many different stories. Flight was cancelled. Bf missed the flight. Flight was cancelled and he had to rebook. Finally got someone in the office to book another flight for tomorrow. Refused a hotel. Refused a meal voucher. Refused everything. Somehow the luggage got sent to Houston via Las Vegas from a flight he never got on. Absolutely the worst service I've ever seen. Meanwhile he has missed dialysis

### "prey on peoples misfortunes"
Not Verified | I was impacted by hurricane Milton as i live in saint Pete, fl. Frontier gave me a credit to rebook flight, during rebook i stated this is contingent that everything is back to normal from Milton. Long story short my son cant go bc of an exam he has to take. I didn't want a refund, i was just going to cancel his ticket and upgrade my flight and add bags. Their response is why i will never fly or recommend frontier. $99 cancellation fee each way (total of $198) and because the ticket was less than that amount they said they will simply cancel the ticket. So, the biggest natural disaster in history for my area but they could not accommodate a minor change (I was literally going to put all the refunded money back into them for upgrade.) This is one of the worst companies because they will prey on peoples misfortunes.

### "pay $99 for a baggage"
Not Verified |   Extremely disappointing and frustrating service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. First flight delayed 2 hours+. But the main issue was the agent whom was scanning my boarding pass at the gate. She threatened me to pay $99 for a baggage that would fit under my seat. If not I would not be able to board the flight. Absolutely un professional and disrespectful. I asked for her last name she declined. Agent right next to her helping also was extremely unprofessional.

### "indicated that my bag was too large"
They price gouge their customers for additional money and won’t take accountability for their actions. I have flown Frontier multiple times and this will be the last time. Not only are they always delayed because they cannot properly allocate their employees, their employees are also the most miserable people to exist. Their literal job is interacting with customers and they are so unprofessional. I flew with them today from Philly to Atlanta and had a a connecting flight in Raleigh. I had no issues with my back back in Philly and it fit perfectly (a little snug) in the personal item bag. When I get to board the flight to Raleigh, they indicated that my bag was too large and I had to pay an at-gate flight even though it DID fit and it has already passed in Philly. When I get on the plane, I put it in overhead because they made me pay for a carry on. The flight attendant asked me to move it to under my seat to make room for larger bags. IF I am forced to move my bag by the flight attendant because it’s small enough for fit under my chair then I shouldn’t be forced to put it underneath my seat. The unprofessionalism and impoverishment really shows on this airline. Please steer clear just pay the additional money to fly another airline and save yourself from the horrors of this mismanaged company that only cares about squeezing you for every dollar they can.

### "sad with this experience"
It is my first experience with frontier airlines and my last time, the 1 checked luggage is expensive, plus very late updates departure, no respect the customer time. I understand safety is number 1 but why before the customer pay ticket give them correct information. I’m sad with this experience.

### "Don’t ever ever book with Frontier"
I booked a flight to Las Vegas in advance on a busy weekend, knowing that if I wait, prices will go up drastically! A flight to Vegas from my city is about one hour long ! Then I get a random email about changes to my flight and when I go to check it tells me that my flight now has a layover. Making it a 7 hour flight instead of 1 hour. I click on the email to learn my options and there are no options. I call because I think it’s for sure spam , there’s no way you’d do that. You don’t talk to people whose flight isn’t the best day. Finally, on the chat on your website I’m able to ask for a call back and I do. You call me back and tell me you can either schedule a flight that leaves at night instead of in the morning, making me miss a FULL DAY, or you can give me a PARTIAL refund. I ask for a supervisor and the rep pretends not to hear me and hangs up on me. Now we are 7 people and a baby, with a hotel and activities booked and no flight. All available flights are double the price they were back when I booked and there is nothing I can do about it. Don’t ever ever book with Frontier. Ever. It’s not worth it.

### "I will avoid Frontier at all cost"
Not Verified | I thought Frontier Airlines couldn't get any worse after raising their carry-on and checked bag cost but now they reduced the bag weight limit to 40 pounds .... if over they charge you ridiculous overages depending on the range. I vow every 3 or 4 years to never fly with them but occasionally figure it has to have improved and give them a try, but never found that to be true. It's the experience you receive from the moment you arrive at their ticket counter for check in etc. Their employees are miserable and appear beat down and it projects to their customers. They act like they hate their job and I would guess with the number of complaints they receive, I would be miserable as well. Starts at the top. Normally fly United exclusively and will make sure from now on, regardless of the situation I will avoid Frontier at all cost. In the end you end up paying more anyway so why not cut out the frustration and pay a little more upfront.

### "denied me boarding"
This is my second bad experience with this airline. The first time, we paid $150 each for priority boarding, but they called all zones at once. When my boyfriend and I pointed out that it wasn’t fair, we were mocked by others, and staff were rude to us throughout the flight, even restricting bathroom access. Today, I had to fly from Salt Lake to Las Vegas for an early meeting. I bought a package with carry-on and priority, but mistakenly didn’t pick a seat. At boarding, they said I didn’t have a seat, so I politely offered to pay for one. When I expressed frustration about the situation, the gate agent got upset and denied me boarding, even though seats were available. Despite my offer to pay more, she singled me out without any respect and consideration. My only word wrong, was: this is crazy, since was 10 ppl without seat. I was referring about the situation not them. Both times I tried to contact customer service has been unhelpful.

### "These products are scams"
Not Verified | We got the Barclays card which was supposed to be affiliated with Frontier. I was never able to link the benefits from Barclays card to the Frontier miles account. It is complete fraud. We spent the amount on the card ($3,000) and were supposed to get free bags, 60,000 miles and free seats. The account number linked to our miles account but it was linked to one that was not our number and we could not access it. Frontier miles does not accept phone calls unless you are elite and since our miles are misdirected, no one will talk to us because we are not matched with an elite number. Thinking this would work, I bought an annual Go Wild Pass. ($600) I have logged in a dozen times to find none of the flights I want or places I want to go have a Go Wild Pass category. It is never an option. I have had the pass over a month and have not been able to take a single flight. These products are scams, they do not do what they say- it does not work. I travel a lot, this has been one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had. To make matters worse, Barclays cannot call Frontier either, and while they apologize they don't help you resolve the problem saying they cannot. Shame on Barclays for partnering with this airline.

### "Terrible flight experiences"
Not Verified | Terrible flight experiences both directions. The initial flight was delayed over 3 hrs, and they refused to refund it even though there is a federal law now saying they have to. When I inquired about it they told me that the law is not yet in effect. I looked up the legislation and showed them right at the top the effective date, which was several months prior. They just shrugged. The return flight, the app was not working to check me in and the employees working the frontier desk told me they were not able to check me in! Even though the flight was not even boarding yet and I had initiated the conversation over 1 hr prior to departure time. I had to miss the flight for absolutely no good reason. They also charged me for a new flight later in the day *without even confirming that is what I wanted,* and without asking if I wanted to apply a $50 voucher I had. I asked them if they would cancel that charge as I had not authorized it and wanted to explore my options, and they told they could not. For both issues they told me I had to call frontier to talk to someone there. I asked, aren't I talking to frontier right now? And they said no you gotta call bc they are technically not employees but rather contractors which is why supposedly they couldn't check me in or help me. They wouldn't even make a call for me to resolve the issues, just sent me on my way. It took me over an hour to finally get a person on the phone with the automated answering machine repeatedly hanging up on me. And when I finally did, they told me only a supervisor can review refunds, and that I could not speak with one at that time but they would submit a form to have someone call me and to make sure to do so before the later flight they charged me for. They never did so. Terrible experience and they have lost a customer for life.

### "they refused to help"
Not Verified | Airline would not let me check in my bag 1 hour and 15 min before the flight, and would not refund me for the extra fees i paid for seats and carry on bags. When i called customer service, they refused to help and would not transfer to even a supervisor. They did not give any information regarding who i was speaking to, or any ph# or contact to file a dispute. They simply said no to everything i requested to resolve the situation. Nobody should ever give any business to this Airline. Im spreading the word!

### "I was treated horribly"
Needed to simply check a bag. Tried using the app because they charge $104 to check even a small 29 lb bag. The app isn't clear on how to do this (should be simple and easy to use). I simply asked the agent for help. She was visibly perturbed by my simple question. I said I had no training on this app. She said "don't get started with me" and said call the cops. I said fine, I'll just check it instead of the app. She refused to do so. I asked for her manager she refused. I was treated horribly.

### "a nightmare of unexpected fees"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience with Frontier Airlines and would give 0 stars if I could. What seemed like a cheap ticket quickly turned into a nightmare of unexpected fees. First, they charge extra for carry-on bags, which is ridiculous! Most airlines include that in the ticket price, but with Frontier, expect to pay up. To make matters worse, my flight was delayed with less than 10 hours' notice, causing major disruptions to my plans. The airline showed no responsibility for this inconvenience. When I tried to reach out for assistance, their customer service was by far the worst I’ve ever encountered — rude, unhelpful, and dismissive. They clearly don’t care about their customers. The whole experience felt like a bait-and-switch. While they advertise low fares, by the time you factor in all the hidden fees, you end up paying way more than you bargained for. Overall, avoid Frontier at all costs if you value your time, money, and sanity!

### "uncomfortable as it could possibly be"
Not Verified | Frontier is charging the highest final price for the worst overall experience. They made every aspect of travel as uncomfortable as it could possibly be, for an outrageous fee. Frontier is guaranteed to arrive late and bring regret.

### "Worst flying experience ever"
Not Verified |  Frontier sent text messages saying our flight was delayed for an hr and 10 mins, about two hrs before the original flight time, they sent another message saying the flight was delayed but had the original flight time on the text. I couldn’t get a confirmation from the airline through chat or calling. So I rush to the airport forced to park in daily parking, get inside and there was no one at the counter, I go to the gate and they were loading the plane. Agent at the gate told me if I miss the flight I would have to pay to get on the next flight even through the airline sent out the message saying the flight was delayed. I had to run back and get my bags and was forced to throw all liquids away in my suitcase to get it through TSA and barely made it on the flight. The gate agent charged me $99 for my bag that I already prepaid for days before my flight. (Frontier eventually refunded the $99 for the bag). Got to my connecting flight in Las Vegas and was delayed there over 3 hours. They said there were some issues with the plane. Worst flying experience ever. Called the customer support, they ended up also giving me $100 voucher to fly with them again.

### “the worst customer service experiences”
Not Verified | Frontier cares that I’m lean. Both in my wallet and my waist circumference. Let me explain First, the obnoxious bag charges - $69 dollars for a 40 lb bag and then $75 for a single pound over? Ridiculous! Even with the front desk, don’t expect them to let it slide. You’re 100% better off skipping this “budget” airline and going with an airline that actually cares about service and the customer experience. Thanks! Next - they care about me being fit and trim. Why else would they have their plane fly out of the last gate of Tom Bradley even though the check in is at Terminal 1! They obviously wanted me to get in my 10,000 steps before my flight and have me walk a mile to the international side even though it was a domestic 2.5 hr flight to Colorado. On top of that, they made their seats extra small and uncomfortable so that way you’d be motivated to lose weight to make more room. For reference I’m average build, I am 5’9” and 185lbs. Thanks Frontier! You even inspired me to dust off my writing skills just to leave this lovely review. I don’t even normally leave a bad review if I have bad experience, but this will classify as one of the worst customer service experiences with the business I’ve ever had. For anyone reading this do yourself a favor and don’t bother with Frontier. Go to a different airline.

### “strongly recommend not to fly with them”
Not Verified | My first flight was a headache, get there with still 50 minutes before my flight left and was told couldn't board it and was told that I had to buy an extra ticket. Paid almost an extra 100 dollars for my second flight then after I showed up, they are telling me that I apparently cancelled it. They couldn't do nothing about it and that I need to get in touch with customer service which is mainly just a machine with no real person. Got no refund, was also told that for me to get to my dentation I would have to buy another set of tickets so out of close to 300 for four tickets and not able to be there for my daughter's birthday, strongly recommend not to fly with them.

### “Worst customer service”
Not Verified | They are taking people for money. $80 for a carry-on and $20 to have someone help you to check in! Worst customer service. Totally rude, inconsiderate, disrespectful, not helpful. I've never had anyone made me feel so dumb for asking a simple question. I’ve flown with Frontier 5 times. Trust me I try and avoid them but it's my last resort. Every time it's a nightmare! Avoid this airline even if you have to pay $50 more for another airline. So worth it.

### “disrespectful and unprofessional”
Not Verified | I had the absolute worst experience with Frontier Airlines. I arrived at the airport well before my flight, but they closed the gate an hour before departure without any communication or warning about this policy. Because of this, I missed my cousin's funeral—a once-in-a-lifetime event I’ll never get back. To make matters worse, the staff, especially the lady at the gate, was incredibly rude and dismissive. Instead of offering any help or understanding, she was disrespectful and unprofessional. Frontier Airlines clearly doesn’t care about their customers or their situations. I will never fly with them again, and I don’t recommend anyone else does either.

### "Horrible service"
Horrible service. 7 Bag check in attendants were just standing around and talking. Then when i got up to the front the attendant left to take a personal call. The other 6 workers there kept talking and ignored the line. Flight was delayed twice. First due to crew. Then the pilot just didn't want to board passengers. The baggage measurement tools are inaccurate. The same baggage at the KPHL scales weighed 4 pounds more in KMCO. Not worth the price.

### "disrespectful, miserable, and unhelpful"
I wouldn’t event give this one star if I had the option. Literally the worst experience I’ve ever had flying. The staff is disrespectful, miserable, and unhelpful.

### "fly anyone but Frontier Airlines"
Literally fly anyone but Frontier Airlines. Their flights are the cheapest for a reason, the people are so unbelievably slow and unhelpful. They do not want to work there and it shows. You will end up spending more money and more chances than not, they won’t even let you on the flight. I’ve flown on countless of planes and this was by far the worst worst worst experience I’ve ever had. Spare yourself and trust the other reviews. Customer service won’t help you, they don’t care about any conditions or your situation at all.

### “It was chaos”
I have bone on bone arthritis and had to stand on the tar Mac for twenty minutes while they took people up the ramp two by two. There is no connecting skyway so one has to climb from the ground to the plane door which is not a short distance. This would have been fine if I had not had to stand on my knee and then make the climb with a backpack strapped to my back. The “service crew” did nothing but watch me struggle, and didn’t lift a finger to help me put my backpack in the overhead bin. Why these people couldn’t have been brought up after all had boarded the plane is beyond me. It was chaos.

### "never fly on this airline again"
Frontier is poorly staffed and disorganized. On March 24th, 2024 I was involuntarily denied boarding to a flight operated by Frontier. I had flown to Atlanta as a layover, and was denied boarding to the second leg of my flight. According to the department of transportation's regulations, I am entitled to a refund when I am involuntarily denied boarding or the flight is delayed more than 3 hours. I uploaded an email proving that the new flight I was scheduled on was delayed by more than 3 hours. The staff did not follow the department of transportation's guidelines, and blatantly lied to my credit card company about bumping me. Staff were asking ME questions about Frontier's policies, as Frontier uses contracted employees at their gates who know very little about customer service. I'll never fly on this airline again, and I'd encourage anyone considering it not to take the risk. It just isn't worth the hassle to save a little money.

### "I've never heard such nonsense"
Not Verified |  We've landed and have been sitting on the plane and taxiing about for over 30 minutes because Frontier has no disembarkment gate booked! They told us the gate they were scheduled to use was being used! In all my 40+ years of flying, I've never heard such nonsense. It's now going to 9pm for a flight that landed at 7.45pm and the people who were supposed to pick me have had to return home as they have a child with them. I'm now having to arrange an uber instead for when we're finally off this plane!! !

### "got bumped from the flight"
Not Verified |  Coming home, was at an entirely different airport which wasn't made clear at all. Luckily I had enough time to get to the other airport. Turns out I missed the 2 hour check in window (? ), so got bumped from the flight. Cost big $ to catch a flight the next day. Will never happen again.

### "flight attendants were awful"
Not Verified |  Every step of the way and in every stop the flight attendants were awful. First 25 bucks to print my ticket? It was already 200 for just one standard suitcase. The last trips attendants are a breath of fresh air. First flight since half empty i asked if we could spread out into the untaken seats. Man said hell check on it- im watching for a signal. He comes up to me and projects his voice saying “Still dont know we see you eyeing me!! And people laugh with him. Ok F U. Not even that bad. 1st Returning flight- 6 am. This older flight attendant starts getting angry and raising her voice “sir you need to wake up and listen to our presentation. Maam you need to put your phone up to listen to me. Sir I know you heard me put your phone up. We were so shocked at her behavior like a teacher on an ego trip . Who wakes people up multiple times? While already done with their run throughs? Let people live their lives we aren’t children. So last flight has a 8 hour layover. I sit and I wait for 8 hours. In the same spot. I don't fall asleep. A few hours in I go to a Frontier desk that has no public sitting in the terminal. I go up to ask a question. Actually-I go up to ask who I can ask. Ask I walk up she shuts the door while a man is shouting and running to make it. She smiles and slams it shut and then refuses to help him in any way. Then my turn. I said “Hello do you know who I can talk to about if they every found an earlier connecting flight they mentioned” She said “maam I'm standing here that means in doing my own flights so you're gonna have to go. I ask Flight Info and they said no. Totally fine. 8 hours comes up and we are waiting. 2 girls on a completely different shift, laughed to themselves and pull me out of line. You can step put of line now. put your bag in the box” What the same bag I've had for three flights untouched -  halfway goes in. he other younger girl just shrugs. i grab my jacket out. She shakes her head. I reposition it and it goes in more. I look around “how is that?. I push it down and it goes in and all the way, all they did was roll their eyes disappointingly making a hand movement. I ended up just running in due to the fact they kept me up for no reason and went on. A joke truly. For my first solo connecting flight into a city I haven't been before, very disappointing and scary. Lady attendant named Justin from philly going to nashville 9/16/24 you made all the difference!

### "experience was far from satisfactory"
I recently flew with Frontier Airlines on September 13th, 2024, from San Diego to Missoula, with a layover in Denver. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. During my layover in Denver, I was informed that my personal item bag exceeded the size limit and was charged $99.00. This was despite the fact that the same bag had been allowed on my departing flight. This inconsistency was frustrating enough, but the situation was further aggravated by the delayed flight in Denver and a problematic boarding process where nearly every passenger was forced to measure their bags. It felt as though the priority was more on making extra profit rather than addressing the delay efficiently.

### "extremely unprofessional"
Not Verified |  We had a personal bag that didn't fit into their size machine due to the plastic wheels. My husband finally offered to pay for the bag, but needless to say was frustrated, and slapped his credit card on the counter. He never raised his voice and apologized numerous times. They finally said we could board the plane, but had closed the gate door. When my husband went to open it, the woman became very belligerent, belittling him, asking , "Is this your house?". She then refused to let him board the plane, telling him it was a "done deal" and we'd have to rebook our flights for 6:25am the next morning, at an additional $360 per person. I'm 70 yrs old, he's 68. Hardly a flight risk. This woman just was looking for a fight and had to show she was boss. These people are extremely unprofessional. Guess that's why they have cheap flights. I will never again fly Frontier.

### "ticket that they never gave me"
Please be careful with this airline and try to avoid buying tickets with Frontier as much as possible. I bought a ticket from San Juan Puerto Rico to Miami (round trip) through their website and they charged me the money but I never received the confirmation and the locator of my reservation, so I had to buy another ticket with the same airline, with exactly the same route and at the same time, receiving immediate confirmation of my second booking with the record locator. I called the airline dozens of times to ask for a refund for the first ticket that they charged me and that they never gave me and several months have passed without them giving me a response about the refund of my money ($359). A real scam, they charged me for a ticket that they never gave me and I had to buy another ticket with the same route and at the same time. Irresponsible. I tried calling the airline for many times and many days and weeks, but unless you're a sky's miles member you can't talk to a representative. The platform chat system goes in a loop without result it's just an Al.

### "website unnecessarily delayed me"
Not Verified |  I spent 45 minutes attempting to get my boarding pass. Frontier kept sending me in circles and kept asking me for a new password. I must have changed my password 5 or 6 times. I left for Midway and the counter person said "You should have showed up 2 hours early. Two supervisors  told me I'd have to pay $250 to get on an afternoon flight. I explained that if their web site was working properly, I would have been on time for the 12:36PM Flight on 9/9. Both said you have to pay because we can't put on a flight without a paid ticket. I explained that Frontiers website unnecessarily delayed me. Both said pay $250 or no go. Neither of the ladies were solution oriented. I am a clergyman and a retired Police Inspector. I am a solution oriented professional. Your policies need to expand to accommodate weary travelers looking for good treatment. I do not plan on using Frontier in the future. I have never dealt with an Airline as messed up as Frontier.

### "Very disappointed"
We purchased two tickets to travel to MCO and even though the tickets were purchased in the same transaction, Frontier Airline decided to sit us in separate seats, once at the airport in Puerto Rico, we asked the gate agent if we could sit together and she advised that the reason why we were not seated together is because is a company strategy so passengers can be charge for seating together. Now, on our return flight 2982 we noticed the same pattern so we decided to purchase even more legroom seats, once in the application, we noticed that within seconds the prices changed from $42 to $73 dollars. We approached the counter, where we were not even greeted by the clerk, as I was explaining the issue regarding the prices, he talked over me advising me that it was usual for the prices to change drastically from one moment to another and to purchase them quickly on the application cause his prices were going to be more expensive, after that, he took a look at my partner and advised me that we couldn't purchase the seats on the exit road due to the fact that my partner did not speak English and would not be able to assist in case of an emergency. Which is inaccurate because my partner speak English. He dismissed us quickly once my partner spoke to him in English. We stepped to the side and purchase the exit road seats. Not even a minute after we requested his assistance for those seats which we paid $73 dollars, the clerk made an announcement that he needed 4 volunteers to seat on the emergency road, after, he proceeds to look at us and mischievously smile. Honestly this Frontier Airline experience has left us with very little desire to ever fly with Frontier Airlines ever again. Very disappointed with the company policies and disrespectful employees.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly this airline again. We were at the check-in desk in Detroit 62 minutes pre-departure, and were given the option of checking in online or at desk (for a fee). We gave the agent out passports and asked if there was time for us to checkin online and she said there was. However, we weren't able to download the app, so decided to pay the checkin fee and gave her my credit card. About a minute later, we were told that she wasn't able to check us in since the two minutes had expired and check-in had closed. Offered to be rebooked on a flight the following day for an additional $250. Highly unethical.

### "experience was horrible"
I bought a ticket for my cat in their website. At the moment of the purchase they didn’t inform me of the new rules or anything, they just let me buy it. When I arrived at the airport they told me I couldn’t fly with my cat. They told me that it was an error of the website, and it shouldn’t have let me bought the ticket. The supervisor couldn’t help me and only told he couldn’t do nothing and that I couldn’t board the plane. The experience was horrible. I ask for a refund and I hope they give it to me because I couldn’t get on the plane.

### "Customer service does not exist"
Not Verified | I had issues checking in. When I decided to get help at the desk, I was told I would be charged $25 to get my boarding pass printed. I decided to try the kiosk again. No luck because, unlike other airlines you HAVE to have the confirmation number, which I could not find on ANY of the emails I received. Long story short I missed my flight. The young lady was cold and didn't care about my dilemma. I was told only a supervisor could help and I just had to wait for her to come out the back. She said oh, she has on a white shirt? Once I saw her she didn't even look directly at me while she was talking but she couldn't help. They were trying to put me on a flight where I wouldn't get home until the next day with a layover in ATL for $400. What! This left me with no option on Frontier. I had to catch a flight on another airline for the next day. Customer service does not exist at Frontier Airlines!

### “Stay away from Frontier Airlines”
Not Verified | Stay away from Frontier Airlines. On 9/2/24 my wife and I were scheduled to travel on a direct flight from MIA to CLT at 8:00am arriving at 10:00am, 2 hour flight. This was only our second time flying with Frontier. Our first flight was fine but I did witness employee rudeness as stated by our reviewers. Well we got up at 5 in the morning the day of the flight which was scheduled leave MIA at 8:00am. After going out to meet our Uber driver for our ride to the airport I noticed a text message at 1:05am from Frontier canceling our flight and offer us the ability to book another flight. After searching for another flight, Frontier had no flight on the same day and did not offer the same flight/time any other day. Only thing available were connecting flights in the evening with the range from 6 hours to 21 hour flights the following day. There is no customer service number where you can get a live person on the phone. We had no choice, we had to be at our destination on the 3rd and flying on another day was not an option. After paying a cancelation fee for the Uber, and researching our options with other airlines to fly out that day, which was cost prohibited, we ended up renting a car and driving 15 hours to get to our destination. I have been flying over 40 years, other than for weather, I had never experienced a flight cancelation on the same day. Again, I have always flown with a major carrier and we were trying out Frontier because of cost. Well I WILL NEVER FLY with Frontier again.

### "can't get customer phone service"
Not Verified |  If you aren't paying for elite status, you can't get customer phone service. Ran into this recently. I'm active duty military and got an unexpected extra couple of days to be home with family, so I thought I'd change my flight. No big deal right? Not a chance. It literally cost me less to just buy a new plane ticket than to change my flight. Figured that out from what felt like a robotic customer service representative. Cheap flight my behind. Went to check in and there were bag check kiosks! . Because I hadn't added my bag to my list of stuff I had to do extra steps and eventually just went to the representatives to which I was witness to another customer who flight issues that he was trying to resolve and the representative who he was speaking to was less than helpful and stone walled him for a lack of a better phrase. The line grew and another representative was helping other customers, but was ignoring the growing group. I asked the gentleman and to his credit he quickly asked if I was adding bags or active military. To both I said yes. He then told me to go back to the line I was standing in as that was for those people and quickly went back to doing what he was doing. Finally another rep opened a kiosk and finally myself and others could check our bags. The lady was standoffish and less than pleased with the situation. I'll give grace for the hour of the morning, but come on. Thankfully everything else went as smooth as most airports are today. If it wasn't for the fact that I could dodge the bag fees, I can only imagine the nightmare that flying this airline would be. My only other gripe was during boarding. Usually most airlines call all people with disabilities, families, and active duty military to pre board. This didn't happen on this flight. Small gripe and not a big deal, but come on.

### “whole experience was unpleasant”
I booked through Expedia and then frontier changed my flight to a later time, weeks prior to my trip. Once arriving at Portland airport- a very rude frontier employee said I couldn’t check my luggage in until 2 hours of the flight and gave no additional advice or information. When it was time to check in our luggage, a different frontier employee was somewhat nice but definitely charged us as much as she could for an overweight bag plus a $5 fee. I even let her know this was my first time flying frontier and I feel she took advantage of that to charge me al the added fees. Then upon boarding the aircraft, no flight attendant was smiling. They all looked unfriendly. During the flight, there talked to us like little kids and we needed to follow directions. There was NO drink service unless you want to buy something? Frontier literally charges for EVERY single thing. Then they proceeded to speak about their credit card miles and how everything is FREE if you sign up. This was 30 minutes before landing. The whole experience with frontier was unpleasant. Even the seats were cheap & we got half a table tray to put a cup of water on. I will never fly with frontier ever again. Do better, train your employees better.

### “Total bait and switch”
Not Verified | I booked a direct flight on Frontier's website. Now they are telling me that my itinerary has been changed. Instead of having a direct (2 hour) flight from SLC to San Francisco, I now have been bumped to a layover in Colorado (and then on to San Fran). The travel is going to take 6 hours instead of 2 hours, which is going to be a huge pain because I'm traveling with children. Total bait and switch. Not even sure how this can be legal.

### “No voucher, no reimbursement, no apology”
Was at initial gate (T17) at 3PM waiting. At 4:17PM received text that flight was delayed until an estimated 5:30PM. Following this, another text was received that the gate has been changed to concourse T. We immediately took the train to the gate to find that the flight left on time despite the change in location and flight time. No help was given at gate or Frontier desk. Was told to purchase another two tickets at my expense for a flight two days later. Checked luggage was presumably sent to MSP. We purchased a one way ticket to ORD with Frontier and booked a rental car from there to get to MSP. No voucher, no reimbursement, no apology. Get to MSP to find that luggage was at ORD and was told via voicemail that we could come retrieve it in Chicago. Phone number left to call on voicemail goes to dial tone after one ring. Two additional flights, additional checked luggage, a car rental, among other expenses unplanned for.

### "definitely do not recommend them"
Frontier moved my return flight to two days earlier without informing me, and they would not move it to the original date and time without a charge of $335. In addition, their baggage fees are extremely expensive. I will never fly with this airline again and I definitely do not recommend them.

### "extremely dissatisfied with the service"
Not Verified |  On July 29, 2024, at 1:02 PM, I purchased four airline tickets from Frontier Airlines' website for travel from Baltimore, Maryland (BWI) to Chicago. The scheduled departure was set for Friday, August 16, 2024, at 7:40 PM, with an arrival time of 8:36 PM the same day. On August 15, 2024, at 7:48 PM, I received a confirmation email instructing me to check in for the flight, with the departure and arrival times as initially mentioned. However, on August 16, 2024, at 3:21 PM, I received an email and text message notifying me of a flight delay. The revised schedule indicated a new departure time of 8:39 PM on August 16 and an arrival time of 8:08 PM on August 17, resulting in a total flight duration of 24 hours, which I found unusual. Upon arriving at the airport at 7:15 PM, I waited at the counter for approximately 15 minutes. During this time, four Frontier Airlines employees were present but did not offer assistance. After 15 minutes, a staff member informed me that she was no longer serving customers. Eventually, another employee assisted me and advised that boarding passes were only required for TSA screening. We proceeded through TSA and reached the gate listed both on the monitor and in my email by 8:15 PM. At 8:39 PM, it was concerning that boarding had not yet begun, and no announcements had been made regarding the flight. I went to the counter, where another passenger was already inquiring about the same issue. The attendant rudely informed us that the Chicago flight had already departed. When I questioned how this was possible given the delay notifications, the attendant claimed no such emails had been sent. Despite showing the email and text notifications on our phones, the attendant became increasingly agitated, asserting that the flight had left a long time ago and that it was fully booked. This was perplexing, as only five passengers were present at the counter. I requested a refund on August 17, 2024, at 1:56 PM, but it was denied. I am extremely dissatisfied with the service, as it did not meet expectations and was poorly communicated. Furthermore, it was difficult to reach a live representative to address these issues. Overall, my experience with Frontier Airlines was exceptionally poor. I rate the service as a negative on a scale from 1 to 10, given the lack of accommodation, unclear communication, and inadequate handling of the situation.

### “this airline will leave you stranded”
Not Verified | This is the worst airline ever, please don't be like me and ignore the reviews and book, take my advice, this airline will leave you stranded at the airport. Thanks to Frontier I missed two very important events a celebration of life for my late nephew and my birthday party planned with my whole family. You just don't know how hurt I am, I will probably never get over this. I lost my whole day, I hate that I put my trust in this company. I guess they feel like they make it up to you by giving you a 20.00 food credit. I would rather starve or pay 200.00 a meal before accepting that meal. I guess they think Two people can eat off of 20.00 at the airport! Is about ridiculous. Who ever reads this please, don't use this airline, pay the extra money so you can have a piece of mind and not be worried about being stranded in an airport far away from home.

### "deliberately gives false information"
Frontier deliberately gives false information on your flight in hopes you will cancel your flight. They wait until everyone is at the gate before canceling or delaying flights. First flight at 9 AM was canceled. Second attempt to fly out was at 2:30 pm and got delayed until 8 PM. Then they showed us itinerary that said 8 PM flight would take 17 hours to fly from Orlando to Atlanta. This is clearly a joke! I'm sure this is the case for every airline. The department of transportation 2024 and the secretary of transportation is a complete failure to the American people. This never happened 4 years ago. Worse than covid. I will never book a ticket on an airline ever again.

### "worst customer experiences"
Not Verified |  I am in Business Consulting and I have rarely seen such a poorly run company. Why they have so many employees standing around doing nothing screams manual processes and no integrated systems. One of the top 10 worst customer experiences I have ever had. You are not allowed to speak to anyone in customer service over the phone unless you have an upcoming flight within 24 hours or within the last 24 hours. So if you need something rectified, good luck. Not going to happen. Ended up paying way more than if I flew United or American. Flight was delayed 4 hours and no one seems to know when the flight is taking off.

### "they extort money from you"
I knew Frontier was a no frills, fees happy airline. But this last trip was my last. I booked flight third party as I always have. I knew there would be carryon fees, baggage fees, seating fees, etc. having flown Frontier in the past. At check in screen asks to bundle fees or continue without bundle. This was a lie! It would not let me proceed without a bundle. It had various options I choose the least expensive $121 per traveler. Because they already had me over the barrel for the bundle I added seat upgrade to exit row $9each (very reasonable). My cart total was $502 in addition to the $327.94 I had already paid for airfare. Can you math with me… $327.94 airfares + $121(for the bundle you had no choice but take) per traveler ($242) + $9 exit seat per traveler ($18) = $587.94. I got charged $502 at check in bringing the cost for traveling to $829.94. Where did to other $242 come from you ask? When I called customer service they told me the bundle was each way, so on the round trip airfare I had purchased was not $121 (bundle you have no choice but purchase) but $242 per passenger. I could have paid less for flights on almost any other airline and had a padded seat with even minimal food and beverage service, all which I already knew was not part of flying on Frontier and was willing to go without for the cheaper cost. Buyer beware. I should have known better I have flown them in the past. The new wrinkle is the forced bundle and hidden each way. It will be interesting if you fly Frontier how they extort money from you. I learned the lesson no more Frontier Airlines! Burn me once shame on me, you won’t get to burn me twice!

### "you are likely to spend more"
Not Verified |   This is the worst trip I have ever taken, and it will be my last one choosing Frontier. The airline canceled the flight schedule for ~5:40 p.m., 4 hours before the flight, and they never emailed or messaged the passengers. When you tried to check in, there was an error, and you didn't know why. The only time to find this out was when you physically checked in at the airport, and they told you the flight had been canceled, and the alternative was two days later, and there was no guarantee for the rescheduled flight. When you want to save money by using this cheap one, think twice; you are likely to spend more and have a headache managing the last-minute changes, which you will surely know better if you use other airlines if there is a cancellation.

### "absolutely no complaints whatsoever"
Amidst all the negative reviews for this airline, here is a positive. Short flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco, #F93307 on 29 July. Ground and cabin staff most helpful and friendly, short delay in departing LAX, but on-time arrival in SFO. Seats reasonably comfortable for a low cost airline. Did the job well in getting to destination, absolutely no complaints whatsoever.

### "delayed over an hour and 30 minutes"
Delayed over an hour and 30 minutes on a "signature", first they said 5-10mins. No food or beverage. No refund. Very unacceptable. Lack of communication. Almost as if the airlines forget your actually working for the customer. Without our payment for tickets, you would be out of business. Next time get your "signatures" prior to take off time. This is ridiculous. I'm actually still sitting on the plane as I write this. This is a frustrating reason for a nearly two hour delay. A signature, you can get signatures thru apps nowadays, you don't need to fax it and physically run it over by foot. Won't be flying here again unless it's free.

### "demonstrated staggering incompetence"
Not Verified | I would not trust this company with a can of soda. They have demonstrated staggering incompetence. And the problem is when something goes wrong and in this case they did everything wrong on their own with no help from weather. They don't have humans that are capable of sorting anything out or helping people because they do not believe in customer service. We're going like I'm finding the evening started after going through security and getting to the gate on time for a red eye. They announced they don't have a pilot. They've had over a year to plan for this flight and they don't have a pilot. Tech on 2 hours for that. Then they board us and come in and yell that we all have to get off. Very rudely pushing us off the plane because their seat map is wrong. They've got the wrong flight. After hurting us out like cattle and they're condescending insults, they afford us again. After we board for the second time we sit stranded for an hour because they can't figure out how to push an airplane back. Don't trust them with your money. Don't trust them with your life. Stay away from this company until they fold up and leave the world a better place.

### "an abysmal experience"
I recently had an abysmal experience at Denver Airport. From start to finish, the customer service was shockingly poor and utterly disrespectful. First, the staff behaved as if we were traveling for free, making us feel like a burden rather than valued customers. The most appalling part was the disrespectful behavior towards families. Despite my 11-year-old child being visibly upset and in tears, the staff seemed to find humor in our distress, laughing and showing no empathy. When confronted, they argued with us instead of offering any assistance or apology. Their badges were deliberately flipped around to hide their identities, making it impossible to report specific individuals for their unacceptable behavior. This experience was beyond disappointing.

### "one minute past the 1 hr early mark"
Not Verified |   My wife and kids had a flight at 530 in the morning. They showed up 1 hrs early and the front desk wouldn't take their baggage or check them in because they were one minute past the 1 hr early mark. Now they are charging an extra $600 to rebook. What a scam. Do not use this airline! They are money hungry and have no clue what customer service is. Funny thing is, we have used this airline in the past and have had no issues. Whatever changed is horrible and i can assure you that We will never use this airline again.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |   Nice new aircraft but still have horrible customer service both boarding and onboard. Truly nasty people. They snarled at me. I am 74 years old and don’t like their attitude.

### "they just want your money"
Was charged for a bag that was not mine as my wife gets free carry on bag. Was being nice and said I would hold it for her. She got on first since she’s active military and I was done three. Upon the airline crew calling my group (3) they said I needed to pay for the bag. I explained the situation but they said I had to pay 99$ to get on anyways and I had a problem, to dispute it later. The staff were rude and did not try to help or understand the situation. Will not fly with them again and on top of this issue, they are always rude, and are not helpful. There is nothing on the flight that they give out and it seems they just want your money.

### "customer service is the worst"
Not Verified |   This airline is a joke. I was trying to reach PHL before my father passed away. On my outbound flight, they took me to BWI and left me there. I had to get a rental car to get to my final destination, arriving right before my father passed away. On my return, they flew me to CLE for a 6 hour layover. One hour before my flight, it was cancelled. The only return option was the next evening, connecting through LAS with a 12 hour layover and then to SLC. I ended up cancelling my flight and drove all the way across country in 24 hours so I could get back to work. The customer service is the worst I've ever seen. You can't talk to a real person unless your flight is in 24 hours or you flew within 24 hours. The fees are outrageous. I actually watched a flight attendant say in a very abrupt manner that a passenger in the exit row "can't fly in that seat if you can't speak English", after which she sent him to the back of the plane. A manager in PHL told me I was "creating too much work for him". By the end of the flight I had gone from a $1600 fare for 4 passengers round trip to over $3200. And we never even arrived at either destination. How has the FAA and/or the BBB not shut these people down?

### "I am deeply disappointed"
My experience with Supervisor at Pittsburgh was extremely negative. I arrived at the airport at 4:30 am for a 7:20 am flight, checked in the night before, and found no one at the bag drop counter. I had to bring my bag through TSA due to long lines and lost all my toiletries. By 6 am, I printed my bag tag but was told by the agent that I arrived too late. Despite being at the counter until 6 am, the agent claimed staff arrived at 6:05 am and blamed me for missing my flight. She was rude, dismissive, and loudly argued with me in front of other customers. She also attempted to charge me extra despite having a bag tag. Her behavior included publicly training an employee with misinformation and making jokes about my situation. Overall, I am deeply disappointed with Frontier’s customer service and leadership.

### "misuse of power and mistreatment"
Departing flight was delayed due to flight attendant being late for flight. I was checked in and at the end of line to board. I had my purse and earlier purchased bag with airport merchandise. Agent stated that my purchased merchandise will be considered as a carry on and will not be allowed on the plain. I explained the situation to the agent. After all nowhere on your website policy does it state that airport purchased merchandise will be considered as a carry on luggage. Agent insisted and while puting my purce in the bag with merchandise I laughed loudly. I placed consolidated bag in the meaduring section. It fit without any issues. However another agent, who's name she refused to give me took me aside and said that I insulted the agent, was misbehaving and will be punished for my behavior. I asked for a manager, and while female agent called manager I could see that boarding was coming to the end. I requested to board the plane instead of waiting for manager to arrive and write an online complaint instead. The agent kept repeating that I misbehaved and will have to wait for manager, while she pushed me backwards. A manager arrived and stayed that I will not be alliwed to board. I asked her to provide the reason. She responded that I was disrespectful and pushe the agent. She refused to further speak with me nor look at me. The flight departed and I was not allowed to rebook flight. I have filmed the exchange with both an agent who accused me of misbehaving for laughing at the situation and the manager who absolutely refused to help. I was forced to spend the night in the airport and purchase a flight home on another airline, all because Gate agent didn't like me laughing sarcastically, costing me additional $179.00 and the loss of return airfare, as well as emotional distress. I was flying roundrip from SFO to San Antonio and back in one day. This was completely unnecessary misuse of power and mistreatment of passenger by denying boarding.

### "never use Frontier Airlines again"
I would give Frontier Airlines a rating of -5 if it were possible. My recent experiences with them have been nothing short of dreadful. Two weeks ago, I flew from San Francisco to Dallas, while my brother's family flew from LA to Dallas. Both flights were absolutely horrible and not worth it, even if they were free. The 3½-hour flight felt like torture. The cheap plastic seats are untillable, making it impossible to get any sleep. To make matters worse, they don’t even serve drinks. A man on my flight, who seemed to be suffering from dehydration, asked the attendant for a cup of water and was simply rejected with the explanation that we were landing in 30 minutes. On our way back on July 13th, only Frontier's system was down at the airport. Many flights were canceled, and the airport was packed with people waiting in line, hoping to get new boarding passes or bookings. Some passengers even collapsed, requiring police and firemen to respond. After waiting two hours from 6 to 8 pm, Frontier personnel announced that the LAX flight was delayed by three hours. My brother's family needed to return that day, and they were fortunately able to purchase tickets to LA from American Airlines. I later requested a refund from Frontier. They rejected the refund, claiming their plane departed less than three hours later, despite Frontier personnel announcing the three-hour delay and the uncertainty of the flight's departure. Frontier personnel even gave us a card with instructions to request a refund via their app. As for my experience, I waited from 6 pm to 11 pm to finally get a boarding pass, went through security, and ran to the gate only to find out that the flight to San Francisco was canceled. I had to stay all night and half of the next day at the airport. Given all the suffering we endured, and the significant amount we had to pay for alternative tickets, the least Frontier could do is refund the original ticket amount. They rejected that request as well. Moreover, it's impossible to communicate with them for any issue. It's just incredibly horrible. I will never use Frontier Airlines again in my life, even if it's free.

### "get what you pay for with Frontier"
Not Verified |   I had bought my son a ticket to fly from CVG airport to Dallas Fort Worth. He was going to meet his sister and help her drive home from her clinical rotation in Shreveport. He was at CVG at 5:00 am but was denied entry to the plane. Frontier staff closed the plane 90 seconds before he arrived at the gate. My son had his ticket and boarding pass. There were many other passengers on this flight who were also denied entry. He was then pressured to purchase a different flight which would make him wait over 6 hours in the Charlotte airport and arrive in Dallas close to midnight .... with a $125 flight change charge. I cannot reach anyone at Frontier for 2 reasons: I am not one of their Elite members and it is Sunday. I have logged a complaint and refund request, but I have little hope of receiving any contact from Frontier. Let this be a lesson to me and others -- you definitely get what you pay for with Frontier.

### "They’re completely incompetent"
Not Verified |   All the passengers for multiple flights are here. The planes are here. The pilots are here. Their server is down so we can’t get on the plane and go to our destination. They’re completely incompetent.

### "consistently disappoints"
Not Verified |   Frontier Airlines consistently disappoints with its poor customer service, often described as unhelpful and dismissive. Passengers frequently encounter hidden fees for basic services like seat selection and baggage, leading to unexpected costs that escalate the overall expense of travel. Flight delays and cancellations are rampant, causing frustration and inconvenience without adequate compensation or alternative arrangements. The seating arrangement is cramped and uncomfortable, offering minimal legroom even on shorter flights. For travelers seeking reliability and comfort, Frontier Airlines falls short of expectations and is not recommended.

### "looking to get nickeled and dimed"
Customer service could not care less if you almost die on their flight and need to change your ticket on your return flight. Absolutely lacks compassion and is not for anyone with medical issues. If you are looking for people caring about people, then don't look here. If you’re vulnerable and looking to get nickeled and dimed then Frontier is at the top of the list.

### "refusing to return the money"
So my flight from Omaha to Denver was cancelled at the time the flight was scheduled to depart while we were at the gate. As previous reviews on this site have stated, they never updated the website or flight alerts. The airport departure screen said "on time" until 30 minutes after the flight was cancelled. Our mass confusion was met with indifference and resistance by every Frontier employee I came in contact with, which was only three they had working at the time. To add insult to injury, I was not offered a refund, a rebooking or any other accommodation due to the cancellation. Just given my checked bag back and sent on my way. In addition, I had to book a $400 flight on a different airline for the following day and pay $140 Uber back to my sister's house over an hour away since all the hotels were sold out for the College World Series that week. After numerous attempts to retrieve a refund I was offered a $75 flight credit which isn't even half of what I paid. It's been three weeks and they are still refusing to return the money I gave them for a flight I never took. They are refusing to refund the money I paid to check a bag that was returned to me. They are refusing to refund the money I paid for a seat I never sat in. I feel like I have been scammed because this is blatant theft.

### "This is the worst airline"
Beyond unprofessional. For starters we received 3 emails stating our flight was delayed, cancelled and then delayed again. Frontier never bothered to update their app, website, Google Flights or even the airport website to show whether the flight was truly cancelled or delayed. Everywhere we checked it showed that the flight was on time. So we went to the airport and on the Departures screen we saw that our flight was on time and was even assigned a gate. After getting through security we waited for 10 minutes before asking the gate agent when we would board only to be very rudely told that the flight was cancelled. First off this confusion was created due to their conflicting emails but beyond that how hard is it to update your actual website and app or update the departure screen. At the very bare minimum write a sign saying the flight is cancelled. I wasted money driving to the airport, paid for parking only to miss a very important milestone for my family and in return was treated as if it was my fault that I didn’t know that my flight was cancelled. This is the worst airline I have ever encountered.

### "uniquely worse than it should be"
Not Verified |   Frontier It’s hard for me to add more truth to what’s been posted about Frontier airlines. It’s labeled as an “ultra-low fare airline.” Great, awesome everyone likes a deal. However, low fares do not have to also equal low quality. For example, Chick-fil-A’s prices are comparable to other fast food restaurants, yet it feels somehow different than the competitors Frontier utilizes most of the same planes, software and hardware as other airlines. Flying Frontier is uniquely worse than it should be. Why? For me, it’s their attitude. It begins with a distinctly “customer” service phone call focused on Frontier’s bottom line. No one is ever going to try and help you. They will offer you Frontier-focused options, usually at a cost. Next, they play “Jam Your Luggage In the Steel Box” at the gate. I’ve noticed bag size has nothing to do with who’s selected to play. They only pick people that look like they can pay the $75 fee. It’s profiling. Gates agents have a financial incentive. They receive $10/bag charged at the gate. It’s in their self interest to make you pay to play. It has the worst on time rating of all major airlines. I’m convinced the Bag Game slows many, many departures. Once you take your seat, a flight attendant will walk the aisle telling people, “All personal electronics must be on silent. Why am I hearing all this noise? !” Full flights don’t guarantee working bathrooms. My flight had just one. Once you arrive, it’s not guaranteed your luggage will be there. If it is, you’ll wait and wait and wait for it to come out of the luggage carousel. Again, it’s puzzling because less people check bags than carry them on. No one working at Frontier smiles or volunteers to help. Employees look miserable. It’s obvious leadership does not care about customer experience. I seriously doubt upper management flies Frontier. Otherwise, they would have to willingly overlook such poor quality. It can be experienced in every flight, from every city that Frontier services. Frontier employees are unhappy and take it out on the customer. Ironically, Frontier feels that by putting an animal on the plane, people will somehow overlook their glaring deficiencies and have more fun. That’s an interesting approach that doesn’t work. I know this review won’t make a difference. It doesn’t even make me feel better to post it. Note to Frontier: Attitude is free. You don’t have to spend an additional penny on anything else to significantly improve your reputation. You just have to care. Sadly, it’s obvious, caring is just not part of the Frontier company culture.

### “staff are extremely rude and unprofessional”
I will never fly this airline again! The staff are extremely rude and unprofessional. The airplane was delayed and extremely hot. I was forced to pay for a carry on for a bag that was smaller than most backpacks that were allowed on board, and upcharged on the fee. A LV bottomless bag that was also damaged from the bin it was sized in. I travel frequently with my employer and as director of opps my company I will make sure we don't will not book with them again! 100 bucks now will now cost them several thousand.

### “Don't waste your time here”
I reserved my flight a few months in advance, then about 45 days before the flight, get notified that my flights have been changed. The times that were offered can't accommodate the schedule I have. And the offered flights all go from my scheduled time of 1 hr 46 min to the next one being over 6 hrs and more. I had to cancel and go with another airline at 3 times the cost because of the late notice and Frontier's inability to accommodate me. Also the fact that Frontier now has NO LIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE makes doing anything impossible. I will never fly this airline again. Don't waste your time here!

### “3 hour flight took 6 and a half hours”
Not Verified | I was told to get to the airport around 9 am and I got there about 9:15 am. Person at the check in counter told me that my flight is not checking in for another 2 hours, I finally checked in and went to the gate and there was a 30 minute delay for boarding due to a problem in Phoenix so we were waiting. We boarded and sat in the waiting plane for about an hour because some of the baggage was put on other planes and we had to wait until they went and found the luggage and bring it back and put it on the plane. Now we taxied out to the runway and had to wait another 30 minutes because we were late chasing luggage, now our 3 hour flight took off, it would have been smoother if I was being towed by a pigeon and if I was wearing a hang glider. During the flight a stewardess handed me a menu and a can of pop was $4.30 some cents, we finally landed and we pulled up to the gate and the captain said there will be a delay, we had to wait for mechanics to come and fix the catwalk so we could get off the plane. That was another hour so our 3 hour flight took 6 and a half hours, I should have paid attention to the reviews I read before the flight. I do not care where my next destination is, I will take a cab before I ever set foot on Frontier Airlines again.

### "by far the worst airline"
Cancelled 20 minutes before boarding. No assistance, no nothing. Because of all the other flights they cancelled that day, they couldn’t get me to my destination until almost 48 hours later. This is by far the worst airline in the existence of the airline industry. The Wright Brothers would roll over in their graves if they could see what a mockery of aviation Frontier is. When it comes to flying, I think one would have better luck trying to hang glide on a Dorito chip to their destination.

### "I would rather walk"
I would rather walk to my destinations than use this airline again. They cancelled my flight last minute and could not provide hotel accommodations as they were “sold out”, forcing me to spend the night in the airport. Mind you, I got to the airport from a connecting flight around 9:30pm on Sunday 6/23. My flight was supposed to be at 11:59pm and the next available flight wasn’t until 11:59pm the following night (6/24). So yes, I was at the airport for over 24 hours waiting for my new flight, which conveniently was delayed several times. I finally boarded hours later, thinking I was finally in the clear. What else can happen, right? Well, as I was exiting the aircraft, I offered the person in the row across from mine to go ahead of me since the other two people already went (aka just trying to be polite), and he insisted I go first. Okay, nbd, it was a maybe 2-3 second delay, and so I started to grab my bag when a passenger a few rows behind huffed and said “let’s go”. As if I was not already in the process of grabbing my bag from the overhead? I gave her a dirty look and she proceeded to go OFF on me and said a bunch of other insane things as I was walking away. I mentioned it to one of the flight attendants right away, as I did not feel safe since she was making threats towards me, and the FA didn’t seem to care at all! That was my final straw. I filed a complaint with the airline and they refuse to compensate me.

### “no professionalism, no support”
Not Verified |  Where to begin, original flight was to leave FLL. After passing checkpoint and made it all the way to the gate, I realized the flight had been canceled through the board, but I received no notifications either through the app, email or text. When I went to the counter at FLL the employees had no suggestions, no Public Relations, no professionalism, no support, no suggestions and sent me to Miami. Once in Miami, I went to the council where I was assured the flight was secure. I made it all the way through checkpoint was there from 2:00 all the way to 10:00 and at 10:00 p.m. was notified that the flight scheduled for midnight had been canceled. Again employees had no support, no professionalism, no assistance for elderly, people with disabilities or illnesses. Many passengers spent the night at the airport and had to book their own flights through other airlines. Some of us were fortunate to find other passengers to collaborate and find nearby hotels to the night there and book flights with other lines, but none of this was because of Frontiers' support.

### "never fly on this airline again"
I will never fly on this airline again! My flight times were changed several times, receiving multiple notifications via email. I was flying with several family members and My return flight as well as my sister in law’s flight was canceled and our option was to return the next day. We were inconvenienced greatly because we had to get a hotel room for one night as we had to check out of our Airbnb. We also had to pay for an additional day for our car rental. My son who was on the same return flight, did not have his return trip canceled. It was a huge nightmare! Not to mention the fees for everything. We should have flown with a different carrier, it might have been less expensive and without all the extra fees.

### "This has been a nightmare"
This has been a nightmare, painful, costly, traumatizing experience. Customer service reps lack customer service skills, have no knowledge and no customer service etiquette. With delays and gate changing without ample information and confusion at the gates with incorrect flight information posted and no one at the desk who has any knowledge and friendly approach, I ended up have to purchase a one way flight back to my home destination on a different airline which cost twice as much.

### "a nightmare from start to finish"
Flight experiences on F9 22 and 23, round trip from Phi to PUJ 6/21-6/24, was a nightmare from start to finish. I reviewed an email from the CEO on 5/17 citing clear, upfront pricing options and a better travel experience overall. Frontier fell quite short of this. The listlessness and apathy by PHI gate agents was awful. I was forced to pay up for my personal item backpack (historically used this way - never an issue) to a carry on price of $124, which is absurd and certainly didn’t match bag price checker site. I have spondylosis and my back pack has wheels which caused it to not fit in the curiously small baggage checker at the gate. My condition was dismissed by the gate agents. Attempting to leave PUJ was also pure chaos regardless of arriving 3 hours prior to take off. They couldn’t organize lines, make clear announcements, and proceeded to charge me over $200 for checked bags which I was sure I had already paid for both ways at check in for departure, and again does not match bag price checker site. After waiting in 4 different lines that kept devolving for almost 2 hours, this bag charge was about 4 minutes from the established boarding time so I did not have the time or patience to debate this. With such an amazing experience at our resort, to be sandwiched by this awful experience by Frontier, makes us almost regret the whole trip, but certainly wholeheartedly regret booking with frontier.

### "turned into a 2 day ordeal"
Traveling in a party of 4 with young kids. Frontier Airlines cancelled my non-stop flight forcing me to rebook to a previous day. I was forced to pay for a non-refundable hotel and car rental for the extra night. After I accommodated this change in dates by Frontier, I was informed the next day that they cancelled the rebooked flight as well. Now I am forced to reroute to Denver (their hub) 3 and half hours in the opposite direction, book yet another hotel stay night on my dime. To make matters worse, I had to cancel all my birthday plans & travel to Denver that day thanks to Frontier. I was traveling with young kids & had to ensure we had a hotel for the horrendous 14 hr overnight layover in Denver. Not to mention that my wife had to lose an extra day of work. Upon arriving at the airport in Atlanta, we are greeted by the checkin manager, who raised concern that our checkin bag (for which we already paid $75) was overweight by 5 pounds and I would have to pay extra per POLICY. I informed him that I was compelled to carry more clothes than anticipated due to the extra two days. He said he couldn't accommodate this and that it really wasn't his problem and this was only Frontier Corporate's problem, Can you believe that? Talk about corporate disfunction. When we arrived in Denver to board our connecting flight to our final destination, we were told we needed to pay $99 for the carryon which was now a bit heavy due to the extra clothes we transferred from the checkin bag. When I explained our situation to the gate agent manager and how Frontiers cancellations had led us to carry more bags, she didn't seem to care one bit and instead responded by stating that I had two choices- I could stay back and let my family travel onwards to our final destination or I could just leave this bag behind. OMG- who is frontier hiring of late? Robots? Where is your empathy? Do you have any sense of how to treat passengers? Upon speaking with some folks, I learnt that their Gate agents have been outsourced and there is a clear lack of concern for passenger satisfaction. The agents have been incentivized to get as much money from passengers for bags & behave like robots bringing up their crap policies & have no concern for the actual situation of a passenger or if this situation was caused by Frontiers poor management. After I add up the hundreds of dollars I spent for the extra hotel, cars & extra baggage, I would have been way better off flying the other leading airlines. Never making this mistake again.They have no idea of how to treat passengers & should frankly exit the airline industry. The frequent flight cancellations are due to low passenger volume & it's not surprising why they have so much difficulty getting passengers. What should have been a quick 2 hour non-stop flight, turned into a 2 day ordeal with significant out of pocket expenses and loss of work productivity.

### "airline is by far the worst"
I have been traveling for work for over 20 years. This airline is by far the worst in every way. 4 hour delays with very rude service at the counter. I asked for the name of the person helping me and he said no. I have him on recording telling me he’s going to cancel my flight so I can’t get on. 4 hours later I was still waiting for my flight. At first it was maintenance and at the end they said it was weather. Make sure you download the Frontier app to check in or they will charge you $25.00 even though they are delayed 4 hours.

### “Customer service was an absolute joke”
My wife and I booked a Frontier Flight from Milwaukee to Las Vegas for her 40th Birthday and had layover in Denver. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 9:40 AM from Milwaukee. We arrived at the gate and waited at the scheduled boarding time we are told we are waiting for an airplane. About 40 minutes later we board, sit in our seats and wait 40 more minutes in a closed aircraft at the gate. We are told there's a maintenance issue maybe 30 minutes to an hour and are de-planed. While waiting we are told that our flight was the only flight out of Milwaukee and no additional arrangements can be made other than waiting. At noon 2.5 hours after scheduled departure they tell us we can drive to O'Hare to make a 3 PM Flight. 3 hours is laughable, and since its last minute we would be on the hook, for gas, tolls and parking. Customer service was pleasant but had no ability to help. At about 1:20 we are told it will be a six hour wait for them to get a part from O'Hare and are then canceled at 1:30. It was a full flight, they're response green cards with a QR code for a refund. Options for to get your destination- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Paid Transfer to O'Hare- NO Flight with another Airline- NO Another Frontier Flight- MONDAY QR Codes in hand all passengers left as the gate agents shooed everyone away. We were told the gate agents we not Frontier employees and were contracted. They couldn't look up other airline flights. We were on our own to get to Las Vegas. What was the compensation for the canceled flight? A refund and a very generous $100.00 credit to Frontier, must be used by the original ticket holder, valid only for 90 days and I'm sure so much more fine print it would make the bible look short. We got flights on United for $900, $600 more expensive. The price for day of flight on a mostly full flight and a working airplane. Customer service in the days afterwards was an absolute joke. Only offer the useless $100 credit, never flying with frontier again. We have been transferred to at least 5 different agents probably more. They have the worst policies in the airline industry for cancelations, See the photo below from Air Advisor.com. Spirit is better and cheaper. Avoid this worthless excuse of company.

### "The worst airline there is"
The worst airline there is. They charge you an arm and a leg for a carry on and check in bag just to get customer service they charge money. This airline has no standards at all and I will never use this airline again.

### "The worst customer service"
Not Verified |   Never again. It’s bad enough that the first bag is $74, second bag $90. Once at the airport when normal airlines have an assistant answering questions, directing their “guests” to the correct line, after printing our bag tags, there is no direction as to go from there. We had our bags tagged but were directed into the same lane as all passengers who still needed to check their bags. A man who was clueless as to what he should do, asked an employee behind the counter for advice. He was told he has the same problem as everyone else and refused to talk to him. He then was looking for another representative from Frontier to no avail -  they had 2 people working behind the counter which made the wait horrible. The worst customer service I've ever had. The staff behind the counter were stressed and had no patience for anyone. Not the employees fault but Frontier does not have sufficient help. They sell you your “cheap” ticket then couldn’t care less about those flying or their frontline employees. Shame on you Frontier. Frontier made the ending of a wonderful family vacation a nightmare.

### “I will never use Frontier again”
Not Verified | I usually fly with Jet Blue, which I find excellent and they give the costs up front. This time my booking agent got me on Frontier for the return leg. The reason was that Jet Blue asked $100.00 for the first leg and Frontier $35.00 for return. Sounds too good to be true, and it was. While Jet Blue included everything, also carry-ons, and gave excellent drinks and snacks and movies, Frontier charged me $99.00 for carry-ons (the first airline ever) and $45.00 for my boarding ticket when I reached their counter. Thus: suddenly the cost shot up to $179 without any service on board. Giving these costs at the time of boarding leaves no alternative but to pay. Needless to say, I will never use Frontier again.

### "The absolute worst experience"
The absolute worst experience. They charged a hidden fee for carry ons, both ways! We bought the ticket then once we were in line they said we had to pay 99 each for the luggage. We had no choice, so added the cost to our round trip ticket price. Then they charged us again to get home with the same luggage! The flight leaving was an hour late, so we missed the reason we flew instead of driving. Now to get home they switched the departure time from 7:50 to 11 pm with no communication! We downloaded the app to get notifications, yet, nothing. We chose seats together both times and they separated us,  and told us if we wanted to sit together that they would charge us extra! I wish I had checked because I'll never fly with frontier again.

### "$100-$150 per bag"
Not Verified |   The flights are cheaper. Only if you’re not planning on taking any luggage with you. Otherwise you’re looking at $100-$150 per bag. Their customer service is non-existent, they are slow, unhelpful and have excruciatingly long wait times. Do yourself the favor and pay for the more expensive airlines.

### "pay more for better airline"
One of the most low-quality airlines in the United States. It is funny that they did not accept me as a documented disabled US Army veteran, but they do take any random person claiming as disabled bc they pay more! Regardless of location, the gate representatives are mean, disrespectful, and just looking for excuses to charge passengers more. They can even communicate with passengers as usual. Airline intentionally separates passengers to charge for change of seat! In advance, this airline has no respect for active duty, and men or women in service only care about passengers, who they call "value passengers" bc they pay more. I dont recommend this airline to any one specially my brothers, and sisters in service do a favor to self and pay more for better airline.

### "Fly Spirit over Frontier"
Cancelled my flight from Denver to Orlando. Called customer care. Was told by an agent that if I contact Frontier and file a complaint, I will get reimbursed by Frontier. Agent (useless) told me that he could only give me 10k miles per passenger. Back and forth for several emails and no resolve. Fly Spirit over Frontier.

### "nickel and diming everyone"
We arrived at their kiosk and had a bag for our son we needed to check and we were charged 200 dollars for one bag. Our flight cost us 495. I am not sure how they can justify charging such a high rate for a bag. Then we attempted to change 0ur flight till the next day and they wanted to charge us another 600 dollars. They don't offer any snack or drinks without charging. They advertise as being affordable and are the complete opposite. They charge for everything nickel and diming everyone. I would rather pay 1000 to another airline before I will ever fly on Frontier airline again. These guys take full advantage of every passenger and to top it off their planes aren't even comfortable. What gives them the right to take advantage of people? It's horrible customer service to top it off. I will file a complaint anywhere someone will listen. This is how upset they have made myself and my husband and I'm sure this will be swept under the rug without a care in the world by this company. They could care less about you their customer.

### "avoid the unpleasantness"
Not Verified | Rating 1 because 0 isn't an option. Can confirm, customer service does NOT serve the customer. All they care about is the company's bottom line. Flights delayed (DEN-MCO) and canceled (MCO-DEN) and passengers left to bear the brunt the consequences. Nevermind if you're flying with young children. And they go so far out of their way to get around having to talk to anyone on the phone. Never again making the mistake of using this cheap unscrupulous airline. We'll pay a little more to anyone else just to avoid the unpleasantness.

### "Bravo to Frontier Airlines"
My husband and I had front row seats on our flight back from Mexico, and before we took off, a little girl (4 years old) 2 rows behind us threw up (in a bag). The Mom got up, proceeded to the Flight Attendant at the front and told her about their daughter getting sick and could she toss the bag. The Mom said she does this before flying due to nerves. Events that happened next. Flight Attendant asked parents several questions (kind, concerned and very professional). -Pilot came out to talk to the parents (very kind and professionalism). Pilot then came back out with a Doctor on the phone and the Doctor asked parents questions. All of this to insure the safety of their daughter and to make sure this was a one off and there would not be escalated issues while in the air and for our safety as well. Questions included where were they from, where have they been. We were delayed maybe 15/20 minutes. You do not always get the full story of when things happen on flights and wanted to share. Bravo to Frontier Airlines for handling this situation so well.

### “customer service is quite terrible”
My two main complaints is they advertise a price but in the end that's not the price you pay and the second complaint is their customer service is quite terrible. When you pay for a bag it says it costs around $80 for a checked bag one way. In the end, you end up paying over $200 in extra fees and that's just for one way. They charge you for talking to an agent too. On our return flight, my daughter and I were literally two minutes late beyond the checked bag cut-off time. At first, the representative said he could get us on the flight but our bags would need to go on another flight. We were okay with that but then a woman behind him gave us a hard no and told us we couldn't get on the flight and we would have to pay for another flight. At that point, I was so sick of Frontier that I booked tickets home on Southwest which is what I should have done originally. Frontier managed to ruin our family vacation and separate my family because adult kids did not have checked bags and were able to get on the flight. My family will never again fly Frontier. It's not worth it. In the end, we spent way more than what we would have spent if we had just flown Southwest and we would have had much better service.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Never fly with this airline again. They do not put you together although, you get tickets in same transaction. They charge you extra for that. I have a personal item bag that I take to all my flights with me and here they charged me 99 bucks for it as a carry-on, while it’s not a carry-on. They treat you so rude and bad. The carry on places above our head are not organized and you don’t see any room to place your stuff, however there is room available. I would never fly with this airline again. You get it to be cheaper and it ends up much higher than good airlines.

### "never fly Frontier again"
My flight was delayed because of maintenance. There was a thunderstorm coming into Dallas. We had to hold our altitude for an extra hour. We finally landed 1 1/2 hours late. I have now been sitting on the runway waiting for a gate. I have been sitting here for literally 1:45 minutes. All the other airlines are going to a gate. Seriously, why are we still sitting here. This was such a terrible management call from frontier. Why make us sit for 2 hours with the engine exhaust blowing in the air conditioner. I will never fly Frontier again!

### "never fly Frontier again"
This airline is known for cheap tickets and horrible customer service and no one to talk to if anything goes wrong. Case in point , I arrived on time , only to be held on the tarmac for over 35minutes due to the fact it was no gate for us to depart off the plane. I get ready to go home only for there to be no gate number on my ticket TSA had issues and got to gate at 6:11pm when the gate said it was closing at 6:15pm I was on time but door was closed. Explained it to a frontier rep. Who clearly was more interested in her cell phone than trying to alert the other person who shut the door it’s still customers trying to board! I was so disappointed which lead me to seek some type of help from someone who has a frontier shirt , not one individual was helpful kept telling me to go on the website, say you want to speak to live rep and do it three times, someone will connect you. After purchasing my ticket from Southwest $153.00 later I got through chat of frontier only to be told you should have gotten to airport early to retrieve your boarding pass. I explained I got it one day early through website but there was no gate number! Can I be partially reimbursed or what about the rude customer rep who shut the door aware it’s people still standing there. I will never fly Frontier again and warn people to not fly or patron this airline. Do not attempt to fly and get respect from a place who does not and will not be held accountable.

### "the ridiculous fees they charge"
Not Verified |   I recently purchased 3 round trip tickets through a 3rd party site. Only after I made the purchase was I made aware of the ridiculous fees they charge. The tickets were inexpensive but the fees are outrageous and they charge a fee for everything. You are allowed 1 personal bag but it is severely limited in size (14x18x8 inches) about the size of a childs backpack, a laptop bag or purse. Anything larger you have to pay a fee for each flight. My flights for 3 people add up to 12 flights which after adding one carry on per person totalled out to about $100 less than the actual tickets. All of a sudden it is twice the cost. Additionally they charge the "low" fee of $61 per checked bag per trip (round trip means paying $122 total per checked bag). We have 2 checked bags = $244 more! Keep in mind these are their discounted fees because we are pre paying and not at the counter. If you wait to pay at the counter, it will cost over $90 per bag per trip! All this and we still have to pay to select any seat. If we choose not to pay for the privilege of picking a seat we already bought they will randomly assign you a seat. Guess travelling together when flying Frontier is out of the question unless you are willing to take out a 2nd mortgage to pay all of these fees. Really sad how far customer service and satisfaction has fallen. I will recommend any other airline. Do not fall for their misrepresented lowest fares like I did.

### "unprofessional customer service"
Horrible and unprofessional customer service from check in, to gate to flight attendants. They all need to be re trained on etiquette, kindness and professionalism. It would be nice if the gate agents knew how to comb their hair and speak clearly. This airlines is a joke and is for anyone who needs a job that has no sense of decency! Shame on the management! Worst experience for me ever.

### “beyond unprofessional and unacceptable”
Literally the #1 worst experience in my life flying with them. Not only was the pilot late he didn’t show up until 35 minutes later and we didn’t take off until an hour and 5 minutes after our scheduled take off time. This is beyond unprofessional and unacceptable. Just because they have cheap tickets they think they can get away with everything. I will never get that time back, I understand a little wait even the 30 minutes but at this point this is ridiculous. Then there’s only one pilot no co pilot or anything. He keeps saying 10-15 minutes every 15 minutes and it’s still a wait nothing happened. I will most definitely spend the extra money next time for a more professional outcome because this is just not worth the “money saving”.

### "scamming their customers into paying extra"
I bought a ticket that included a "bundle", which is how Frontier works. My bundle paid for a carry-on bag, as well as a checked bag with extra weight (Frontier only allows 40#, and so I paid to upgrade to 50#). At the airport they tried to charge me because my bags were >40#, and I tried to tell them I paid but they didn't believe me and sent me to multiple different agents at the desk. When I finally got it sorted out, 30 minutes later, they allowed my bags (I ultimately had to pull up a screenshot of my original ticket). I missed my flight by 5 minutes because of that. Then they rebooked me but told me I had to pay $75 for my carry-on. I told them my ticket included a carry-on and even showed them the receipt, but the agent said "I don't see that from my end" and so I had to pay, otherwise I wasn't bringing on that bag! So it seems Frontier has lower prices but clearly gets that money back by scamming their customers into paying extra. It was my first time flying Frontier and obviously will be my last!

### "$90 to reinstate the passes"
On November 4, 2023, we got in an Uber to head to the airport at 5:30am. We got to the airport at 6:00am. The flight was not until 8:30am We get in Frontier Airline ticket counter line around 6:30am. There were about 3 people in front of us, and several people later lined up behind us. I stepped out of line and printed the checked bag ticket and looked around for the baggage drop. I did not see one. I remembered on Frontier’s website that it stated that it would be approximately an $80 fee to utilize a ticket agent for your checked baggage drop instead of the self-help baggage drop. We waited in line at the ticket counter for about an hour. At around 7:15am, we were still in line and not moving. I walked up and asked the ticket agent where to drop my checked baggage and she stated you have to do it with me. At 7:30am the ticket agent makes an announcement that if you have your boarding pass you need to go to the gate. Several people including us asked what about our checked baggage and the ticket agents stated that the flight was closed and oversold and you cannot check any bags. We stated that we were here and have our checked baggage tags printed. The ticket agent got nasty with all of us and stated that they had to help the people get on the earlier Philadelphia flight and that we should get to the airport three hours in advance. We all looked at each other and we stated, we just need to hand over out checked bags. We also stated that we were here two hours before the flight and stood in line for over an hour. The ticket agent stated that the next flight was around 5:00pm. We asked what are our alternatives. The ticket agent said there are none with us, you can see what is available at other airlines. We asked are you going to give us a refund and the ticket agent said, no. My family and I stated, let us go see who has other flights. We went to American Airline ticket counter, with our tagged checked baggage in tow. An agent from American Airline asked us why we were carrying our checked bag. She said if you have a checked bag, you should be headed to your flight. We told her what had happened at Frontier Airline ticket counter. She went to talk with the Frontier Airline ticket agent and the ticket agent stated that we were not in line earlier enough. The agent knew that was not the truth because we had printed the checked baggage ticket and suggested that one of us should take an American Airlines flight with our baggage and the others take the Frontier Flight since we already had boarding passes and had purchased the tickets. We thought this was a good option and three of us headed to security. When we got to security and was about to present our electronic boarding pass, we learned that the ladies at the Frontier ticket counter had cancelled our boarding passes. We went to the attendant with the AA agent and she explained and the Frontier ticket agent stated that it would be $90 to reinstate the passes. The agent asked why, they already had passes and you cancelled them. Why would you charge them. The Frontier ticket agent stated that is our policy. So we walked over to the American Airline desk with the agents assistance and purchased 4 tickets, and had an uneventful flight to MCO. We actually arrived before the Frontier Airline flight.

### "not fly Frontier Airlines again"
Not Verified |   Both flights were 2 hours late (night flights) which meant I got no sleep for those 2 days because I had to work in the morning. I will not fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "never fly Frontier ever again"
Not Verified |   We booked 3 premium seats in row 2 for the extra leg room and early boarding. We confirmed our seat choices only to have Frontier change our seats splitting our family up where our child cant sit with his parents. Despite communicating with them that our family paid extra to sit together, we were told our only option was to downgrade but at “no extra cost.” They said they couldn’t put us back together despite separating us in the first place. Now our family is forced to fly separately. What’s the point of paying extra and booking seats if it can be changed at any time without warning, notification, explanation, or remedy? We are frequent travelers on multiple airlines and have never encountered such lunacy. We will never fly Frontier ever again.

### "unwillingness to fix the issues"
Not Verified |   I purchased a roundtrip ticket for my girlfriend to fly from SLC international to Las Vegas International. I specifically purchased seat 3D for accessibility and leg room as well as a quick exit as she is currently disables as she needs a full knee replacement. When she boarded someone was in her seat, so she sought help from an airline representative who told her that she was wrong her seat was 23D which is way in the back, little leg room, long walk with bag to exit. It aggravated her knee so badly that it ruined our weekend trip. She ended up staying in the whole weekend in our room because she could barely walk. I attempted to contact Frontier to cancel the return flight as I paid for a different flight on American as I did not want her treated this way again. I never did get through until this morning and nothing. Pretty much too bad sir, we do not care we violated ADA standards and law, we don't care about our staff's unwillingness to fix the issues. We are doing nothing. Sad thing is we are talking 90 dollars. Its not even the money, its the point of how they treated her, disregarded her injury and then will not even give me an apology.

### "overcharged $276 for a $75 bag"
Not Verified |   On April 13th I was overcharged $276 for a $75 bag. Support is only via chat and you cannot get a phone call. It took over 30min to speak with someone via chat. The first specialist claimed that the charges were for carry-ons (which we already paid for) and an overweight bag (which was paid for at the gate, and not by me) basically, they lied. The case was escalated and the person tried having a conversation in a non-stop circle in hopes of confusing me.

### "had to be removed to change the tire"
Ridiculous lines and was delayed 35 mins due to incoming flight but failed to do flight checklist until all passengers and baggage loaded, then pilot announced that the air in a tire low so they needed to change tire and everyone and their luggage had to be removed to change the tire. Went from a 45 minute delay to a 2 hour delay for no reason The luggage staff make it really uncomfortable for everyone else traveling. They literally made each individual regardless of size of purse or satchel get out of line and go over to a size rack.

### "Terrible experience"
We flew round trip from Minneapolis to Phoenix. This was our first time on Frontier Airlines. Terrible experience. Departure was 3 hours late. App never reflected a delayed departure. No reason given when we finally boarded. Seats were more tightly packed in than any other airline we’ve flown so on return trip I paid $39 for an exit row for my 6 ft 5 in husband. When we boarded, the seat that had been shown online as an exit row seat that I paid for was not an exit row seat. They had a different configuration online than the plane we were on. When I requested a refund they stated they don’t do refunds for seats and refused to accept any responsibility for the inaccurate seat map on the app. There were no plug ins for devices. No screens in seat backs. Seats did not recline. Carry on bags were $70 each. Checked bags were $60 each and had to be no more than 40 pounds or you paid even more. Snacks and beverages were offered for sale, not complementary like most airlines. When we landed there was not crew to direct us in so we could not deplane. We won’t spend a dime with this airline in the future. No customer service what so ever. Trip cost as much or more than a premium airline in the end.

### "2 hours for a representative to show up"
Not Verified |   Their kiosk was broken so I had to wait 2 hours for a representative to show up, and then they delayed my flight by two hours because one of the flight crew was late!

### "expensive bag fees"
It is my bad for booking with them without reading the reviews. A silly mistake that wont be repeated! Their cheap fare that grabbed my attention, quickly more than doubled after adding expensive bag fees (checked bag $70, for only 40 lbd, and even more expensive for a carry-on! ), and then there are assorted nickel and dime fees. There are no snacks or drinks unless you pay exorbitant fees ($5 for water or can of coke), and no way to charge electronics on board. The seats weren't too bad, unpadded though. But I only had an hour flight to Philly from Boston.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |   Frontier had the worst customer service in my life. We get off an Aer Lingus flight with an hour-long layover. We walk over to the frontier line, rudely waving her hand at us to leave. She kept saying no, no, go away. She says we're closed, and every other airline, including Spirit, was helping passengers. We got some stuff from Dublin, Ireland, and she said to throw it away. Security let us keep it. The gate was chaos. The workers at the gate kept pulling other people over for no reason, even if their bags fit. She pulled someone over, saying pay $99. She started tearing up. She got to get on with a lot of other people's support. She also pulled me over and almost made me pay $99. Frontier Airlines does not care about anyone except for money. On the intercom, they canceled a flight for no reason. Worst customer service ever.

### "It is not worth it"
Save yourself the time, $ and headache from the rude and unprofessional staff! It is not worth it! It was my first and last time traveling with them! !

### “company is not reliable at all”
Not Verified | This airline did not give me my refund when I canceled my flight within the required 24 hours. I contacted a customer service thanks to the help of Justfly, I spoke on the phone the same day I canceled, and they told me they would send me my refund within 10 business days. It's been more than 10 days and I contacted them to ask about my money and they told me that they were only going to give me a credit for another flight when that was not what they told me. This company is not reliable at all. They steal your money. I will not travel on this airline again. They are thieves. A customer service named Alma Disque was helping me and it was the worst help I could have received.

### "you get what you pay for"
Not Verified |   You get what you pay for. No frills nickle and dime airline. Airline profits from ancillary revenue from water to luggage to a seat there’s a charge. Flying Frontier reminds me of taking a school bus when I was a kid. The service is so poor I’ve never seen a service rep make an effort to accommodate a passenger. I would believe that if they could charge for flight attendant smiles they would. This airline changes itinerary or cancels flights with regularity and their notification system is inconsistent. Sometimes the app notifies a passenger of changes and sometimes not. If you ever are in an urgent situation and need to speak with someone you’ll become disgruntled. In summary no frills and no service. It’s cheap but you get what you pay for.

### "they said you will need to wait"
Not Verified |  They did not give us seat numbers and by the time we got to our gate they said you will need to wait, it is overbooked. We asked why did you pick us she told us the first lie "because you were late check in" although we checked in right after we received the email and were 3 hours earlier. Few mins later they said we did that because you did not receive your seats and paid for them. We ended up with our luggage sent to Milwaukee, we are going to Chicago paying 3k for tickets on different airline.

### “no space for our bags”
Not Verified | This is the worst airplane I have ever been on. To start, boarding the plane was a hastle. I almost did not get in on time due to the inconvenience of the staff. They told me my bag had to fit into an eyelash sized compartment. Since it didn’t, we had to pay 300 dollars extra just for our bag. Where do I start with the actual plane. Well, there was absolutely no space for our bags, even though we paid an extra 300 dollars. The leg space was absolutely horrid, and do not get be started on the cushions. The cushions were slipping and sliding off the seat, and my seatbelt was stuck under the chair. Overall, never riding with Frontier Airlines again.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Do not fly this airline as you end up spending just a fraction less after all the ridiculous charges. The worst airline I experienced. Should have spent the extra $20 to fly delta, after frontier upcharged me more than $200 for things like a carry on. I added my carry on with a $0 dollar additional fee (I had paid on the previous leg) and checked in. But they charged me $100 when I was boarding even though I told them I was not charged for the carry on which I added in my check in. They have you captive at that point and exploit that. Then when you get on, you don’t have seats that can’t recline and seat trays that are literally smaller than an iPad. Only the water is free (the bad coffee isn’t). Last time I fly on frontier and wish I could have given 0 stars. Not a sustainable business model.

### "the organization was horrendous"
Not Verified |  My boyfriend and I arrived 2.5 hours early to our 5:15 am flight from Orlando to Detroit through Frontier. We were very poorly directed through a series of long lines wrapped around the entire perimeter of the airport. Hundreds and hundreds of people all waiting for Frontier. It took us hours to get through the line and we realized rather quickly we’d never make our flight. Mind you, the organization was horrendous. Attendants were trying to get groups of people to cut in front of our line, making people even angrier. We finally reached the front desk at 5:05 am only to be told very rudely, “The plane is gone, you need to leave. No refunds.” We were stranded at the airport with no money and no ride until my boyfriend’s Dad came and got us two hours later. Luckily we found another flight to Detroit through Sanford. This was our first and last time flying with Frontier.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  The (already late at night) flight to Orlando was delayed by 30 minutes but this was never posted on their site. We waited without knowing why, and then sat on the plane at the gate for another hour because of mechanical problems. They had to restart the plane twice, and then they had trouble with the ramp. When we arrived in Orlando, they told us the wrong baggage claim area, and we waited another 30 minutes for our bags before finding the right claim area. When our bags came, they were soaking wet. Our returning flight was supposed to leave Orlando at 7 am, but was delayed by an hour. When we arrived at the airport, and tried to get in line, they stopped us at the gate because they had switched to a smaller plane and there wasn't enough room for the last 9 people to get on. The plane left without us and we all had to be rerouted. My son and I were separated from my husband and other son. No apologies, no explanations. They wouldn't even tell us what had happened until the plane took off. The new flight was scheduled for 8 hours later. Their compensation? They gave us 250 per ticket for our next flight. I do not want a voucher because I will NEVER fly frontier again unless I don't care if I get where I am going. Even if they give me free tickets, I will never fly Frontier again. They are the worst airline I have ever flown on.

### "Out of control baggage fees"
Don’t fly with them. What should have been a 3 hour travel day turned into a 12 hour travel day. Outdated planes, feel like I’m sitting on a piece of wood. Out of control baggage fees, ridiculous weight limitations.

### "probably the worst flying experience"
They attract people with low posted rates, and then invent ways to triple the price of the trip! I witnessed grown women and a few teenage people in tears at the gate as they were all charged $100 for their “personal items”. This airline separates people on the same booking, demanding everyone pay for seat selection. I was sat in a middle seat both ways of my trip and in my entire row were people separated from their travel companions. If you get caught buying a ticket with this scam airline, you must understand that the true price of your flight is going to be triple what you think it is, and probably the worst flying experience of your life. The entire travel experience with this airline is the worst in the industry, they have the rudest gate staff, the worst and laziest flight attendants, their seats are industry worst for comfort, it takes over an hour to board their planes due to all the gate charges for the passengers and they provide nothing while aboard the airplane. I personally witnessed two teenage girls throwing their personal clothing into the garbage can at the gate in desperation to get their “personal items” to fit the required measurements to avoid the $100 gate charge and the gate staff could not have cared less. The staff talk to all passengers as if they are children, they are extremely rude. As consumers, we have the power to stop scam airlines and companies in general.

### "Avoid this airline by any means"
Avoid this airline by any means. They charge for everything & try to find ways to manipulate you. I paid for luggage & still paid another amount because it wasn’t dropped at a Frontier location. There was no Frontier at the gate they mentioned. I have seen others complaining too. In simple terms, save your $ by avoiding them.

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Absolutely the worst airline I’ve ever flown. Disgusting customer service, 100$ for a checked back, worst seats hard as a rock and don’t lean back.

### "by far the worst experience"
This was by far the worst experience I have had as a traveler. The flight was delayed 4 times and each time no announcement was made or explanation given. When you do decide to go to the desk to see what options you have or what the delay maybe every Frontier Associate was rude, made the customers feel like we were bothering them and gave a different explanation to multiple different people. Once we finally boarded the plane the flight crew hung out for about 5-7 minutes chatting and laughing before closing the door for departure. As we begin to finally move in hopes that yay we might actually be leaving after sitting and waiting for 6-7 hours of new ETAS and no updates… then we are grounded due to weather. This was very disappointing and could have been better handled by your crew and staff. I literally heard a flight attendant or crew behind desk snap at a passenger because he simply wanted to know if a refund was available and he could be moved to another flight since it had been 4+ hours. Tips for improvement: it’s okay say to say we don’t know and we apologize. I didn’t hear that once today. We know it’s spring break but it’s the way you communicate and when you communicate that allow others to be heard even if there is nothing you can do. Align on customer service training and what best practices should be followed when a delay occurs. Ensure that updates are given otherwise all passengers are forced to listen to someone around them instead of knowing for sure what the actual issue is. Lastly and most importantly: treat others like you want to be treated. A lot of the staff seem pretty annoyed but the batter, eye rolling and profanity could have been minimized with announcements, a bit of emotional intelligence and accountability. I will never fly your company again unfortunately, I love a good nonstop flight. But for the $75 I paid for my bag being 4 pounds over 40, the lack of care from your staff and the fact that the plane has not taken off. It’s a no

### “did not want to hear me out”
Got to the gate and was told I had to pay for my personal bag. I then ask why because I had just paid for 2 checked bags and was told my personal bag was ok and I didn’t have to pay. After asking questions as to why I pay the $100 and afterward told you can not fly on this flight because of your attitude. I ask for a supervisor and takes her time getting to us then say what ever the counter says that what it is. I then ask why would you have me pay for a bag then say I can not fly. My kids was already in the flight. She states because I’m upset I had to pay for another bag. They are horrible and did not want to hear me out at all. This is the worst airline I have ever flown.

### "blind sided mid-trip"
I was on a transfer flight on the way to Ontario, CA from Las Vegas, NV coming from Houston, TX. When exiting the aircraft in Las Vegas for my connecting flight to Ontario (keep in mind, this was still the same plane at the same gate I exited. I unboarded and reboarded 10 minutes later) I had my personal bag and a basketball I was carrying from my previous flight. I was told at this time when I was reboarding that I couldn't take my ball on board unless I pay a carry on fee, which was odd because I wasn't told anything about this. I don't understand why I would have to pay more half way through a trip that was already paid for? I was not going to pay an extra $75+ for an item I was already cleared to carry before hand. I was extremely upset due to the fact that the basketball I had received was purchased at a Houston Rockets game and then was signed by one of their players, Boban Marjanović. So the value of that ball was irreplaceable for me. Extremely upsetting to be nickle and dimed. But to be blind sided mid-trip is ridiculous.

### “not worth it if you value your time”
First time flying domestically in the US, made the mistake of choosing Frontier because it was cheapest. However, my first flight from MSP to DEN was delayed by 5 hours, causing me to miss my connection. I was rebooked onto a later connection (10 hours later) only to find that A) it was also delayed by over an hour (5:00 am departure to 6:00 am), and B) it turned out the rebooked flight was not checked in even though the app displayed otherwise. I was forced to pay a 25 dollar fee or not be allowed to board. It's just not worth it if you value your time. I should have taken the reviews more seriously , it's 1/2 out of 10 for a reason.

### "Worst experience under this airline"
Worst experience under this airline and I refuse to ever fly with Frontier again. Showed up to airport within 2 hours of our flight departure time. Sat in line for an hour while they had one staff trying to check in 5 plus passengers and redirect those who had missed their flights. We ended up missing our flight because of lack of employees helping to push passengers through the check in process. 12 hours later and after several attempts to make other flights, we are finally taking the red eye home and will be home at 5:30 am. Long day and all due to a lack of organization and responsibility to your passengers trying to make it through the check in process. Never again! I’ll spend the extra $100 to go with an airline who has more employees to help!

### "no one at the check in desk"
Never again will I fly on this amateur unprofessional airline. I tried to check in one hour before my flight and there was no one at the check in desk. They all decided to leave at the same time to go to the gate. I missed my flight and the next one wasn’t for 2 day so I booked with United.

### "This airline is the worst"
This airline is the worst. They nit pick every penny they can. Seats are worn out and like sitting on a piece of wood. They charge for everything. $65 for a small carry on bag, You pay for a glass of soda or pretzels. The seats do not recline. If you want to sit next to your wife or child. you Pay! Our set of seats had no windows. They a stuck us in the last row. No room if you are taller than 6ft you don't fit. No WI Fi.. no movie. No entertainment. We were late departing and arriving. This is not uncommon.

### “my travel plans were ruined”
Zero stars. My flight was canceled at the last minute. This is when I discovered Frontier Airlines has no humans manning customer service. Only a bot chat on their website! It was a circular waste of 45 minutes. Through accident only, trial and error on their awful website, I rebooked another, not ideal flight. After waking up at 3am to get dressed and out of the house (husband was up and at it, too, to drive me to the airport), I got a Frontier text. My new flight was delayed 5 hours! Finally, at the airport 5 hours later, after sitting at the gate for an hour and a half, the gate agent reported another 2 hour delay! So here we all are, the whole lot of passengers, sitting for hours at this gate, all of us inconvenienced and sharing our stories with each other about just how bad Frontier has been since buying our tickets. Some of us, like me, were using Frontier for the first time. Spoiler alert: If you think you were going to fly for less than the cost at Delta, think again. Your roundtrip ticket that you bought initially for more than advertised? Seat not included. So Frontier must expect us to hold onto the wings and hang on tight! Also, unlike other airlines, they charge $70 extra for a carry on. You expect to pay for a checked bag, but a carry on? You're doing them a favor by packing lightly, and they charge you for that. My travel plans were ruined and I paid 6 times the price advertised when it was all over. If you want a reliable, easy flight, with very little hassle and no hidden charges... fly Delta! Because the Frontier leadership team is not only unavailable for comment, they are banking your money and probably laughing on a yacht somewhere in the Caribbean sipping champagne.

### "varying degrees of horrible"
I’ve flown on frontier 6 times. Every single experience has been varying degrees of horrible. Every staff I’ve encountered varies from neutral to incredibly rude. More often incredibly rude. No one at that organization has a speck of care or concern for their rudeness or the horrifying inconvenience they cause to people’s lives. I do everything I can to not fly with frontier, or if I half to, I make sure to lower my expectations to zero.

### “fly with a reliable airline please”
I implore people not to fly this airline and even if a few more bucks to fly with a reliable airline please do so. You will regret all of their nickel and dime policies and heaven forbid you need to cancel or reschedule - it’s basically a lost ticket. Unlike other reputable airlines they charge you carrier fees each way of 100 dollars plus a cancellation fee. Ultimately your ticket value is useless and you still have to use it within 90 days. I will never fly this airline again as long as I live no matter what price they initially try to entice me with.

### "getting yelled at by customers"
Frontier changes our flight time 3 times within 4 hours, and we missed our flight and lost a day of vacation. Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:10pm. A few days before the flight I received an email that it changes to 1pm. Then at 9 am on the morning of the flight they changed it to 2:20pm because of a late arriving aircraft. Then at 11am I received a notification that the flight was again moved out to 3:04pm. So we arrived at the airport at 12:15pm and had to stand in line for 1.5 hours for an agent to assist us because we were flying internationally. When we finally made it to an agent at 2 o'clock, we received another notification that the flight was moved back up to 2:24pm, and now it was too late to check in. Luckily we were able to get the last 4 tickets on the same flight the next day. And Frontier doesn't treat their employees any better. The poor lady at the counter was getting yelled at by customers because there were only two people at the counter and a line 2 hours long, but there was nothing she could do. She said she didn't even have a food or restroom break since she got in early in the morning, and it was almost time for her to go home. She had been at the counter with no lunch or restroom break all day because there was no one else to help the customers, and there was a really long line.

### "didn’t want a travel credit"
Not Verified | I planned a little vacation with my daughter and son from March 10 to March 15 Our flight from Salt Lake City to Tampa. Our flight from Salt Lake City to Denver was okay. We arrived at the Denver airport at 8:30 in the morning. Then, I got an email saying our flight from Denver to Tampa was canceled. I tried the Frontier app and customer service, and talking to a human being was impossible. We asked a lady at Frontier’s gate, and she was insulting. She told us to reach gate A38 because we needed to talk to their customer service. Did we go to gate A38 and WTF? There was a huge line there. I thought it was just our flight, but Frontier canceled multiple flights, and many people were trying to fly home or somewhere else. It was my turn after 1 hour and 55 minutes in the line. The attendant was rude and told us the next Frontier Flight would be Tuesday, March 12? I had my hotel and my rental car booked for March 10. We were supposed to arrive in Tampa at 6:49 pm. So, I booked the rental car pickup for 7:30 pm to drive to the hotel. Check-in at the hotel can be anytime from 3 pm. She asked me if I wanted to fly on Tuesday or get a refund. I preferred the refund. She gave me a card with a QR code that I should scan and fill out the form for a refund. I had to buy 3 tickets last minute to get to Tampa. The only flight I could get was with United Airlines, departing at 11:59 pm from Denver and arriving in Tampa at 4:30 am on March 11. Well, it was our only option. For the 3 tickets, I paid $1,479.30, which is $493.10 per person. After I bought the flight, I had to call the hotel and the rental car, explaining that our flight was canceled. of course, they didn’t understand because you have to cancel the reservation at least 24 hours before. I told them I would arrive on the next day and I had to pay one day for the hotel and rental car without using them. After the flight with United Airlines was booked and I could communicate with the hotel and rental car, I tried to reach Frontier’s Customer Service, impossible. There’s not a phone number, not an email. . After much research on Google, I could chat with someone on WhatsApp. So stressful. I decided to forget about it, enjoy my vacation and get my refund at the end of it. I received emails from Frontier. The first one with a $30 voucher “to grab a bite.”  $30 bucks for 3 adults to eat at an international airport? Are you kidding me? The other 3 emails were to say sorry about the flight cancellation and give each of us a $100 travel credit. I didn’t want a travel credit after this experience, and Frontier didn’t give me an option. The company decided for me. I wanted my money back, not a travel credit. I decided to cancel my flight back home on the 15 and was charged a cancellation fee for canceling my flight. Frontier cancels on me at the last minute, and is that okay? I need to cancel a flight 4 days before it and pay a cancellation fee. Will Frontier pay me a cancellation fee for canceling the flight at the last minute?

### "Shame on you Frontier"
My wife and I booked a flight to Little Rock for my best friend’s funeral. We were extremely early. Checked in our bag and waited by the gate for hours. The flight was delayed multiple times which is understandable as things happen. They then switched the gate multiple times and in the miscommunication if there was any communication at all, we missed our flight. Even the information desk and boards could not keep up with the correct information. My wife and I left the airport and have now rented a car to drive 15 plus hours to make it to the funeral tomorrow. Our luggage is in Little Rock and I am told that I can not receive that luggage until after 4pm. The funeral is at 11 am. So we must now either go buy new clothes to look presentable or show up in sweats. You know comfy flying wear. I am appalled by their tactics. No Customer Service to talk to, only through a dang app! They did say that they will refund the flight out but will not refund the flight back. I think it’s the least they could do is comp the flight back as well as we are now out another $800.00 for the rental, gas, sleepless night and now clothes, so I can say goodbye to my best friend. I am not asking a lot of them. Admit you were wrong and make it right! Shame on you Frontier. Do. Better.

### “everyone was furious”
Not Verified | This has got to be the worst airline in the world. They were originally cheaper than the others but after you calculate $149 one way per checked bag, $32 for three drinks and one snack, 5 delayed flights including one where we had to go from one side of ATL airport to the other and the absolute rude and callused disregard towards the passengers I will absolutely NEVER fly with these clowns again!! The icing on the cake was, on our return flight, since they "overbooked the flight", if your bag weighed more than 40 pounds, regardless of whether you'd already paid their "overweight" fee online, you would still have to pay an additional $180 or you could choose to ship it via UPS or FEDEX. Nearly every single person in line waiting to drop their bags were faced with the same issue and everyone was furious!

### "extra charges are ridiculous"
Not Verified |   Once again Frontier cancelled my flight hours before leaving - this has happened more than once. The staff is always awful and the extra charges are ridiculous. Bait and switch garbage company. This airline is absolutely terrible.

### "there were no Frontier Airlines staff"
My family was scheduled to take a 5:05 am flight out of Orlando for a nonstop flight to Buffalo. When we arrived, there were no Frontier Airlines staff to assist passengers even though we were told to get there 2 hours early. When they did finally open up the line, there were only 4 people to take baggage even though there were by now hundreds of people in line. By the time we got to the counter, we were told we were too late and that rebooking any flight would cost us $99 per person (we're a family of four) because we were "no shows. Many people were angry and yelling at the staff. Frontier schedules multiple early morning flights but does not invest in the personnel to handle the influx of passengers. I would not recommend Frontier to anyone, but I would especially strongly discourage anyone from taking any early morning flight out of Orlando. We ended up rebooking and flying to another city more than five hours away from home then renting a car. When I complained to Frontier's customer service, they basically said it was our fault for not arriving early enough even though we did. They responded that our experience "does not apply for a refund or credit since the flight was performed without any incident. I'll bet that flight took off with a ton of empty seats. Check out the line photos -- which I took after Frontier staff were already helping people.

### “nothing but a disappointment”
The whole trip was nothing but a disappointment. I missed the event I was flying out for the next day and it was just issue after issue with them. This is just a summary. First flight was delayed by 18 hours. From gate agents to every level of airport Frontier employee they are not customer friendly. You definitely get the feeling that customers are not welcome. The baggage lady employee at DFW at G38 yelled out ‘this is a low cost airline if you want first class service then you better fly with someone else.’ Well I would like to arrive to my planned event on time and in the seat that I paid extra for too. So thanks for the advice I will definitely fly with someone else!

### "shady way they are doing business"
I last flew with frontier in February and a bunch of people on my flight, including myself, had their seats double booked. I hope no one got bumped from the flight because of their careless disorganization. Then on my return flight I had so many issues and bugs with the app I had a hard time even getting my boarding pass. It kept saying I was seat 0 in section 99. I’ve had continual issues with their website that have been incredibly frustrating. But I’m a loyal customer so I ignored the annoyance and decided I would book them again for my next trip. Back in February I had purchased a discount program through frontier. When I went to book my flight yesterday, It said I had never purchased the program and wanted to charge me full price for the flights. I immediately started looking for a customer service number, I could not find one. I searched through Google, finally found a number, and when you call all it does is say to use their chat service and then hangs up. So I go to their chat service it takes about 30 minutes for someone to even drop into the chat. And then every response I send them it takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to get back to me and they’ll ask me the same questions over and over. They’ll tell me “please wait two minutes while I look that up” and then 10 minutes later, they say it again, it took me over an hour to get it resolved. And I had to keep re-explaining the situation. They kept telling me that I didn’t have a membership and they could enroll me now for a fee. Like hello that’s what I contacted you about! Is everyone being replaced by AI/NPC/Bots or are these actually people? I thought I was going to lose my mind, when finally it was resolved and I could book my flight. The membership fee was $100 and when I was booking the bag fee was $47 each way. So I thought my bill was going to be $100 cheaper, which covers the bags. Unfortunately that is not what happened. When I was able to get my situation resolved, the flight price was increased to $186 more than it was when I initially tried. And then they also increased the bag fee from $47 to $70. So when it was all said and done, I paid more with the membership, than I would have without. Absolutely shady that I was given the run around by customer service and by the time my situation was resolved the rates were adjusted to make sure I didn’t receive a discount at all. That membership was a complete waste of money and going forward I will be taking my business elsewhere. Absolutely disgusted by the shady way they are doing business.

### “they lost a portion of the car seat”
Was told by Tampa we had to pay and check in our car seat, then the measurements we were given for free personal items were wrong. So they charged my account for checkin baggage, carry on bags and baby items. Was told I had to pay it or we could not fly. On flight home we were delayed over 3 hours, when I went to check-in the car seat they said I did not have to that it was free! When we went to board they pulled a bunch of us for things they did not on our first flights delaying us another 1/2 hour. When we finally arrived there was a plane loading in the spot we were to unload. Then that plane died and had to be unloaded and moved leaving us on the taxi lane for over an hour. Once we were unloaded we were directed to the wrong baggage claim and luckily another passenger somehow stumbled on the correct one and came back and told us. When we get the car seat back they lost a portion of the car seat and said they were not liable for it that it was our responsibility to make sure everything was secure. I turn in a claim and they labeled the charges as 2 check in baggage for my daughter going to OH and not coming back home (which was a lie as the only thing checked was the car seat that was forced to be checked), 2 baby items going to OH and not coming back (not sure what this was as we only had the 2 bags that we were told could be personalitems to carry on free and the child seat), 2 carry on going to OH and coming back. They did refund the 2 baby item charges but refuse to refund the made up checked baggage. I have turned them into my bank as fraudulent charges.

### “It was awful”
Not Verified | Horrible customer service and even worse ticketing service in Orlando. We were treated so rudely by the baggage check agents in Orlando. They were rude, inconsiderate of any passengers and were more interested in gossiping behind the counter than helping anyone. We were there two hours earlier but almost missed our flight because we had to wait in line TWICE to check our bags. They should have told us we needed to print a bag tag before getting in line. It was awful. Worst experience we have ever had with any airline we have flown with. We couldn’t believe how rude all the staff was. We wouldn’t fly Frontier if they paid us!

### "customer service was horrible"
Not Verified |   The customer service was horrible. The first woman who helped me was rude and gave a lot of attitude.. But the second lady that helped me was very kind. I was denied access to my flight despite being early- was told the won't check me in because I didn't have any way to do so, and when I asked for a flight move or a refund the denied me that. I had to pay almost double for the next flight.

### “such appalling customer service”
I'm deeply dismayed by the shocking treatment we endured from Frontier Airlines in Salt Lake City. In all my years of traveling, I've never encountered such appalling customer service. It all began with a simple inquiry about an excessive additional baggage fee. Instead of a polite explanation, we're met with hostility and disbelief from the staff. To our disbelief, we're pressured into paying an extra $100, falsely led to believe it would secure our place on the flight. This marked the beginning of a nightmare. After making the payment, we're abruptly informed that we're not allowed to board due to our 'persistent questioning' about the fees. This arbitrary decision left us shocked and distressed. Adding insult to injury, Frontier made baseless accusations of aggression and even summoned security to intimidate us. Fortunately, the airport personnel, showing more sense than Frontier, attempted to help mediate. Despite their efforts, we're heartlessly denied boarding without any valid explanation. Desperate for solution, we turned to customer service, hoping for assistance. However, we're met with indifference and apathy. Hours spent in futile online chats yielded nothing but a refusal to refund our money. How can a supposedly reputable airline treat paying customers with such blatant disrespect and dishonesty? Frontier' disregard for basic decency and consumer rights is truly reprehensible. After paying our tickets and luggage, Frontier effectively left us stranded in a city that wasn't our home. We're forced to scramble for funds to book alternative flights. People informed us that this mistreatment was common with Frontier. It's utterly unacceptable to leave paying customers stranded and helpless, especially when it's a recurring problem that the airline refuses to address.

### "nothing but rudeness"
Not Verified |   I was driven to the airport by a family member and apparently got to the San Juan airport late the morning of January 30, 2024. I'm also unable to walk fast as I am disabled. I am in my upper 70s. I've never felt so humiliated and stressed with the way I was treated in the San Juan airport by Frontier staff. They couldn't find my flight information and said I will not make my flight and there was no other flights that day and there's nothing they can do. I was shocked as now I found myself alone at that airport. I had even paid for insurance when I had purchased my ticket. I tried so hard to get them to help me but they told me to leave the airport. I had to purchase a new ticket to fly out at midnight. Now I see my credit card charged for the two flights on the same day. I called frontier and nothing but rudeness. I had my daughter call and they hung up on her. What is going on with Frontier employees? Whatever happened to Customer Service?? By reading up on their reviews I see nothing good. I wish I would have read them before I chose them to travel. Thankfully my credit card is on this to fix the problem. I am now flying to Florida next month on another airline. M

### "avoid this airline"
Not Verified |   My significant other had knee replacement surgery and ended up having complications and our trip was no longer possible. Dealing with Frontier was a nightmare. You can't call anyone. So I drove to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport to talk with an agent in-person and was told they could not help me, that I had to talk with someone on-line to change my reservation. The on-line chat was slow and very hard to use for detailed communication about rescheduling the flight. As I was unable to get reliable assistance to reschedule I canceled the flights for both of us and am now trying to obtain a refund from the travel insurance agency. In addition, I found inexpensive Frontier flights on-line for our new travel dates but was not given those flights as options when I went to reschedule. It would have cost me $1076 to reschedule our flights so it was cheaper to cancel and lose $500. To say travel with Frontier is risky is an understatement. No amount of money saved was worth the stress and hassle of nearly absent customer service. I will say that the staff I had direct interaction with were friendly and very apologetic but completely unable to assist me. Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline.

### "charged $100 for each backpack"
Not Verified |  The flight from MSP to DEN was delayed by 2 hours, and the return flight from DEN to MSP was delayed by 2 hours. These delays significantly inconvenienced my travel plans. To add to my frustration, we were charged $100 for each backpack at the gate in Denver, even though these backpacks were allowed for free in Minneapolis and easily fit under the seat in front of us on the plane. I have used these backpacks as personal items on many flights before without any issues. Not only did the gate agent charge us more than the stated $70 per bag at the airport, but they were also incredibly rude and unhelpful when we sought a refund. We were instructed to contact Frontier for resolution. Furthermore, the delay on the return flight from DEN to MSP was attributed to "customer service needs," which I strongly believe was caused by the gate agents charging numerous customers for their personal items, creating unnecessary delays. This experience has been incredibly disappointing, and it has left a lasting negative impression on me. I have always appreciated various airlines' services during my domestic and international travels, but I have never encountered such a disheartening experience. I am committed to sharing my unfortunate experience with Frontier Airlines and will discourage others from choosing your airline in the future.

### "hate Frontier Airlines with passion"
Not Verified |   Arrived at Orlando 2 hours early. Had 1 bag to check. The line for this was longer than I'd ever seen anywhere in over 30 years of flying. By the time we got to the front of the line we missed the cutoff and were refused service. Had to rebook to Detroit for additional 200 dollars. I am furious and now hate Frontier Airlines with passion. I also have to get from DTW to GRR on my dime. So sad I tried to save a couple bucks and got screwed. Did I mention the bag checking was understaffed and a bit rude? Do yourself a favor and avoid frontier.

### “the last time I fly with them”
Not Verified | Never experienced such a frustrating experience with any airline as I have with Frontier. Unfortunately todays experience will be the last time I fly with them. Individuals want to be treated responsibly and respectfully. I’ve only ever wrote a few google reviews but felt compelled to let other potential passengers know of my experience. Frontier sends you an email reminder to check in. The email has a hyperlink that connects you to their internet based online check in. Upon two days of trying to check in online my family gets to the airport goes to the ticketing counter and the associates refuse to provide any assistance whatsoever. Stating they only serve customers who have checked in. I explain again I’ve repeatedly tried and then literally show the associate how their system gets stuck in the check in process when you don’t check or carry on a bag. They push me aside and say you’ll have to continue to try and please step out of line. I do so frustratingly. I request a supervisor. None come. I wait. Ask again if they could assist or get a supervisor. A different associate says that getting a supervisor will be difficult. I wait. I wait more. Now I’m irritated. No one comes. I finally come to the realization that I may not be able to check in even though they’ve already collected my payment via their online system. So I figured I’ll try and attempt to get the Frontier app. The app did get me checked in just in time. I find disheartening that their website and associates say to check in online via the internet. The saddest part was the lack of assistance from the various Frontier associates.

### "Annoyed customer"
Do not buy tickets from them no matter how cheap they are. You will be responsible for $73.99 to have a carryon or $99 at the airport. I paid for the carryon because it had my clothes, how ironic they would charge. Go with Priceline. I didn't due to no flights at the time. With Priceline most airlines allow 2 carryons at no charge. Took them 3 hrs to get me my e-ticket. You get what you pay for. Annoyed customer.

### "shutting down the Frontier credit card"
I've been a United Airlines fan for years, but recently got hooked into Frontier because of needing to fly DEN to STL for a year. I made the mistake of signing up for their credit card. Similar to their flights, it looked like an amazing deal. After a few months of winding through the Frontier maze of add-on charges and loopholes and restrictions, and never getting the miles from the credit card (with mafioso interest rate ), then comparing the actual cost for a flight with United (which makes everything so simple and easy and clear and fair) it turns out the cost is only a bit higher with United. And I get to keep my sanity. And I'm shutting down the Frontier credit card that never gave me the miles it promised. I like life without feeling scammed. And I'm willing to pay a bit more for that.

### "help at counter was awful"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled as many were because of the  weather". Nobody was issued a voucher for anything, no help with finding a new flight, a motel (as we were all in a different country) nothing. The help at counter was awful and only stated  What do you want us to do ?

### "they nickel and dime you"
Frontier Airlines is genuinely the worst airline I have ever flown. They are dishonest, deceptive, and astonishingly cheap. The best way to describe them is "bait and switch". They want to bill themselves as a budget carrier, but the way they nickel and dime you with drip pricing, you don't actually save much money. First of all, their checked bag weight limit is 40 lbs, 10 lbs less than other carriers. And even one pound over triggers a $100 overweight fee. You get no carryon with your ticket, so that's another nearly $100 for a single carryon if you do so at the counter. They will keep you off the plane if you don't pay this, even refuse to print a boarding pass. All snacks are paid for on the flight, including non-alcoholic drinks. I paid almost $5 for a 12 oz can of club soda. Other items were similarly outrageously priced, and there was no menu so I had to ask about everything and the price. Everything on board was tiny, from the tray tables that were smaller than my hand to the bathroom, which was so small that when I was sitting on the toilet, my knees were pressed against one another and I'm not a big guy. The seats were almost on top of one another to cram as many people in as possible and didn't even have the option to recline the slightest amount. There was one incredibile person on the flight. Most of the flight crew were basically robots who did the job with little attention paid to the actual humans they were supposed to be helping. The person at the gate who gate checked my baby stroller didn't tell me what I should do with all the paperwork they gave me, so I had to juggle a baby, stroller, paperwork, and a diaper bag at the plane entrance to do something I could have prepped more comfortably if they gave me actual instructions. This is worse than famously terrible Spirit Airlines. A wretched experience that I am not looking forward to repeating on the way home, but they've already stolen so much from me and would take even more to change flights that I can't afford to get literally any other carrier. The worst part is that, considering the overwhelming number of bad reviews and the fact that they still exist, this will only have a minimal effect. .

### “customer service is an absolute joke”
Frontier may be the worst airline. When you search for flights they come in 100-150$ cheeped than United or Delta or any respectable airline. They charge you to choose your seat, pay for check bags and carry-ons. Then they charge you $25 to put on a bag tag to show where your bag is going. The seat on the plane a very little to no cushion. They don’t recline. If you are on a flight over 2 hours it’s very uncomfortable. The customer service is an absolute joke. Terrible is to good of a word to describe it. No one will pick up a phone and talk to you it’s all through text. They will then ask you to email them details about a problem and don’t respond as promised.

### “fly someone else”
Not Verified | I booked flights from Denver to Cancun back in early October, our flights have changed multiple times so good thing we haven’t booked a shuttle yet. I had a work thing come up and I needed to change my return flight to Dallas, I called their third party customer service line and was told I would have to pay the difference in the flights and $150 service fee, the flight was $80 so I just bit it and decided to keep my original booking and fly frontier from Cancun to Dallas. I rebooked this a month later so early November. It’s not three weeks from when we fly back to the States and Frontier notified me that my 3 and a half hour flight to Dallas was cancelled and I was out on a 13 hour travel time flight that would go to Atlanta and then have a 6 hour layover then go to Dallas (makes zero sense) so my complaint is that I understand that my plans change, I pay for the consequences, their plans changes and boohoo it’s your problem to fix not theirs. So not only am I losing money on a wasted plane trip back to Denver that I won’t be on, I had to book a more expensive flight through another airline for my flight to Dallas because it is short notice. I don’t get $150 change fee for their inconvenience. I’ve emailed them with my review and I highly doubt I’ll ever hear back. This is minimal given some of the other reviews I have read but once again, we are just a number to this company, we don’t matter, we just provide them their paychecks. Save your time and money and fly someone else. You’ll save money in the long run. We haven’t flown out to Cancun yet but I’m just waiting to see what the next added cost will be. I wish I was shocked but to watch their collapse into absolute shit has been sad, they were a great company back in the day, if they could see this company now I would hope they would be disgusted, embarrassed and ashamed of their treatment to their paying customers and their total lack of responsibility and compassion. I do want to say that I haven’t had a problem with their staff ever, it’s just been leading up to the flight where they truly do not care about you.

### “won’t help you if problems arise”
Not Verified | This is the first and last time we’ll ever take Frontier. We took this flight only because our previous one was canceled. Both airports were somewhat out of the way which is inconvenient but we took what we could get. When buying the tickets, we thought it was ridiculous to be charged $100 extra for a bag over 40 lbs but we went ahead anyway. When we went to claim our bag, one wheel was missing, one was broken, and another was likely structurally compromised as it broke soon after. I honestly don’t know how a suitcase could be broken that badly if someone tried, let alone if only carelessness was involved. We filed a claim for a refund but they said they wouldn’t help us because we didn’t send the file in the time period that they wanted. Even if there was good reason for that policy, it was unreasonable to expect customers to just “know” that. I tried to explain that and I posted photo proof of the damage (including the time it was taken, which was soon after landing), but they didn’t respond. They didn’t care about proof or security cameras or anything. They just want to penny pinch I suppose, to the expense of their reputation. This airline doesn’t treat their customers well. Even if you encounter no problems on a flight, they won’t help you if problems arise on the next flight. We wasted too much money on this rip-off of an airline. Steer clear and don’t make the same mistake! Their customer service is awful. It’s better to pay lots more for better service somewhere else.

### “ avoid at all costs”
Arrived at Philly airport at 4:00am on 1/16/24 to fly to Orlando, flight got delayed from it’s original departure of 11:20am, it got delayed till 1:00pm and after taxing to the runway it was cancelled due to mechanical issues so we got put in a different aircraft due to leave & 3:30pm and after a couple of hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, flight got timed out so it got cancelled again without any other news. So we have been trying to fly for over 24 hours and had to pay a hotel plus all the food. Frontier Airlines so far is the worst airline and it needs to go out of business but people need to read the reviews and do not use them. I really suggest travelers to use a different airline, avoid at all costs flying Frontier.

### "experienced wonderful service"
Not Verified |  I flew with Frontier Airlines last December and we experienced wonderful service from ground staff and cabin crew and the crew helped me put my backpack in the over-head bin. There was no wifi or Entertainment screen so we used our time to sleep in the flight. Value for money was great too. Seat was comfortable. There were no snacks onboard though. Will fly with them again!

### “worst airport staff”
The worst airport staff at Frontier Airlines I’ve ever encountered anywhere, not helpful at all. I was travelling with 2 children so I had to fill in 3 Ecards because I was travelling internationally, I asked for help as I didn’t know I had to do this. I checked online and nothing said I needed to do this until I tried to check my bags. The women at the front desk was very rude and loud, told me to move if I didn’t have my ecard ready, she didn’t try to help just shoved me off to the side and told me to fill it out online and get out the way and to join the back of the line when I’ve done it. I managed to do this it took me over an hour and a very nice woman took the time to explain this to me from a different airline. We arrived at MCO with 90 mins before our flight, more than enough time, when I finally got to the rude woman again she hurried me through, the first 2 bags (the kids) were both under by 6kg & 5.5kg then told me 1 of my bags was over 0.5 kg hardly anything & my other bags I paid for were both under but she told me I still had to pay the $79.99 and I didn’t have time to argue and I would miss my flight if I didn’t hand over the money, she said I’ll stay here all day and you may miss your flight I don’t care you got to pay lady. I said my other bags are under I’ll just take something out and put it in the other case, she said no if shes taking it off I can miss my flight and get to the back of the line. Honestly the woman was a bully, I suggest Frontier look in to their staff. Based on that 1 horrible woman I wouldn’t want to fly with Frontier again, I’d rather pay 2 or 3 times more money to make sure I never encounter that sort of treatment again. I don’t know if she didn’t like her job or she just didn’t like me.

### "Will never travel with Frontier again"
The worst customer service I ever experienced! To check in at the counter you have to pay 25$ per person for boarding pass print! Agent at the counter was very miserable and not friendly at all! At the gate same person charged me 100$ for bag pack that could fit into the allowed sizing slot and definitely under the sit in front of me. So, in addition to flying ticket, I had to pay 150$ extra! It would be cheaper if I went with other airlines. Will never travel with Frontier again!

### "so strict with the overweight"
Words don't describe how bad this airline is. I have flown with many companies over the years, but nothing compares to Frontier Airlines. The only reason I booked with Frontier is because they were the only one that fitted in with our plans. I was warned not to fly with them but we had no choice. From the get go, their lines for checking in were horrendous. Only 2 staff to check people in for an aircraft that took over 200 people. Every member of staff spoke to you like you were lower than dirt. Most unhelpful staff iv ever met. And to top it off, in front of us were first time flyers, you would think that they would be more helpful to them and make them comfortable (They knew they were first time as I heard them say it to the staff member) Not only have we paid more for this flight then all 4 of my other flights put together (Including luggage) we were 5 pounds over on one bag and 11 on the other. No problem I said I'll just take the 5 out and put it in my carry on. The lady that was getting everyone through quickly (because they were running behind) said I cant do that. There's no time. Im shutting the flight soon. So because of their incompetence of not opening more check in desks, and organising people better - I now have to pay £250 on top of what I've already paid for my luggage. So a $700 flight (without luggage) turned into a $1200 flight. For a 2hr 30min flight. I have never been so disgusted in all my life. It was cheaper for me and my wife to fly from London to Miami, Guatemala City to Houston, Austin to JFK & finally JFK to London - All with checked in baggage - Than it was for this one flight with Frontier airline - Miami to Guatemala City. I understand I found great deals for this to happen, the main thing that grinds me is the way we are handled. Like cattle. They were so strict with the overweight on our baggage. The staff need to learn manners and learn to speak to human beings in general.

### "never had a worse experience"
Frontier Airlines is the absolute biggest scam of all the airlines. Guaranteed delays every flight, they will charge you for anything you go to an employee for, by the time you board your flight you can count on paying more than any other respectable airline. The employees will cuss you out and make you wait in ridiculous line. Don’t even bother requesting a refund they will not even consider it. All my friends and family have heard about my experience and I advise everyone to never fly with these scammers. I have never had a worse experience.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  I booked a ticket for my 68 year old mother to fly from Denver to Houston to come visit us. She arrived at the airport and checked in 3 hours prior to her flight. Due to security and her being unable to get the assistance with movement to her gate and her being 68 years old by the time she got to her gate they had closed the doors and would not let her board. To add insult to injury when trying to get booked on a later flight they wanted to charge an extra $99. She went to customer service and called me and when I tried to explain the issue to the gate agent she put the phone down and refused to speak to me. Mind you there were no harsh words or attitude from my end. Trying to call the corporate office it sends a chat link which is totally automated and will do everything but get you to an actual person. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and now I understand why everyone says dont fly Frontier.

### "no traditional Customer Service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely no traditional Customer Service offered. Customers are forced to use Chat or Email only, no one to call with questions. I was forced to drive all the way to the airport 1 week before my trip to request wheelchair assistance at the check-in counter because I couldn't get a response any other way. The seats I was "crammed" into were just awful. The brackets used to secure the row of seats to the floor in front of me required careful navigation and negotiation in order to avoid tripping and falling. The seats do not recline at all which left me with a sore back after the flight. There is very little cushion at all. The only good thing I can say about Frontier is that their staff was nice and efficient. I'd rather pay more for a better traveling experience.

### "never be flying frontier again"
I don’t think I’ve even been on a frontier flight that was majorly delayed or cancelled. The plane almost always arrives late to the gate and therefore delays departure by minimum 30 min. I’ve had flight get delayed 2-3 hours. I had one flight change destination airport altogether which resulted and even more delay at the arrival gate since they were not expecting us. Not to mention it was the airport I was expecting to land at which was a major inconvenience. It’s safe to say I’ll never be flying frontier again. I rather pay a little more than lose hours of my time waiting on frontier to depart.

### “they cancelled all flights”
Not Verified |  I was sold a “GoWild Pass” for fall winter so I could travel cheaply between PHL and CHS. A few weeks after I purchased the pass, they cancelled all flights between Philly and Charleston saying they would resume in April / after My GoWild pass expired. When I asked for a refund, I was told “Too bad - you didn’t read the fine print where it says we have absolutely 0 responsibility for anything after you pay us.

### "Horrible airline"
Not Verified | Horrible airline. It was my first time flying with Frontier and will never be my intention to even get close to them in future. Very rude, inexperienced agents, flight crews, specifically the flight between Las Vegas and Dallas. Very unreliable mobile app which doesn't give you accurate information, several hidden fees that you don't know until you buy ticket. I just saw normal flight attendants/crews from LAS to Seattle (Dec 20th). So, I'm excluding those staff from this complain as they did their job like any other regular airline. But the rest of my experience for the four flight/connections from Seattle to Dallas through Las Vegas was horrible and I'd recommend everyone to not look at saving a few dollars by buying ticket from Frontier.

### "banned my tickets"
Not Verified |  I have been flying with Frontier Airlines for a very long time never had an issue until December 17th 2023. Flight #1458 from MDW Chicago Illinois to MCO Orlando fl. On December 16th I flew with them with no issues. On the 17th I had a little personal item that fitted well on the free personal item stand. One of the customer service lady asked me to go ahead and place my personal bag to measure it to see if it fit. It fitted very well and I told her that yesterday I came same airplane it was a issue why are asking me pay 100$ for same personal item. She was very rude unprofessional, responding I don't care if you don't want to pay you will not be boarding to my airline and I ask her for supervisor, both unprofessional, very rude, banned my tickets. I had to go buy another ticket from southwest last minutes when I got banned from them and I asked the supervisor if they will booked me another ticket since I can't fly with them, her answer was you go ahead buy your own ticket with another airline. It's not our problem.

### "flight was delayed 2 hours"
The flight was delayed 2 hours. The plane was unbearably hot when we boarded and remained hot throughout the flight. Frontier knew ahead of time that the flight was not going to be on time but only sent an email notification about 15 minutes before boarding was supposed to take place.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience of my life. I bought a ticket for my mother to fly down to visit her grandchildren. At the front check-in they charged her $180 for ONE checked suitcase! That's 50% more than the price of the ticket. Then, when I myself flew Frontier, they tried to upsell everything they possibly could through the website. If I agreed to all the add-on charges, the trip would have cost over $1,000. And try calling customer service. I couldn't get through. I will never again in my life fly Frontier Airlines.

### “take your money elsewhere”
Not Verified |  I attempted to use this airline via my company. I was scheduled for a short easy flight from Phoenix to Las Vegas. Easy right? Not for this airline. After swallowing the bitter pill of excess charges for a checked luggage my flight was delayed by over 4 hours. My scheduled holiday party was to start at 7 PM. I was basically arriving at the airport when it is half over. I encourage anyone who really cares for their time and planning to absolutely boycott this company and take your money elsewhere!

### “Just horrible!”
Not Verified |   Worst airline with no customer service standards! I made a booking for me and my two kids! The price for each ticket was under $100. I didn’t add any extra to the booking! I didn’t add bags or even select seats! The price stayed that way until I hit confirm! Once the booking was confirmed my confirmed total jumped to $584.94. Within that minute I canceled it due to the wrong amount charged! Frontier has confirmed the time stamp for the book was booked at 12:04 and canceled at 12:05 on the same day! I tried to reach out to customer right away but was unsuccessful! This company have no direct number to speak with any one which is horrible! I called all numbers listed online, they just hang up on you. I tried to reach out via chat but was just getting system generated messages! I reached out to my bank to dispute the charge and was given a temporary credit! Almost two months after I received a letter from my bank that Frontier claims it WAS a valid charge, denied the dispute, the credit was again taken from my account! After that I was advised by my bank that I would have to settle this with the airline because Frontier is not providing them with all the information needed and it so hard to get a hold of any one there. I reached back out in the chat taking forever to finally speak with a person. The rep advised me the reason why my price change was because I added a bundle, I advised him that I DID NOT add any extras because I didn’t need to so that was a website error and canceled within a min! He then said they cannot issue me a refund because it was already a dispute and give from my bank! I them sent him the letter the bank sent me showing where the credit was reversed, he still refused to refund the booking! Offered a full flight credit trying to force me to deal with this horrible company again, I declined! So now Frontier stole $584.94 from me due to their poor website and refuses to refund it! Companies without proper customer service channels should not be allowed to exist! Just horrible!

### "charged for wheelchair service"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is not a good airline to fly, the service is bad. They charge you extra for luggage, the seats are real small on the airplane. Customer service at the ticket agent is bad, they charged my wife for wheelchair service. Frontier Airlines needs to improve their service. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "Charged $100 for a carry on"
Worst airline. Would never recommend. Charged $100 for a carry on at the gate without them even telling me the price. Not to mention, my “carry on” had plenty of space to fit underneath the seat. Absolutely horrendous. Save yourself the hassle/money and fly with a real airline. The personal item allowed would not even fit certain backpacks of regular size. Terrible airline that I will not see myself ever flying with again.

### “a SCAM from Frontier Airlines”
Not Verified | My wife and I purchased Go Wild passes since we have really flexible schedules. We live in Austin, TX. There are absolutely no available flights ever. I've tried time and time again and the only place you can get flights from are Denver and Las Vegas, and they are limited. I contacted customer service and after a few canned emails, they just completely stopped responding to me. We spent $500 for a SCAM from Frontier Airlines.

### "First and last time with this airline"
The worst. My first time flying with this airline. Even after hearing all the bad reviews, we decided to give them a chance. What was supposed to be a quick trip to Atlanta for a surprise bday party for a family member. We chose an early flight (9am) so that we can spend a day touring Atlanta and visiting family members. We get a text on our way to the airport saying our flight was delayed 2hrs, with no explanation. So now we aren’t leaving until noon, mind you we’ve been up since 5am to ensure we got to the airport in time. Once on the plane, we are then told there is too much fuel and we had to waive for the fuel truck to remove some of the fuel. After sitting on the plane for about 20 minutes we were then told we needed to deviate the plane. Once off the plane, we sat for an additional 20 minutes and then was told they needed 40 people to voluntarily swim their flight and if they didn’t get 40 people they would just start scratching people. Just unreal. So they got 40 people (bless their hearts) so finally at 2pm we are ready for departure. Needless to say our planned day in Atlanta was ruined and we were exhausted. They did try to rectify it, by sending my family a $50 voucher for another Frontier plane ride to schedule within 90 days. No thank you. First and last time dealing with this airline.

### "Terrible in every respect"
Terrible in every respect 1. We could not check in on their website. 2. They tried to charge us $25 for printing boarding passes. Only relented when we proved we couldn’t do it on website. 3. first flight delayed two hours 4. second flight delayed 15 hours. Original explanation: forgot to turn the plane on. Not making that up. 5. offered $15 food voucher for our inconvenience 6. looking at 27 hours in transit for a Cross country trip. Can’t recommend using another airline strongly enough.

### "What a horrible experience"
I remember a few years ago Frontier was the cool airline. You talked about which animal was on the tail of the aircraft you flew on. Not anymore. What a horrible experience. I tried to do everything right but the minute we entered Frontier space the "hell" began. I paid over $200 for bags. The people were not customer friendly at all. The woman at the gate was really disrespectful. The information provided was not clear as I wasn't in zone 1 and didn't realize I was not allowed a personal item. It was charge after charge after charge. They didn't seat my husband and I together even though the flight was a little more than half full. It was simply a ploy to get you to spend more money on a seat. We traveled to meet our new grandchild and this flight home ruined a very special the trip. I will never fly Frontier again. Any airline is better than this rude, nickle and diming airline.

### "a customer last horrible attitude"
Our flight was delayed almost 2 hours. Which I'm not surprised because every time I fly frontier it's the same story. I watched one of your agents attack a poor mother, and her four year old kid. All over the baggage cash grab at the gate that's so subjective. I saw the bag fit in the bin provided by frontier However the agent was persistent it didn't so she tried to shake this poor lady and her 4year old down for 100 bucks. The poor mother was panicking so bad I had to get involved and offered to pay. The mother explained that she was on a connecting frontier flight from Phoenix and had no issues on that. But the agent didn't care and wanted to be confrontational. The mother missed her flight and I paid 900 to a real airline, United so she and her 4 year old could get home. Frontier Airlines staff left this poor lady and her 4 year old stranded in Vegas with out batting an eye! I still can't believe it happened. I'll never fly frontier again. All agents I came across in Vegas had a customer last horrible attitude. You need to see how your agents talk to your customers it's 100% unacceptable.

### "not do announcements for gate changes"
Not Verified |  Zero stars if I could. I am a first-time flyer and I went to the gate stated on my ticket, there was no PA or announcement sent to me stating that the gate was changed. I asked after noticing something was off and the gate was very far away. I ended up missing my flight so when I called Frontier stated they do not do announcements for gate changes. How is that right? Seems like they should have to let you know that. Pretty nice scam if you ask me as they do not refund you and wanted another 200.00 dollars to rebook my flight. I would suggest looking elsewhere first.

### "Absolutely horrific"
Absolutely horrific. Flight was delayed twice making me, my wife and son miss our connecting flight in Ontario, CA to Orlando. Customer service did nothing other than book us on a direct flight later in the night at 11:06pm which was also delayed until 12:05am the next morning!! All day and night at Las Vegas airport because of this disaster of an airline. Wasting my time and more importantly money because now I am going to lose wages due to their incompetence! Do not fly with Frontier. Cheaper means headaches. Do yourself a favor and appreciate your time - it is valuable and they do not respect that.

### “I felt disrespected”
Not Verified | I used Frontier for my trip from Las Vegas to Dallas and I must say I was annoyed. For a college student, Frontier is affordable, and for the price, the legroom is amazing. However, I didn’t appreciate the treatment from the flight attendants. Firstly, my friend and I were moved to a different seat because the person we were sitting next to was paralyzed and needed to sit next to his wife, which was understandable, therefore we moved to our new assigned seats. The flight attendant questioned whether I was with my friend, and I told her yes. She said NO and went on to ask my friend whether I was with her. I assumed she didn’t believe me, and I felt disrespected. Plus, I disliked the way she handled the situation. It was as though she was ordering me to move from the seat with no “could you please” and no reason as to why I had to move. The reason was given after I had to ask. As much as I appreciated the legroom the treatment from the flight attendants disregarded that factor.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I booked a trip in March 2023 to travel from Phoenix to San Francisco. I got a good deal, or shall I say that I thought that I got a good deal. After waiting online about 30 to 45 minutes to check our bags as the kiosk was not working, I had to spend $150 to check one luggage piece and one carry on. After checking our bags, we noticed a long line to go up stairs to the gate. Some said that we could take the elevator. About 15 of us literally sprinted and we caught the elevator just before the doors closed. We got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. We then boarded the flight and I had to ask for coffee as they did not serve that on the flight. When we departed SF, my daughter checked the bags online which was still about $130. Not only that, they flights were changed about two to three times. I will never fly with them again.

### "The worst airline possible"
The worst airline possible. There are extra charges for everything. I paid 3 times the original price. The service is terrible and you also have to pay to talk to an agent. Be aware you are not getting a cheap ticket it’s all a big lie!

### "We will never fly Frontier again"
We were supposed to self transfer to Frontier airlines when we arrived at Seattle airport for our 1:45 pm plane. We got to the airport at 12:30 pm and there were no frontier employees there. We called customer service and they told us that the employee at the front desk can move us to another carrier. The first frontier employee came in at 3:30 pm, they told us our flight was changed and will not be leaving until 6:15 pm. They refused to refund our money due to "fine print" or switch us to another carrier because "we accept transfers from other airlines, but don't send any of our people to anyone else". We had to stay overnight at the airport, got home a day later than expected and were not notified. We will never fly Frontier again. They were unhelpful, uninformative, gave misinformation, and provided NO alternatives for their 12+ hr flight delay.

### "staff were AMAZING"
First, addressing bad reviews: I chose this airline for the reduced prices. They can offer this bcz of the layovers and smaller planes. If that is not want you want, pay the much higher price and good luck if you are thinking that will buy a guarantee. People think they can get something for free if they complain. What a nasty trend. My experience was what was expected having layovers. They staff on the other hand were AMAZING. They were polite, accommodating, on top of everyone's needs and protective of their clients. I hope Frontier commends them.

### "a horrible airline"
Not Verified |   I arrived at the airport (5:20 am) and was in line more than 90 minutes prior to my flight. When I finally got to the baggage check-in (they only had two agents for several hundred people in line), after an hour and a half in line, I was told that the plane just left, and I would have to be rebooked. I was rebooked for a flight the next morning. I had originally paid for a seat in row 9, but when I was rebooked they put me in row 38. I paid again to get a better seat, then when I checked in the next day, they would not credit me for paying twice for the seat, and the agent did not seem to care that I lost a day of my trip because of their staff shortage. Frontier is a horrible airline.

### "Never Flying Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Never Flying Frontier again. Worst airline experience. Chicago to Atlanta delayed 2 hrs; mechanical issue. Missed connection. Rebooked for Atlanta to Orlando. That flight was delayed 4 hrs due to a mechanical issue. Total delay 6 hrs. Staff do not care to help. Do not care at all with exception for nickel and dime fee announcements.

### "charged $99 for the bag"
The only positive in this experience were the pilots who brought us safe to Denver. Where do I begin to explain how their $54 ticket ended up coating me at least &500? Sms and email around midnight that our 6 am flight is postponed by 4hrs. I had to cancel taxi, change car rental at destination (which ended up being almost twice as expensive as the original one). The passive aggressive robot at Detroit gate, who charged $99 for the bag that is smaller than the Frontier measures on website (but peaked a little bit out of their bin, which is def. smaller than their website measures for personal item). A further delay of 2 hours at gate due to computer error, which nobody told us for 2 hours while we were sitting at gate with zero information when and if we will ever leave. Ended up driving in hazardous weather in Colorado because I'm the 6+ hours of our delays there was a snow storm+ a road accident at Vail Pass which held us additional 1+ hour in traffic. Yes, they did send a $75 voucher, which must be used for further flights only, not for food or bags. Will I ever fly them again? I highly doubt it.

### "Don’t waste your time with Frontier"
Not Verified |  Never again. The stress of dealing with Frontier is not worth any savings you get on the cost. Received emails that original plane was substituted for smaller plane. Needed people to change flights. Then on our two hour trip to Charlotte we received another email stating the flight was delayed and instead of it being a 2 hour flight. It now was going to take 14 hours and not arrive until the next morning. The worst part of it was we tried for an hour to contact Frontier to see if we could cancel. Of course no one answered the phone. Had to use the what’s app only to be jerked around by a computer generated responses that never answered our questions. Drove all the way to Charlotte hoping there was a human at the gate to answer our questions. Fully expected to book with another airline to make our planned arrival. Don’t waste your time with Frontier, pay a little more not to be jerked around.

### "$150 fare ended up $500"
The worst airline I have ever flown. They claim they have low fares, but then make you pay large sums for absolutely everything. My $150 fare ended up $500 when all was said and done. They seats are terribly uncomfortable, staff unfriendly and the longest check in lines I've ever been in. There was only 1 person checking passengers in at the airport and about 40 people in line. Avoid this airline at all costs!

### "the worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  This is the worst flight experience I’ve ever had! They delayed our flight 5 hours, but they only delayed an hour or two at a time 3 times. Then once we boarded we sat on the runway for 2 hours. They would not allow anyone to use the restroom until people started protesting toward the end of the wait. They then told us they had to change flight crew, so they taxied back in and told us to get off only to cancel the flight. We had to wait in line for 1 hour, only for the person at the desk to give us a business card with a QR code for a refund. I mean seriously, they didn’t think to pass these out while we were sitting on the plane or exiting the aircraft? Then customer was a real joy! They had 1 person for the entire plane who yelled out that we were all a bunch of whiners. We lost our air bnb stay and excursions booked for the day, not to mention taking off a whole day of work that didn’t need to happen. I get it, flights get cancelled and things happen, but we felt like we kept getting strung along with no transparency of what was actually going on. The saying that goes, “Buy cheap, pay twice”, is so accurate in this situation. We thought we were saving $ by flying Frontier, but it cost us more in the end!

### "Not good and not happy"
Not Verified |  Had a layover in Vegas. Landed and found there was no connecting flight to Phoenix. Flight cancelled. Next flight was the next morning at 6am. Was told i would have food vouchers. The gentlemen at the counter for ticketing said he was unable to get me vouchers and i asked for his superior/manager. I was forwarded on to another gentlemen who said he was the manager and another guy that was also bumped received vouchers. I was told they were going to be emailed to me and i got nothing. On top of that I ended up paying for a cab to a hotel and getting a hotel which the whole trip ended up costing an additional $350. Not good and not happy. Also was delayed for work day the next day.

### "Who charges for a carry-on bag"
The most ridiculous experience I have ever had traveling. I would rather rent a car and drive than fly with Frontier again. The agents only care about collecting as many extra fees as possible. A normal / good airline is the same price once you add the fees (checked bag fee, bag overweight fee and if it is over 39 lbs., it is considered by this low budget airline to be overweight and carry-on bag fee). Who charges for a carry-on bag - what nonsense. zero entertainment on board. If you pay for and take a carry-on bag of any kind, they will require you to stuff the bag into the bin at the gate - this bin is not a "standard airline" sized bin, it is a undersized bin that Frontier has fabricated to collect yet another fee, so prepare to pack undersized and underweight in every category or pay extra.

### "never received my confirmation number"
Not Verified |  I never received my confirmation number to check in online and obtain the boarding pass, in consequence I had to be helped by a lady at the kiosk, who charged me $25.00 to print my boarding pass. Later on one lady at the moment of boarding announced that the flight was oversold and that it was offered $600if you agreed to flight later in a different time and place. When I went to her to ask for further details about this, she told me to Be quiet and stop talking - very rude, I was very decent in a friendly tone of voice.

### "worst airline I’ve ever used"
By far the worst airline I’ve ever used. By the time you pay for all the additional fees, it’s the same price as a good airline (carry on bags, checked bags, overweight fee - all other airlines let you take up to 50lbs, but not this horrible airline) Do the math on all of the charges before you waste your money.

### "whole experience was awful"
This airline used to be good. The terminals were dirty, with ripped and stained seats and garbage everywhere. The customer service agents showed up like 2 minutes before boarding, not an hour before the flight. There were no customer service agents when you got off the plane. They charge you for everything, even if you need a printed boarding pass! No carry on without paying. No luggage without paying. No water. Flight attendants were rude, yelling at people and telling them to hurry up. The whole experience was awful and I will never use Frontier again.

### "the stress isn't worth the savings"
I had booked a round-trip ticket, hoping for a smooth journey. Little did I know, I was in for a nightmare. On my outbound flight, we spent a staggering 3 hours on the plane before being informed of technical issues. The flight was eventually delayed by a whopping 9 hours! Nine hours of sitting in the airport with no compensation whatsoever. I ended up shelling out a fortune on overpriced airport food just to survive the wait. Now, let's talk about my return flight. I received a notification about a 1.5-hour delay, which I diligently checked while on my way to the airport. To my dismay, upon arrival, the departure board showed an on-time status. Long story short, the plane left without me and several others who faced the same issue. The airline's excuse? It was updated 4 hours ago. Well, guess what? We checked, and it was not! I wasted an additional 4 hours at the airport just to secure a rescheduled flight for the next day. Another day in a hotel, more expenses, and an overall stress-inducing experience. This airline is an absolute disaster! Don't be enticed by the low prices; you'll end up paying more in frustration, inconvenience, and unexpected costs. Trust me, the stress isn't worth the savings. Save yourself the trouble and choose a more reliable airline for your peace of mind.

### "Horrible customer service"
Charges $25 for boarding pass, deplorable. Horrible customer service. No complaint phone number. I refuse to spend another penny with Frontier. What if I didn’t have the $25? I wouldn’t have made my flight to see my ill father. They even refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor.

### "carry on policy is ridiculous"
Will never fly frontier again. Their carry on policy is ridiculous. They charge a ridiculous amount of money for their carry on policy. I brought one personal item onto the plane and I was forced to pay for it to be a carry on even though it fit comfortably below the seat. The seats are uncomfortable, the crew is not very friendly, and overall my experience was not worth the money I paid for this flight. Immensely disappointed in Frontier. They brand themselves as a cheap option, but when you add up all of their hidden fees it is just as much as flying Alaska, Southwest, or Delta. Wouldn’t recommend the airline to my worst enemy.

### "frequent flight cancellations"
I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the frequent flight cancellations that I have experienced with Frontier Airlines. While I understand that occasional disruptions can happen in the aviation industry, the consistent cancellations have resulted in significant inconveniences for me, causing not only lost vacations but also disruptions to critical business meetings. Over the past several months, I have booked multiple flights with Frontier Airlines, only to have them canceled at the last minute. This has not only led to the loss of non-refundable accommodations and wasted travel expenses but has also negatively impacted my personal and professional life. When people book a flight with any airline you are expecting them to provide a reliable and efficient service, especially when it comes to business travel. However, the recurring cancellations have eroded my confidence in Frontier to have the ability to meet its commitments. I recommend everyone not to buy a flight or any package that they offer.

### "we were very embarrassed"
Not Verified |  Me and my wife were allotted adjacent seats in the boarding pass and asked to move to different seats, we were told if we do not move we will forced to get off the flight, we were very embarrassed.

### "Customer service was chat only"
In December 2022 my wife's flight out of Conn. was cancelled at their suggestion after delay which would have caused her to miss a connecting flight in Atlanta. Her luggage had been checked earlier. When she went to retrieve her bag it was no where to be found. A lost bag complaint was immediately filed. Frontier staff stated they thought it had to be stolen by another passenger. Twelve days later we were contacted by Houston airport to arrange pick up of a bag reported missing 12 days earlier. Houston Frontier had no clue the bag had been reported missing. We had to request that the bag be flown back to Conn. We filed claim for $100 worth of dated medication boxed to large to carry on the plane so it was packed in luggage. That claim was denied because my wife never got on the plane which makes no sense at all. Customer service was chat only. In addition to lost luggage we also lost $400.00 car rental which would not reimburse. Luckily the hotel credited us.

### "be sure to never fly with them again"
I will be sure to never fly with them again. While calling zones to board, only 1 man was available to check boarding passes, he made every single person in line check their personal items in the size crate, no matter if they had a purse, backpack or whatever. It held the line up tremendously, till the point where he's yelling saying "yall only have 30secs to board" with about 6 people still in line and currently forcing someone to size a booking (which I've noticed is $100, if it doesn't fit). Secondly, while flying, I never in all my days of traveling, seen a flight attendant get upset and rude because you asked for a napkin, I never experienced a rude flight attendant period, so this was one for the books. I hated that entire experience, mainly for the other passengers, they were experiencing way worst things than I was. So sad. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable, my back was still sore 24hrs after getting off the flight.

### "will not give me my money back "
I arrived at the airport an hour before my flight and was told the flight was closed. I tried to talk to a manager and was told no. I tried to get a boarding pass and couldn't. I was told the flight was over-sold. I paid $381 and that did not include luggage and I had none. I was not able to reschedule. I was supposed to photograph my aunts wedding that night. I missed the wedding. It was a disaster. The airline will not give me my money back or even a voucher. I will never fly with them again and would not recommend anyone else to fly with them either.

### "told me I missed my flight"
Paid for round trip plus checked bags, arrived at counter an hour and a half before boarding. They told me I missed my flight. I asked how that could be, and they said I should have been here 2 hours before. The app wasn't working and would not allow me to check in. I had plenty of time to check my bag, go through TSA, and board the plane on time. The counter workers took great joy in telling me that I could not check in and there are no refunds. I had to buy another ticket from American Airlines for almost $300. I will never use Frontier again. It's not worth it! You will end up paying more in the long run!

### "They overbook flights on purpose"
Not Verified |  They overbook flights on purpose. You are not valued other than the money you give them and then you are stuck at the airport for 24 hours. Just spend more its not worth it.

### "told me I couldn’t get a refund"
My worst experience. I showed up an hour and half before my flight waiting to check in and they told me I couldn’t get on even tho I was an hour and a half early. I ask for a refund and they told me I couldn’t get a refund and that I need to purchase a new ticket. I ask for the management and I waited 2hrs while my flight was nearly gone and still no sign of a manager or a supervisor. The workers are very disrespectful, young and inexperiences and has no respect for customers. I felt like I was scammed out of my money.

### "Completely not worth it."
Completely not worth it. Nickle and dime you for everything. Even your carry-on luggage. Heightens stress. Scam vibes. First and last time flying with Frontier.

### "never recommend this airline"
The worst airline I ever flew with. They cancelled the flight with no notice sending me a boarding pass then when I got to the airport the flight shows cancelled. No agent at the desk to help book you on other flights, no phone number to get a human to deal with the inconvenience the only way to contact them is via WhatsApp which is ridiculous. The first person I get to chat with was clueless and didn't even try to help. The second person offered me a refund of $28 for one way and a voucher of $100 my whole ticket cost $400 how is a one way refund is $28 and a voucher for what I would never fly the airline again. I had to buy a one way to Denver for $800 to go home at the end. $28 refund for a trip that cost me stress and $1200 and to this day no email or someone I could reach to deal with all of this. I understand its a low budget airline but still you have to at least get a proper customer service. I would never recommend this airline to anyone I flew Spirit a multitude of times and they were much cheaper and better customer service than Frontier.

### "This is a messy airline"
Very unprofessional and frustrating experience. I have used Frontier a few times with no major issues, despite the bare bones experience. This time I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas from Dallas. I was at the gate over an hour before boarding was scheduled to start. The flight was delayed by about 10 minutes, which is not a huge deal, and then they finally started boarding very late. They called Zone 1 to board, and I was in Zone 3, so I waited until Zone 1 completed boarding, assuming they will call the rest of the zones to board. After Zone 1 finished boarding, I was confused about why they didn’t call the rest of the zones. My AirPods were dead so it wasn’t like I was distracted and just didn’t hear them. Well instead of calling any other zones, I saw the gate agent closing the boarding door! Other people were obviously upset as well but the gate agent seemed frazzled and said “I’ll have you removed” to anyone who asked her why they didn’t call the rest of the zones for boarding. This caused me to miss my flight as well as my connecting flight. I had to purchase an exorbitantly priced one way flight home at the last minute so I can get home in time for work. This is a messy airline - use at your own risk.

### "Travel with a reputable airline"
I injured my foot but I already scheduled my trip, same day going and coming. So I ordered wheel chair service. The Frontier 10.57 departure was almost one and a half hours delay. I was already operating on a tight schedule. 10 57 arriving in GA 1.30. I had a 3.00 and 4. 00 pm appt to catch my flight 7.30 pm coming back to New York. Mind you the ticket agent kept changing the time of departure depending on who asked her with no definite answer. I asked the flight attendant  if she could make sure I was off the plane first. Incidentally I was seated in the first row right isle seat. She called me hunny, with a condescending rude tune, while smiling , telling me frontier only deal with frontier matters. I asked her if she couldn't call ahead, when we land, to make sure the wheel chair service was at the gate when we land so that I could get to my appointments on time. In the same way she said hunny you have to wait until you reach Georgia. I had my little bag and she told me I had to put it in the overhead bin. I asked her since it was small could it fit under the seat. While smiling she said No but she could switch me with a seat in the back of the plane where I could fit it. I told her I didn't pay 34 for my seat to be placed in the back of the plane. She was also rude to a man trying to switch seat and I decided to report her. So I made the mistake and asked her name. She smiled and smurked. I asked about the spelling and she smiled and said spell it anyway I like. I told her I wanted the correct spelling and she asked me why I said because of your attitude you are a very rude person. She walked away and went into the cabin leaning over smiling and talking to the captain. He then came out the aircraft on his phone. Then she came out and pull her coworker to the side and the next thing I knew. I was being asked to leave the plane. I asked why, and I was told because I was rude to the flight attendant. Although I had a witness beside me shaking his head and saying no they told me I had to come off the aircraft. The captain nor the flight attendant spoke to me about anything. She realized I was about to report her so she had me escorted off the plain. Let's just say I'm out thousand of dollars. I would never under any circumstances take Frontier airline again. They also have allot of unhidden fees pay attention guys to your online check in. Travel with a reputable airline whose staff has class. As for me never again. I was then told I had to walk back without the wheelchair. I had to Insist I couldn't walk then a wheel chair arrived.

### "never fly or recommend Frontier"
Not Verified |  This was the worst flight I have ever been on in my life. Flight was scheduled to be Las Vegas to Philadelphia then after layover to Charlotte. We were not advised of a canceled flight and the customer service lady was extremely rude. Her comment was after we asked for something in return for their lack of communication "I can cancel all yalls tickets" totally uncalled for. I will never fly or recommend Frontier Airline to anyone

### "it was incredibly disappointing"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying with Frontier Airlines, and it was incredibly disappointing. My flight, F9 2271 from New York to Atlanta on September 24th, was plagued by a series of issues that left me deeply frustrated. To begin with, the flight had a substantial delay of over an hour. The real problem, however, emerged during the boarding process. The airline staff, who seemed ill-prepared and stressed, mishandled the situation. The announcement that the flight would be canceled if not airborne by midnight added unnecessary tension for all passengers. My frustration reached its peak when I realized that the Frontier Airlines mobile app had deleted our boarding passes due to the delay, rendering them inaccessible. Despite completing check-in at the airport, the boarding passes mysteriously vanished from the app. This issue was poorly managed by the staff at the gate, who were both unhelpful and rude. What truly bewildered me was the sudden demand for a $25 fee per ticket to reprint my friends' boarding passes, even though I had just received mine without any charge. This arbitrary fee felt like a punitive measure rather than a reasonable solution to a problem caused by the airline's delay and app malfunction. In summary, my experience with Frontier Airlines was marred by delays, poor communication, and unprofessional behavior from staff. The arbitrary fee for reprinting boarding passes added insult to injury. I sincerely hope the airline addresses these issues to improve the overall passenger experience. My advice to future travelers would be to carefully consider their choice of airline, as Frontier Airlines left me deeply disappointed and frustrated.

### "last time taking this poor airline"
Not Verified |  Boarded on time at 1830 hours - been on plane waiting to departure for over two hours! - Not one associate has provided us any status or reason as to why? - Notifications have only be given to us customers through phone which is unacceptable - last time taking this poor airline - photo attached shows people walking back and forth, tired from sitting for two hours.

### "delayed today again for four hours"
Not Verified |  This is my fourth time flying Frontier Airlines I have been delayed twice. The first time I was delayed Elp Paso to Las Vegas back in May and I got no compensation. It was delayed about 2 1/2 to 3 hours then I’m delayed today again for four hours and we get a $15 voucher which we can’t even use Unless we have money on a debit or credit card then you reimburse us which is not even right. There are people that have limited amount of money and they can’t buy anything.

### "cancelled my flight two nights in a row"
Terrible service. They cancelled my flight two nights in a row, at the last minute. I made the trip out to the airport twice only for them to cancel both flights at the last minute.

### "come with cheap customer service"
Not Verified | Worst experience traveling I have ever experienced due to Frontier. They canceled the flight last minute while we were in the middle of the 2.5 hour drive to the airport. We got spots on the next flight out for 6 hours after our original flight. Then we had to wait in the airport for another 2 hours before we could even check our bag. When trying to check our bag, we were informed that the flight had been delayed another 13 hours. At that point, it was 3 pm, past our check-in time to our hotel, and we were being told that we wouldn't even fly out to Las Vegas until 6 am. 9 hours before we were scheduled to go home. We ended up canceling our trip all together and driving another 2.5 hours home. After all of this, the best they offered without asking for a refund was vouchers, as if I would ever fly with them again. They have cheap tickets, but they come with cheap customer service. I am still battling them for compensation for the time and money wasted trusting them with our travel plans. Not worth it. I rated them on cabin experience, but only because they were required fields. I never even got to TSA.

### "regret ever flying with this airline"
Flight was cancelled and no one communicated. Initially was told they had a gate change. We arrived at the new gate and it was for a different flight. Went back to speak with a Frontier representative and they insisted the gate changed. After some back and fourth they figured out the flight was cancelled and rescheduled for 12 hour later. No empathy or attempt to help. I regret ever flying with this airline. Lesson learned. I wish I would have read reviews before deciding to fly with them. No customer service or consideration for the passengers.

### "the dishonesty is apparent"
My best word to describe Frontier Airlines is crooks, the dishonesty is apparent. I booked a flight from Cleveland to Las Vegas with a 1 hour layover in Phoenix. We departed Cleveland at am instead of the scheduled 8:45. We were given multiple reasons for the delay which included maintenance and fueling. Then we get to Phoenix and are told there's no flight to Las Vegas except Saturday. Which is a 19 hr flight that lays over in Denver. Then they recommended I get a refund and try Southwest or rent a vehicle. When I asked how fast was the refund I was told immediately depending on my bank. When I put in for the refund it says up to 7 days. So I'm in Phoenix instead of Las Vegas trying to figure out how I can still enjoy my vacation and make it home to Cleveland.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
The flight was delayed by almost two hours less than an hour before boarding and no one in the airport knew, tons of confusion and chaos ensued. Zero help at the counter, zero information, and all of this was after they nickel and dimed us for absolutely everything. Never flying Frontier again.

### "this airline did not care"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight on 9/1/23 to flight for our great granddaughter's birth for me, my wife, my daughter and grandson to be there for our granddaughter's delivery but the baby came out on September 1 and we cancelled the flight within 2 hrs of booking. Frontier did not refund our credit card charge instead charged "cancellation fees" and the customer service representative told us we have a $69.91 credit to our next flight. I rather eat the credit than to fly again with them! We are retired and living on our retirement income and this airline did not care.

### "not customer friendly"
Not Verified |  I will never fly with frontier airlines again. A friend of mine told me to try them we booked our flight months ago and find out the day before that we have to pay an additional $140 round-trip to sit together this is done intentionally and it is considered a hidden fee. They have done nothing but Milk us with hidden fees. They charge you for carry-ons and everything, and not customer friendly.

### "Charges for bag more than for ticket"
Worst company. Charges for bag more than for ticket. Everything is uncomfortable. I'll never use this company. Staff so angry. Memories is left so bad After flight.

### "I will never fly thru them again"
Not Verified |  I had a 5:00am flight out of DFW, and never received a check in email. I contacted customer service and they told me the flight had been canceled and to contact the agency I booked thru. The next day I contacted frontier again because the agency said they needed proof that the flight was canceled. Frontier agent said they had no record of my cancelation and said they didn't have my email address to send the check in info. They were not helpful at all, and could not care less what I was saying. Please know that these flights are cheap for a reason, so please stay away. I will never fly thru them again.

### "Never fly Frontier"
Flew out of Laguardia, NY on 9/14/23 at 11 pm. Passengers crowded entry to plane even though only zone 1 called. No airline crew prevented other Zoned passengers from blocking entrance. Our plane arrived in Dallas at 1:14 am and the pilot kept telling us our gate was changed 4 times. We ended up being held up in the plane for an hour and a half. No apology, no refunds. We were so glad to get off of that airplane. We bought the stretch seats so we actually paid for what a bigger, more prioritized airline ticket would have cost. Never fly Frontier!

### "So far Frontier has been awesome"
Not Verified |  So far Frontier has been awesome. I travel light so that makes it easy. I've got a bag that I know is personal item size. And a carry on that maxes out the size in case I want to pay a little extra to bring more. I love it, super clean and courteous. I just wish they flew direct to LGA, Islip is like nowhere. It helps to be near a hub too.

### "charge you for what ever they can"
Not Verified |  I flew frontier today and my honest review is a 6/10. I’m giving it this rating because of the flight attendants and how you have to pay for everything as an “add on”. If you’re travelling with just the clothes on your back and no carry on then the price and comfort is just for you. Once you start adding carry on bags or checked bags, that’s where the dollar signs come into play because they will charge you for what ever they can. Seat wise, the seats were a smidge hard but the distance between seats/ leg room makes up for having a sore bum cheek after the flight. Unfortunately they do not provide service on the plane unless you pay for the food or pay for the drink. The flight attendants are completely awful, they come around maybe twice to check on you or collect garbage but out of the 2 and a half hour plane ride we had the flight attendants sat and stood at the front of the plane for about 2 hours and 20 minuets of the flight and talked to each other the entire time. Another thing that caught my attention is that the flight attendants are 1 row in front of me (seats were empty) yet they are making fun of the pilot saying “he must not know his math that good, his calculations aren’t correct”. If frontier had uniteds flight staff then they would be a 10/10 company. One last thing is they have no wifi and no TVs. You have to download either movies on your phone or sit there and count the clouds you pass by. All and all I’d rate this company a 6/10

### "never consider Frontier in our future travel plans"
Not Verified |  Frontier had more convenient flight times for our needs, so my wife and I (both very experienced travelers) decided to fly with them, even though we are well aware of the upcharges for carry-ons or seats or a paper boarding pass or for talking with an agent, etc., etc. The outbound flight was satisfactory and arrived on time. The return flight was canceled without notice or recourse, leaving us stranded in Fargo, ND on a Sunday morning with no hope of a seat on another flight even on another airline for several days at least. There was no Frontier gate agent at the airport to handle stranded passengers, and no assistance could be had by phone or internet. Frontier did refund our return fare, but we had to spend $541 for a 24 hr car rental, then spend 14 hrs driving 900 miles in order to be back in Denver for work on Monday. Guaranteed that we will never consider Frontier in our future travel plans.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Please do not fly with them. Cancelled my flight twice and when I finally boarded a plane, it was delayed for almost 3 hrs. They have no live agent to chat with.

### "Last minute gate changes"
Always late!! Absolutely no apology. Last minute gate changes. It’s a poor show. Won’t be using again. The staff are great but operations suck!

### "Frontier is awful"
Not Verified |  I bought their Go Wild Pass. Don’t you make the same mistake. Frontier is awful. Always late, and you are minutes away from scheduled Boarding, and THEN they announce a two hour flight delay. As if they didn’t know they were running late two hours earlier!

### "never fly with them again"
This is my first time flying frontier and i will never fly with them again. Flew into Vegas at 5:45 am and was taking a connecting flight to Oregon at 8:13 am (via frontier) which had a 2 hour layover, frontier delayed the flight by an hour then ultimately canceled the flight and re-booked the passengers for a 7:20pm flight. Since I've been sitting her waiting on my 7:20pm flight, they've delayed 2 more flight. This was the worst experience ever, frontier really needs to get it together.

### "delayed three times in a single day"
This was my first time flying Frontier Airlines and this will be my last. My flight was delayed three times in a single day and the last time I didn’t receive a notification until close to a half hour after the time our flight was supposed to take off. I feel like my time was wasted/disrespected by Frontier Airlines.

### "worst airline experience of my life"
This is hands down the worst experience and the worst airline I have ever flown. The gate agents, for the most part, are some of the worst in the industry I have ever seen. The way people are treated is awful. The personal item policy is fine, I have no problem with it but I watched them belittle people over something that fit except for a strap literally less than I would guess a couple centimeters over the line at the top and they would not let it on without paying a huge amount. There was another person in their party that had room so they were going to take the black strap off and put it in their partners bag and the agent literally would not let them stating they were not "together". I watched these two people literally sitting together the entire time. Because of what we saw when our passes all run out my family will never fly another frontier flight again as long as we live. Frontier should be ashamed of itself for the treatment of passengers. Their personal item policy, again I am fine with but to charge someone for a wheel or a strap? The bags fit in their ridiculous box. From the staff through the policies, save yourself the heartache and sadness of witnessing what I would consider all but verbally abusive actions of a power trip airline with the worst policies I have ever seen. This really was the worst airline experience of my life.

### "First and definitely last time!"
This airline is a joke! First and definitely last time! Please save yourself the stress, headache and hidden charges! With all what you have to pay for you might as well go with a more reliable and popular airline. Frontier expects you to pay for check-in at their counter, your handbag, your carryon bag, your checked in bags, your seats, what’s next the air on board too! After paying all these ridiculous fees I was charged $99 to walk on with my handbag because it didn’t fit in their ridiculous size box with purchases made in departures. The agent was rude and mean and disrespectful. Made nasty comments to us. We were given 2 ridiculous seats on tickets both together. One in the front and one in the rear. Now why would we want to seat apart as a traveling couple, gimmick 2 trying to get you to pay for seats together, absolutely ridiculous! The aircraft was practically empty and every couple who didn’t pay had the same scenario. There should be some kind of regulations and sanctions on this foolishness. If you value your hard earned money do not travel Frontier! They are a joke! They’re always late, the aircrafts are cheap, poor and ancient. I wish I had known before I did this because as someone has traveled for 40 years this is by far the worst experience ever!

### "they try to penny pinch their customers"
I booked a flight from Denver to Las Vegas for the Labor day weekend. I booked these tickets back in April of this year for a 1pm departure from Denver. During the coming months my flight departure changed on both of my round trip tickets. Now I was leaving at 8am and not leaving Las Vegas until 7pm, which was planned for 10am before. So we showed up way earlier and could not check in our hotel for hours due to this, that was the start of our vacation. When booking I did not choose an advanced seat due to the extreme pricing for that, I did however pay $60 both ways for a check in baggage. So when I went to their self-check bag monitor it would not allow me to check my bag, I asked the agent there and he told me since I did not have a confirmed seat, that I could not check my bag, he pointed me to a longer line then the self check and said I need to talk with an agent over there. After waiting for over an hour to finally get to the agent, I was told that they have to charge me 25$ for agent assistance. So I told them what happen, it was not my fault at all, I bought my bag in advance and since I did not buy the advance seating it should not have anything to do with my check in bag. So she got someone else who was able to help us out and not be charged for that stupid fee. Now coming back I started to look to see if we could get an earlier flight since they pushed it back months ago and the hotel kicks you out at 11am. To my surprise the earliest flight was the one we were on, 7pm. This started to bug me, when I bought the ticket they had at least 8 other flights from Las Vegas to Denver on this day, so I decided to ask other people waiting for the flight what time was their original departure and for almost everyone I talked to, their tickets got pushed back to 7pm. This got me thinking that Frontier most likely does this with all their flights, they show these flight times trying to catch as many people knowing that they will not fly those times and move everyone to one flight to save money. After sitting there for over 3 hours waiting for the time to board our flight, I become worried when it was 30 minutes till departure and there was no movement at the desk, no-one was there. Then someone came up and told all of us waiting that the flight had changed gates, not only gates but was in a different terminal. We hurried up to get to the gate, having to wait on a passenger train to take us to the new terminal, When we got there, they had already called all zones, I dont really care for the zone thing, but others may have bought a zone "upgrade" and it would not have mattered. Once we landed back in Denver we had to wait on the tarmac until we could get a gate to park in, due to our gate being used by a different airplane. We waited around 20 more minutes and finally was able to pull into the gate, but wait there's more, there was no one there to drive the gate bridge to our plane. We waited another 20 minuets for that to happen. After this flight I canceled my membership with Frontier and will never fly them again. They tried to save money by reducing the customer service and it shows. I hope more people realize how bad this company has gotten, and they try to penny pinch as much out of their customers and until people stop using them they will continue with this.

### "experience was quite disappointing"
Not Verified |  I recently had the opportunity to travel with Frontier Airlines, and I must say that my overall experience was quite disappointing. The flight I was scheduled to take was delayed multiple times throughout the day, leading to its eventual cancellation. What made matters worse was the lack of clear communication and support from the airline. Despite waiting at the airport for over 7 hours, no one from Frontier Airlines offered any meals or refreshments to the stranded passengers. It was disheartening to see the lack of attention to basic customer needs during this extended wait. To compensate for the cancellation, Frontier Airlines assured us that they would provide a hotel stay for the night, as the flight was rescheduled for the next day. However, despite the cancellation, we have yet to receive any details or updates regarding the promised accommodation. This lack of communication only added to our frustration and discomfort. Furthermore, after waiting an additional 2 hours at the airport, we still haven't received a confirmation email for the hotel stay. The prolonged wait and the uncertainty surrounding our accommodation have significantly impacted our travel plans and overall experience. As a customer, I believe it is essential for an airline to prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of its passengers, especially during unforeseen circumstances. Unfortunately, Frontier Airlines fell short in this regard, leaving us feeling ignored and undervalued. I sincerely hope that Frontier Airlines takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their customer service and communication during flight disruptions. Traveling can already be stressful, and it is crucial for airlines to provide timely assistance and support to ensure a positive experience for their passengers. Overall, my experience with Frontier Airlines was marred by flight delays, a lack of communication, and unfulfilled promises. I hope that my review serves as a constructive critique for both the airline and potential travelers.

### “worst airline I have ever flown”
Not Verified |  Absolutely worst airline I have ever flown! We will never use Frontier again! We flew from Seattle to Vegas, that flight was 1.5 hours late! We almost missed our connecting flight to Tampa. They were closing the doors as we were running to get to there. Then 4 days later, our return flights began in Tampa to Vegas, where we had a 5.5 hour layover. Roughly 2 hours before we board the flight to Seattle, we receive an email asking us to change our flights from the 6:10 am departure to a 4:30 pm departure. We politely declined, as we were already spending 5.5 hours in the Vegas airport. They lost one of our checked bags. Then told us it was put on the next flight. We spend all day trying to get ahold of Frontier. Much to our surprise, unless you are standing at the airport, there is no live human to speak with. Everything is all online. Around 7:15 pm, still no word, we finally got ahold of a representative via chat. We were told to go back to Seattle to pick up our luggage. So another 2 hour drive back to Seattle, we show up and no luggage and no one around to help. After stopping several TSA employees, we were standing there completely defeated. So we take a chance on someone being at the ticketing counter. Much to our surprise, there was! As my husband is on the phone with Rena (who was absolutely useless), the gentleman at the counter smiled and told us they had found our luggage! Out of every person we spoke to, he was the only one who was patient with us (as we were both angry) and did everything he could to help! We didn’t catch his name but he needs a raise at the bare minimum!

### "spent over an hour on a slow chat"
Not Verified |  How can they be entirely web based and have a glitch in their system that does not allow you to book a flight for a child between ages 2-5. I kept getting error and went kinda crazy. Then I spent over an hour on a slow chat to get the flights booked.

### “Every single flight was delayed”
We used to fly Frontier a lot and had no major complaints. This past year they have really gone into the toilet. Flew them four times in the past month. Every single flight was delayed, significantly delayed. We tried to switch to different flights/different airline but Frontier does not even have a customer phone number-it’s absolutely ridiculous. The flights are cheap but honestly, my time is worth more than that and I will not be using them anymore in the future.

### “airline is absolutely terrible”
Not Verified | This airline is absolutely terrible! They don't provide any helpful services or make any effort to make the customer experience better. They charge exorbitant fees for everything, I mean everything! And to top it off, you have to check in online before you can even use the kiosk. It's absolutely ridiculous! I will never, ever choose to fly with this airline again.

### "It was horrible service"
It was horrible service. I do not recommend this airline at all. Flight was cancelled two times. It happened with my family last time too. Always problem with this airline. Workers who is giving boarding pass were so rude. When flight was cancelled, Frontier changed my flights without asking me to very late hour and then asked extra $99 to get a earlier one. Even in check in time, they took $25. Everywhere check in is free but they are charging you for that. Very poor customer service and always problematic with flights.

### "I would never recommend to anyone"
We were family traveling with 2 kids infant/toddler and staff at gate E20 Sep 10th 8.40 flight made it very difficult. I was holding baby in my hands and gate staff asked me to open diaper bag checked twice asked if any of the thing’s from my husband backpack put it in the bag while he was rearranging his stuff in the backpack. Our check in bag was having 37 pounds and have space for 3 more pounds. We are both having our laptops and chargers along with baby stuff for 2 kids. They humiliated and threatened that we can’t board the flight or asked me to board with 2 kids and leaving husband behind. No respect for customers and were rude. I would never recommend to anyone. No support for parents Traveling with kids

### "the gate agents are rude"
First of all our 1st flight was delayed over 5 hours, the gate agents are rude and there is no phone number to call. The weather was perfect and we were not given any explanation this delay. Caused me to lose my car rental and deposit. The flight back home was also delayed so say they couldn’t get gas in the plane. We were a group of 6 traveling everyone else received a refund except me when I did the chat the rep was more worried why I didn’t know the other passengers last name and info and I’m like we work for the same company but different markets why would I know their information. The worst part of all they don’t even care about the bad reviews.

### "a massive punctuality issue"
Frontier Airline has a massive punctuality issue so I shall add to the endless list of grumbling complaints that are all well deserved. The airline departed exactly 3 hours late on a flight from Las Vegas to Houston. Now, while on board, several excuses were made as to why we couldn't depart on time. Imagine everyone's delight when the fuel got too hot so we had to head back to the terminal and deplane! It seems like they enjoy sitting on the tarmac listening to passengers get mad. That brings them joy apparently. The alert sent to my phone said bad weather was to blame. Nope, weather was clear. Bottom line is, book this airline at your own risk. Imagine being this tardy at your job or college or whatever, you'd lose your job. Frontier airlines tho? Tardiness is praised and accepted and is probably their corporate motto.

### "Treat your customers with respect"
Booked a flight and purchased a bundle deal that included a checked bag, carry-on bag and seat selection. Choose an exit row seat (12A). As boarding was about to begin gate staff announced they had three exit row seats available and those passengers that met the criteria could have them for free. Wait, I paid for my seat selection and they were giving these seats away at no charge? Of course I am going to approach the gate staff and inquire if those of us that paid for exit row seat selection were going to be refunded/compensated as now a premium seat was made available for free. Needless to say i was rudely brushed off. Commented on Frontier Social media and was requested to DM the customer service department. Chatted with Frontier agent, who was patronizing and offered $5.00 in compensation. I guess it was my mistake in buying the bundle. I asked for $55 (the cost of the bundle that i would not have taken when free premium seats were handed out for free) in compensation which i felt was reasonable for the aggravation, rude gate staff and patronizing customer service agent. Extremely Sorry" but nothing they could do. Advised them to take the $5 refund and donate it to a Veterans Group that flies Veterans. This post is more about principle than the $5/$55. Treat your customers with respect. Put yourself in their shoes, especially when perceived value is in question. Check your rudeness and patronizing attitudes at the door when you clock in for work, The unfortunate part of this issue: the exit row seat had great leg room however no recline and the seat sat almost straight up. Losing a customer over $55 is a shame. There will come a time when a seat will be empty on a Frontier flight that I could have purchased. Too bad. Giddy up. Choose any other airline but Frontier.

### "experience thus far as been not so great"
Not Verified |  I was looking for cheep air fair and I thought Frontier was the place to go. Unfortunately it is not! The airline does have cheap tickets, but only if you are flying by yourself, taking a purse / backpack only and you don't have any questions. My experience thus far as been not so great. I am a mom traveling with 3 kids, ages 5, 3, and 7 months. I will need to bring car seats and a stroller and taking three kids through and airport without a stroller is hard. So with that question and a few others in mind I called the different numbers I could find to get the information I needed to know that I could bring these items and not be charged. By the way for future help just google it, its way easier then trying to talk to a person. Anyway finally found that info only to go to purchase my tickets and they charge 69$ for a checked bag. I thought this was supposed to be a cheep flight. So 4 people times 69$ = 276$ my tickets mind you are 54$ round trip, but to take a bag larger then a back pack is going to be more expensive then my actual tickets. So I paid for my tickets and one checked bag. Then the airline now calls me. if you want to guarantee you are sitting with your kids its going to be a 59$ charge to make sure you are sitting with your 3 and 4 year old" so 350 ish dollars later I have my 54.99$ amazing price tickets, a bunch of taxes, (that's unavoidable), one checked bagnd a guarantee I will be sitting with my kids. Thanks frontier, guess I will go with a more expensive ticket to get apparently more honest airline.

### "flight was one of the worst"
I've seen reviews saying Frontier Airlines is not good for anything longer than 1-2 hours, and I can confirm with 100% certainty that this is 100% correct. I took Frontier from Atlanta Airport to San Juan Puerto Rico this past June, which is about a 4 hour flight. I was traveling solo to see my mom for the first time in 14 years, and to meet my little brothers for the first time. First things first, the seats are extremely uncomfortable. Compared to American Airlines, it makes AA seats seem luxurious, especially after 4 hours sitting in a seat that feels like a plastic chair. Secondly, my flight was scheduled to take off at 8:54 pm (though we didn't even leave the ground closer to 10 PM), so it was a night flight. The first 30-45 mins of the flight, the cabin lights were off and people were snoozing. However, around that 45 min mark, the flight attendants came out with the large carts to sell snacks and drinks (because they are not complimentary). Because they came out, they turned on most of the cabin lights. After that time, the cabin lights never went off again, throughout the remaining 3 1/2 hours. Even worse, the sides of the plain are extremely curved in an uncomfortable manor, so even with a neck pillow, there is no truly comfortable way to rest your head. To add it all on top, there are zero charging ports on board the cabin. To be fair, I did know that and the snack thing beforehand, but having never taken Frontier before, was not expecting it to be so detrimental. Overall, the flight was one of the worst I have ever taken. On the way back, I took American Airlines and it was such a more smooth, and bearable flight. This is your sign to chose a different flight (like AA) if you are going anywhere over 1-2 hours. I will never be setting foot inside of a frontier plane unless it is a dire need and it is less than an hour.

### "never again for anything longer than 2 hours"
I might try this airline for a short flight, but never again for anything longer than 2 hours. We paid extra for the stretch seats but they were terribly uncomfortable. The seats did not recline and the seat cushions were very thin making it like a straight up and down, hard bench. There is no in flight entertainment or complimentary beverages. We were delayed for 4 hours and had to change gates 5 times while waiting for our flight. The airline charges more for carryon bags so we only took small backpacks which had to be stored under the seat, which was not a big deal. The staff was friendly enough.

### "will walk before I  fly this airline"
Not Verified | HORRIBLE. NEVER NEVER NEVER fly Frontier. It took me an hour to get a ticket purchased as it kept freezing up after selecting the pay now option. I had to enter all of the data three times before it took. Each time I did I was worried that the previous attempt had gone through but I never knew and I was buying another ticket on the same flight. They LIED when they tell you that you have 24 hours to cancel the ticket. Even the DOT has regulations that a airline was to refund your money if cancelled within 24 hours. I found I could move my flight 4 hours early about 12 hours after buying my ticket. When checking how to change flights I was advised it best to cancel and then re-book. I did that...BIG MISTAKE. they don't cancel and return your money. They keep $122 of the ticket to change flights a few hours within the 24 hours. They force you to buy a seat. Later I found if you don't select a seat they assign you one FREE. No mention of that at all when selecting the ticket. Before changing the time I wanted to make sure the option. I found there is not a customer service available at ALL. What does a person who cant use a computer do? The BOT Chat doesn't let you ask any questions except the pre-programmed ones they supply. No option anywhere to ask a question to be sure about their poorly communicate information. This is the worst company I have ever experienced. I will walk before I ever fly this horrible airline. I will also make sure everyone I know be advised to NEVER use the unethical and dishonest thief of a company. Did I mention they are HORRIBLE

### "it was a complete nightmare"
Horrible Experience with Frontier Airlines! My family and I recently flew with Frontier Airlines from Philadelphia to Orlando and back to Philadelphia, and it was a complete nightmare. The airline had no staff to assist us, and we were left to fend for ourselves at every step of the way. They didn't even give us any information about flight time changes, and we were just left stranded at the airport. When we asked for help, the airline told us that we needed to rebook and pay for our flight due to their mistakes. We were forced to stay two nights at a hotel because they wouldn't provide an early flight for us. This was a significant inconvenience and an unnecessary expense that we had to bear because of the airline's incompetence. To make matters worse, the flight that was supposed to cost us $700 ended up costing us a whopping $1920! This was outrageous, and we felt like we were being taken advantage of. The airline charged us $467 for just two bags alone, which is an exorbitant amount of money. I strongly urge everyone to stay away from Frontier Airlines. They have no regard for their customers, and they will not hesitate to mistreat and take advantage of you if given the chance. It's just not worth it, so do yourself a favor and choose a different airline.

### "Customer service is Zero"
Not Verified |  They advertised Low Fare which I purchased, it’s a trap. No human being should fly this airline. The agents were rude to the people. Customer service is Zero - they are cruel to even people with children. They only care about charging $120.00 for a duffle bag. I am a traveling nurse but this was the worst experience ever.

### "Absolutely unacceptable"
They canceled my 6am morning flight at 1:45am. Woke up to no notifications from Frontier (boarding pass still looks valid) and no recourse but to go through all of my bookings and cancel them (some at a fee). Absolutely unacceptable.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown with. Appreciate they are a budget airline but the staff at check in must be hired based on their dreadful and downright rude demeanour or are trained to serve with an attitude. Travelling with 3 young children is stressful enough but to have one of their check in staff empty our stroller bag onto the floor in front of everyone because we had some nappies and a baby float in it and continually repeat to their colleagues that we thought we were being smart is beyond belief. After spending $100 for the discount den and an extra $450 on extra baggage and they do this! Will never fly with this airline again! It’s not a budget airline after you pay for baggage!! Never again!

### "worst airline you can imagine"
Not Verified |  The worst airline you can imagine is Frontier. Flights are constantly delayed, calls to the support service are not answered. Flights were canceled and money was not returned. I do not advise anyone to fly with this company. I was kept in line for two hours and I didn't have time to check in for the flight. They offered to pay extra and fly with two transfers. Due to the fact that they did not register me, I lost a whole day of time and spent $700 on other tickets. I hate this company.

### "no way to access the pass that I paid for"
Before the merger with Republic Airlines, I used to be a top-tier frequent flyer on Frontier. Since the re-structuring many years ago, I have avoided Frontier because of their poor customer service and general hassles. However, when I saw their "Go Wild, fall/winter pass" I decided to give it a try, with some hesitation. Today is the start of the pass use period and they are not doing too well, so far. First, their smartphone app is not fully linked to their online accounts, for some reason. This is pretty pathetic. But I am required to use the web login for setting up flights for the Go Wild pass. (FlyFrontier app cannot be used to do so.) Under my profile, it acknowledges I have purchased a "Go Wild" pass and has been saying: "Starting on 09/01/2023, you’ll be able to access your limitless GoWild! Pass™ here! for many weeks. Well, today is 09/01/2023 and the message is still the same. I have no instructions and no way to access the pass that I paid for. I am trying to set up a flight to Minnesota, but there is a special booking method, but I haven't been told what it is. It has been the same message since midnight. I called up the Frontier booking number and the customer support agent just hung up on me, claiming it was a reservation line. But that is exactly what I was trying to do -- make a reservation! I paid $300 for the Go Wild pass, but so far, I have no way to use it, as promised.

### "Don't fly with Frontier"
Frontier is literally the worst. First and only time I’ll ever fly on this terrible airline. Delays, upcharges, terrible seats, no in flight amenities. Everything is just awful. Don't fly with Frontier.

### "flight was changed to a time I couldn’t fly"
Not Verified | I bought a ticket for a straight through flight from Nashville to Orlando. After the purchase I got an email stating the flight to Orlando was changed to a time I couldn’t fly, and they were sending me to Denver first. I canceled the flight, but wasn’t given a refund.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  I have flown this airline for 15 years and for the last 7 years 1-3 times a month. In the last 4 months, nothing but problems, issue, delays and the worst customer service. Do yourself a favor and pay more for much much more. Moving on from this airline.

### "everything was at an extra cost"
Not Verified |  The flight itself wasn't bad although it was delayed almost an hour, however, everything else was horrible. We ended up having to pay $190 per suitcase! Same suitcase that would have cost $65 in any other airline. ALL snacks, beverages were at an additional cost, no entertainment nor Wi-Fi, taking to the attendant at the ticket counter was at an extra cost, everything was at an extra cost. This airline is a scam, a complete disappointment.

### "3 weeks without my luggage"
Not Verified |  Frontier has no phone numbers to call if there is an issue with your flight. It's been 3 weeks since flying with Frontier from Raleigh to Syracuse. They lost my luggage. I immediately reported it to the gate agent. Waited days and heard from no one. After a week, went back to the airport, still no sign of it. Filed a report, got an email saying they were working on it. That was the last communication I had with them, 2 weeks ago! Last week I tried using the CHAT feature to try to get someone's attention and was told my problem is being work on by the "BACK OFFICE" and they couldn't do anything for me. So it's been a total of 3 weeks without my luggage and I haven't had the courtesy of a phone call. They got my money (this time), so I mean nothing to them.

### “It’s far from budget”
I generally fly about 60,000-70,000 miles per year and I fly Alaska Airlines almost exclusively. I took a trip with friends to Nashville and to match closely with another itinerary I chose to fly on Frontier this trip. How bad could it be? I can honestly say that this is the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of flying with. Everyone knows budget airlines nickel and dime you to death but I wasn’t prepared for the amount of money this airline sucks out of your wallet. It’s far from budget. The seats are very uncomfortable and stiff and they are without any power outlets. But the cherry on top was when we were delayed by an hour getting out of Nashville on our return trip. The connection in Denver was going to be very tight, so naturally the connecting plane left Denver EARLY rather than waiting for all the Portland passengers coming in from Nashville. It was a late flight so I had to sleep on the floor of the Denver airport. No hotel voucher because they said it was weather related. The customer service in Denver by Frontier staff at their “customer service” counter and by their gate agents was atrocious. They were grumpy, rude, and unhelpful. The airline attendants on the flight were hit and miss, but clearly there isn’t a culture of customer service with this corporation. I’ll never fly Frontier again in my lifetime nor will I ever recommend it to anyone. The allure of a discounted fare isn’t worth the trouble. The CEO of this airline should be ashamed of the product that they provide.

### "worst experience I've had flying"
Not Verified | Waited in line for 4 hours in the boarding line to be told flight home was canceled. Stranded 2 days with a family of 6, no rental car, no kids cars seats no hotel. Wound up spending $1,500 on extra transportation, hotels, plus missed work/school/childcare. Was told we would receive a $300 voucher (yay) which we were later told we didn't qualify for since they technically did eventually fly us home. By far the worst experience I've ever had flying. Never again.

### "caused me to miss my ship"
Not Verified |  Frontier caused me to miss my ship at port Canaveral. My first cruise. My trip was delayed three times flight 1053 at Orlando. I paid $125 for a private transportation but it was too late. Now I'm in a motel in coco beach costing me $150 a day trying to figure out what to do. This was my first time using Frontier and last.

### "does not care about its customers"
We bought a flight for 6/20/23 and noticed it did not give us the right return flight we tried to call Frontier Airlines to request a change. The automated system told us to go to the website, and when we did so it changed the outbound flight. We attempted to contact them via phone again and the only other option was an automated chat link they sent to our mobile phone. We then attempted to call the airport to speak with a Frontier representative and either was disconnected or hung up on twice the representative called us back but could not help us. We then attempted to go to the airport to speak with a representative in person and were told the flight was fixed and we would receive an email with the flight update that we never received. We could not use the flight we received and could not contact Frontier to speak to a human person to fix the website mix-up. We did know we could cancel within 24 hours of purchase but not about the 7-day window. When we tried to call (801)-401-9000 and the airport number 215-644-7238. there is no human to speak with at Frontier Air it is a ripoff that does not care about its customers. We fly every 2 -3 weeks round trip all over the country and this is a first for us.

### "do not buy their passes"
I bought 2 passes for the summer Go Wild Pass. Ended up wasting 1000 on this so called deal! I wasn’t even able to use it. Every time I checked for a flight (and I checked every few days!) and no flights were available. Even though they had plenty of flights for their regular and subscription flights. I contacted the BBB and even after a month of going back and forth, BBB had to close the case unresolved since frontier refused to respond! Don’t make my mistake, do not buy their passes. Waste of so much money!

### "just horrific / traumatizing"
Everything about this flight was just horrific / traumatizing, pulled my 5 yr old granddaughter seat along with mine after we went to get boarding passes, through the long line at security and all the other hoops to get to the gate to be turned away like we were trying to hitch a ride for free. I have never been this humiliated in my life, staff were so rude to me through out the whole approximately 52 minutes of either being ignored to ma'am, you have to wait and see if we have enough seats to, ma'am you have to wait 2 more days until you can go home. By this time I'm at my wits end anf has explained to me how they can just resell your seat/seats like that without any kind of notice and last but by far the least, she put us all the way in the back of the plane and those seats were $30 if not a little more then what we purchased.

### "Too busy nickel and diming for everything"
Travelled from Orlando to NYC (MCO to LGA) with my 1yr old, 5 yr old, and my wife. They seated my wife in a completely different row. Before check in , we called customer service to request that we be seated together. They told us that the check in counter would help. When we got there, we were told that the gate counter person would help. When we got there, we were told the flight was full and we would need to ask the flight attendant. When we got inside the plane, they said they would try. They never came back. The guy in the window seat didn’t wanna trade. Now I have 2 screaming kids crying for mama. Everyone gets to suffer because of this stupid airline. Too busy nickel and diming for everything to use common sense. What a sorry excuse of a company. Why even separate a family traveling with a 1 yr old and a 5 yr old? This should be illegal.

### "Never using Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I had to cancel my flight due to them pushing back the arrival time 6 times and over 5 hours later! They approved a refund but have not yet given it. I keep getting the run around and cannot talk to an actual person. Never using Frontier again.

### "Customer service was horrible"
Not Verified |  I got to the airport on time and made it to the gate. I wasn't allowed inside because the flight was over booked. I was asked to fly the next day and connect through Denver (travel time of about 10 hours with a layover). I went to Frontier customer service and was told that she can't help and to reach out to Frontier's chat line. I reached out via chat line and no help. Frontier is the worst airline I have used. Customer service was horrible. No communication. The lady assisting was ignorant. I flew over 10 times this year already and I will never use Frontier again. Horrible experience.

### "ruined our trip"
Frontier cancelled my daughter and I’s flight home from vacation with 8 hours notice, stranding us. We had to be home due to work and a very important court appearance. Our only last minute option to get home was 5 times what the refund was from Frontier. We were given nothing more than what we paid for the flight. It ruined our trip, we were devastated. The cost to get home was more than the entire trip combined. When we told our family what was happening they said you should never have booked with this airline, it’s well known they cancel flights and do this to their customers regularly. I’ll make sure I’ll post my story everywhere so others can be warned.

### "We have 6 hour delay"
Not Verified |  Trash airline, basically, you think you’re saving money, but you’re wasting your time. We have 6 hour delay from Orlando airport when coming to Philadelphia, they ask us to go to one gate ad later they told us to go to another gate. I regret it especially have 4 children with me age 2 to 6.

### "they basically said too bad"
I purchased the "go wild" pass from Frontier that says  you can fly as much as you want but can only book the day before. I am retired/disabled and my schedule is very flexible. I tried to book my flight every single day for over a month and nothing was ever available. You can't actually talk to a person at customer service, and when I emailed, they basically said too bad. So now not only do I have to buy my ticket at full price, but I'm also screwed out of several hundred dollars for a pass I can't use.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Disorganized, rude, terrible customer service. Waited 40 minutes checking in in what was a moving line only to be told it wasn’t a line and forced to go to the end of another long line. Had issues checking the bag once I finally made it to the counter. Printed wrong gate on boarding pass. First and last time on Frontier. Worst airport experience to date.

### "wish I would have read the reviews"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our flight and still charged us the cancellation fee. We noticed this within minutes and they would not reinstate the flight. Nothing we could do. This is completely wrong. I wish I would have read the reviews before we made this reservation with them.

### "Zero communication - lazy and rude"
This is my first and definitely my last time flying Frontier. By far the most inefficient system and horrible customer service. You can count on delays, paying for your carry on and seat, and being charged 100-200 EXTRA upon your check-in/arrival. Zero communication - lazy and rude.

### "horrible customer service"
Airline cancels flight without a reason, horrible customer service. You can only reach somebody by email and after sending them a long email they respond with something totally different than what your question was. I also bought insurance on this and the insurance I bought with Travel Guard cannot give me a clear answer if this is going to be covered or not to book with a different airline. This is a family trip and they have no other flights out for the next two days my sons in the military and has already got his time and they’re not reimbursing anything like hotel rooms and car rentals that have already been set in place. Don’t even waste your money on this airline anymore. Even if you have to pay more for American Airlines, United or Southwest it’s worth dealing with real people.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. No manager available. No customer service phone number. They directed me to the chat bot which did not help with my issue at all. The refused to issue me a stand by pass to go through security with my 16 year old who was flying alone. The flight was an evening flight and was delayed multiple time. Her phone was broken so she had no way to contact me. Additionally they charged me $25 to print her a ticket because her phone was broken and we couldn't check in online.

### "Flight cancelled with no explanation"
Flight cancelled with no explanation. Once again flight got delayed and then eventually canceled, worst flight experience ever! They advertise low airfares and good departure times but have no intention of their flights actually departing at the time you booked. They will change your flight time to just under 3 hours difference, which is the time limit where they are required to offer you a refund. Then they will further delay your flight once you arrive at the airport for reasons such as “aircraft maintenance” thus resulting in flights departing 5 to 6 hours later than originally booked but you will not be offered a refund. And don’t bother trying to contact their customer support because they no longer have any real people you can contact, only a robot which will get you nowhere. Don’t fly this airline unless you don’t care about getting anywhere.

### "unbelievably unprofessional"
Not Verified | HORRIBLE customer service, unreliable and unbelievably unprofessional. DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE. I’ve been screwed over so many times with canceled flights, and no refunds. Has left me stranded at the airport for hours on end with no compensation.

### "never experienced an on time flight"
Not Verified | The worst airline EVER, they should not be in business!! I have never experienced an on time flight with Frontier. Delay after delay for petty things. Delayed over 2 hours because they were waiting on one flight attendant. The people who work for this company are so rude and clearly hate their jobs! If you are planning a trip spend the extra money to book with another airline unless you don’t mind being late for everything! Would give a 0 if I could.

### "Horrible airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. The flight was delayed for 2 hours, and 15 mins after departing change the terminal and the door, so at the time I got to the new terminal and new door, the plane was gone. Lost my flight and my hotel, airline does not want to refund the ticket nor be responsible.

### "Worst service ever"
Worst service ever. Refuse to let me on the plane after constantly telling them and showing them the payment and my seat number I had chosen after the extra fees they charge me. Please stay away.

### "never be flying with frontier again"
Not Verified |  The worst experience I have had with any airline in my life. My first flight was canceled and my second flight was put on stand by and didn’t get a seat. The front desk lady was so rude and condescending to not only me, but about 15 other people who were placed in my same situation. So unhelpful and rude. I understand the stress, but there is no reason to be that rude! Someone like that should not work with any airline. I will never be flying with frontier again.

### "Worst airline to fly with"
Flight was rescheduled twice and a total of over 3 hrs for the delay and was given a card to receive a refund for the flight and was told because I still flew on the flight I could not receive any type of compensation for my inconvenience when the flight attendant is the one who told me I would be able to receive a full if not partial refund for the delays. Worst airline to fly with. I will never fly with this airline again it may be a cheaper ticket but you will end up paying even more because of the checked bag and your paying for a carry on. They don't tell you that until you get to the airport.

### "customer service is terrible and ridiculous"
The worst experience I ever had, checking in is bad enough and then the flight was delayed over 4 hours and they changed the boarding gate in the mean time. They told us the next plane was for us at 10.31 and now it’s at 1.32. Will never take Frontier for my travels again, if I can’t drive it guess I will not be visiting that destination. Also on that note customer service is terrible and ridiculous, you can not communicate with anyone from the company in person, you have to chat with a dam computer and get nothing resolved. So irritated I could scream, don’t take Frontier it’s not worth the headache!

### "Stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  College-sponsored overnight trip for my teen son and I, so first (and last) time we are flying Frontier. Keep in mind this was not some $33 fare, these plane tickets were over $500 in total. It was such a bad experience that I came straight home and I'm writing about it before unpacking!! Uncomfortable, seats don't tip back at all. No in-flight entertainment. No charging outlets. Pay for your snacks/drinks, only freebie is water. Cabin was so cold with dry ice seething out of the perimeter of the ceiling, I literally had to purchase a $40 hoodie at an airport kiosk. Airport chaos: Checked in using their horrible Frontier app and got a confirmation that we had both checked in, but somehow my boarding pass failed to show up in their app - I went through so much drama to get another one. Two airline agents went ghetto on me when I tried to explain what occurred and tried to charge me $25 for a boarding pass when it was their app that failed! Thankfully another agent arrived on the scene and felt sorry for us and didn't charge me. Their personal item limit is so small you can't even tote a regular sized laptop bag. Then they want to charge you outrageously for carry-on and checked luggage. I witnessed several people get tagged for extra $$. They actually measure, and if you're carrying a small wheeled laptop bag, the wheels count. I had to cram my laptop in a daypack with no padding with part of my laptop hanging out in order to avoid their extra charge I was not prepared to pay for. Connecting flight home from Philly to RDU was hour+ late. There were four gate changes within 15 minutes before boarding, two of which were not announced, and we weren't even informed about -- and we were close to boarding time. I literally had to find out what new gate my plane was taking off at from two strangers who heard it from someone else. I asked a Frontier rep who then had to look in her computer because she didn't even know. Once confirmed, I quickly ran over and courtesy announced the correct gate to all of the people who were waiting to go to RDU at the wrong gate. The Frontier staff didn't even initially know, and had given all of us wrong gate info. Once we boarded, even before takeoff, the plane sounded like it was going to break down at any minute. I have never flown in an airplane that noisy. Once we got to RDU, we literally sat in the airplane on the runway for over 30+ minutes because we had nowhere to deplane. Stewardess was super nasty. Once deboarded, the luggage (which we were told by the stewardess would be on one carousel) actually came in on yet another carousel clear across the airport .. after an hour+ delay. Had another passenger not announced it to everyone, we would have never known. All told, we spent literally an entire day traveling from JAX to RDU: 10+ hours (and serious aggravation since I could have actually missed my flight because Frontier didn't even know what the heck was going on with their own planes, or we could have legitimately had a mechanical failure!!) counting airport check-in. I literally could have drove it in 6 hours. Stay away from this airline. You will regret it if you don't!

### "There was a strong foul odor"
Not Verified |  There was a strong foul odor like a toilet burst, no explanation given, they pretended nothing is going on while most of the passengers closer to the back were covering their nose and several came forward when offered. So stinky and if it was a trip on ground, I would have gotten off. No explanation. Fortunately it was a short 52 minutes flight.

### "2.5 hours for baggage to carousel"
Not Verified | Absolutely worst airline experience EVER. Paid extra to be able to check bags. Expected this so wasn't surprised. Flight was uneventful with the exception of you have to pay for anything you want as a beverage, including soda. Arrived at IAH terminal D (4:25), was told baggage at terminal A carousel 4. Hike and train to that location, our flight is displayed, baggage comes off. Half the plane gets their bags the other doesn't. Not a single Frontier representative to found in all of terminal A to inquire about this. Ticket agents will be there 2 hours before next flight, next flight is at 8. Go to Ticketing at 5:45 (over 20 of us) only to be watched by the Frontier ticket agents sitting against the wall for 20 minutes before they approach their positions. They did not help earlier because they were aware of why we were there as this has been the standard practice of Frontier. Once all of were able to speak with them the only thing they could tell us was to go back and wait and baggage would eventually arrive. Ended up receiving baggage at 6:50. two and half hours after landing the other half of the planes baggage makes it to carousel and we are told by Frontier that this is standard operating practice. My First and ONLY time to fly Frontier Airlines.

### "even Spirit is better"
Not Verified |  Awful, staff at Tampa Airport rude, 4 people working, put a small sign around the side of their desks to drop luggage, where no one was entering, for international flights only, while the line for domestic flights had to have had 75 people lined up, they refused to allow anyone to check bags even tho they had 3 people in that line, rude and throwing literally luggage onto belt! Secondly, you charge a arm and a leg for luggage, measuring backpack etc, and then charge a crap ton for soda or water! Got our luggage from the carousel soaking wet. I will say on a positive, the flight TO Tampa from Midway, easy, the staff was very friendly, and pilot even seemed kind. Frontier, I should be charging you for my extremely wet suitcase and belongings. Never again, even Spirit is better than that.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
I can honestly say this is the worst airline I have ever flown in my life. I’ve flown with Frontier about five times and each time it just gets worse. Delay after delay and no compassion towards the customers. If you plan on arriving somewhere on time to not fly frontier you will most likely not get there at the time you’re supposed to. If I were you I would spend the little extra money on a different airlines. Spirit tops frontier at this point I’ve never had this many problems with Spirit. Please consider flying another airline to save yourself problems!

### "Frontier has lost my luggage"
Not Verified |  Frontier has lost my luggage. It has been over a month and they do not have an actual phone number to speak with about my situation. I have done all the paperwork they required and still have not heard anything. Each time I communicate on their "chat" system I am told, "We are working on this" and "Thank you for your patience" Well I have run out of patience.

### "unhelpful and unempathetic"
I tried to purchase a checked bag while trying to check in from your app and every time I put in my credit card it took the bag out of the cart. Could not check in without doing that so checked in without a bag to check at the airport and instead of $71 on the app (which is asinine). It was $79 and the ticketing agent was unhelpful and obstructionist when I asked for a supervisor as “you are the only one who had reported a problem with the app; I just do what I’m trained to do”. It’s a sad day when you train your ticketing agents to be unhelpful and unempathetic.

### "personnel were rude to everybody"
Not Verified |  We were booked on flight #437, confirmation# 889SI, to depart Milwaukee to Denver at 10:59 pm, August 6th, 2023. Notified via text and email, delayed till 11:40 pm. Flight was delayed again till 1:30 am. While waiting, we happen to overhear another passenger having a conversation with a maintenance person walking through the terminal, and he informed everyone that our flight had been canceled 10 minutes earlier. We did not receive any notification from Frontier. When we approaced the gate personnel to confirm the cancelation, we were told that they would give us a refund or rebook us for a flight out of Milwaukee on Tuesday, the eighth at 6:30 PM. 2 days later. We asked about hotels and were informed that they didn't have any available and then asked about food vouchers and was again told none available due to the fact that everything was closed. Gate personnel were rude to everybody. We personally found a flight out of Greenbay the next day (Monday) and asked to be rebooked on it. At first, they didn't want to do it, but we insisted. 3 other passengers overheard us and asked to be rebooked to Greenbay also.They did not try to help any of the other approx 200 passengers they stranded due to multiple cancelations. They did not offer to shuttle anyone to Greenbay or offer any compensation for their screw up. We still do not know why the flight was canceled. They then kicked us out of the concourse, and we were instructed to go to the front area so the 2 employees at the gate could go home. People were laying on the floor while an airport employee vacuumed around them. Of all the people on the full flight to Denver, only 5, out of approx 144 people, made it on the flight out of Grenebay the next day. The others were left to figure out where to stay and pay for food at their own expense for 2 days. They would not look at any surrounding areas for flights. They didnt care.

### "Disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Disappointing experience. As a frequent traveler, I recently had the opportunity to fly with Frontier Airlines and I'm sorry to say that my experience left a lot to be desired. From the moment I went through the registration process, I was shocked at the lack of transparency and poor service. My first unpleasant encounter was when I found out that my personal item was considered larger than what was allowed by Frontier. Although I had gone through the check-in process without a problem, I was met with an unexpected charge of $100.00 upon boarding the plane. The lack of communication on this issue left me feeling frustrated and cheated. But that was not all. My return flight from Puerto Rico to Orlando, originally scheduled for 3:30 pm, was changed without notice to 3:00 am. Upon arrival at the airport, I was informed that to change the departure time, I would have to pay an additional $99.00 for each ticket. This unexpected change and the associated costs only added to my discontent. What disappointed me the most was the lack of empathy and customer service from Frontier. Despite the problems I faced, I did not feel that the airline went out of its way to provide a satisfactory solution or compensate in any way for the difficulties I experienced. In short, my experience with Frontier Airlines was disappointing in several ways. From unclear baggage policies to sudden flight changes and extra charges. I hope the airline will take steps to improve its transparency and customer service in the future. I do not recommend this airline. Decepcionante experiencia con Frontier Airlines Como viajera frecuente, recientemente tuve la oportunidad de volar con Frontier Airlines y lamento decir que mi experiencia dejó mucho que desear. Desde el momento en que pasé por el proceso de registro, quedé sorprendida por la falta de transparencia y el servicio deficiente. Mi primer encuentro desagradable fue cuando descubrí que mi artículo personal se consideraba más grande de lo permitido por Frontier. Aunque había pasado por el proceso de registro sin problemas, me encontré con un cargo inesperado de $100.00 al abordar el avión. La falta de comunicación sobre este tema me dejó sintiéndome frustrada y engañada. Pero eso no fue todo. Mi vuelo de regreso desde Puerto Rico a Orlando, originalmente programado para las 3:30 pm, fue cambiado sin previo aviso a las 3:00 am. Al llegar al aeropuerto, me informaron que para cambiar la hora de salida, debía pagar un adicional de $99.00 por cada boleto. Este cambio inesperado y los costos asociados solo añadieron a mi descontento. Lo que más me desilusionó fue la falta de empatía y atención al cliente por parte de Frontier. A pesar de los problemas que enfrenté, no sentí que la aerolínea se esforzara por brindar una solución satisfactoria o compensar de alguna manera las dificultades que experimenté. En resumen, mi experiencia con Frontier Airlines fue decepcionante en varios aspectos. Desde la falta de claridad en las políticas de equipaje hasta los cambios de vuelo repentinos y los cargos adicionales. Espero que la aerolínea tome medidas para mejorar su transparencia y atención al cliente en el futuro. No recomiendo esta aerolínea .

### "Go Wild Pass is the biggest rip off"
The Go Wild Pass is the biggest rip off and scam ever. Don’t buy it. You can never get flights. In one case I was able to a flight to my destination but I couldn’t get one home unless I paid them full price. Also on the way home from Vegas, the second leg of the flight was cancelled and we were stranded in Raleigh, NC. We were not given any options to get home. I had to purchase a same day ticket on Southwest Airlines. When I asked for a refund, they refunded my ticket, but not the $59 that I paid for my luggage.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Horrible service. First time on Frontier. My kids booked for me due to an emergency. I was charged 25.00 to have someone print a boarding pass even though I couldn't check in online. Staff was rude, cold, and uncaring. My ticket was bought 8 hours before my flight departed. Who knew I had to check in again. Frontier is the worst airline. Never ever again will I fly with Frontier - I promise.

### "get worse and worse"
I've traveled with Frontier for years and witnessed them incrementally get worse and worse. They are so disgusting at their practice at this point they should be removed from the market. Absolutely abhorrent, the practice they are using now with the fees  is literally predatory.

### "Buyer Beware...don’t fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  No customer service in person or online. No phone available for customer service either. Don’t expect to be treated as a paying customer with this airline and if you get over charged for anything you can forget getting a refund. Customer service in all aspects is the rudest treatment you will ever get. Will never fly this airline again. Is sad because they used to be a great affordable way to travel. Now you can’t even get any assistance unless you pay a fee to do so. We were delayed for 3 hours and we appear 2 hours before the new scheduled time and they said we were late and we lost the flight, and they can't get me in another flight we couldn’t cancel due to no customer service at airport or online. We missed the flight trying to figure out the new gate because we didn't have the info, out all these issues and were treated worse than I have ever experienced. I was trying to file a claim but they don't want to give me a refund. They offered re booking for another day and charge me for the difference in cost. This is ridiculous. I didn't accept, lost my money and couldn't resolve anything. Buyer Beware...don’t fly Frontier. Worst airline ever.

### "will never buy a ticket from them again"
This is a terrible airline, will never buy a ticket from them again. I had a connecting flight and my initial flight was delayed 10 hours before take-off, which meant I would not longer be making my connection. Frontier does not have a phone number to call, so I had to sit on a chat for over an hour waiting for someone to join, and then when someone finally did they were not helpful in any way whatsoever. I explained the problem 3 different times and I'm not sure whoever was on the other side of the chat had the mental capacity to understand what I was even saying. Their suggestion at the end was that I just fly into the connecting airport and hope for the best. The fact that Frontier not only doesn't have a customer service phone line, but that their "customer service" over chat is so unbelievably slow and unhelpful shows that they do not care at all about their customers. On top of that, they refused to refund any of the flights because the delay was under 3 hours, even though the delay meant I wouldn't be able to get to where I needed to go and they were not willing to schedule me on a different flight. This airline is a scam, do not ever fly with them.

### "We would never use them again"
7-29-2023 we were scheduled on flight 103 DFW to TPA (Conf: FD4RFG). While waiting to board were told we would be delayed due to plane arriving from Cancun and needing to be searched. An hour later, we boarded. The pilot told us “This plane isn't leaving anytime soon” followed by saying he had run out of his hours to fly that day. Later they told us the flight was delayed until tomorrow & were told to leave plane and go to counter for info. We were told go to Gate E37 for info. We went there to find no one there, then realized we were to go to ticket counter. A Frontier agent said "Your flight is postponed until 10 am tomorrow, If you want to stay on that flight you don't need to do anything or get in line. You do need to get in line if you want a refund or if you need accommodations for tonight, but we do have to process everyone first". After hour in line the agent told us once everyone was processed the manager would come out & call each name to come up & get vouchers. There are few seats & we were sitting on the hard cold floor. Over an hour later the manager came out & called 2 names who were not there. After over an hour, my husband asked agent if there was any word on the vouchers. He was reassured the manager was in back working on it & would come out & call our names. After 1.5 more hours he went back & listened to different agent telling passengers that manager had sent all info to corporate & was waiting to get the vouchers. After 1.5 more hours he again went back & spoke with manager & was told that there was a limited supply of vouchers & those who were getting them should have received them by email already! We had been lied to for 6 hours, telling us hotel vouchers and transportation were on the way & now we were told that was NOT going to happen. NO ONE ever came out to inform the passengers of updates or changes in plans. We tried to book a room & found out at 4 am there were no rooms left nearby. We were exhausted mentally, emotionally (it was very important to us to be home that morning), and physically. We were desperate to get rest & we & most others tried to sleep in the loud ticketing area & next to a busy baggage claim. We spent all night until 9 am with no way to get food except a vending machine. We finally received an email about a voucher & it was a $75 voucher to purchase another ticket from a company with such poor service they had to delay our flight to the next day & lied to us for 6 hours about hotel rooms! We would have gotten a hotel room & gotten some rest instead of spending such a miserable night there.. Our bodies hurt all over from being on hard surfaces for so long. Submitted complaint through complaint form on Frontier website and never received response. We would never use them again under any circumstances.

### "Don’t fly frontier"
Not Verified |  1 star. Both flights cancelled. My family and I were up at 3 AM to catch our flight just for the pilot to be 3 hours late and leave us stranded in Ohio after cancelling our direct flight to San Francisco the day before. Apparently the pilot maxed out his time so he couldn’t fly us anymore. Why would you fly a two part flight knowing you will not be able to do the second part? The stewardess was also very rude. The service was honestly just ridiculous. Almost missed the concert for my birthday because frontier can’t get it together. Don’t fly frontier. (more…)

### "Absolutely nobody will help you"
They lost my luggage. Absolutely nobody will help you because they will not answer the phone. No humans available at counters unless they have a flight going out. Online glitches and refuses to accept your name and confirmation after you have landed. I’ve waited now 24 hours and I have no update or phone call to where my luggage is. They will absolutely not care about you or the distress their airline caused you. I’ve wasted 25 hours of my much needed time off to get my luggage. I left 9 messages on their lost luggage phone line, which still has never been answered. They have really put me in a bind.

### "Never, ever again"
This is the absolute worst airline out there. Every time we fly on Frontier we have issues. 4 hour delay. Moved gates 4 times. No answers to our questions. Never, ever again.

### "couldn’t get response thru customer service"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever. Sad as I used to fly with them all the time but now it is a total rip off. We were over charged for bags and never refunded. Customer service at the airport, and online was horrible or non existent. I don’t know how they are able to rip so many people off without consequences. My kids, grandkids, and myself were put through hell trying to get refunded for charges that were duplicated. Treated horribly for trying to get help to straighten out the problems with a duplicated flight and also baggage charges. We almost missed our flight trying to get help. After the flight couldn’t get any response thru customer service online either. There is no customer service phone assistance either. Never again.

### "I was tagged as a no show"
I flew on this flight August 5th, after a 5 hour delay we finally got to board. I flew the 2hr 6min flight from Ohio to Florida. I was checking the app for my miles and I did not receive them. Apparently I was tagged as a no show and wasn’t on the flight. I most certainly was. I have been arguing with a rep about it for 2 hours now and just keep getting told “the system shows you didn’t show up for the flight”, I have lots of pictures and proof I was. It’s been very frustrating and I won’t be renewing my discount den membership.

### "Horrible experience"
I purchased my ticket for my family vacation in February 2023. Here it is August in Florida with my family enjoying vacation. I went to check my ticket for a return flight and nothing was coming up. Call Frontier to get an automated system that doesn’t have my flight as booked, there is no one that can assist over the phone. So I call Priceline only them to let me know the flight was cancelled, I had no notice from them. After repurchasing a ticket for the 8th, I get to the airport only to find out the flight was cancelled again. Now it’s 4.30 in the morning with my family of 6, rental is returned, I already checked out of the hotel and no family in Florida. I was told we can wait until the next day 3pm in order for us to fly in to Hartford Connecticut. They ended up putting on a a flight to Long island where we ended up having to pay an additional 300 dollars to get to Connecticut. We had to Uber to the train station, take a train to grand central then take another train to Connecticut with all our luggage, and kids in tow. Horrible experience.

### "Should have listened to all the bad reviews"
Flight cancelled, ruined my trip. Should have listened to all the bad reviews. Avoid Frontier airlines at all cost. Doesn't matter how cheap their flight are if they just get cancelled.

### "Never been so humiliated"
Not Verified |  From San Francisco to Atlanta, the flight was delayed by couple of hours and then the gate was shut on my face and was told it’s a full flight now even though I had a boarding pass on me. Ultimately gave me a seat on the aircraft without a seatbelt for my 6 month old baby. I was told they don’t carry them. From Atlanta to San Francisco, the flight got delayed again for few hours and ultimately after waiting for four hours of so with my baby I was told it’s been cancelled. Went to the front desk to rebook the flight and they put me on 8 hour flight. When I asked to change it, I was screamed at in front of everyone there. Never been so humiliated in my life and would not fly with them even for free.

### "terrible and nightmare"
Worst airline service. Our three flights in the whole booking was delayed two of more hours. The last flight returning from Orlando to Cleveland was terrible and nightmare. How bad an airline service can be. First our connecting flight from Orlando was supposed to start at 11 am. They delayed it saying hydraulic issues and said will leave within two hours. Then said we need to move to another gate and the flight will go now at 3 pm. We were eagerly waiting and has been on the Road since the morning day before. Then they said flight cancelled for flight shortage. Then asked us to go to cancel or refund without any compensation for the losses. Then as we had no option this autocratic airline gave us 10 pm flight as a change flight. Then it delayed to 11.50 pm start. Then again to 2 am, when I am writing this I am waiting for 2 am flight with my colleague.

### "losing all my future business"
Not Verified | I have been a long time customer until today. Frontier Airlines charged me for a carry on I didn't have and when I contacted them.for a refund they basically called me a liar and refused to refund my money. I have been using Frontier for years for myself my girlfriend my kids and my grandkids and today they lost my business for good. I hope that $78 was worth losing all my future business.

### "denied my request for a refund"
Not Verified |  I missed my flight because this airline changed the gates at the last minute and the departure monitor crashed. Me and a number of customers missed our flights because of this issue. We were all issued a card for refunds. When I reached out to the customer service team, they denied my request for a refund. This was totally unacceptable. I am never using this airline again. They have to be the worst.

### "Don't rely on this airline"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled at last minute. Only option was to fly to Denver then back to Miami from Cancun. A one hour flight would take 14 hours. Cancelled flight and had to buy a new ticket on a different airline, pay for a hotel and my meal. Frontier only offered hotel and meal if you rebook on their plane. The attendant was nasty telling everyone to cancel and figure out on your own. Mind you we are in a Foreign country with no place to go. This is the third and last time this has happened to me with Frontier. Read the reviews and ratings. The planes are old and noisy. The staff is rude. Pay more money so you can actually get where you need to go. Don't rely on this airline. The FAA should step in and revoke the licenses. Frontier is garbage.

### "the most frustrating experience"
Do not book with this airline, it will be the most frustrating experience you ever have. Left San Antonio via Denver to Philadelphia. Flight was cancelled mid air. Arrives and has to do a 4 hour plus line past midnight. Reason is something to do with their logistics. Only one person attending over 100 cancelled flight customer. Next morning we board new flight from Denver via Cleveland. Flight is super delayed and possibly cancelled. No compensation or support as far as food or hotels. Left at 9pm on Sunday and it's Monday 8pm and haven't departed. Please do not book if you care about time. These people don't care about your welfare or your time.

### "Absolute nightmare"
Absolute nightmare. Delayed over an hour. Boarded us, taxied for almost an hour. Crew timed out. Deplaned us and gave us zero information. Got a text the flight was now 9:20 the next morning. Get a hotel, get to the airport the next morning, that flight is cancelled with no other options Nothing they can do because “weather” The worst part of it all is there are zero people who tell you what’s going on the whole time. I’ve incurred significant expenses for flying this airline, am still in Baltimore. Nobody answers the phone.

### "Waste of money, time and energy"
Not Verified |  The service was horrible. First my flight was supposed to be at 10.12am on August 6th, was canceled due to the airline saying we need to find another flight and pilot. The airline didn't let the customers know till close to an hour after we were supposed to board the plane. There wasn't another direct flight and other flights had major layovers. Another customer and I had found another flight to Orlando which was further away from my destination, but we had to get back. Problem was I was at the airport from 6.30am - till 2pm for that other flight. The guest service agent at the plane area was no help. She couldn't transfer our money and to the new flights, she couldn't refund nothing. I had to walk all the way back to where departure was to go through tickets. I was forced by the first agent to purchase the flight on my phone. Never got a refund for my flight and paid double amount for the second flight. Plus had to pay double amount for transfers to get me to my destination. This was a horrible experience. They didn't pay for my food since it was more than 3 hours to wait for the second flight. The employees are incompetent and lack of training. Customer service to get refund is a joke you can't get a human to talk with. The only thing they sent in an email was a 100 voucher for a future date. That is a joke, I shouldn't have to pay for my flight for their incompetence. All the passengers should get a refund all in all. I should have gotten a refund for both flights due to the price I had to pay to get back towards Tampa and time driving. This airline was a joke and this was my first time flying with them. This was a horrible experience and nightmare. I usually don't complain and go with the flow, but if you really want to save don't fly with frontier. They have extra charges for example getting help at the ticket service to print a new boarding pass due to their cancelation another 25.00. I also had to go through security all over again as well. Waste of money, time and energy. I have flown with other airlines and never experience lack of training rudeness and incompetence. Please never fly this airline pay more for better service.

### "Awful experience"
Horrible experience. They emailed that it was a smaller plane and asked customers to rebook for $250 credit. Then the plane was delayed and hour. Finally got on the plane, taxied and the plane was returned to the gate due to the crew timed out and could not fly. Flight was canceled and next flight was not until 9:20 am the next day. Airline lied and blamed the cancellation on weather even though we were told the crew timed out. With this lie, they didn’t need to pay hotel or food. Had to sleep on the floor in the airport. Awful experience.

### "Canceled our flight on way to airport"
Not Verified | Canceled our flight on way to airport. Wanted us to fly across the country and stay overnight to fly back to Denver in am. Absolute garbage. Will never use this airline again.

### "this airline is not worth it"
The worst airline in my life. More than 4 hours late and a detour to Minnesota and they didn't let us get off the plane not even to buy water. I will never fly with Frontier Airline again. If they can pay a little more for another airline, it's better.... For saving a few dollars, this airline is not worth it. La peor aerolinea en mi vida Mas de 4 horas de retraso y un desvio asta Minnesota y no nos dejaron salir del avion ni para comprar agua. Jamas vuelbo a Volar con Frontier Airline Si pueden pagar un poco mas para otra aerolinea es mejor .... Por aorrar unos dolares esta aerolinea no vale la pena

### "Frontier is a joke"
Not Verified |  Person announcing the flight called group one and priority boarding and argued with me when I came up with my 3 year old daughter to board the plane. Frontier is a joke.

### "to check a bag is over $70"
Not Verified |  I had changed my flight. When putting in my card info reviewing the charges, that price did NOT match what I was charged. I was charged over an extra $200 and no one at frontier will give me a refund saying it’s a “policy”. What policy charges your card an extra $200 without authorization? Worst airline I have ever flown as well. No leg room. Mean flight attendants. Dirty plane. Don’t waste your time. Not even worth the “cheaper prices” because to check a bag is over $70.

### "flying experience was terrible"
I paid for my flight, Checked in on the app the night before I also reserved my seat, and paid for priority boarding. Your system did not give me a boarding pass, I did not receive priority boarding, and a family was given my seat and the flight crew did not make them move. I also asked for assistance with my boarding pass at the gate, since I did not receive it from Frontier and, one of your employees said I was lucky because they usually don't help with this. This whole flying experience was terrible, and I was also charged multiple times for my carry-on baggage at multiple stops. All employees at the boarding counter were late and barely showed up on time to board the plane much less to assist. I will never use this airline again.

### "Frontier makes it impossible to speak with anyone"
Not Verified | Frontier makes it impossible to speak with anyone. We got to the airport two hours before our flight and had to wait hour and 20 minutes to check our bag. We checked it in and ran to our flight. Our daughter ran ahead and got on the flight realized we didn’t make the flight as we were at the gate before our flight but they closed the gate after she got on. The airline realizing she is a minor without her guardians let her get off the plane but wouldn’t just let us on even though we were at the gate. At this point, things got worse as there was no customer service open to help us get on another flight. We eventually had to call a third party vendor that handles Frontier issues. They charged us $500 to get on the next flight. My daughter said the Frontier stewardess and baggage person that escorted her off the plane were mean and dishonest. They told her we will allow your parents on the plane but then grabbed her by the arm and took her off the plane. She was sobbing when they opened the gate door to join us. It is amazing to me that this airline will choose to work against instead of for their customers. A costly lesson to learn never to fly Frontier again. I hope others learn from our mistake.

### "This was the worst airline experience"
Worst experience I have ever encountered while dealing with an airline. I received a email that said the plane was being downsized and if I wanted to switch to a different flight then I’d receive a $250 voucher for each member of my family traveling. If I did not want to fly another time then I should proceed to come to the airport to check in and board the plane. Me and my family of 5 arrived at the airport 2 1/2 hours prior to my flight departure time. It took over a 1 hour to get to the check in counter. Once we were at the check in counter I only received a seat assignment for 3 of the 5 passengers. I informed the lady at the desk and she stated that they would take care of the other 2 seats at the gate counter. Once we made it passed security and to the gate counter, a frontier worker arrived 30mins prior to departure time. Once it was my time to speak with her I informed her of my ticket situation and she looked at my tickets and said “you have 3 out of the 5 seats assigned?” Then she asked for my tickets and then removed my 3 seats that were assigned and told me that I didn’t have any seats assigned after they were printed on my tickets. She removed my 3 seats and gave them to another party of 3 since I didn’t have all of my seats assigned and told me to wait on standby to see if 5 seats become available. After the plane boarded they sent us to another gate to speak with the shift supervisor in which he informed us there was nothing he could do for us and that we had to go back down to the check in counter to book new flights. 58 people were kicked off the plane due to the plane being “downsized”. They had no solution for this either. Now back in the check in line I had to wait another hour and a half to get to the front of the line just to be told that the next available flight was in three days. I told the gentleman, “Sir, you mean to tell me that I’ve been here for 5 hours and you now tell me that the only flight you have going from Orlando to Cleveland leaves in three days?” That’s crazy to me. Why didn’t the lady at the ticket counter just tell us that we were not going to be able to fly on the plane at 8:15am when I arrived so that way I didn’t waste 5 hours in an airport with 3 young children and my wife. I probably would have been able to book a flight with another airline. So I asked for my refund and my voucher and the guy was hesitant to give me one. Leaving me no other option but to get a rental car and make the long drive to Cleveland, Ohio. This was the worst airline experience I have ever dealt with. And I am very disappointed with Frontier Airlines.

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. It might be tempting to purchase a flight with Frontier, because of their "cheap" tickets, but whatever money you end up "saving" on your ticket, you will end up spending on luggage, fees, and taxes, and in the end, you'll spend more money for a poor experience, than you would have if you went with a different airline company. My boyfriend and I ended up having Frontier as our return airline company from our trip to Punta Cana, we were going to Phoenix. We get to the airport and check in our two suitcases, a medium and large one, and they charge us $250 for them, for one being slightly overweight, and "other taxes and fees". The employee said the price is high because it was an international flight? How come United only charged $100 for both bags when we were coming to Punta Cana, it was an international flight then as well. We pay the fees for our bags, and the employee prints our boarding passes with no seat number or zone, and tells us we will get our seats at the gate and proceed to the gate given to us. We arrive at the gate just to find out it was a completely different airline, and Frontier had moved to a different gate, within 5 minutes of us getting our boarding passes. We proceed to the new gate, I walk up to the podium and ask if we can get our seat numbers, one of the attendants told me that none of them are Frontier employees and that I need to go to yet another gate to get my seat assignments. I proceed to the third gate, where I encounter the most unfriendly and condescending Frontier employee, that looked dumbfounded that I would ask for my seat assignment 30 minutes before boarding. Annoyed I return to the gate area and wait for boarding, when it was our turn they scanned our ticket and told us to step aside and wait, since we don't have a seat number we have to wait and see if there will be room on the plane for us. We managed to board and were on the way to Orlando, where we had a 22-hour layover. The next day we come back without bags to check them in for our flight to Phoenix, the attendant in punta cana said we won't have to pay any more fees for our bags, once we check them in, in Orlando. The attendant in Orlando charged us an additional $88 for our bags, even though we already paid $250 in Punta Cana when we checked them in. $338 just on bags, plus $200 for a hotel we had to book because of the 22h layover, absolutely ridiculous. If i could give them negative start I would! The staff is unfriendly, unhelpful, and condescending. I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy.

### "feels a bit scammish"
Not Verified | I'm 99.9% positive there was no change in plane on our flight out of Orlando to Punta Cana on Frontier, but my wife and I purposely have bags to meet the requirements of a personal item and have flown numerous times and never once got "checked. However, our flight out back to Orlando has triggered a "check" and our bags didn't fit their "personal item" example. This caused us to pay $200 for the luggage which is currently under the seat because it always fits. Not sure why their personal item storage checker is smaller than what is allowed for under the seats but it feels a bit scammish. I should also mention that there was another couple on the same flight in, and now out, that got hit with the same issue.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  I was at RDU airport waiting to board my flight, mind you, I am deaf. When the worker speaks over the intercom (I cannot understand nothing! ), I rely on the email or the app to follow for updates, even though it is 2023, it is time to provide a screen with subtitles to keep us informed just as much as a hearing person. When I ask the worker for help after being notified by email that the flight 1741 was canceled and to find your own flight home with no help from them, she was rude! I told her I wear hearing aids and I am confused with what is going on, she said "didn't you hear the intercom like 15 mins ago? I said "didn't you hear that I stated I wear hearing aids? she said "you talk just fine, nothing we can do, your best bet is find your own flight". Never again. Worst experience ever. I always fly Delta, AA, Southwest, etc. Never had this experience. Again, Frontier Airlines needs to shut down period.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline and worst travel experience I have ever experienced. The constant delays and cancellations during my travel, I would never travel frontier again under any circumstance. For all the issues caused and the complete disruption to my work schedule, they gave a lousy $30 “meal credit”. The flights are cheap but I would not recommend this airline to anyone for any type of trouble unless you are looking for an instant headache.

### "wasting my time with them again"
Not Verified | I have traveled with Frontier before and there has always been an issue. I can say this time is on me for thinking that this time it would be different. My flight to PR was ok, a bit of a delay, still I arrived to the island at a good time. My flight to go back home, first it was delayed by a couple of hours then just by a few minutes and lastly it was canceled. When I asked why was the flight canceled they said they had no available pilots, the pilot had called out sick. That is ridiculous and unacceptable. You don't have enough pilots to make sure you don't have to cancel flights and mess up everyone's lives, you should close down and not even bother. We were offered vouchers that I'm pretty sure most of the people won't even use so in other words we get screwed over while the airline doesn't take responsibility. No accommodations because our flights weren't round trip "you kidding me" nothing. I'm stuck on the island for another 2 days spending more money that I could afford on hotel and food with a special needs daughter. I will be missing appointments and therapies and all they do is give a voucher that only can be used to buy another ticket with them like I will ever fly with them again. Horrible airline I would not recommend it. Like I said this one is on me for wasting my time with them again, I should have known better by now.

### "can't seem to get it right"
Where do I even start. I don't understand how one of the biggest airlines in the industry can't seem to get it right. Does nobody from corporate pay attention to anything the consumers have to say? Every single flight I have taken since last year with Frontier has had so many issues. Today, I thought this was going to be the very first flight without any trouble. We boarded on time, took off on time, and even landed on time and now we have been sitting on the taxi way for 25+ minutes because "our gate is occupied. I'm so fed up with this airline and will be flying any other airline from now on. Even Spirit never had this many issues consistently.

### "customer service: very, very poor"
July 6, 2023. I arrived early at the airport, ready to go home. There was no line. Agents were standing around; not busy. I showed my id. The attendant told me I had to check-in online. I asked if they had computers I could use to do the self check in. No, you have to use your computer", she said. I asked if she could help me, since I did not check-in online. She reaped the same thing again like a robot: "you need to check-in online...". I asked to speak with her supervisor. She said "they are going to tell you the same thing". I waited for at least half an hour before I was able to get help - a different agent said I could do it on the phone. I did it, but I needed to get to the payment page. i approached another attendant with a question, she told me it would be a $25 charge to get help - question or any type of service from attendants. Customer Service does not seem to be something of a value to Frontier airlines as a company in general, and to these attendants in particular, and they don't seem to care. To have their questions answered, customers must pay $25. I ended up spending almost an hour just trying to check-in. Attendants were standing around not wanting to help unless I pay an extra $25 them on top of the ticket I already purchased. I find this ridiculous. I have flown with many different airlines, domestically and internationally; but Frontier airlines is the first one of a kind when it comes to customer service: very, very poor! Attendants: unfriendly. Plus hidden costs.

### "deep disappointment and frustration"
I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the treatment I experienced during my recent travel. I arrived at airline counter with the expectation of a smooth boarding process. However, to my dismay, I was involuntarily denied boarding despite holding a confirmed reservation. The airline staff informed me that I would be entitled to a 400% payout due to this unfortunate incident. Regrettably, my disappointment did not end there. I, along with other affected families, was made to wait for over three hours without any clear communication about the situation. Eventually, we were informed that the promised compensation would not be provided in monetary form but rather in the form of vouchers. This abrupt change in the offered compensation is highly disconcerting, and I strongly believe that your airline should honor its initial commitment to provide the specified monetary compensation. Furthermore, during this stressful and uncertain period, I requested information regarding the alleged aircraft downgrade that led to the denied boarding. However, your staff declined to provide any supporting evidence or explanation for this claim. Transparency is paramount in such situations, and I urge your airline to provide detailed information to help me understand the basis for their decision. The ordeal worsened as the next available flight was scheduled for the following morning, leaving me and fellow passengers without any provisions for food or accommodations during the overnight wait. I was left with no alternative but to purchase a ticket with another airline, incurring an additional cost of $290. This added financial burden, coupled with the inconvenience of being stranded, reflects poorly on your airline's commitment to customer care. I firmly believe that the level of professionalism and consistency exhibited during my experience does not align with the standards expected from a reputable airline. I request a comprehensive explanation for the denied boarding incident, the alleged aircraft downgrade, and the sudden change in compensation. Additionally, I seek further compensation for the financial losses incurred due to the delayed travel and the necessity of purchasing an alternative ticket.

### "Frontier is a terrible airline"
Not Verified | Frontier is a terrible airline. I took four flights and all of them were delayed for two hours. The seats are terrible and they don’t offer a cup of water. They changed my connexion with a difference of 16 hours. Never again

### "without doubt the worst I have flown"
Not Verified | I’ve been flying 100,000 plus air miles a year for the last 35 years. This airlines is without a doubt the worst I have ever flown. And that is saying a lot because I have flown domestic flights all over Asia and Africa. Nobody during the entire process seems to care one bit about the passengers. The airline prays on people that are not experienced flyers. They give you a very low price to attract the naïve and then add a cost for everything. You have to pay to get an assigned seat. Unless you pay $50 plus you get a seat that doesn’t recline and if you are 5’10 or taller, your knees are hitting the seat in front of you. You have to pay to bring on baggage. I am very experienced with computers and yet found getting a boarding pass difficult. If you figure out how to get a paper or e ticket, don’t worry, just pay $25 at the airport and they will be happy to print one out. Oh, and you can’t check baggage you have paid for, $70, unless you have checked in. You have to pay for anything to drink including water. The boarding process is a zoo because a substantial portion of the gullible passengers have never flown before. The only favorable comment is that the plane was clean. Frontier should change their tag line to one and done. Never again.

### "Save yourself the annoyance and trouble"
Not Verified | Will never fly again. My low-cost ticket went from $250 to $500 because of all the hidden fees like processing fees, check-in fees, and baggage. I really thought I was getting a deal, but these surcharges cost me $150 more than what the average ticket prices were if I had gone with other airlines at the time of my purchase. All my flights were also 2-3 hours delayed. Save yourself the annoyance and trouble. Customer service is also terrible. Misery breeds misery.

### "the worst airline I ever went on"
This is the worst airline I ever went on. The flight got delayed multiple times every 10 minutes. And eventually it got cancelled. My plane ticket was on July 30th 2023. After a lot of waiting I finally got on the plane. After I got on the plane in like 20 minutes the captain start talking and he said he’s been working for a lot of hours so it’s illegal for him to fly so everyone had to go out from the plane. If there’s no pilot why would you make people get in the plane and wait for no reason.

### "cancelled two days in a row"
Not Verified | I did not get to use my flight because it was cancelled two days in a row, no reason given or known. I received nothing from Frontier Airlines as far as compensation. I was directed to the customer service area at the airport. Frontier has 1 agent working and approx. 400 people in line needing assistance. Absolutely outrageous! Also, there is no phone number you can call for assistance with Frontier Airlines, they don't have one. This is the absolute worst customer service one could experience. Never fly this airline. I had to use my computer to request a refund and then, there I am at the airport with my bags and no flight. I end up buying another ticket that day from another carrier at an outrageous price rate so I could get home. There were three of us flying.

### "won't find me flying Frontier again"
The flights were very nice, however you won't find me flying Frontier again, since the reps and supervisor I spoke to when I Finally found a phone number were very rude and would not listen to what I had to say and wanted to charge me a hefty fee to change my tickets, even though the bundle I purchased promised my cost would be fully refundable if changes or a cancellation needed to be made. This is flat out misrepresentation. This is a horrible way to run a business. I felt robbed. I am still considering my options.

### "Customer service is absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. Never recommend this. Customer service is absolutely terrible, didn't bother trying to help us check in. If anything, never use this. Got lost multiple times and only the people who were actually taking the airline tried. Worse airline I've been to.

### "Outrageous bag fees"
Not Verified |  Outrageous bag fees. $75 for 1 checked bag 1 way with the bag weighing 20lbs. So for 2 people we paid $300 in bag fees, which was more than our FLIGHT was, and we were not allowed a carry on bag either. Small seats and very cramped. You should at bare minimum offer water free of charge.

### "think twice before flying with them again"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to fly out at 2:50 p.m. on July 26th. After 8 delays it finally took off at 12:59 a.m. on July 27th. During that entire time we received two notifications my email and nothing by text. We only received a $30 food voucher for two people. At an airport one person can barely eat on $30 .We chose to get on the 6:00 a.m. flight on July 27th instead of waiting several more hours at the airport. We got to the airport on July 27th at 4:45 a.m. only to find out that the flight had been delayed until 9:26am. Then the flight was delayed even further because the staff did not board the passengers in a timely manner. We ended up finally taking off around 9:45 a.m. we already have our return flight booked so we have no choice but to Fly Frontier again but I would think twice before flying with them again.

### "I didn't get to fly"
Not Verified | Disregard all flight information. I didn't get to fly. I booked my flight through a third party app, everything was good. I'd never flown Frontier before in my life. My brother, my husband, my aunt in another state, all rearranged their schedules to accommodate my visit. I got the notice to check in for my flight. After entering all information, I got nothing but error messages. So I waited 2 to 4 hours and tried checking in again. When it didn't work I was forced to contact customer service via Facebook messenger, of all things. I was informed I canceled my flight, (or that it was canceled), I freaked out. I couldn't think of what I had done to cancel my booking. I was able to re-book with Spirit. Another couple I overheard talking, after security, was also on that canceled Frontier flight. They informed me that Frontier canceled that ROUTE and didn't let any passengers know. Thank goodness we got our money back. I don't know how this airline is still in business. Spirit has NEVER left me stranded. Nor American OR Delta. (I highly recommend Delta).

### "uncomfortable seats, terrible reliability"
Not Verified | We received a text from the airline to be in the airport 2 hours early due to security lines. We arrived at 3am because our flight was at 6am. After we breezed through the security line, we stood in line for Frontier to drop off our luggage. At 4:45am, the Frontier employees arrived and just stood around. One of them asked another more senior member if they should open the and start processing. The senior member replied "they can wait. We'll open when we want to open". She said that in front of everyone. They didn't begin processing until 5:15. Blatant power trip and a terrible airline for allowing this kind of behavior. Not to mention all the hidden fees, the uncomfortable seats, and the terrible reliability of the airline.

### "the worst airline out there"
Not Verified |  They keep people waiting for long hours and end up canceling flights. A lot of money is lost and they don't respond. They are the worst airline out there. I lost a lot of money on reservations and the airline instead of solving their problem or calling another plane they do nothing. Tienen a las personas esperando muchas horas y terminan cancelando los vuelos. Se pierde mucho dinero y no responden. Son la peor aerolínea que existe. Perdí mucho dinero en reservaciones y la aerolínea en vez de resolver su problema o llamar otro avión no hacen nada.

### "nothing enjoyable about this experience"
Not Verified | Horrible experience, but evidently not as bad as many others. Frontier offered the lowest price, so I took it (not knowing in advance how much they would nickel & dime me down the road). Then, a week later as I was preparing for my trip, they sent a notice that it was time to check-in. They explained that bringing a CARRY-ON item would cost me $74 EACH WAY, and a checked-luggage would cost me $76 EACH WAY. That that point, their original low-ball price on the tickets was now much higher. Once on-board, I found that the air temperature in the cabin would be a frosty-cold flight. I had two blankets, which I always bring with me in my backpack, and even with those two blankets, I was still uncomfortably cold. The other onboard surprise was that NONE of the seats had an option to recline. That may seem like a small thing, but for us older folks who have flown all over the world, we're accustomed to that one inch of recline usually allowed in most flights. Then, when the food service was wheeled down the aisle, we were told that everything/anything we wanted other than water would cost us. It would have been nice to know that in advance so I could have brought my own snack vice paying their highway robbery prices. Finally, the straw that broke the camel's back, they texted me a few hours before our return flight to (at first) delay the flight by one hour, and ultimately to cancel the flight completely. They DID say they would refund the amount of my return flight, but the last-minute cost of my new return flight through a more reputable airlines cost me more than double what my Frontier flight says they will return to me in 7-10 business days. Other than landing safely at my trip destination, there was nothing enjoyable about this travel experience, and all that inconvenience is directly related to Frontier. I dreaded the return flight right up to the moment it was cancelled, and at least can console myself that I'll NEVER have to get on another Frontier flight the rest of my life!! My nephew flew on Frontier the week before and went through a much worse experience with delay flights which left him stranded over-night in the airport at his connection location along with all the rest of my complaints as listed above. If you're ever offered "a great option" for a flight on Frontier Airlines, run! Don't walk, RUN!

### "truly was an awful experience"
Let me start with this. Flying Frontier should be your absolute last resort. I would gladly pay for an uber from Atlanta to Houston than ever fly this airline again. Every person that worked for Frontier, and I mean EVERY person was rude, refused to communicate, and did not care about any inconvenience to any person. I am used to that kind of customer service, but professionals would have at least faked it. The flight out to Houston from Atlanta, and then back to Atlanta were delayed numerous times with zero communication. No snacks or drinks provided, only a menu where you can buy a small water for the price of champagne. This truly was an awful experience. I would rather walk, barefoot.

### "Horrible experience overall"
Not Verified |  Seats are uncomfortable on the plane, no service in the air and if you want anything it’s an additional cost unlike Delta or pretty much any other airline. Even a simple drink will cost you. Flight has been delayed 5-6 hours yet isn’t even updated in the airlines end. Horrible experience overall and I highly recommend Delta or pretty much any other airline. These guys are horrible and I will never be flying with them again.

### "Worst flight I've ever been on"
Not Verified | Worst flight I've ever been on. Waited to use bathroom. Told to sit down despite seat belt signs not being on. Said it was because they were boarding. I was in front row and the flight attendant in the back was allowing people to use bathroom. Couldn't make it there in time. Take off and when seatbelt signs come off. They bring beverage carts both directions and just park them at the ends. NOBODY CAN USE THE BATHROOM the entire flight.

### "they have endless number of fees"
Stay away from this company! If you think that you are saving money using Frontier, you are deeply mistaken. This company only advertise themselves as low-cost airline. but in fact, they have endless number of fees that grow to your ticket price like a snowball. When I chose my flight, The price for luggage was $55, as a result, I paid $140 for a regular sized 35 pound suitcase. During the flight, you will not even get a cup of water for free, the seats were very uncomfortable they did not lean back. If this is a night flight, it means hat you will not fall asleep even for a minute. When we arrived, we waited half half an hour to get off the plane , and an hour and half for our luggage. It was 2 AM, there were many passengers with small children. It was awful.

### "constantly delaying and cancelling flights"
Worst airline out there. Their excuse for constantly delaying and cancelling flights is that they are a budget airline. This is no excuse to treat people like expendable variables. Unprofessional. Not even a single person at the Frontier  desk. Only went with them as I'm poor and now I guess I have to pay for my sins of being poor.

### "canceled my flight with no notice"
Not Verified | This idiots canceled my flight with no notice had to purchase same day ticket with other airline to be able to return to work and not miss a day at work due to their irresponsibility.

### "we were 5 hours late departing"
This is my second time having a bad experience with this airline. The first time the pilot was 2 hours late getting to work, this time we were 5 hours late departing causing my travel plans to be completely messed up. I ended up having to come out of pocket an extra 200 for my transportation, there is no number to call the chat feature sucks and I was denied a refund. The trip back home was delayed over 2 hours, the reps don’t care at all, they are not friendly or helpful. I can’t wait until they shut this airline down.

### "Bait and switch tactics used"
Not Verified | Do not fly this airline. Bait and switch tactics used. Nothing but fees for everything. Starts off the lowest airline out there. After you pick all the options like the seat you want which all of them cost money. You pay more than a reputable airline. No thanks do not buy

### "cancel a flight 4 hours before departure"
I can believe this company has taken over the market with their false advertising, they just cancel a flight 4 hours before departure, with no option of flying today. We have plans and now we need to move over things because this people don’t know how to do their work, they own plenty of planes, so if one broke, get another one ready. A cancellation like this should be penalized

### "airline doesn’t care about their customers"
This is the worst airline ever. First you can’t check yourself in at a kiosk you have to go to the desk line. If you wish to print your boarding pass you have to pay them to do it, 25 dollars to print a boarding pass. Then the agents are all rude and unprofessional. When at my gate trying to board after the desk agent had said you can bring a backpack or purse on without paying, I had to pay 99 dollars for my backpack. This airline doesn’t care about their customers. This is the first and last time I will ever fly frontier. With the money I had to spend in extra fees I could’ve booked a better airline with better customer service, planes, and overall attitude. It’s truly disgusting how this airline operates.

### "there is no customer service phone number"
Not Verified |  My son and his girlfriend flew July 22nd. They had a layover in Charlotte NC. Well my sons girlfriend needs a wheelchair which the airline left in North Carolina. I know this happens. My complaint is if it does with Frontier there is no customer service phone number. I had to file a complaint it could take them 7 days to respond. They aren’t responsible for lost items well they lost it. Also their baggage fees are outrageous. They advertise cheap well they aren’t. I and none of my family will ever fly Frontier again.

### "rudest employees ever!"
Not Verified |  I cannot express my frustration enough with this airline, they have to have some of the absolute and utter inconsiderate and rudest employees ever! They are definitely not a discount airline. They charge you for everything and these charges are exorbitant! Making everyone measure bags and then pay an additional $100 for simple things like backpacks because they don't fit into a slot. I wish the government would just shut this airline down, they don't deserve our business! What are the executives doing? I'm sure they know about the dissatisfaction. Never have I seen a good review or heard anything good about this airline. I've definitely flown with them for the last time. They didn't leave on time, they overbooked, and even when they're in a rush you have rude employees at the gates rushing passengers. If you express any type of discomfort or let them know that something is wrong they will pull you off your flight! I've seen it happen! Definitely negative zero stars on everything.

### "They never left on time"
I have flown many times with this airline. They never left on time. We are sitting in Las Vegas on a plane and have been sitting for 40 minutes outside at 120 degrees. I'm late for a business dinner.

### "I assume they had no crew"
Arrived at gate in 415 AM 7/15/23 for 515 AM boarding and 6 AM flight, plane was sitting at gate. All is well, boarded and ready for departure. At 610 they decide to fuel the plane, they said 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we leave the gate and arrived in Cancun. Return flight was supposed to be 1020 departure 7/21/23. Left resort 6 AM and arrived at gate 7 AM and found out flight was cancelled. Received an email and text after arriving at airport about cancellation and was told our return flight would be next day at 216 PM. Frontier counter told us to scan a QR code which was worthless and said come back tomorrow. No hotel to stay, basically nothing. I asked why flight was cancelled and was told something about “air traffic control and crew”. I assume they had no crew but this flight had been scheduled for six months, planes were continually landing and taking off so not sure what was meant by “air traffic control”. We were in a group of 20+ people who were left scrambling to get home.

### "waste of money traveling"
As a 1st time customer I was very disappointed with the poor service I received at the Orlando Airport. The agents are very unprofessional, very rude and don't take the time to properly outline important information. On arrival to the airport I was left to find my way around the airport, the staff told me they can't move to help me to check in, the machines were not scanning the information. On checking in I was not aware that flying Frontier the weight limit was 40lbs. I was of the belief that all airlines was under 50 pounds. I was not allowed to reorganize my bags I was demanded to pay over 600us for 4 bags. If I was told on entering the counter that the weight is 40lbs I would have restructured my bags, the staff was rude pay now, give me your credit card, bullying me without giving me the information forehand that the limit was 40lbs. I will not recommend anyone to fly Frontier and the flight over 20 seats was empty. I would prefer signs posted in the airport to share information with customers. The plane did not even offer water and I was traveling with 3 small children. No form of entertainment for passengers flying nothing. A waste of money traveling and being treated like dirt.

### "The worst of the worst"
The worst of the worst airlines I have ever had the displeasure of traveling with. It seems like a good inexpensive deal at first. They nickel and dime you for everything. This is the second and last time I will fall for them. The first flight out was a disaster with an arrival 2 days late! This was the return trip that is equally as awful. My son arrived an hour early to catch his flight. He has 3 bags that according to their scales was ~2 lbs over. They were all 1lb under when we weighed them at home. He took out a jacket from one and some books from the others and made weight. Then had to wait for the agent to call him back. By the time the agent was ready to help him, he said that the system won’t allow it bc now it’s 45 minutes until the flight. Had the agent checked him just 1 minute sooner, he would have been able to board. Now we have to pay an extra $99 fee to rebook him 5 days later. There is literally zero customer service! Any complaints or changes or help needed all has to be done online, which means you get zero help! A human cannot help you.

### "Worst airline to exist"
Worst airline to exist. Delayed over 1 hour during departure, on our arrival into Chicago we didn’t have enough fuel to perform a holding pattern. Diverted to Milwaukee. Sat in the hot plane for hours waiting for them to refuel which took longer than they promised. Said it was a short flight to Chicago. Flew another hour in the air and still wasn’t in Chicago. Caused me to miss my event and intended purpose of travel. Zero excuses, zero compensation. Such a terrible company.

### "the worst airline available"
Absolutely the worst airline available. I understand completely that things happen but the airlines response is unacceptable. Left us stranded in Mexico with no assistance in getting home due to a flight cancellation. No explanation no empathy nothing just scan this QR code and come back tomorrow. Worst customer service reps, worst flight attendants, worst fees, worst inflight service. No reason for this company to still be in business.

### "The fees are unbelievable"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience! The fees are unbelievable. I had to pay $108 for a small bag that could've easily fit underneath the seat or could've been considered a personal bag. The seat that I was assigned to was all the way in the back of the plane (mind you I am a handicapped individual). There was also a slight delay in which we were initially supposed to take off at 7:40 but did not end up leaving until around 8:20. We didn't end up landing until almost 11pm. Please do not fly with Frontier Airlines. Even if you save a few dollars on the ticket price you will almost certainly pay more once you add the fees for a seat on the plane and luggage. I have flown with them before but definitely learnt my lesson this time around and will not be flying with Frontier ever again.

### "met with great difficulty via the app"
It wasn't that the voucher number didn't work, but rather that there was no time/place to enter it throughout the new transaction on your website/app as per instructed in the voucher email. The only thought I have is that the app went through a new update as the one I have been using the past few days clearly had a new interface and somewhere in the translation, the process was changed or buttons not added properly in the html etc... prior to launch? My hope is that the voucher can be added to the flight I already purchased for tomorrow. In other news, while attempting to cancel my earlier flight from today, I was met with great difficulty via the app (possibly resulting from the aforementioned update?) After going in many circles with the chatbot and waiting something like 35 min for a representative to arrive on the chat, I got frustrated and began searching for a phone number online to which I found a number claiming to connect me to the Philadelphia airport Frontier desk, but rather, connected me to a third party scammer who ended up "canceling my flight" with you somehow (likely getting a refund of some sort themselves) while simultaneously charging me an additional fee to cancel. While I don't expect any kind of reparations for that as it was a result of my own impatience/frustration. I'm guessing by my talks with other frustrated customers, that they are equally frustrated when trying to resolve issues with your airline, which can't be good for business. Having been a supporter of your airline in the past and knowing of your former bancruptcy claim, and fully understanding the role of chatbots, etc.in today's society; I fully believe that an investment in more customer care personel, empowering those people to resolve things beyond the standard voucher system and realistically solving all the other issues with unreliability that seemingly are plagueing your airline as of late so that the necessity for resolvement becomes negated is the only way through your current situation. Will I recoup from the loss of a few hundred bucks and my elevated stress levels and missed appointments, connecting flights and opportunities to use my time how I so deem necessary? Of course, but I (and the rest of your dwindling customer base) really shouldn't have to.

### "appalled at the behavior of the staff"
I'm absolutely appalled at the behavior of the staff on board. We haven't even departed and I have heard the flight attendance talk negatively about the attendant welcoming guests boarding, speak rudely to a handicapped guest trying to place their crutches, and then discuss in front of me whether I flushed a toilet that I didnt use while I was in the bathroom to take my medication in private. Prior to entering the bathroom, one attendant shared how much she "hate this plane". What on earth is so wrong with this company that they would allow these humans to be "in charge" of these passengers. Most of them seemingly do not care about anyone but themselves. It's truly a disgrace.

### "terrible experience with this airline"
There was a terrible experience with this airline. All my plans were disrupted. My son had a flight 7/20/2023 from Houston to San Francisco via Phoenix. The departure was at 10:55am from Houston on 7/20/2023. On 7/19/2023 at 11:40pm They sent me an email for delaying flight from Houston to Phoenix about 11.5 hours. Frontier airlines offered me a refund and change flight options. They did not offer any hotel stay or something. I had to get refund because change flight options are not appropriate for us. All our plans changed and I purchased another airline company ticket from Houston to San Francisco on the same day by paying extra $300. At midnight I was dealing with resolving my son flight to San Francisco about 2 hours. It was a terrible experience with this airline and 11.5 hours delay disrupted everything. I do not recommend their service and flight options.

### "The fees are unbelievable"
Not Verified | Horrible experience! The fees are unbelievable. DO NOT FLY WITH FRONTIER AIRLINES! We have never paid so much for checked bags as well as for carry-on bags (and of course seats were extra as well). We paid $140 per bag because they weighed 49#. We had to pay $65 per carry-on (which by the were backpacks). Please do not Frontier Airlines. There are too many other options. Even if you save a few dollars on the ticket price you will almost certainly pay more once you add the fees for a seat on the plane and luggage.

### "my first and last time"
Not Verified | Let’s just say I’ll never fly with Frontier again. Flight left Philadelphia at 655pm on 7/11 Nonstop to Vegas or so we thought. Two passengers become unruly on the plane which caused us to divert to Denver. After sitting about a hour in 30 mins in Denver after the police came on board to remove the two passengers. Our A/C stopped working. Maintenance fixed that. Landed in Vegas about a hour and 20 mins behind schedule. 7/14 arrived to the Las Vegas airport. To not only get charged $204 for a checked bag that I paid $79 in Philadelphia for with the same exact items in. For the flight to board and take off a hour later then scheduled. Let’s just say this is my first and last time flying with “Soul plane” airlines! Never again!

### "the worst I’ve ever flown with"
This airlines is genuinely the worst I’ve ever flown with - we were held back by an hour because they claimed they had some weight balancing issue that messed with the seating and an innocent woman had paid for 4 seats for her, her husband and small children, and were only given 3 seats to have for the duration of this flight. This is absolutely ridiculous, please don’t fly with them!

### "Garbage! With a capital G!"
Garbage! With a capital G! Actually make it all capital letters and bolded! I always want to give airlines a chance and this is my 2nd time with Frontier and once again it reminded me why I shouldn’t fly this airline. They delayed my flight twice and claimed that my pocket on my small purse was touching their bin where they measure bags so they charged me $100. This ridiculous! If you can afford a better airline or maybe save a bit more for a different airline then do it! I have been so stressed out with this airline that I literally have a migraine. They claim that your bag needs to be a certain measurement but what they really mean is, make sure your bag slides in the bin and there’s plenty of room around without even letting the slightest piece of your luggage touch the bin. I hate this airline!

### "Don’t even try this airline"
Don’t even try this airline, the worst ever. Please do yourself a favor, do not even try it. 6 hours delayed with 3 kids. Their excuse is no crew available for it. They tried to give me a voucher for $10 dollars for food. Please spend 100 dollars more on your next flight and buy the ticket on another airline.

### "the worst flying experience"
By far the worst flying experience of my 45 years. The first flight from O Hare was canceled after multiple delays, and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there! Since I was expected at my destination, I took it. 2nd leg had a slight delay also, but I got there 24 hours after expected. 2. Flight back had 2 legs as well. 1st leg again delayed. No mention of 2nd leg was made by staff, but the layover time was enough that I made it. Or so I thought. The flight from Atlanta, which was supposed to be at 10:27 PM, was announced as delayed to 11:20 PM. OK, I thought. No biggie. At 10 PM, they announced it was delayed to 2 AM because they didn't have staff. Here's the kicker. If they found staff, they would leave earlier. So passengers couldn't move from the gate. No meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay. Clock kept ticking. 12:30 AM, I went to get some coffee. Came back. The board at the gate says departure at 12:25 AM. All passengers were still waiting, but I panicked and asked the agent, and he says, sorry, mistake. It's at 2 AM. Then, all gate agents left. 1 AM, 1:30 AM, 2 AM... 100-plus passengers are at the gate desk, calling out for someone to come and update us. I started talking to their online agent. No customer service telephone line. It takes 15 minutes to get one online. He closed the chat unexpectedly. Ok, let's say it was an accident, but given their behavior this far you get the point. I try again. It takes 10 minutes. The agent says all their systems are down, and she can't tell me what's happening with my reservation. I tell her, I'm asking for flight status. Surely, you have that. Or air traffic control would have something to say. She keeps repeating all systems are down, and she cannot tell me more. I ask for a supervisor. She won't get me one. 3:15 AM, someone shows up at the gate desk and says they're just waiting for pilot. Passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we aren't being kept informed. The 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they don't have to let any of us fly. They say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate. Okay, passengers agree, and we walk. 3:27 AM, I get a text saying flight is at 3:30 AM. Then, gate agents leave again from the new gate. They come back around 4 and say flight canceled. We can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule. Oh, you also have to get your checked in luggage. If you know Atlanta airport. I get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance. Huge lines. They say next flight to anywhere in Illinois will be in 2 to 3 days. At that point, I ask how much will I be refunded, because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much. Answer is: I don't know. If I choose to stay (at the expense of 2 lost vacation days), will I have hotel covered? Yes, but meal and hotel won't happen until 3 PM. Remember this is now 5 AM for a 10:27 PM flight, and all passengers have been awake through the night because of their stupid conditions. Eventually, I book tickets on United and decide to eat the loss.

### "the service is the worst"
This is my first time flying on Frontier and the last one, this company has the intention to charge the customer for absolutely everything and the service is the worst, I tried to change the flight and they want to charge 100$ and for the consultation online 35$, that’s crazy! And then at the airport all the check in machines were broken, so if you want a boarding pass printed they will charge you $5, I also did my check in the day before but for some reason the check in didn’t show up so I tried to do it again and the lady at the counter told me to do it and it will be 25$ so of course I tried again with the only one machine that finally worked, but even though I got the ticket 2 months early when they told me I don’t have a seat and I had to pay 50$ for the seat, I asked the lady why didn’t I have a seat, she said because the flight was oversold! That’s wasn’t my fault, Frontier oversold the flight and then charge for the seat! I’m here waiting and crossing my finger that I’ll finally get a seat!

### "This is completely unacceptable"
Not Verified |  My minor daughter flew on Frontier. First, the plane was delayed four hours. She was expected to arrive around 10 pm, but didn't arrive until almost 2 am. Second, when I arrived at the airport to pick her up, no one was at the counter, amd no one was expected to be at the counter until after 3 am. So, I could not get a security pass to meet her at the gate. I tried calling Frontier but it's system hung up on me. All airlines should always have someone at the counter at all times. This is completely unacceptable.

### "only one employee at check in"
Not Verified | They canceled the flight as we were heading into the airport with no heads up or anything. When we got to the airport too there was only one employee at check in. If I could give Frontier a zero I would but unfortunately I can’t so Frontier gets a 1. Please save yourself some brain cells and stress and find another airline to fly with. They don’t even have a customer service phone line because they know they are a bad airline and if they had one, hundreds of customers would be asking for the help they desperately need. I cannot stress this enough DONT FLY WITH FRONTIER.

### "Not flying with them again"
Not Verified | Rip-off company. Nowhere when you book it says to check in online or there will be a service fees. We had to pay 100.00 just because we had to go up to the agent to check in on our way back. Kiosk did not work and I couldn’t actually did not know I was supposed to check in online. Agent was rude did not even explain what the fee was for. Plus we had to pay 159.00 for our bag. Ridiculous. Not flying with them again.

### "has been the worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight straight back to Cincinnati, and this has been the worst flight experience. Don't ever fly with Frontier. We knew they were bad, (I.E: don't offer food for a three hour flight unless you pay, don't let you have a jacket in-hand unless you are carrying it) but they were incredibly cheap, so against our better judgement we booked it. It got delayed for 2 hours , and as we're in line, we get an email saying it's cancelled. Do not fly with Frontier.

### "Canceled our flight out of nowhere"
Not Verified |  Terrible. Canceled our flight out of nowhere and offered no explanations or alternatives. Say they give refunds for the flight but what about the accommodations that are already booked and paid for? We had a rental car and airBnB already paid. No flight until two days later even though it was only a 4 day trip. Don’t book here, it’s unreliable and will waste your money.

### "Worst flight of my life"
Not Verified |  Worst flight of my life. I fly often, and have never experienced anything like this flight. All flights including connecting ones were delayed almost three hours but since it was not a full three hours customer “service” was a joke and no help. Chat feature on frontier to get help was automated and ridiculous. Never flying this airline again.

### "never be flying Frontier Airlines again"
Not Verified |  This airline is awful. First of all, a carry on costs 60-70 dollars for one bag. Secondly, My wife had a carry on so she got on before us, and then when my two children who are under the age of 13 and I went to get on, they changed our seats causing them to be separated from us. My family will never be flying Frontier Airlines again. If i could rate this a zero I would.

### "Worst flight of my life"
Not Verified |  Worst flight of my life. Thought that I can save a buck by booking with frontier but I was so wrong! They charge you 70$ for a carry on bag. The price came out to be almost the same as flying American or Delta. Flight was delayed 45 minutes. Once we landed we were on the tarmac for 2 hours. Then the flight attendant stated that there was a malfunction with the plane and we had to be tugged in and the A/C was going to turn off. Mind that Houston is over 90 degrees and very humid. And the only thing the airline did was give us glasses of water.

### "This madness has to stop"
This morning I put my 15 year old minor son on a flight to Orlando. It was supposed to reach Orlando at 1240pm - it is now 845pm and they diverted his flight to Miami because of bad weather. Meanwhile me or his mother hasn't gotten a text email or phone call about the this travesty. So now he's been in the Miami airport for hours tired and hungry while other airlines have taken flight with no issues. Just think of your newly 15 year old stuck in a city where he knows no one, how does that make you feel. This is absurd. Now my son's mother either has to drive 4 hours from Orlando to get him or put him on another flight. I can't imagine the other people that are there with him and their frustration. This madness has to stop. I have already sent an email to frontier and BBB over this incident.

### "Never flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Flight got delayed when I was flying to DR for an hour, and then on the way back it got advanced by 30 minutes. Barely made it onto my flight and they never called my name. After the flight back to Miami, we got all the way to baggage claim and had to wait about 3 hours because Frontier lost everyone's bags and doesn't know where they are. The rep said that the airlines "misplaced" the bags and they had to be flown back. Imagine branding your airline company as being really good with traveling experiences, and losing the bags, making everyone wait two hours get it back. Never flying with them again and I'm gonna make sure people know not to fly with them either.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Frontier is by far the worst airline and doesn't deserve a place in the sky! Management should hurry up and sell this company to another firm who will actually take this airline, and indirectly, people's lives serious. I was set to head back home when I got an email stating that my flight has been canceled. The issue is that Frontier does nothing to accommodate canceled flights and expects flyers to just be ok with this. We the people need to boycott this type of behavior, as we all are experiencing the same thing but we continue to patronize the airline. I will never fly Frontier again in my life. You all should be ashamed (which I know you all could give two nuts) at how you all are running your operation.

### "extremely horrible"
Not Verified | Thieves! Double charged me for my seats during the transaction for a payment for my carryon. I was supposed to get charged $79 but was charged $129; staff member advised me to take it up with corporate. I Felt like I was just robbed. I will never fly with them again extremely horrible.

### "No customer service reps"
Not Verified | I'm never flying this airline, ever again. I'd pay $150 more per ticket to get better service and convenience. They charged me $200 for my son's carry on bag? $100 to get it from AUS to DEN then another $100 to get it from DEN to MKE. That's $50 more than the price of his ticket. No customer service reps to speak too. Seat was hard, small, uncomfortable. Screw this company. NEVER again.

### "no person to speak too"
Not Verified | I of course had to book my ticket online, it kept charging me for a checked bag as well as a carry on, I tried several times to remove the bags. I was charged an additional $50.00 for checked baggage which I did not want or need. I could not go any further without paying for the unwanted bags. Of course there is no person to speak too. When I finally was able to chat I was informed that they could not refund the bags and that I needed to inform them at the airport. This is not truthful, they will give you a website that you never hear anything from. I have been flying frontier for 7 years almost 8, this it. When their flights aren't full they charge you for your personal item. I have had the same bag that I have used forever, when the flights aren't full I am charged for the bag. Frontier should truly be ashamed of their selves treating loyal customers this way. Customer Service has gone straight out the window.

### "not cheap and a complete headache"
Not Verified | Even when the initial price made this look as a good option, at the end it was not cheap and it was a complete headache. When searching for a flight I found the prices posted as very attractive, later on I found that this airline charges extra for everything. If you want assistance at the check-in counter (not automated) you have to pay extra, they charge for a carry-on, meaning everything you might have in your hands have to pay extra, if you check-in your luggage, you will have to pay and then suffer the terrible customer service at the counter. The lines are so slow that it almost made me lose my flight. They charge if you want to select a seat, they charge for water, nothing is free here and at the end the cost of the flight was very similar as Delta. Don’t be fooled, this airline is not the deal you think you are going to get. On the other hand, where are the rights of the consumers?

### "first and will be the last flight"
Not Verified | My first and will be the last flight with them. Going back to Chicago is a nightmare with this airlines. Our flight was delayed for 4x then cancelled for the next day. We’re in the airport from 12 noon until 10 pm and just imagine we have 3 kids with us and no any supervisor or no contact so we can asked what’s really the problem. They just gave a 15$ voucher and when they gave the fast food near to close and when they confirmed that the flight was cancelled for tomorrow they didn’t gave us a free hotel accommodation and we even spent 200$ for the hotel room. They don’t even care about their passengers. It’s the worst worst worst airlines and I’m telling you all the passengers will not recommend this airlines and that will be our first and last flight with them. Kids got sick and me actually is sick due to stress, fatigue and so so tired. Not Frontier again. You are worst.

### "simply cannot be trusted"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Frontier Airlines, and let me tell you, it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. The pinnacle of their incompetence came in the form of a tardy email, attempting to apologize for their abysmal service. Frontier Airlines' late apology email is merely a feeble attempt to pacify disgruntled customers who have suffered through their abysmal service. Their claim to strive for the "best travel experience possible" is nothing short of a hollow marketing slogan. If you value your time, money, and sanity, I strongly recommend avoiding Frontier Airlines at all costs and strongly advise against choosing Frontier Airlines. Their empty promises, lengthy refund timelines, and overall incompetence make them an airline that simply cannot be trusted.

### "has been a disaster"
On 10 Jul 2023 on my return trip (Flt 96 SDQ-SJU) from a weekend family wedding at Dom Republic my checked luggage was mysteriously lost after it being personally check in at the counter and received by a Frontier agent at SDQ. The checked suitcase was checked under one of my in-laws who was part of our traveling party assisting a family wedding at SDQ. The party consisted of 3. All of our wedding and dressing attires were in this bag. Most items hold a high sentimental value aside from the incur cost of the items purchased to assist our family event. To this date we have not received any news after a file claim as to the whereabouts of our belongings or status of the same. Our stay in San Juan, Puerto Rico has been a disaster because of this Airline’s irresponsibility of managing personal property and keeping passengers informed of the process. No one else's personal property(ies) were lost except ours. This was a full one legged flight from SDQ to SJU. We are currently staying at La Concha Hotel in San Juan, PR with a return date back home to Florida, USA on July 15. We still have no news or information regarding our bag to this date.

### "airline has no customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible. This airline has no customer service. They got rid of their phone number. Everything is automatic thru a website. So the flight was several hours late. I missed my connection. No refund was issued. Then the return had to be changed. I was charged both a charge fee for 99 dollars and a cancellation fee for 99 dollars. They double dipped and would not refund even one of the fees. I would have been ok with either a change fee or a cancellation fee but not both. So then I bought a whole new ticket so I actually paid them 3 times for the flight. In summary, an original 112 dollar ticket became over a 400 dollar ticket. It would have been cheaper to just use a reputable airline like American. On top of all that they stuck me in the middle seat. Now once again I tried booking a new flight with them and they cancelled the 9 pm flight and offered me a 6 am flight. That did not work with my schedule. They also cancelled the return. So this airline advertises routes and schedules but when they do not meet their passenger quota, they just cancel the flights to stay profitable. The hell with the actual people who fly them. Never ever again. Spirit has better customer service than Frontier and that is really saying something.

### "horrible plane ride"
First time traveling frontier. Horrible, plane schedule was changes twice. Nowhere to call and check. No customer service. The seats are so uncomfortable. Frontier does not give free drink and has NO Wi-Fi very uncomfortable seats. You cannot sit with your partner - horrible, horrible plane ride. I will not fly this airline again, and I will not recommend it to anyone again.

### "We will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  My family had pre-purchased tickets departing West Palm Beach Sunday, July 9th at 8:46PM. As we were arriving at the airport at about 6:00 we received word that our flight was cancelled. We were told that we could not get another flight out of W. Palm Beach until Thursday, 7/13. We were handed a card that we could use to process a refund. The person at the ticket counter was working alone, and, since her terminal was not working was unable to help us other than to tell us we would have to find another flight ourselves. She phoned a superior several times asking for someone to come help her with the long line of angry customers that had, by now formed behind us. No one showed up. We eventually went on-line with our cell phones and determined that there was a flight leaving from Orlando Tuesday 7/11 and we booked flights. That meant we had to rent two cars, drive to Orlando, and then rent two hotel rooms for two nights. The flight that we booked leaving Orlando at 10:30AM was delayed multiple times, the last time because they needed to get a refreshed crew member to the airport, did not leave until after 11:00 PM Tuesday night. We will never fly Frontier again and we are now on a mission to let everyone else know that Frontier's customer service goals are to provide as little service to as few people as possible.

### "I will never fly frontier again"
This is the worst airline ever! The people at the counter were rude, if I remember correctly, most airlines have a 50 pound weight limit on a checked in bag, frontier is 40 pounds and if it’s 1 pound overweight it’s an extra $75. The guy at the counter said “OK well I will take your bag off of your hands for $155”. Tickets might be a little cheaper on this airline but trust me they get you in the end. If you want to choose your seat, it’s anywhere from $40-$65, if not, they assign a seat for you randomly. We had a 6:00 AM flight and TSA did not open up until five it took over an hour to get through security, which is not the airlines fault, but then we had to run for the plane and barely made it on. If you don’t check in at least 24 hours before the flight online, they will not check you in. There was a gentleman at the counter next to us that had the same flight as us but he did not check online and they bumped him to the next flight , that’s horrible! We did a lot of traveling this summer, and flew several major airlines, and had no issues with any of them. I will never fly frontier again, you won’t save any money, it will end up costing you more in the long run for horrible service!

### "never fly Frontier Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Cancelled with No Explanation. Flight 2936 leaving San diego june 28 Wednesday, Arriving in Phoenix June 29 Thursday. First it was delayed once for approximately 45 minutes then received another email it was being delayed for another 35 minutes! Then after waiting for an extra 2 hours, Intercom came on And Said Flight 2936 was Canceled. Head downstairs to rebook. But they forgot to Mention the next Available Flight to Phoenix was 2 days later On Saturday July 1st. Had to rent a car & get Hotel room that night $600.00 later. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Absolutely terrible. This was my first time flying and ruined our vacation. The first flight was delayed many times then cancelled. Then the next it was delayed twice we finally got on and after an hour of flying had to turn around. Then we waited another three hours to find out it was cancelled. It then took another four hours to get our bags. Absolutely terrible experience. Will never fly again with them.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  I booked this flight a month ago to see my brother on military leave. They delayed 4 times. Then canceled the flight. They provided no other options and gave us a 100 dollar voucher. Flights to Buffalo are $1000 at this time. It's meaningless and I'll never fly with Frontier again.

### "I would never fly Frontier again"
I would never fly Frontier again. My flight was delayed. My connecting flight was canceled. They lost my bag it’s not worth even if it was free. I had to pay $500 to American Airlines get me home. I drove back in Hartford looking for my bags no one has a clue stay away from frontier.

### "customer service was very unprofessional"
Not Verified | Yesterday my flight was cancelled from Orlando to Indianapolis 2 hours before flight time and the best they could do is give us a flight for the next day at 6pm with no food vouchers or hotel accommodations and the customer service was very unprofessional

### "pay them $99 for the carry on"
Beyond disgusted with the staff at Frontier. My family and I will never be flying this airline again. The staff for Flight 66 to Punta Cana from Miami was rude to everyone. They stopped me and said my bag was too big to be a personal item and I explained that the lady when I checked in said the bag was good. They separated me from my family and told me that my family will go to Punta Cana without if I don’t pay them $99 for the carry on. I kept saying that the lady when I checked in said it was good. The agent felt it was necessary to mention my family going without me again. Frontier Airlines is nothing but a scam airline with horrible customer service.

### "paying for carry-ons is insane"
Not Verified |  Genuinely couldn't be more disappointed. This flight was almost the equivalent of Murphys Law in travel forms. What was supposed to be a 1 hour flight took twice as long because we were on the tarmac so long. Also, paying for carry-ons is insane.

### "the 24 hour window had passed"
The system was down when I was trying to cancel it within the 24 hour window. By the time I was actually able to cancel it, the 24 hour window had passed, so I wasn't refunded. Who can I speak to about this. This was not my fault. Even an agent from Orbitz was trying to cancel it but the Frontier online system was down. This is not fair at all. I have the call log and everything. I did everything correctly on my end, therefore I don't think it's fair that I have to give up $93.98 for something that is not my fault. Orbitz said that Frontier has to be contacted about it and they cannot do anything on their end. I contacted Frontier and they canceled the flight but accessed an undeserved penalty which cost more than the flight itself.

### "Cannot tell you how disappointed we are"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever! I bought tickets for two and 10 minutes after I made the purchase, I got an email about it changing. These emails kept coming over the next 3-4 weeks to a point it changed 6 times. I tried contacting them but got their very poor chat system as you cannot talk to anyone (FYI, they said they went to that system to improve their customer service). Finally after several hours I contacted someone via chat and asked why it changed as their website says that flight was still available, got no help. It got so bad with changes and cancellations that I had to go to another airline to book one way tickets to get to our destination and had to pay out of my pocket. Now we fly back tomorrow and went in to check bags and it is going to cost right at $200 to check our bags (3 total). This by far, without a doubt, is the worst experience we have ever had. Our flight back was supposed to get us back home at 1pm and now because of all the changes, we are not getting home till 11pm (as of now). They are making us layover for 8.5 hours at another airport enroute home. Cannot tell you how disappointed we are. Their initial prices may seem good, but believe us, they will get it back from you. We will never fly Frontier again, do not let low prices fool you.

### "Booking with frontier is a gamble"
Booked flight with Frontier 3+ weeks prior. Checked in 10 hrs before take off. Received notice flight was hour and half delayed. 3 hours before boarding received notice flight was canceled. Went thru all options, no offer to assist with another flight, no phone number to get a Re-booking, website routing just kept popping up with “do you want a credit or a refund”. Tried for hours, only could reach robots with standard response like “go to manage flights”! Can’t manage a canceled flight! Kept trying every avenue. Finally, 6 hours later, after booking a flight that cost 6 times more than my frontier flight I asked to write a complaint! I got a “chat agent” that gave human responses which were “Sorry we had to cancel flight we do this to ensure passengers safety” “Sadly, I do not see where you contacted us”. When I asked for help getting home, rep offered me a flight 3 days from my original date at twice the money… Word to the wise. If you can afford another airline, take it. If you have to fly frontier, take snacks and water, they won’t give you anything and may strand you and they will not help you to your booked destination. By the time they cancel, you could have booked first class tickets on a dependable, customer friendly and professional airline. As I told frontier, I may be slow but I’m not stupid. Booking with frontier is a gamble but you will eventually loose!

### "the most deceiving airline"
This is the most deceiving airline I have ever flown with. They over charge for everything, from carry ons, to sit with the people you booked with, to water, to trying to check in before even pre board, I was charged $340 for 2 carry ons and to sit by my mom and son after I booked the tickets. The staff are completely unprofessional and rude. They took my moms Cain and put it above her and no other airline has done this to us. They had us waiting while they literally dragged garbage out in front of all us. Very unsanitary and gross. Don’t they have CDC guidelines to follow for sanitation? Never take this airlines.

### "no one trust this so-called airline"
Not Verified | Frontier is nothing more than a fraudulent corporation. My 6/24 flight was cancelled after checking in bags. Thee was no explanation but it was not due to inclement weather. In an attempt to economize an upcoming flight for a job interview, I booked again with Frontier. It was suggested I not take the chance and rebook with a more eligible airline. I was charged a cancellation fee and the ENTIRE value of the ticket with less than 25% available to book for a future flight. If this isn't a fraudulent money-grab, I don't know what to call it. I will suggest that no one trust this so-called airline.

### "Our flight keeps getting delayed"
Our flight keeps getting delayed and all Frontier wants to say they can do is refund me my money (which won’t come back instantly) or we can switch our flight to a later flight. Our flight has been delayed twice already and it’s not even raining where we are not where we are going. This is ridiculous and they just come up with excuses how they it’s not their fault.

### "Never using them again"
Worst experience ever! They canceled my flight, the email with options was an error page. The next flight they could put me on was over a day later. Never using them again.

### "most expensive flight you ever take"
This will be the most expensive flight you ever take! They will cancel your flight mid way. Then delay and cancel again. Paid $600 to get my wife home on another airline to not miss work. I am on multiple days of trying to get home and I am posting this while standing in the customer "service" line for the 3rd time. I am about to rent a car to drive if I can't get a flight. Please it's not worth it.

### "hope to never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Flight was canceled. They left us sitting there till time when we should have been taking off. When tried to get information about what was going on the staff was very rude. Not offered a flight till the next night. No hotel vouchers given. Had to rent a car to get home for work which cost 400$ and driving most the night. Most of the staff were quite young and very belittling and demanding over the intercom and while being helped in line to try to get a refund. I hope to never use this airline again, it cannot be trusted.

### "Absolutely the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline. First overbooked the flight, then cancelled the flight when boarding was to begin. Customer service is a joke, refused to reimburse for hotel or vehicle rental, refused to compensate for lost wages as we lost a day of work due to their cancellation. Basically said too bad here’s your refund plus a $50 voucher to fly on our airline again. I’ll walk before I fly Frontier again

### "this person should be acknowledged"
Not Verified |  This review is strictly for an employee that my family feels deserves the recognition. MCO was chaotic and overwhelming. The kiosk machines were not working, other Frontier employees were dismissive. Aziza kindly and without reservation offered to assist us. She walked us through everything we needed Ana made us feel settled. It's been quite some time since we've traveled and we are tremendously thankful to have encountered such a wonderful, helpful person. I can't say much about the rest of our Frontier experience, but felt this person should be acknowledged for doing exactly what travelers expect... for being there with a smile. Thank you Aziza!

### "so lousy and deceitful"
Never ever fly with Frontier, it's an absolute disaster!!! My itinerary is from LAS to MSY with a layover in Denver. After boarding the flight in Denver to MSY (F9 478 on 06/30/2023), we were informed the flight has been cancelled; literally after boarding the flight. Didn't give us any reasons on why the flight is cancelled. After waiting in line for more than 2 hours, finally got a chance to speak to the agent at the customer desk. She was the only one who was dealing with all the passengers. She was miserable, and didn't care what the passengers were going through. I was told by her that there is no alternative to get to destination for the next 48 hours. I even requested her whether I could get a flight back to LAS, to which she denied. When asked for other options, I was told I could cancel the itinerary for full refund, and that too I have to claim for it online. Given no choice, I left the desk, filed for refund, and booked a different airline at that last minute for a whopping price to reach the destination. Later I came to know that only a partial refund was issued on my itinerary, I got flabbergasted looking at the email. I filed a complaint with the customer service on the deception. They got back to me saying since the first leg was flown, only a partial refund could be issued, and apologized for the deception with a $50 voucher for future flight travel with Frontier. Who want their credit because I would never ever in my life would choose Frontier again. Also, I will never recommend anyone to chose this airlines. This was my first and will be my last flight experience with Frontier. The airlines and their customer service is so lousy and deceitful, so please never chose this airlines for your travel, if you have a choice.

### "notified that our flight had been cancelled"
Not Verified |  My husband, our children and I flew from Sarasota to Philadelphia. When we got to Philadelphia for our return flight home, we were trying to do self check in and were notified that our flight had been cancelled and that we could either choose a different flight or a refund, but no other assistance was given - the guy just walked away. As we tried to decide what would be best to do, we chose a refund, and tried to book a later flight. Of course they wanted more money, so we went to the counter to see if they could get us on that flight for the same price of the original cancelled flight, and they kept saying “there’s nothing we can do.” This company nickels and dimes for everything, all the way down to charging for customer service, which was none existent anyway. This was our first and last flight with Frontier, and I will make sure that I tell everyone I come in contact with not to fly with them.

### "They won't even pay for a hotel"
Not Verified |  Love them canceling my flight and only giving a refund in return. They won't even pay for a hotel for making me wait over a day and a half to get the next flight. Plus they charge as much money to add a carry on bag as the plane tickets. Luckily I only had to wait a short 12 hours at the airport to catch another flight with a different airline.

### "This airline takes all joy from flying"
This airline takes all joy from flying. Not a bargain airline. My Orlando to Detroit trip was an hour late departing. Checking flight status app, that flight is always late departing. The gotcha fees are brutal. Show up with a heavy bag - there goes a quick $100.00. For 12lbs! Buy a decent seat $84.00. Expect to get bumped. I did - their offer was to fly me to San Francisco where I would spend the night and fly to Detroit the next day. Sounds like fun but I would arrive in San Fran at 3 in the morning with no accommodation. I had to buy from another airline. Frontier sent me a voucher for $150.00. To fly this airline again? My masochism has limits.

### "such poor customer service"
The worst airline service that I have never flown on. Their hidden fees are ridiculous. We were charged 104 per bag whether we chose to carry the bag on or check the bag. We still had to pay 104 dollars per bag. So we elected to check our bags and our children’s car seats. I was irritated that I was charged 104 per bag but at this point we had no option as it was approaching boarding time. Then we were in line to board our flight (no announcements made at any point that boarding had begun) boarding tickets in hand, when the woman in front of us for whatever reason boarding ticket wouldn’t scan. The woman working for Frontier and scanning boarding tickets then proceeds to close the door to the ramp to board the plane. She then proceeds to tell the woman in front of us and us that we would not be allowed on the plane because we did not arrive prior to their 15 minute boarding warning. Mind you we were in line with everyone else and the door to the ramp was still open. We had zero control over how quick or slow the line moved. She then tells us that the plane is full and our seats are no longer available. That we would need to rebook. I have called their “supposed” customer service line which doesn’t even connect you to a Frontier agent. They have an option to file a complaint online, which I did, and I received an automated response that it could be up to 7 days before I receive a response. The staff were extremely rude. They did not care that I had a 3, 6, and 12 year old with me. That we had no luggage or car seats. They dismissed us like we were trash and they could have cared less. Never in my life have I ever experienced such poor customer service and overall service in general. I will never fly Frontier or recommend them to anyone. We ended up having to rent a car and drive almost 10 hours home. We purchased 5 airline tickets and never flew, paid 312 dollars in luggage fees, and 300 plus for the rental car and car seat rentals.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
Everything about this experience was awful. Hidden fees were only disclosed after the tickets had been paid for. The flight was cancelled, resulting in a 5-hour wait for checked-in bags. Furthermore, the second flight was delayed for an additional 3 hours. The staff seemed miserable, and the aircraft itself was in poor condition. I would not recommend this airline under any circumstances.

### "Trust me you will regret it"
Cheap is going to be expensive! Trust me you will regret it. Our whole trip was a mess. We booked a flight to Denver ticket for 3 and couldn’t believe the price . Reached airport on time and received an email, they cancelled the flight. Says they refunds $100 And our trip to Colorado was cancelled making us loose tons of money on Airbnb we booked for 3 days / no refund 4 Activities that we have prebooked only half refund. And it’s not like we can even bargain with them, like it’s not going to go anywhere. Hopefully everyone learns the lesson and never books with them.

### "had been a total of 4 delays"
Horrible from the time I booked the returning flight had been delayed & rerouted I’m sitting in the airport right now it’s been over 7 hours I have 4 young children who don’t understand what’s going on &amp. I also have a job I need to attend or I’ll be forced to call off there had been a total of 4 delays just sitting here waiting to get back home. This is beyond ridiculous. I will never book with them nor recommend. I guess you get what you pay for!

### "nickel and dime you for everything"
This was a flight that my daughter chose because their prices were so cheap, but we quickly found that there was a catch. First off, they nickel and dime you for everything from your carry on, your purse, all the way to a cup of water. The plastic chairs have zero comfort. The staff are rude and really don’t care what you want or need. I sat In an aisle seat and the employee continued to walk by me hitting me and never once apologized. It was a 5 hour flight and it was just horrible, the flight, the energy, and the people. Never again, I will stay with Alaska and Delta from now on. Even though their tickets are slightly more, at least they welcome me with a drink I don't have to pay for and I’ll never pay to carry my purse with me.

### "Worst airline"
Not Verified |  Worst airline. Flight got cancelled and no alternate options. Will not reimburse for the expenses incurred like another airline tickets, hotel rooms, meals etc. every time there is horrible delays and cancellations. No customer service number or options to connect.

### "good at driving your blood pressure high"
Not Verified |  Frontier Gate Staff at some airports, especially Philadelphia and Dallas will make you feel like you're a charity case and they are so rude and arrogant. The are very good at driving your blood pressure high. Their new chat bot based customer service is terrible because it keeps populating and prompting same set of Q&As. You can see that someone manually entered these Q&As to prompt and answer, so you're basically stuck with that and getting a person on the phone is very difficult. They switch their Gates and sometimes at the last minute and there will be no notification to your email or phone. If you miss the announcement or happen to be in the restroom then you basically miss the flight waiting at the wrong gate. Go Wild Pass Review: I was not able to book a single flight to Miami, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Denver and to other major destinations from NYC(LGA) during this summer season using Go Wild Pass . So, my only options are either Philadelphia or Islip, NY. Philly is 100 miles from where I live and Islip, NY is 60 miles and both options are costly and time consuming. If someone from NYC thinking to buy Go Wild Pass then be aware that during the high season your chances are zero that you'll be able to use the pass from NYC (LGA).

### "the airline is unaccommodating"
Not Verified |  Flight departure from Tampa 0700 to Montego Bay. Arrival to airport 0430 get in a line of approximately 200 people for a mandatory check in at the Frontier counter. Line moves very slow with one agent doing the check ins. At approximately 0630 agent announces, “no more ticket will be printed for flight to Montego Bay because plane is at the gate. I have an alternative option, you guys can go over to Orlando because frontier has a flight heading out to Montego Bay @1600 there.” So approximately 70 passengers were left to make the decision to make their way to Orlando in order to make their trips to Montego Bay. Once arriving to Orlando flight scheduled to leave at 1500 then gets delayed to 1700 with a gate change. There was no remorse, apologies nor accommodation made on behalf of Frontier for any of the inconveniences they caused. No other airline had this long check in line. No other airline had these check in inconveniences. We didn’t have the usual option of a pre check in online. Frontier caused a great deal of inconvenience and a day of vacation activity with not even an apology. The employees are rude, the airline is unaccommodating and I wouldn’t advise anyone to book with them!

### "flight went surprisingly well"
This flight went surprisingly well. I was expecting a typical budget airline experience, filled with negatives to occur. The flight left within 15 minutes of departure, which is considered on time in the industry. We arrived on time in CLE. Contrary to recent news reports, the gate agents were not enforcing bag size/weight check at the gate when my mom and I were boarding the plane. Frontier got new seats and these a lot comfier and better than the old seats, now with a better sized tray table! It’s nice to have a direct flight to CLE from SAN for us. Far better and calmer experience than LAX. It was a great July 4 experience! Great deal too, the airfare itself excluding extras was $59, though those did add up quickly, but we know that when choosing an ULCC. Ex: Carry on was $65, seats $28/per person. Beware though , they charge $1 more for the middle seat! Why? Also not all planes have the new seating yet, but hopefully it’s coming soon. That’s why it’s not 10/10.

### "never been treated so poorly"
After being delayed almost 2 hours, they would only let my wife and infant on the plane early, so I had to wait till zone 4. People at the desk were extremely rude, and told me my carry on was too big, so at the last second I had to get out of line and pay $105 to check on a bag that was slightly too big and still fit under the seat. Funny thing is the “bag checker” was only looking for half the time so lots of customers went through without having to pay. I’ve never been treated so poorly. Frontier just lost a customer for life and hopefully many more due to this review.

### "Overcharge for everything"
Overcharge for everything. Start with seat choices. Pick a seat, pay a premium. Almost doesn't matter where they are. They all seem to have a premium. 1st upgrade for an alleged discount airline carrier. Baggage, no free ride here. Spin the wheel and guess how much extra you'll spend at the individual airports. So in addition to paying extra for baggage. You can expect random charges depending on your departure country. We had 2 bags. Charged $75 leaving Philadelphia charged $150 leaving Punta Cana. Seats are so uncomfortable, no leg room. Airline attendees have an entitlement issue like they're doing you a favor. I could go on and on! I can tell which airline I'll never go on again. Back to American, Delta, Southwest...anyone but this company.

### "they don't care about passengers"
Not Verified |  This airline is really bad. The made me waiting a couples hours to finally announce that our flight were cancelled, the send to hotel terrible on Cancun with out a/c. The transportation pick up at 5.30 arrived to the airport, flight delayed again, waiting for pilots and staff, finally get in on the airplane they told us they have problems with plane. Arrived to Miami, bags not found, no information? They forget our bags on Cancun, finally around 3 hours walking on the aropuerto 1 person from the airline explain what happed. They given us by one by one our bag. Don't ever trust with those people, they don't care about passengers or child.

### "an awful experience"
I will never fly with this airline again and I highly recommend you don’t either. Although it may seem like a cheap option there are ridiculous hidden fees, one of which was 80 dollars per person for assistance. There was zero communication as the employees either yelled on your face or blatantly disregarded you as they roll their eyes. They are also extremely unhelpful with god awful attitudes. We waited 30 minutes in one line to which they told us we were in domestic and needed to be in international, so we moved to another line which we waited in for an hour as chaos ensued. There were no lines because everybody was confused, extremely slow, and instead of checking us in yelled at us, to which they then shut the entire station down causing multiple people to miss their flights and offering no substitutes. We later found out that the line we were initially in was for both domestic and international so had we stayed there we wouldn’t have missed our flight. Extremely misguided, rude, disorganized and overall an awful experience.

### "Lack of consistency"
Not Verified | Lack of consistency with bag requirements. I was cleared on the way to Denver, and then had to pay $99 as I was leaving Denver along with several others. Apparently it's $36 cheaper on the app, but you can't pay through the app after checking in. It's completely unfair to be so inconsistent and have such a cost difference.

### "so many hidden fees"
Worst airline ever with so many hidden fees! They charge $75 per bag if your bag is over. I needed to change my flight to another day and they were trying to charge me $916 to fly back, this was 300% more than what I originally paid for my flights. I will never fly Frontier again and I will tell all my friends and family to never fly Frontier!

### "The worst airline of all"
Not Verified |  The worst airline of all. Please do not waste your money to book with Frontier Airlines. Although it may seem like a cheap offer, it really is not. The customer service is lousy, they charge for everything it's a horrible experience. On June 30 we had booked a flight to Punta Cana from the Miami airport, and from the counter to check luggage and documents the service was bad, we spent about an hour and a half in that process where there was a huge line of passengers and only 3 members of the airline attending. The flight was delayed, when we got on the plane we were already 40 minutes late. Inside the plane we waited for about an hour or maybe more, and they gave us many excuses as to why the plane was not taking off until finally they told us that we had to get off because it had a damaged engine, after waiting two more hours in the waiting room they canceled the flight without offering more alternatives, most of the passengers had reserved hotels in Punta Cana that they lost because of Frontier, others came from other states or cities in Florida. Even when some passengers complained, Frontier members were upset as if they had been affected. The worst experience. Please don't throw away or waste your money. Do not use Frontier Airlines.

### "don't throw last minute charges"
Not Verified |  I flew on three separate Frontier flights in the space of one week with no food, water, entertainment, it reclining seats before they decided to charge me $40 extra to check my carry on because it was "too big" on my very last flight. It might be low blood sugar and travel fatigue, but I have never been more angry at an airline ever in my life. I get that you get what you pay for, but please be consistent and don't throw last minute charges at the very last leg of the journey.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Absolutely horrible! Never ever again. The flight was delayed going and coming back, the staff was rude. We had to pay an additional $100 on top of paying for bags. I paid for 20 tickets for me and my family flying in between two states to Orlando and they were extremely unaccommodating. They are literally one of the worst airlines you can do business with.

### "such kind of trouble in our backpack"
Not Verified |  First things the onboarding person was very Rude. I cannot imagine how one can be resist when they are already facing that. We never face such kind of trouble in our backpack when we took this personal bag everywhere even with frontier before. I understand there are certain rules and we respect that but there is a way to handle the situation. My wife and I were trying to pack things properly so we can fit the bag in given space but the lady was so rude that did not even give chance to wait for my partner when my checking was over. She also threatened my wife to unboard her from flight when she was just trying to ask her something. I am very disappointed with this kind of behavior and threatening behavior.

### "misleading and deceptive practice"
Frontier is not and will never be my go to airline, but I went to them because I recently purchased their Summer Go Wild Pass that I have only been able to use once. The pass allows you to fly for about $15 each way but you are only allowed a personal item (which is about the size of a kids backpack and you cant choose your seat.) anything else will cost extra. Apparently they made changes to their website to now almost no flights are available for anyone using the Go Wild Pass but the seats are available if I were purchasing a regular ticket. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration with the Frontier Summer Go Wild pass, which I recently purchased in good faith. It is with the utmost disappointment that I bring to your attention the sheer unavailability of flights for the utilization with this pass, rendering it effectively worthless. This has not only wasted my time and money but also tarnished my perception of Frontier Airlines as a reliable and customer oriented airline. Despite the enticing proposition of enjoying flights for a mere $0.01 each, I have found that almost every flight that I attempt to book using the Go Wild pass is inexplicably marked as "not available. This flagrant lack of availability stands in stark contrast to the same flights being readily accessible for regular purchase. The fact that the flights I am interested in are supposedly accessible under normal circumstances only deepens my exasperation. Let me emphasize the tremendous inconvenience and emotional distress caused by this egregious issue. As a customer, I places my trust in Frontier Airlines when I opted to purchase the Go Wild Pass, expecting a fair opportunity to utilize the benefits promised. Regrettably, my experience thus far has been nothing short of an elaborate hoax, leaving me with a sense of betrayal and frustration. Frontier Airlines must be held accountable for this misleading and deceptive practice, which is an affront to customers who believed in the value of the Go Wild Pass.

### "Exceeded my expectations"
Exceeded my expectations. I’m not sure what all the complaints are about. I enjoyed the flight as much as I could. I did Pay extra for more leg room.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. We arrived at MIA 2 hours early already checked in for the flight and got in line to check in our bag. The line was very long, but they were understaffed, not organizing customers by priority, and asleep at the wheel, we waited for 1 hour and they say last call for Denver, 15 people raise their hands and they do nothing. They don't start a separate line to get these people through the bag check so they can get through security and get to the gate. They were already boarding and we are stuck in the Frontier line with the supervisor in the back and the counter under staffed. People were saying they needed to check their bags or they would miss their flight, having been in line for a crazy amount of time. Frontier did nothing about it. We and 6 other people arrive at the gate rushing like crazy 12mins before take off and they had closed the boarding. Next we wait another 30 mins to speak to a supervisor who hands us a Get a Refund card of which we are not eligible for because they say it was our fault we "missed the flight". Infuriating. It was Frontiers fault!! The only compensation they offered was a next day flight for $99 each travel time 10 hours, for a 4 hour fight. Ridiculous! We had to get home. The person at the counter was very rude and spoke so fast you could not understand her. We couldn't get any live person on the phone. So we are out $800 for two flights that we never boarded. Had to go to Southwest to get home. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "horrible customer service"
I had a late flight leaving Detroit at 10:47 PM on Monday and getting back to Atlanta at 12:00 AM on Tuesday. The flight was pushed back twice and finally cancelled at the last minute. What made it so bad was that all flights were booked up until Wednesday night at 10:47. This would have left me stranded in Detroit for almost two more days. I decided that the best option would have been to get a rental car and drive to Atlanta and drop the car at the airport so I could arrive in Atlanta around noon time. That cost me 170.00 plus 86.00 in gas. That's around 250.00 plus in addition to the inconvenience of driving. All Frontier offered was a $100 flight voucher that you could only use on their airline! No hotel option. No help with travel expenses. Nothing! Lots of people have been complaining about Frontier lately. If they don't become more customer friendly, they will be out of business soon. They can't just offer cheap prices and then offer horrible customer service. Soon, people will turn to other options.

### "not worth the cheap ticket"
On June 26, 2023, my flight to Trenton NJ, via Raleigh Durham, was cancelled. No explanation was given, but we found out later it was due to severe thunder storms. This can't be helped. We were told at the gate to go back to the ticket counter to re-book or cancel. I went to ticketing and asked a Frontier agent where I needed to be for re-booking. Her response was "Over there". She didn't indicate where 'over there' was, so I asked again. Same response. I said, "Do you mean behind this woman (who was in line)? , and she said "No. Over there where the person in green is standing". So I moved over to the end of the line. One by one we were moved to another line for rebooking and after about 30 minutes, I, too, was moved. I stood there for another 20-30 minutes when a Frontier employee walked over to us and informed us that if we were to re-book, we needed to be in the original line, the one we'd all just left. I tried to ask him if we were expected to go to the end of the line, but he interrupted me and said he would answer question once we all moved. I tried again. Same thing. Another passenger tried for clarification, and again, the very rude response. And once again, someone tried to ask, and once again, he interrupted before the gentleman had a chance to get his question out. I finally said that I was not going to the end of the line because I'd already been there once, and he then told me, "Then you won't be re-booked". Not one of us was angry or rude or disrespectful. We were appalled at his behavior toward us but no one was complaining about the cancelled flight or the long line. Some folks had been there for two days. Of the dozen or so standing around me, we all commented to one another that we would never fly Frontier again. After moving over to 'the other' line, I went back to the Frontier employee and asked his name. He interrupted again, saying he'd answer questions when we were all in line. I told him I didn't have a question other than could I please have his name. At that point he looked at me and said, "I don't have to give you my name". That's when I cancelled my ticket. Never, in my 72 years, have I witness such complete and utter disrespect to a group of people, and for no reason. Frontier Airlines deserves the terrible reputation it has. It's run on a bate and switch mentality. Just take a look at it's website. It has absolutely no regard for it's customers. Try finding a phone number where you can actually speak to someone. It's airline employees must hate their jobs, if their 'customer service' is any indication. I'm fully aware that these employees had probably had a couple of tough days, but what about the woman in front of me who had been trying for two days to get back to her kids? There was no respect or regard for her at all. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. They should be ashamed of themselves for the total lack of professionalism they display. I wonder what corners they cut on their aircraft. It's not worth the cheap ticket. Life is too short. Note: This survey requires I rate the on plane experience, which I cannot do since I never made it onto the flight. However, the survey requires an answer, so I gave it a 1 star.

### "Will not use again"
This company nickel and dimes you for everything. Want a paper ticket? There's a fee. Carry-on? Fee. Checked bag? Fee. Sent your party together? Fee. A soda on the flight? Fee So not so budget once you start adding everything up. Flight out was delayed over an hour due to weather, poor communication from the airline. Flight home showed on time, then delayed by a half hour. Then an hour. Then 5 hours. Then flat out canceled. They offered us a $30 rebate for food for 2 people and $100 off a future flight. Zero assistance with canceling, rebooking, or even finding a hotel or anything. Left completely on our own and given a business card with a QR code on it to cancel instead of any sort of customer service. Airport staff was rude and unsympathetic. From talking to other customers this happens frequently. Will not use again.

### "horrible customer service"
This is the worst airline I have ever travel. The customer service is horrible. They change your gate often and don’t announce it causing so many to lose their flights. Also, please make sure to purchase bags online. Otherwise the will try and charge you over $300 for to luggage just for one way. Honestly this airline is worse than Spirit and should be audited and place under investigation. On my last trip I purchased a round trip ticket with them, going to my destination and returning I received the same horrible customer service. I sat & watched many lose their flights and get treated poorly.

### "This is not a budget friendly option"
Not Verified |  This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I will never be flying Frontier again. They seemed like a slightly cheaper option, but they cancelled our flight at 3.45 am right before our flight was supposed to leave. This caused excessive amounts of stress, and we had to book a flight last minute that takes off 12 hours later and cost us nearly 800 dollars extra. Save your money. This is not a budget friendly option if they cancel your flight and force you to purchase a more expensive and less desirable flight last minute.

### "Frontier offered zero solutions"
This airline is complete trash. They wait until the last minute to cancel flights in my case with only a 3 hour notice. I needed this flight to pick up my kids from a trip to their grandparents and had to book a different same day flight with another airline paying nearly $400 for a one way flight. Frontier offered zero solutions or additional flight options and to top it off it will take 7 business days for them to process my refund. Budget airline with budget staff I highly suggest flying elsewhere.

### "use a different airline"
Not Verified | I have to say I have never experienced such a bad airline, I didn't even know they could be like this. DON'T LET THE PRICES DECEIVE YOU. I had thought I got a good airline and was leaving to my flight. I did not read reviews or nothing. I had already arranged my schedule to revolve around the trip as in my work, my kids classes, etc. The flight was a two way to where I got to Denver then get on another plane to reach my destination. I got to the airport and I was suspecting on why there wasn't as many people there, but I didn't think much of it. I got on the plane and we were getting ready for take-off and a lady said "get off the plane your flight was cancelled" I was confused on why others weren't getting off either and she told me it was for my second flight. I asked if they had another plane that was going to go to my second destination and they said no. which was weird because shouldn't there have been a delay? They told us to reschedule 3 days after which meant , waste of 3 days where I could've been working, waste of 3 days where my kids could be going to class, and waste of 3 days off our trip. I scheduled it and got home. I read the reviews and I could not find one with 5. That was another red flag and I was thinking of refunding it instead and taking a better airline I was familiar with. I went to the airport, they weren't there. I called using the airport phone and left a voicemail. They never answered. I emailed them. They said I had to wait 7 DAYS. Which meant my whole trip. I wouldn't even be able to go anymore if I had waited. I thought I was overthinking it and just went to my next flight that I had rescheduled. What a confidence they had cancelled it AGAIN. Not only that but the workers came way to late for assistance at the desk. I talked to the people in line about it and they all has a similar experience. I paid for an uber 4 times (home to airport, airport to home, home to airport, airport to home) which itself was about $95 which I could have just added to the the ticket price and gotten a much better airline and already been at my destination. I just can't stress this enough for others DO NOT LET THE PRICES DECIEVE YOU. To whoever is reading this PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use a different airline. it won't be much more expensive and its way worth it. Please.

### "astronomical for two carry on bags"
Not Verified | Frontier airlines is charging clients for carry on baggage $87 each per destination. I was going to Punta Cana with my husband from Las Vegas with a stop in Denver and after Cleveland and after Punta Cana means I have to make a payment of $348 per carry on baggage. They told me I have to pay the same in my way back home means just for baggage $696. I decided to leave everything in Punta not to be charged at all with this airline. I've never traveled with this airline in my life is the first and last time for sure and is the first experience that I paying astronomical expensive for two carry on bags. They are thieves they steal people. Because we don't have anyone that can protect people who travel they want to charge us whatever they say. You can't see all the fights arguing and complaining people in the lines.

### "Horrible flight and customer service"
Not Verified |  Horrible flight and customer service. I was left stranded at the airport for 16hrs because they delayed my 8pm flight 7 times before canceling it at 1am. They sent us over to the check in counter all in a rush with no explanation and the only thing they could offer me was a flight 4 days later. If I wanted a refund I had to submit that online for review. No help with a hotel, sleeping arrangements, a car, nothing! I had to pay an outrageous amount with another airline to get home and then while waiting for that flight I hear frontier offering another flight $1000 to give up their seats voluntarily yet no help to those stranded. I requested the refund online and got a quarter back. I had to send multiple emails because they have no other means of communication, and finally got a little more returned however it is nothing compared to what I went through or had to spend to get home and no I am not getting any responses what so ever from them!

### "being asked to exit the plane"
My husband and I were wrongfully asked to be escorted from the plane before departure. Before we were even on the plane, but waiting at the airport, we were trying to sit down while we waited. There was a group of 4-5 Frontier flight attendants standing in a group, blocking the only seats that were available for sitting. My husband and I were standing behind them, trying to get by. When they didn’t move, we said “sorry”, trying to get by. The male flight attendant responding in a condescending and very disrespectful way, saying that we have to say excuse me if we want someone to move. We did ask for them to move but they either pretended not to hear or ignored us. Then my husband responding asking if they are going to move or not, all 4-5 of the flight attendants then began to yell at us, saying that we were rude. We walked away, while they continued to yell profanities at us while we left. Once they finally left the area, we went and sat down. They then began to speak loudly to others about us. We did nothing in response. We then boarded the plane and we’re sitting quietly ready for take off. Every single person was on the plane and the overhead compartments were shut. Then, a flight attendant came up to us, asked us of our names, and said that we were being asked to exit the plane. We were given no explanation, we asked for the name of the flight attendant after leaving, and no one told us anything. We were only told that we would be able to fly out on the next flight for no extra charge. There was no problems while we were on the plane, and we were hanged up on and felt attacked by the flight crew. The supervisor said that we could not get a refund and we were given no information on who was on the flight. We were appalled by the lack of customer service and will be vocally sharing our experience.

### "charge me $50 to get an exit row"
I always pay for an exit row and select a seat and pre-pay when I purchase my ticket as I'm almost 7' tall. So I selected an edit row and paid $50 extra. So after check in Frontier assigns me a normal seat. I go to the gate and they charge me $50 to get an exit row. I was double charged. This is after they canceled our 1st flight and gave us 4 hours advance notice and a refund. They advertise $10 fares that turn out to be $200 anyways. No tv. No Wi-Fi. But at least the seat feels like I am sitting on a rock.

### "both times were horrible"
If I could rate them a negative one I would do so. How do we drop our luggage off knowing it was safe and enjoyed our time just for us to have to pay for another flight because we missed our connecting flight due to the aircraft waiting for other airlines. Along with our luggage never making it to our final destination. Frontier does not have a direct phone number to talk with a live person. The numbers that we tried no one answers or return your voicemail. This is the second time we took frontier and both times were horrible. Do not waste your time and money booking with them.

### "how incompetent they are"
Not Verified |  They have no customer service phone number to speak with anyone - all done online. This alone shows how incompetent they are. My teen daughter and I were supposed to leave PR yesterday at 3:30pm. Frontier kept us sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours, saying there was a mechanical issue. Then, they pull us off the plane to change a part. Then, a couple of hours later, they cancelled the flight saying we will get on a different flight out that night. Then, they told us there will be no flight out last night because the pilot is too tired to fly. I had to spend $900 on a hotel room. It was the only place we could find that wasn't booked. They gave NO vouchers saying it was a delay, not a cancelation. Then, they said our flight leaves at 10:40 AM today 6/24. It did not. Now they are saying it leaves at 3:30pm today. The staff kept lying to us, they were rude and incompetent. It's now 24 hours that we will have waited, maybe longer.

### "The savings is not worth it"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. We spent the entire day at the airport. Our original flight was scheduled for 12:21pm. They cancelled our flight and delayed a total of 7 times. We are currently sitting at the airport still waiting to board. the latest delay pushed boarding time to 11:45pm. Airline employees are rude and dismissive. Even announcing to deny boarding if anyone gives them trouble. Not even an apology. They blame people for not having updated email address for update when their own website is horrible and not updated. Currently website says we boarded and left already. And our email is updated. They nickel and dime you. The savings is not worth it. You can’t even talk to someone on phone/chat. Please work on updating your website and retrain your employees on customer service. I would put 0 rating if it was an option.

### "Won't make that mistake again"
We were trying to fly out to a family vacation. Our distance from the airport meant we had to leave by 6:00 AM to make it to the airport on time. at 5:48 AM, we were notified via text message that the flight was cancelled. No, explanation, no apology, no offer to assist in any way. Just a notification that we could claim a refund or travel credit. I still don't know what to tell my two year old that was excited for his first plane ride that we won't be going till later. Of course the time I took off work will go to waste and forget about seeing those non-refundable fees again. Of course the pricing scheme is a joke as always in these budget airlines. Free carry on's? Nope. Bags? 40 lbs max. Modify a trip? Modify your expectations. Thanks Frontier. Won't make that mistake again.

### "this company is scheming people"
Not Verified |  The CEO of Frontier Airlines lies on his commercial promoting the GoWild pass just like guys that scheme people telling you how much you can fly with the gowild pass but in reality you can’t do that often. When I first used it in June since than every place I look to fly is unavailable and I mean everywhere and if there is one showing up there is no return unless you pay big money coming back. 7 family members bought the yearly pass, when we bought it we thought it was going to be a great deal to fly somewhere whenever you have time but that is fake. You look at other websites to purchase tickets to fly to the same destination that you we’re looking at Frontier to fly and sure Frontier pops up with available tickets at their regular price. I made this purchasing mistake but I won’t do it again. I hope some people interested in buying this Gowild pass can take the time and read some of these reviews. The luggage prices are ridiculous high price $75 each way so people beware this company is scheming people in the open publishing their tv commercials.

### "We’re just stranded"
Not Verified | Frontier just notified family of 4 on vacation that our return flight home was just canceled. They keep the seat and bag charges as non refundable and say you’re on your own for finding a flight home. No, let’s rebook, no help getting us on another airline. We’re just stranded. If you see Frontier flight in the future just pretend it doesn’t exist… because in reality it doesn’t.

### "constantly being put on hold"
This was the worst experience of my life. The customer service was ridiculously rude and unhelpful. I was checked in for my flight and my bag was on the plane, after a delay and no updates via the app I was late to boarding. There was still 20-min until take off, they sent me to a customer service desk where no one was working then wouldn’t remove my bag from the plane even after explaining I have extremely necessary medications in my bag. They sent me down to ticketing, they were 0 help. The desk workers were calling for backup the whole time, no one knew what they were doing. Was sent down to baggage, again 0 help and rude attendants. I received no refund and am still trying to locate my bag. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had flying with an airline and I will never use frontier again. Also, I had to update my name on my ticket prior to this flight and their phone customer service was terrible as well. I had to pay $120 to change 1 letter in my name and spent 30 minutes on the phone constantly being put on hold. This airline has no idea what their doing. Every single customer I talked to at the airport has had a terrible experience with frontier. Shut this place down.

### "don’t rely on this airline"
Save yourself the heartbreak and don’t rely on this airline if you’re flying for an important event. We were flying from Houston to Las Vegas with a layover in Florida. After a 4 hour delay in Houston, we arrive in Florida with a 3 hour delay and then finally a cancellation. Upon waiting 4 additional hours in line at the ticketing desk with the other passengers from the other 2 flights going to other destinations that were also canceled, we were told there were no flights to our destination for 48 hours or even back to Houston. To make things worse, there were no hotel or food accommodations offered to us. We are not from Florida. We would have had to sleep in the airport or pay even more money to Uber, stay in a hotel, and then Uber back to the airport. Money saved with this “budget” Airline slowly goes out the window. Finally, to put the icing on the cake, the frontier employees were laughing amongst each other at everyone’s frustration as we waited in line for hours to only receive bad news.

### "need to go work elsewhere"
The representative at IAH is the Nastiest person I’ve ever endured! She was yelling at my husband and I for asking a question. Everything she said was full of attitude and anger as if we knew her or did something to her. I asked about the checked bags because or bag was a little overweight so I wanted to pay for the overage online which was $50 cheaper and she yelled at us for that. I’m just at really confused at the entire situation. If you do not want to be in customer service you need to go work elsewhere.

### "seating was very limited"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed by more than an hour. The crew seemed to be more concerned in finding ways to charge you for something. The seating was very limited, we were packed like sardines. Ground crew was very inattentive and not good at doing their job.

### "this will be the last time I fly this airline"
Yeah, this will be the last time I fly this airline. I guess I should have been a little suspicious of the price of my ticket being so low. There is a $80 charge carry on bag coming and going. Also, the ticket agents at the terminal are a little rude to customers traveling as well. Overall, the price of my ticket went from $112 to $250, which still isn't too bad, but still not the $112 deal I thought I was getting. The plane on the inside is very basic to say the least compared to what AA, Delta, Southwest and international planes that have movies, music, and screen technology on the back of the seats. At the end of the day, I would without a doubt recommend flying with a different airline than Frontier. I think you will get a better experience and more for your money. Now that I know better, I will do better with researching extra or unexpected fees such as a $80 carry on bag that I think is pretty ridiculous.

### "Worst airline I’ve ever been on"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I’ve ever been on. I was charged a carry on fee at the gate. I wanted to purchase it on the app but the agent forced me to pay her instead. This was very unacceptable, once I got on the flight I was sitting in the very back I had the middle seat and the window seat was opened, I figured I would move to give me and the other person room but no I was told to move back to my seat or else I would be charged. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "customer service staff was terrible"
Not Verified |  The customer service checking in was terrible. The staff was rude and aggressive with our luggage. We had a layover in Atlanta where the staff threw our stroller on the ground at gate check. Even the other Frontier staff were furious. Each flight was delayed by an hour. In Atlanta they waited to tell us we were going to be leaving until the departure time had passed. There was no communication until then as to why we couldn’t board. The flight crew was enjoyable but the other customer service staff was terrible.

### "Not any way to begin or end a vacation!"
Not Verified |  I’ve taken my family for years on Frontier and understandably put up with limited service and comfort as a budget airline. They now have instituted so much to nickel and dime you it borders on harassment. From waiting in line to check in our paid bags and being kicked out to print the tags on my own (machine didn’t work) and had to get back in line all over again and haggle not to get charged to ‘print’ our luggage tags to the harassment of my family and others on the clearly acceptable carry on luggage for the for years being now deemed unacceptable at complete random during boarding. I ended up paying an extra $100 on our flight back proactively on baggage to avoid anxiety. Never again! Not any way to begin or end a vacation! Most horrid flying experience ever - and again we used to fly Frontier routinely in the past.

### "My family was separated by this airline"
My family was separated by this airline with 15 seats still available, they refused to seat us together. Worst company I have ever paid, and this will be the last time.

### "Terrible from the beginning"
Not Verified |  Terrible from the beginning. The agent at the desk was incredible rude and unprofessional to everyone I heard her interact with. $40 for one check in bag is ridiculous. Seats on the plane are terribly uncomfortable as when we landed in ATL the crew told us the wrong baggage claim number on the wrong side of the airport! Never again.

### "LIVID is an understatement"
Not Verified | I didn’t even get the change to fly because they delayed the flight FOUR times. Starting with delaying it by an hour and then another hour and then a few minutes to finally delaying it by ELEVEN HOURS. My flight SHOULD have left at 10:13 pm and arrived around 11:45pm. Then it changed to leaving at 11pm and arriving at almost 1pm. Then it changed to leaving at 12am to arriving at 2 am. And the level of irritation that flowed through my body when I received a text message at exactly 11:56 pm stating “Frontier Travel Alert: Flight 895 from RDU is delayed to allow for a late arriving aircraft. Departure now estimated at 9:59 AM.” I’m annoyed because I just KNOW that these people were aware that there would be a significant delay. And rather than having the decency to just send this message the first time or just cancel the flight, they drag it out and leave you waiting for a flight that would never come. LIVID is an understatement, because our time was wasted. And the events that I was meant to attend I missed ALL OF THEM. Because of this nonsense. And rather than to take a chance and confirm the new flight time, I decided to drive rather than to play myself and have another “delay”. Who knows if this one wasn’t going to be for 24 hours this time? I am UTTERLY disgusted with this airline. DISGUSTED. I spent time out of my day pondering and trying to figure out how these people are still in business. Come to find out that frontier is KNOWN for delays. EXTENSIVE delays at that. I should have just stuck with my big three airlines, rather than to take a chance ok this garbage nonsense. Absolutely DISGUSTED and I cannot stress this enough. DISGUSTED. The only thing they got right was sending me an email stating that they were refunding my money. Even then, I still have to call them and double check that I receive a refund for EVERYTHING. and what kind of airline makes you pay for CARRY ONS? And the carry ons cost MORE than the checked luggage? Just absolute and pure garbage. I am disgusted and have made it my life’s mission to discourage ANYONE from flying with this airline. I attached below screenshots of all the delay emails I received. DISGUSTED. Also, don’t mind the star ratings, you can’t leave them empty. But if I could? ZERO STARS! Thumbs DOWN.

### "Frontiers go wild pass is a scam"
Not Verified |  Frontiers go wild pass is a scam. There are no flights available under that pass. They have no customer service number and the agent through chat was absolutely no help.

### "This is awful customer service"
Not Verified |  This has been...I say that because its 1.39am and we still haven't left Dallas, original time was 10.50pm, we got delayed twice, and the last update was leaving at 1.41am, again its now 1.40 and we are sitting in the airport with no update and no assistance. The woman who has been walking back and forth for hours in the rudest person I've encountered in a long while. She acts like we're upsetting her because we're waiting for info and we have questions. Based on this experience I will never ever fly Frontier again. They do not care about their passengers at all. Another flight was canceled and they've been here for hours as well...now they are offering $50 vouchers which they have to use in 90 days and spend with Frontier, what a joke. This is awful customer service and an even more awful airline.

### "unprofessional and poor service"
Frontier did not tag bags checked at jet bridge and after waiting almost 4 hours at our destination, they never arrived. Not very helpful at all assisting in Atlanta with locating or gaining correcting info. We are miles from home with no luggage for any of us, family of 5 with 2 children. No toiletries or even encouragement they’ll locate our bags and get them to us in a timely manner. We were told we couldn’t file a claim without bag tag confirmation but we did have a receipt. DFW is the hub that said we didn’t need the bag tag. Very unprofessional and poor customer service besides the one helpful newbie in DFW.

### "No flights for Frontier available"
Flight #4846, 6/15/23, depart MCO 9.45am, arrive SJU at 12.41pm. First email I received early morning stating there’s a 1hr 25min delay, 2nd email, 25 min delay, 3rd email arriving at 10.10, go through hectic lines for luggage drop off, then TSA check in, shuttle, as we’re waiting in line to grab a quick bite to eat, before heading to the gate, email sent 'flight canceled due to mechanical issues'. Been up since 4am to get here on time, husband upset, twins tired grouchy and hungry because we couldn’t even have the chance to eat, because now what are we supposed to do. No flights for Frontier available, ended up buying tickets through Spirit Airlines for double the price! I hit the opinion for refund, hopefully it is in our bank accounts soon, because they’re quick to take your money! Vouchers were sent to us but only for airfare use! You think I’m Flying with Frontier? Again? No! The least they could’ve done was sent us a check for the inconvenience. All this process is funny to me, sounds like their short staffed, selling seats but not jets available!

### ✅ Trip Verified |
The customer service team was completely useless. First fight was delayed 1 hour, and second flight was delayed 3 hours all together. There was an issue with paperwork being signed off which caused passengers to sit on the plane for 2 hours. The seats on both flights was completely uncomfortable; which caused butt pain, arm pain, and slight back pain.

### "Do not fly frontier"
Never absolutely horrible. They changed the gate with no announcement, no update to the boarding pass. Needles to say we never got on the flight never got a refund and never again. I'll take that loss as a lesson not to forget. Do not fly frontier ever.

### "pay more for the better airlines"
Not Verified |  Just pay more for the better airlines to have peace of mind. My family and I flew Frontier for the first time 6.14.23. Flight was delayed almost 3 hours. The agent at the desk changed our passenger # which caused us Not to be able to sit in seats we paid for and they weren't going to board us in the 1st place but i had to start acting like a Karen. (not my usual stance or persona). Once we finally arrived in Miami we waited almost 1hour for bags just for them to say they left them in ATL. NO real apology, the customer service manager was rude to us and the other 20+ people who were upset they didn't have their luggage. I have to drive to Key West which is 3hrs from Miami with my kids, and husband no clothes, no undies, no supplies and my blood pressure meds missing in action.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified | Only reason I give a decent review for the first flight is because they were chill when I FLEW to Baltimore. Gave me and my friend priority for free and helped out. Did not have to do that and it was above and beyond service. HOWEVER the flight back was a different story. I wasn’t home so I could not do anything about my slightly bigger bag. They were incredibly rude and refused to help me with their carry on service in any way. I knew it was about 40 bucks cheaper on their website, yet they told me it was all “self service” or pay 99 dollars. They would close the gate without me while I scrambled to figure it out and was forced to pay the higher fee meanwhile almost missing my flight. It was a underhanded and disgusting move with the worst customer service I have faced. They were even so low to do it to a family of five. Even if it saves you 100 dollars, IT IS NOT WORTH IT DO NOT BUY TICKETS!! !

### "This airline is a joke"
This airline is a joke. Departing flight was delayed 2 hours. The return flight was originally delayed 2 hours until 11:45 pm, and then was cancelled. The next flight was 2 days later. There was no compensation given for the overnight hotel. The young girls working at the gate counter were actually laughing and said it happens all the time. I had to pay for a flight the next morning on Delta just to get home. I was an idiot for booking with this company, but will never do it again

### "bully people out of their money"
Not Verified | If I could give zero stars, I would! First off, where the heck did your pilots learn to fly?! Second, why do your employees feel as though they can speak to your customers in the tone they do? I will NEVER use this company to fly again! I don’t care how inexpensive the flights are! Over a two hour delay, just to get us on the plane seat us and delay us over another hour. The bumpiest ride I’ve ever experienced, horrible take off, horrible landing. From poor customer service, to poor quality all the way around. I literally watched them bully people out of their money! Disgusting company that lies all around. If you’re looking cheap, Spirit is by far and hands down a better choice than this awful company!

### "so rude and disrespectful"
Not Verified |  Horribly disrespectful I got about it flights and this airlines are very, very cheap. And I don’t expect customer service at all actually. However, I do expect the basics like normal human courtesy, and definitely respect for our senior veterans. I was just behind a man that was asking for help at the customer service desk. He was sent up to customer service by the USO he didn’t have a mobile device and wanted to be sure that he was on tomorrow’s flight. The “customer service” agent couldn’t even give him the courtesy looking at him and trying to help! She simply said she was too early. I needed to come back when the desk opened at 3 AM tomorrow morning. I’m shocked! When did our customer service agents become so rude and disrespectful! I’ve been flying frontier for many years but after this experience, this is my last one. I guess frontier doesn’t care because people will keep patronizing them because of the cheap tickets. But I refuse to be one of those.

### "confusion works out well for them"
Arrived atthe airport 2 hours prior to the flight, at the terminal stated on my boarding pass. I was unable to identify a place to drop off my luggage which I had paid for in advance as per the airline preference. 45 minutes and 2 DFW cust service people later, I was finally able to identify someone to help. She informed me that luggage drop off needed to be handled at a completely different terminal and I would then need to clear security there and catch a shuttle back for departure. I hustled to get to the other terminal where I stood in line. I wasn’t concerned too as we still had almost an hour before the flight. However, bag acceptance for the flight was 45 min before departure. Eventually an agent put everyone going to Denver in a fast track lane but only 2 passengers got through before they closed baggage acceptance. I was told that I had missed my flight. There were over a dozen of us that had to rebook our flight. When I prepaid my baggage, no alert regarding the terminal change was made. The email that ‘should have’ been sent” was not. Nor did any of the others receive an email. I was offered a flight leaving the following day but not arriving until another day passed. A 14 hour trip of which 6 hours were actual flight times. No creativity was demonstrated until speaking with a supervisor after another hour of waiting. She at least looked but said all flights were already over booked. She said she had made four announcements of the departure gate and I should have made it. I pointed out that I had been to the departure terminal and had to change terminals in order to drop my bag. She was unimpressed, indicated that she was aware of the problem but it is considered my fault so she would not authorize a refund.I asked if I could change the booking. I was told the 14 hr flight iwas my only and last chance right then. She also threw in that this 14 hour flight was oversold. I did not rebook. There were several points of communication that could have included this very unusual procedure. The person who informed us to go to the other terminal said,”Passengers miss their flights all the time because of this problem.” This leads me to conclude that the confusion works out well for them because all of us that got caught out freed up seats to cover the seats that were oversold. The icing on the cake was the attitude of every one of thee 4 agents we worked with. I am pursuing a refund through another avenue as this could be cleared up very easily with a simple notification. The service was not provided due to Frontier’s failure to provide accurate information. I did what I was directed to do. It feels intentional on their part.

### "don't recommend this airline"
Not Verified | Very, very, very bad Service. My first and last time. The employee at front desk does not want to help and are super arrogant. I don't recommend this airline.

### "website and app are useless"
Not Verified | This review is the same as the others you will see. They are the worst. Don't fly with the. They don't have a number to talk to anyone and their chat system sucks. Their website and app are useless. You will just get frustrated and not get anywhere. You have to pay for everything that by the time you are done, might as well have just gone with a different airline for a little more. I will NEVER EVER fly with them again. I would never recommend them to anyone.

### "never fly with Frontier"
Not Verified | Horrible airline, not worth the money. Staff extremely unprofessional and just horrible! Will never fly with Frontier again in my life. It was miserable dealing with the employees that were rude and stuck up and straight up disrespectful. The worst airline!

### "I will never fly with them again"
Do not fly with them. The tickets may be cheap but they charge ridiculously for bags. I bought a personal item bag that were the exact measurements they require for a personal item. I flew from PDX to Denver for my layover and the to Detroit with no problems. Then on my return trip I flew from DTW to Denver with zero problems. Then as I was boarding my plane in Denver to get back to Portland after a long layover, the lady rudely stopped me and told me my personal item was too big and that I needed to pay for a carry-on. I put my bag in the personal item bin to show her that it fit perfectly and yelled at me and said it doesn't fit. When I politely asked her how it doesn't fit she rudely replied and said because I said it doesn't, so you can either pay for it or not get on your flight. So I had to pay $99 for an item that should have been free. I will never fly with them again. My round trip mat have cost only $400 but after paying for these bags it cost over $640

### "wouldn’t recommend this airline"
Staff on board is helpful and nice (as helpful and nice as the rules in place for this airline allow them to be). They give you specific bag dimensions which are not the same as the insert they use to make you put them to check size. I measured it. They should change those dimensions on the website because right now it pretty much looks like a trick to get more money from you when you back doesn’t fit. They are not very family friend. They do they bare minimum and cannot provide any accommodations unless you pay for them to families. Overall wouldn’t recommend this airline unless you are doing a quick flight and don’t need any additional bags with you.

### "canceled my flight without my consent"
App shows flight, itinerary email states canceled. I bought the Den Membership for free open flight availability. Tried to change to a later flight due to a delay resulting in my rental car place being closed. I wrote a complaint about the $600 charge. They canceled my flight without my consent and are keeping my money. No person CS, just automated chat and emails. I have filed a second complaint and that email is taking years for them to correct when they canceled within minutes of first complaint.

### "Absolutely the worst"
Not Verified |  Absolutely ridiculous! My entire family was due to board this airline Friday at 11pm. They changed the time of departure 3xs before the plane arrived. So they left bullhead city at 8pm to make sure they arrived in time. Sat and waited until midnight. They had their bags checked, went through security, and boarded the plane. Only to be told 20 mins after scheduled departure that their flight was canceled and delayed until Saturday at midnight. They waited in line for over 2 hoursto be told to come back in 24hr. After driving hours back to bullhead and waiting until tonight. They leave bullhead around 8pm, get to Vegas about to check in, and told their flight is delayed for 3hrs. Meanwhile their connecting flight in Denver is due to leave in 4hrs, so they may miss that one and have to wait for the next flight. Optimistic, they continue to wait ... only to now have their flight canceled again! My sister is out 2 whole days on their airbnb, rental car, and 2 days of an entire family taking days off of work. No explanation. They can't get ahold of anyone. No compensation. No solution. Now they have to wait in line again, with 3 small and very tired children. To possibly be told there's nothing this airline can do. 7 days for a refund. They do not have $ to book another flight. Plans are already set and things are already being paid for that they can not use. Absolutely the worst. Do not book with them.

### "horrible experience with Frontier"
We had a horrible experience with Frontier. The first time I order flight to NY during Christmas to visit family. But they cancelled my tickets twice and cause me not able to go there. What’s worst, is it took me days to fight for my money back. 6months later, I still didn’t receive my money back. I gave Frontier another try. Ordered two tickets to Michigan to visit a friend and celebrate her birthday. The flight delayed 3 times, 4 hours in total. We require to change a flight but they only offer us poor option like waiting in the airport for another 7 hours, 5Am!! The customer service are terrible and not friendly. This cause us missed our connection flight the next day, we were stuck in Orlando Airport, hungry and tired. We waited 3 hours in a short line to reschedule our flight, there was only 1-2 workers are helping with customer service. They offered us another 24 hours long flight, 14 hours layover in Denver! It doesn’t make sense at all. They gave you poor option and not considering your situation at all. Their attitudes and solutions make me think they don’t care their customers at all. Who wants to travel 3 days only fly from California to Michigan? During the flight, there’s no drinks or trash collection service.

### "Customer service is non-existent"
Once again, every single aspect of this airline proves to be the worst. Customer service is non-existent, the staff are always angry, my flight was delayed, and they charged me $92 to fix my last name on my boarding pass.

### "not worth my family’s business"
Not Verified | Book a flight for my minor child via a chat bot, because I’m not allowed to book it online. Verified the flight I wanted with a 1 hour layover, which was fine. When I get my final itinerary it has my child with a 5 hour layover at an airport that was not previously discussed. I can’t have my child held over for 5 hours by HERSELF! So I reach back out to customer service (chat) which is a very poor way to handle flights regarding minor children. Only to be told I have to pay 99$ per flight to rebook. Now I have to gamble on getting a correct flight after paying 200$ or send my child on a flight with a 5 hour layover and hope that she is safe. Why would they even offer a 5 hour layover for a minor child. Frontier is not customer friendly and service sucks. Takes hours to even book or change a flight via their chat service. They make you have to talk to them via chat to book flights for minors and then screw the booking up and I the customer have to deal with it. With the fees and lack of attention for minor children this airline is not worth my family’s business and we will never use Frontier as a flight option again. They need to do a lot better when it comes to dealing with customers.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. They are rude and biggest scam ever. I spent more in luggage than air fare alone. They charge you for carry on when there plenty of room on the plane. Do not fly Frontier

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, terrible baggage allowance policies and excessive charges, 3 hour delay with no explanation (missed my connection), denied accommodation coverage for delay. Overall bad experience with this airline, and not the first one. Again, the cheaper option ends up more expensive (more stressful, more uncomfortable…) I Hope the company I work for doesn’t book Frontier again, I’ve put forward my case so we don’t us them In the future.

### "they charged me $99 each bag"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible airline. I have 2 sons and 1 daughter at 12, 10, and 7. We All chose personal item because I didn’t feel like paying extra. Keep in mind we only have the soft carry on bags. They cue me over to size me and my kid’s bags, they all fit in, but the bendable handle was sticking out by 1/4 an inch, and the service personnel said that each bag was $99, so $298 In total. Me and my wife did not want to pay it, so I shoved the flexible handle into the personal item space, and it fit. Now this is the worst part. Claiming that It was too close of a fit, they charged me $99 each bag. I am never flying frontier ever again. Other than that, it was a very hot plane with almost no room.

### "not customer friendly"
Not Verified |  I wanted a certain time and flight I paid for it and Frontier gave me a flight they wanted me to take. They refuse to refund me my money. Frontier Airlines is not customer friendly and no customer service.

### "customer service is equally inept"
This airline is horrible and the customer service is equally inept. First off, there is no customer service telephone number where you can actually speak with a real person. I attempted to use the very impersonal chat feature, as it was my only option, and whomever was on the other end was not amenable to helping me resolve the issue. I booked a flight months ago and found a flight within the 14 day period that was about $90 cheaper. I asked to cancel the ticket and rebook the flight or request a refund for the difference in the two prices. The customer service bot was unwilling to do either. Frontier wanted to charge me a $99 cancellation fee or charge me $99 to join one of their non-sensical clubs to obtain the lower fare. It is ridiculous how they try to gouge their customers for every penny and are reluctant to help a customer. I thought Frontier had changed its ways. I hadn't flown with them since 2015. In 2015 the customer service rep at the Denver airport was extremely rude and unwilling to help my elderly parents (80's). I guess a bird cannot change its feathers. If at all possible, do not fly this airline.

### "the worst I’ve ever flown"
Not Verified |  Frontier is the worst I’ve ever flown in my entire life We were so late arriving back to Atlanta that my hubby and I had no way back to the hotel to our vehicle cause everything had closed. We waited over an hour to receive our baggage, it was just terrible and they nickel and dime you to death and don’t offer anything free as other airlines do.

### "stay far away from Frontier’s go wild pass"
If you are thinking of buying a go wild pass from frontier DO NOT! They are only allowing you to book the day before for domestic flights and 10 days before for international flights. No earlier, and they don’t even allow for a return flight with the wild pass. For example, I looked at flying tomorrow (because that is my only option), Friday and returning Sunday and I was not able to book my return flight home on Sunday. I have searched multiple dates and locations 1-4 weeks out with NOTHING available for the pass. So unless you are comfortable booking one ways the day before each flight and crossing your fingers there is a pass available for your return flight stay as far away from Frontier’s go wild pass.

### "Worst experience I’ve ever had"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I’ve ever had. Please save your money or pay a little extra for a different flight. In the end you will probably pay more. I had an issue with a departing flight which I tried to cancel only the departure and they canceled my whole trip, hotel and all. This was so inconvenient as I was already at the airport and now had to rush and re book a new flight and hotel. This isn’t even the worse part. My total trip came out to $802 and they only credited me $296, I did not want a credit I wanted a refund. I also couldn’t even contact a representative, there was no phone number to call. This airline has the worst customer service. I will never fly with Frontier again not even for Free.

### "Horrible experience!"
Horrible experience! There was no organization in the bag checking area. It was a free for all with people pushing and cutting lines. The staff checking the bags were short with customers and not helpful. One bag was checked. When the bag was picked up in Tampa, it was unzipped, the belongings were rifled through and a Switch console, Switch dock, and games were stolen straight out of the bag. When the airline and police were contacted about the missing items, the police stated they could not help and nothing was heard from the Airline, now 2 weeks from the trip. These are expensive items that Frontier staff decided they could steal from a young adult who is working hard to make ends meet. This is despicable and I will refuse to use this airline again.

### "had the absolute worst experience"
We had the absolute worst experience with Frontier. We had checked in and gotten our boarding passes online the evening prior. We get to the airport very early the next morning and the security lines were long beyond belief. The boarding gate got switched and we hurried towards the new gate and arrived there right at the gate closing time. Being aware that the airport was extremely busy and a number of travellers had yet to board, not only was Frontier unwilling to help passengers who reported to boarding at the nick of time, but the agent saw us and turned away and left through a door to not be seen again. Needless to say, we were denied boarding to our flight. The plane was also still parked and did not depart until a good while after. We then line up at their customer service counter for over an hour with other passengers who suffered the same fate as us only to be told they won't help us. We had to scramble last minute to figure out a way to get home. My husband had to be back for work that afternoon but Frontier did not care. Do yourselves a favor - do not fly with Frontier. There's no wonder why their reviews are so bad and don't be fooled by their low prices - once you add on the luggage and mandatory seat selection fees, their prices are actually not really that much cheaper than bigger carriers. Save yourselves the trouble and headache and book with another carrier to get much better service and to be treated as a valued customer

### "Stop hiding the fees!"
I thought I was getting a good deal on Frontier. They advertise great rates (i.e. $35!) I spent approx $700 on 2 tickets, which is acceptable. But then they charge an additional fee for seats and luggage (weird that people travel with luggage) At any rate, I get that there are fees, but their fees are ridiculous! $64/per bag one way??? Then to pick a seat so you are assured to sit with your husband, it's an additional $145! So they wanted approx $400 more, making my trip starting at $700 ... now its $1100. I feel this is unethical business practice. Stop hiding the fees! Put it all up front so people know what to expect. My bad, if I would have done more research, I would have chosen another airline. Buyer beware of Frontier and their unethical practices.

### "worst experience ever"
Low Fares Done wrong, 6 hours later I'm back at square one. After being bused from the gate to the actual plane with a makeshift ramp, we had to endure a 2 hour wait on the plane due to maintenance issues. To only find out that the aircraft part had to be flown in, and we needed to deplane. Then, told to go to Terminal E from Terminal D. After arriving to Terminal E, we waited another 15 mins to then be told that we had to go back outside of security to the ticket counter for more information. At that point, we find out that the flight was canceled and that there were no available flights until Thursday. The worst experience ever and there was no immediate recourse, except a refund. When requesting a refund I received a notification that it would take 7 days, which ties my money up even longer causing a financial strain and nearly impossible to book another flight.

### "the most awful experience"
Not Verified |  It was the most awful experience. App doesn't work properly for check in. Lines are always wrapped around the airport. I haven't flown them since my boss asked me to once for the savings. But it's not a savings after the hassle. You for sure won't get your refund.

### "denied by the boarding staff"
I was denied by the boarding staff. I was on my work travel and I am 7 month pregnant. My seat was changed after I checked in but didn‘t think much of it. It was an overnight flight so all I wanted was to be home for my other kids. I get anxiety attacks in the plane so I am usually one of the last ones boarding. The flight was delayed which didn‘t surprise me but still annoyed since it was getting close to 2am. When it was my turn to be boarded, I was asked if I could assist in emergency and I with my honesty declined due to my pregnancy. The staff immediately got upset and put me aside not telling me what‘s going on. She showed attitude and when I asked what was going on, she told me she had to change my seat. Because it was taking awhile I said Id just keep the seat because i just wanted to be home. She rejected my request. A gentleman behind me offered to switch seats with me but the staff rejected that request. At that point, I was fuming and called her names but there was neither adult tantrum/shouting nor physical violence. I was sent to a manager saying she would help me. she asked for the QR code and upon scanning it, she let me know that my next flight would be the following day. Basically she cancelled my flight without informing me beforehand. They continued to ignore me and humiliated me by making jokes to each other. I asked for written protocol and fine prints stating the staff‘s authority to deny passenger boarding and I was told there was no such thing. So they can basically deny anyone as they please. She said my attitude and the danger I can cause would be the reason. Again, I am 7 mo pregnant, extremely exhausted petit person with no sign of violence. I am looking into escalating this incidence. I am so shocked how the staff can simply exercise their authority to punish a customer without any professionalism

### "recommend not using this airline"
I recommend not using this airline even if the price is very low. The seats of the A321neo are so highly uncomfortable to the degree that they may cause health issues if your trip is long enough. Their chairs have no padding I was extremely uncomfortable on the 2-1/2 Hr flight from Bradley Intl BDL to Orlando MCO I was limping after the flight was over. To make things worse, there are always flight delays with this airline. My last one today had worn-out nose gear tires and they were required to replace the old tires with new ones before allowing the loaded plane to travel further. Another 45 minutes added to the delay. There is almost no standing room to stretch out and the flight crew discouraged getting up from their seats unless it's to use the lavatory. One of the stewardesses openly acknowledges how stiff and hard their seats are. I rather spend a few more dollars than use a flight open

### "another 3 hour delay"
Not Verified |  Get to Las Vegas for a 4 hour lay over. 30 minutes before boarding they announce another 3 hour delay. Send me a voucher for food because of inconvenience, but can't use cause I have to pay for the food myself and then they will reimburse. This was an unplanned trip. I'm totally broke sitting here, diabetic and have not eaten in over 12 hours now, and still can't because I cannot use their food voucher unless I have money to pay for food. So does this food voucher really help. No it does not! And now another delay because of a flat tyre! This airline is a joke.

### "This lack of accountability is disgraceful"
I am utterly furious with Frontier Airlines and the horrendous experience I had with them. Not only did they lose my checked luggage, but they displayed a shocking lack of professionalism, responsibility, and basic customer service. Here's a breakdown of the abysmal treatment I received: Incompetent Baggage Handling: Despite having my luggage tag, Frontier Airlines couldn't even locate a record of my bag. How is it possible for a supposedly reputable airline to misplace luggage without a trace? This level of negligence is simply unacceptable. Refusal to Provide Compensation: To add insult to injury, Frontier Airlines outright refused to offer any compensation for the lost luggage. It's beyond comprehension that they feel justified in not taking responsibility for their own mistakes. This lack of accountability is disgraceful. Poor Communication: Throughout this entire ordeal, Frontier Airlines made absolutely no effort to communicate with me regarding the progress of finding my lost bag. They never reached out to provide updates, and I was left completely in the dark. It's as if they didn't care at all about the inconvenience and frustration caused by their incompetence. Unreachable Customer Service: Contacting Frontier Airlines was an exercise in futility. Their customer service line seemed to be intentionally designed to prevent customers from getting through. I spent countless hours attempting to reach a live person, but the phone was never answered. It's an absolute disgrace that they don't have a functional system to handle customer inquiries. Indifferent Personnel: I had to drive to the airport twice to speak with Frontier Airlines personnel, and they displayed an alarming lack of empathy or concern. They seemed disinterested in resolving the issue and displayed a dismissive attitude. It was clear that my frustration meant absolutely nothing to them. Frontier Airlines has shown a complete disregard for customer satisfaction and basic decency. Losing luggage is already a hassle, but the total lack of assistance and empathy from this airline made the situation far worse. I strongly advise against choosing Frontier Airlines for your travel needs. Save yourself the headache, stress, and disappointment by choosing an airline that values its customers and takes responsibility for its mistakes. Frontier Airlines has lost a loyal customer, and I will make sure to share my terrible experience with anyone willing to listen.

### "irate and upset due waiting"
Not Verified | Frontier Airlines gave me a bad experience from the beginning to the end of my trip. As we got to Miami airport we were told that we can't do a early check and we had to wait 3 hours to check our luggage in. The whole process was overwhelming and we had to deal with other customers who were irate and upset due waiting cancelations. I will never fly with Frontier again!

### "an absolute nightmare to fly with"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines has proven time and time again why it is considered one of the worst airlines in the industry. From the moment you step foot on their planes, you're immediately greeted with an overwhelming sense of disappointment and frustration. Let me walk you through the myriad reasons why Frontier Airlines is an absolute nightmare to fly with. First and foremost, their customer service is abysmal. Trying to reach a representative over the phone is an exercise in futility, as you'll likely be greeted with long hold times and unhelpful responses. Their staff seems disinterested in assisting passengers and often display a lack of basic courtesy. It's as if they have been trained to make your experience as unpleasant as possible. But the nightmare doesn't end there. Frontier Airlines is notorious for their hidden fees and deceptive pricing practices. You'll be enticed by their unbelievably low fares, only to find out that you're being charged for every little thing. Want to bring a carry-on bag? That'll cost you. Need a seat assignment? That'll cost you too. It's like being nickel and dimed at every turn, leaving you feeling ripped off and taken advantage of. And let's not forget about the uncomfortable seating. Frontier Airlines seems to have mastered the art of cramming as many seats as possible into their planes, sacrificing any semblance of legroom or comfort. Prepare to feel like a sardine squished in a can for the duration of your flight. If you value your personal space or any modicum of comfort, Frontier Airlines is definitely not the airline for you. To make matters worse, their flight delays and cancellations are a frequent occurrence. It's as if they have no regard for their passengers' time or travel plans. You can expect long delays without any clear explanation or compensation for the inconvenience caused. Good luck trying to catch a connecting flight or making any plans based on their unreliable schedule. Lastly, their overall lack of professionalism is staggering. From rude flight attendants to outdated and dirty planes, Frontier Airlines seems to have given up on providing a pleasant flying experience. It's clear that they prioritize cutting costs over delivering even the most basic standards of quality. In conclusion, I would strongly advise against flying with Frontier Airlines unless you enjoy being treated like a second-class citizen, paying exorbitant fees for basic services, and enduring endless discomfort. Save yourself the headache and frustration by choosing an airline that values its customers and prioritizes a positive travel experience. Frontier Airlines is simply not worth the trouble.

### "so frustrated with Frontiers customer service"
Not Verified |  I have not yet taken my flight but already I’m so frustrated with Frontiers customer service. I booked flights for myself and my daughter but after not being able to find my conformation email (because they never sent it to me) I was one the chat (because we literally can’t talk to an actual person on the phone) with 5 people for two hours. All of which said they couldn’t help me and I they couldn’t find any conformation and to book it again online. It wasn’t until the 5th person until they were actually able to find my reservation. I was cross by this point. Taking away customer service techs was the worst thing Frontier could have done. I will never fly with them again. You can mark that down. Not a fan!

### "Worst Airline ever"
Not Verified | Worst Airline ever. Charged my personal bag for extra $99.00 which is supposed to be free and much smaller size than their policy required! Had only two days trip didn’t have checked baggage or a carry-on with me, just one bag 7h x 14w x 8d. Never ever will fly with them and will tell all my friends and family about this incident.

### "Absolutely a rip off"
Strongly recommend NOT traveling Frontier Airlines!! This was the worst experience due to expense and service! We flew this airline out of Denver in May to Cancun and at the time of early check-in we found out that we were going to be charged for carry-on luggage. We always have our family bring a carry-on and backpack which typically is at no charge to us with other airlines, however with Frontier they charged us over $60 a bag for our carry-ons and we were paying for 8 people's carry-on, so this charge added $1200 (both ways) to our expenses that we were not expecting. They also have a minimum of 40 lbs for carry-on which is lower than other airlines which typically allow up to a 50 lb. bag, so again they are looking to charge any way they can. We then got on our 4 hour flight and found out they don't offer complimentary drinks or snacks, not a huge deal but we paid over $700 for each tickets which we purchased more than 6 months ahead of time, so this wasn't a discounted airline. They charge for everything on the flight. The seats were horribly uncomfortable with no padding and the seats sit so straight up, I have never been so uncomfortable on a flight as I was on the flights we took on Frontier. The flight home added even more stress and expense for us in Mexico with Frontier. Our family member who left ahead of us warned us to use the Frontier Kiosk to print off our baggage tags because if not, the agents would charge us $25 per bag to print them off (in addition to their $60 fee for carry-on bags). So we did this and printed them off and placed them on our bags. When we got to the counter to check our bags in, the agent said our tags didn't include a code they needed so he would have to rip off our tags and they charged us $25 per bag to reprint the tags. So now we got to pay an additional $225 for all of our bags. So in actuality we paid $85 per checked bag with Frontier. Absolutely a rip off! We will NEVER fly Frontier again and we will make sure all of our friends and family know what a horrible airline it is.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Over 4 hours delay due to staffing issues. Podium staff rude and horrid customer service. No compensation was offered. Watched multiple people from other flights miss their flights due to changes in terminal locations and times with no announcements or notifications. Will never fly Frontier again

### "customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  Flight has been delayed for hours, customer service is horrible, and the baggage prices are outrageous. I have never paid $64 dollars to check one bag for one direction I will never be flying with this airline again

### "worst airline I’ve ever been on"
This is the worst airline I’ve ever been on, the seats are just so hard and no soft padding on them, you are sitting slouched over how straight the seats are. We had a 15 hour layover, on top of that it’s being delayed, for another 3 hours. Please go take your money and get yourself a better airline, the worst decision I’ve made. You can’t even contact them directly, have to do online live chat, which a Bot doesn’t connect you to anyone, when it does they just disconnect and don’t care about resolving anything. Paid $150 for baggage it was a bit over weight. You think you’ll save money and have a good flight, you end up spending same if not more than a good airline with their ridiculous pricing on board with drinks and also their inane baggage fees, I have no clue how Frontier is still operating and hasn’t been shut down.

### "cancelled just before boarding"
Worst airline ever. My flight was cancelled just before boarding. Over a hundred angry people (most traveling to see family for Mother's Day). Hours of waiting. I was offered a flight 2 days later. Rude an unhelpful staff. A waste of time, a waste of money (I'm not reimbursed for the return trip, I paid twice for a hotel and a rental car). Low rates, very low skills. Avoid ! First and Last time for me .

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
First I placed my TSA information on my ticket and it was never added to my arrival or departure ticket. I also never received my gate information on my departure information. When I spoke to the chat agent they told me they hope it works now that they have placed it in the system. When I departed again no TSA number was on my ticket. I was told by chat agent it must be TSA fought. It's funny how it worked two weeks earlier with American! When I left Cincinnati my bag was over by 7 pounds since Frontier has lowered the pounds from 50 to 40 pounds but increased the baggage amount to $72 from $50. The teller let me take out a few items until I got down to 40 pounds. However, at the MCO airport the agent was nasty when my bag was 7 pounds over. I was given two choices pay the additional $50 or take the items out and get back to the end of the line. Now why are there different rules state to state? The agent with the bad attitude could have let me take out those two little pounds. I also received a text alert that TSA had long lines 70 mins and to come to the airport as soon as possible. I get there at 5am but couldn't check in until 7am. So, why was my TSA information not on my ticket and why did you tell me to come as soon as possible? The line ended up around the corner in the aisle and it was 10 computers to check you in but only two agents. Yet the agent that checked me in wanted me to move all the way back to the end of the line for two pounds and or charge me $50. I will never fly Frontier again! I advise everyone to boycott Frontier until they have better customers service and fairer prices!! Yea, you get cheap flights but they nickel and dime you on every thing else. You also get cheap customer service and chat agent service neither of them are really trying to help you! Then add in the rudeness, the miss information, what you have to pay on the plane just for some water or a cookie and what you have to pay for your checked bags and carry-on bag you should book a more reputable airline who will get it right the first time.

### "delayed and then we were bumped"
Flight was delayed and then we were bumped! We checked with counter staff 3 hours before scheduled flight time at gate 12. Staff there said we were okay for the flight as we had assigned seats. When our section was called to board we presented our boarding pass on our phone and we were then told then that there was no room for us on the plane!

### "a true scam at that"
Do not fall for the lowest price on the net, it is a scam, and a true scam at that. Yes, you do get from point to point, but the methods they use are scam you out of your money are crazy. They say it is the lowest faires, but yet, they charge you to pick your seat, if you are flying with more then one person, they charge you to sit next to each other, as we had no way or option to pick ajoining seats in the pre-check-in. We opted for the exit row, as I am a tall person, and need the extra leg room, little did I know they ask for volunteers to sit in those rows, and will not reimburse you, even though everyone else gets that row upgraded for free, then they didn't say my mother couldn't sit with us and wanted to stick her in the back of the plane. They charge for over 40lbs of luggage, when everyone else is 50lbs, and you have to pay for any carry-on. so when you have 3 people in the party, everything is 3times the price. So those low rates are gone. They charge extremely high prices for their in-flight beverage and snacks, and was told refills cost extra, and I could not keep the water bottle or soda can. Everything was about money, and how they can get it out of your pocket into their pockets, like the flight cost isn't enough. The agents at the counter were rude, and unpleasant to talk with. The one lady finally offered to help me with my mom, who was in a wheel chair, and could see i was struggling. The cabin staff was horrible, it took a bit of self control to not go off on this dude, he was extremely rude, All I wanted to do was go back three rows and check on my 82year old mother and give her a blanket to keep her warm on the flight as it was cold, she is having issues coping over the last year, and needs reassurance from time to time. A few minutes was not going to hurt anyone or delay the flight any more then it was already going to be delayed. These people think like cops, they are in a position that they can make your life miserable, and waiting on someone to push them to show how much influence they have over us, and there by they think they have the right to be rude and treat customers like crap. Well, you can, sure, but these things are what will not make me a future customer, and I will be forever and always against anyone ever booking a flight with these people.

### "unpleasant customer service"
I went to Arizona with some friends over Memorial Day Weekend. We chose Frontier since it was (slightly) cheaper than the other airlines that we were considering. Unfortunately, it was not worth saving the ~$20.00 dollars or so that we made up by flying Frontier rather than Delta or American. The seats, even in basic economy, felt slightly bigger than other budget airlines I've flown (e.g., Spirit). Very courtesy pilots on both of my flights. We had a significant amount of turbulence on the flight to Arizona but the captain handled it very well and communicated well with the passengers. Some of the cons: -We had checked a bag and paid ahead of time (online when paying for our ticket). We went to the baggage check in to drop off our bag before going through TSA. We printed out the baggage tag at one of the self-service kiosks, attached it to our bag, and went to the desk to drop off our bag. The Frontier service agents insisted that we had not paid for our bag and that we would need to pay again at the counter. Two of us pulled up our receipt proof in our email to show her but she refused to look at it and kept on insisting that we needed to pay - even though we already did! We also tried to show her the baggage tag that we had just printed out at the kiosk but she also would not look at it and insisted it was an "old tag" even though she did not even bother to check the date. Thankfully, another agent came to help and confirmed that we had indeed paid however it was a huge hassle. Of course, mistakes happen but she took no ownership for her mistake and it was a stressful, unpleasant experience. Brusque flight attendants/flight staff. -Unpleasant personal bag "random checks. Frontier does not allow you a carry on bag unless you are a "Zone 1" customer or upgrade for a carry on. Each of us "Zone 2" and below customers were allowed one personal item. As we stood in line waiting to board the plane, an employer pulled random people out of the line (in zones 2 and below) and made them bring over the personal items to "measure" them to make sure they were an appropriate size. Those that were deemed "not appropriate" had to go into another line to pay a fee before they could bring them on. Although the reasoning was understandable, the method and manner by which this employer did this was rather hostile and did not make me want to fly Frontier again! However, it was certainly a bonding experience for all of us waiting in line Based on the comments and conversations among the other passengers, our group was far from the only one put off by the way this was done. Other comments: Not really a con but amusing nevertheless - although most airlines offer you a small snack + glass of juice/tea/coffee, etc, especially on a flight the length that ours were, Frontier did not do so and instead tried to sell overpriced snacks/drinks. The extended sales pitch at the end of the flight for their credit card was also annoying, but my guess is this is more "standard" now to do in the industry. Conclusion: We booked these flights hoping to save a few bucks - which we did. However, given the overall negative experience we had, in particular with the staff and some of the ways policies were carried out, our group unanimously decided we will not be flying Frontier again. The savings (~20 bucks per person) were not worth the stress and unpleasant customer service.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I've ever flown I was harassed over a backpack that fit in the little square cube they require it to fit in. They closed the door on me and had me nearly miss my flight because I couldn't pay the $100 bag fee. The gate agents make a commission off of this it's horrible. I'll never fly this airline again.

### "Worst airline of all time"
Worst airline of all time. Do not fly with them. They will nickel and dime you till the cost is the same as a regular airline. The staff is terrible. The gate agents might be the worst people in the airport. They charge for carry on, for checked bags. For drinks, etc. Everything is an upcharge. No inflight entertainment.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline experience ever. Will never fly with them again! So many things happened on this flight that it would amaze you. I can't believe it myself! I don't know how they stay in business! !

### "The worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  The worst airline experience I have ever had. Our flight was delayed for over 6 hours. I know this happens at times but you would think they would've at least offered us water on the airplane. To top everything off, they sent our baggage to Dallas instead of Phoenix. Not one customer service representative was available at the airport to explain anything. I was only able to get in contact with customer service via their online chat- they do not have a phone number available. We ended up filing a claim to which we found out that we will not get any info on our baggage ordeal for another 24 hours. I do not recommend this airline to anyone,  it appears they don't give a rip about their customers.

### "Do better Frontier!"
This is the biggest money grab/scam I have ever seen. We got to the Cancun airport 3 hours in advance. We stood in line to check bags for an hour and a half. When we got to the front was when they decided to inform us we needed a tag. Why would they not have someone telling people that as they entered the line, especially since this was a frequent occurrence? They then made us go to the back of the line and wait another hour and a half. By the time we got to the front, they informed us we “missed check in by 5 mins” and would not be allowed to board our flight. The rest of our family checked in 30 seconds before us and were allowed on. Many people experienced this problem as well, and they claimed they warned us in line however they did not, and others can confirm this. It is not okay to blatantly lie to your customers. I tried speaking with the manager about this issue and he then said he would ban me from the airline for “harassing them”. I tried explaining that my family that was let through wasn’t even boarding yet and we could make it, and they still said no. As I said before, this was happening to several others in line behind us. They told us our only option was to basically be stranded in Mexico for another day and we would still have to pay for our flight because it was “our fault” we missed check in. Major red flag that they couldn’t take responsibility for their own incompetence and stupidness. I have never seen more idiotic employees. On top of that, they closed multiple counters and the employees checking people in were goofing around/laughing with each other when they could clearly see the line was extremely long. Their solution was to have us fly six hours away from our original destination and rent a car to drive home, while refusing to offer compensation for their own mistakes. Horrible customer service, terrible people, and all they want is to take your money. A 10 year old could do a better job than these people. I truly felt second hand embarrassment and do not understand how they could be getting paid to scam people. I would rather walk from Chicago to Cancun than ever take this airline again. Do better Frontier! I hope you go out of business. If I could rate everything 0 stars I would. Save yourselves and book through a better airline.

### "Frontier exceeded my every expectation"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying as an adult and I was very nervous. However, Frontier exceeded my every expectation. The staff in charge of boarding at the gate was efficient and on time, the flight landed earlier than expected, and the in-flight staff including the pilots were attentive and friendly in their announcements. By the time we exited the plane and headed to baggage claim, our bags were ready to be picked up. Thank you Frontier!

### "The staff are nasty and rude"
Horrible airline. Everything is an up charge. The staff are nasty and rude, not all of them but a good portion of the staff. You have to pay to print out the bag tickets if you don’t do it at the self service kiosk. They measure your personal carry on to make sure it fits. I watched them charge a lady $99 because she had a small bag with wheels. The lady said she was going to take off the wheels and they told her no that they still have to charge her. It was small enough to fit under the seat too. Disgusting attitudes.

### "With baggage fees it will cost you more"
Not Verified |  I already paid extra for checked in luggage at check in. Then my personal item did not fit the measurement because the wheels where sticking out? I had to pay $99 dollars. I was told it’s cheaper online but when I tried to purchase I could not and it kept saying error., so I paid the $99. If you think you’re saving from the flight think twice. With baggage fees it will cost you more. Also they are very strict because they get $10 bonus if they catch you. I've flown many times and this same bag fits every airlines under seat. Lesson learned, will never fly frontier.

### "Complete joke of an airline"
Complete joke of an airline. I signed up for their yearly program, waste of money. When you try to book on their website it will boot you out half way and then charge you a higher ticket price. This happened on three different occasions and me deciding to book with a different airline. This time it happened I choose to move ahead and book the flight regardless of the price raise. As I arrive to the airport they delay the flight for 4 hrs, then 5 hrs, and 6 hours. All they are willing to do is give me a lunch voucher for a measly $10. What lunch can you buy at the airport for 10 bucks. As someone who flies a few times a month, they will never get my business and I will make sure I let everybody know the Mickey Mouse operation they run!

### "The worst flying experience"
I will never fly with this airline again. First off, there are an insane amount of hidden fees after you buy your ticket. I was charged $104 for a carry on, $12.50 to speak to someone, $25 to check in, & $34 for a seat on a one-way flight. I asked why they charge for carry ons and why so much and I was told to purchase my bags prior to coming to the airline and it would be $40. That was a lie. I purchased my bags for my returning flight prior to my departure date and it was $70 for a carry on. The cherry on top of this experience was the absolutely terrible service. My flight is delayed for four going on five hours. We haven’t had the opportunity to go get food because they couldn’t give us an estimated departure time that wasn’t 30 minutes from the last one. Their website says that if one of their flights is delayed by 3 hours then they’ll provide free meal vouchers. That didn’t happen. They boarded the plane 1 minute before the three hour mark and then never pulled off. They have us sitting in the runway for an additional hour because whatever the problem was in the first place was never fixed. The worst flying experience I’ve ever had.

### "airline isn't one I would suggest"
Not Verified |  This is the worst customer service I ever had! It's one thing I've been trying to contact them about my flight! No luck! I arrive at the airport on May 28 and the customer service acted like she didn't want to help, and was ready to move on to the next person in line. She had no knowledge on how to help me! Why have someone up there that's doesn't want to deal with customers? This airline isn't one I would suggest!

### "it was a horrible experience"
We were canceled without being notified. We had a straight flight to Las Vegas from San Antonio. We didn’t find out until the day of the flight. We were delayed 17 hours. The next flight we stayed in the plane for an hour and half. We will not be recommending anyone to this airline. They made us miss a whole day of our trip. We missed the wedding we were flying to. Overall it was a horrible experience.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline we have ever traveled, service is awful, lines are huge, and there is no organization at all. Hidden fees everywhere after booking, please avoid.

### "Employees are shockingly rude"
Employees are shockingly rude. Our gate got changed so we missed our flight from Las Vegas to Tampa and they found us a connecting flight the next day. After spending an already 9 hour day in the airport for our layover, we had to add an extra 8 hours. Employees were heartless and treated me like I was an airhead. Fell asleep on the airport floor and woke up ready to board my flight at gate e10. Get up to the front to a lady I have never seen in my life, asking me if I’ve had alcohol in the past couple of hours? Hello yes I’m in Vegas and was stuck here for almost a day! She then proceeds to tell me that my flight is at D18 as if I was supposed to know that? My boarding ticket says E10! So my bad for the confusion. I’m a very happy understanding human being but the way I was treated is literally so ridiculous for no reason at all. I’m enraged.

### "Never flying with them again"
Never flying with them again. They cancelled our flight due to layoffs that happened 2 days ago. So, we only happened to find out when we were at the GATE. And when we went to talk to customer services. They rudely told us. There are no flights to Cincinnati so just go get a refund(which takes like god knows how long). If u want reliable airlines, fly Delta or Southwest for a few extra bucks it’s worth it.

### "don’t fly cheap it’s never cheap"
Not Verified |  This is probably the worst airline I have ever seen, first I am a veteran flying with my wife and 2 kids both under age (stressful) so we get there and they want to charge me $75 just to check us in because their computer wasn’t working, then we make the line just to hear that the only person working for them decided they are going to cancel our flight because they just feel like it and there’s no one else since they don’t have any customers service there. We end up paying $700 in cancel fees not to mention we also lost our money that we paid for the bags, all on Memorial Day weekend. It’s a scam, don’t fly cheap it’s never cheap.

### "I had to pay $100 for carry on"
Went on a flight with one bag and they let me on but on my trip back I had to pay $100 for carry on even though it was the only bag I came with for free. Later found out that the workers get a incentive for charging extra carryons.

### "I will never fly this airline"
We usually fly Delta. I booked this airline for my husband and I. They don't have 1st class per se but they offer a premium package. Two times already they have changed our flight times, leaving us with a 9hour and 44min layover each time. I tried to use their Chat bot but it kept me going in circles and never addressed the issue. Then I finally just decided to cancel (which the premium package allowed) but I had to "request to be refunded" and then I had to email it to them, wait 7 business days for it to be processed and if they approve it, it will be another 7 to 10 business days for it to return the funds to my card. I have had nothing but trouble since booking with them. I decided to just pay for Delta 1st class again and just enjoy the ride. I will never fly this airline! Don't do it. You honestly get what you pay for and in this case, less than what I paid for.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. First and last time flying with them. Baggage cost 75 dollar despite them saying 30 online for 50 lb. The check in counter refuses to check you in and they require online checking which was not straight forward. The people were rude and they did not serve anything.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline. Had an assigned seat and they gave it away due to overbooking as I was in the airport. On my return flight I was charged $99 for the same book bag i brought with me. I would pay the extra for a better airline.

### "please don’t not choose this airline"
Not Verified |  Extremely unorganized, not only had long delays but they didn’t even have the flight crew thus all the passengers had to wait for a long time. Then after they started boarding they said the flight was over sold and not enough seats for the passengers, they offered us vouchers to take another flight but after our original flight left they didn’t give us more than 2 vouchers while we were promised 4 for all of my family. After I had complained they said two of us could be gone, in another word split my family to make it shorter. They mislead us totally, please don’t not choose this airline.

### "they stranded us all"
If you fly this airline they will ruin your vacation! My husband and I flew to Puerto Rico, it was a beautiful vacation but trying to get home was the worst travel experience of my life. When we arrived for our departure flight we were told the plane had departed an hour before it's scheduled departure, clearly a lie! So us and the 20-30 people in line with us were told we were too late and would be stranded for 3 additional days not hours. We were told we would not be refunded and that no hotel accommodations or food vouchers or anything else would be provided to us. The agent told us if we needed to "think about it, we needed to get out of line". So basically book for 3 days from now with no plans and get out of line. At this point another agent (Sharon Ayala) steps in and threatened to have us banned from the airline if we did not leave immediately. We were calm and polite and they were rude an extremely aggressive. We asked for a supervisor, she refused to give us the name of the agent who threatened us then pretended to process a refund for us. Turns out she had just tapped around on the computer but done nothing at all. So in real life Frontier had overbooked the flight by many passengers but did not send any emails or anything to let us know. They bumped us all then lied to our faces about it. Even a couple hours notice would have changed everything for all of us but they let us all show up, check out of our hotels then they stranded us all. Me, my husband and at least 20 others were stranded and had to purchase flights from real airlines costing us thousands of dollars! Then they pretended to give a refund knowing we would be gone already. My husband had to threaten a lawsuit (in chat because there is no call center) to have a real refund issued. When Frontier responded to my complaint they said the flight had actually been delayed. So the agent lied about the plane being "already gone", the supervisor lied about doing the refund and days later they still will not admit that they bumped us all with no notice! Basically company policy is lie, lie and then lie and if anyone asks questions call security because we don't give any accommodations for any reason and be rude above all. We ended up spending 10x what the Frontier flights costed us to fly with someone else last minute. We spent the night in the airport, my husband missed a day of work, my kids missed an unplanned day of school and it tainted our wonderful vacation. The worst part of all is how incredibly surprisingly nasty and rude all of the Frontier employees were to us when we hadn't done anything wrong. Never experienced anything like it! Not sure how this airline stays in business with service like this!

### "never set foot on another Frontier plane"
It is incredible how much this airline has gone downhill. I have been flying with Frontier for at least 10 years making several trips a year without a problem. It has always lacked in comfort but it made up for in price. My trips are quick so a personal item is not an issue until last night. After the flight being delayed we go to board and the person scanning our tickets scans my husband's, then mine, then tells my daughter to go put her bag in the sizer. She then looks at me and says you too after my ticket was scanned. My husband was just left standing there not knowing what to do. After my daughter and I show the bags fit we go back to the lady and she refuses to let my daughter continue. She tells my husband to board and wants me to go board. By this point my daughter is confused and scared. The person refuses to tell my daughter what to do she told me I could go ahead and board since my ticket was scanned and I refused and stayed with my daughter. The lady continued scanning all the other passengers and would not speak to us. Then she told the other person at the desk to call someone, which I took as security on us. Finally, she tells us to talk to the other person at the desk and he told us to go ahead and get in line. We did and she let us pass. The harassment did not end there, once on board she came aboard and made a point of getting our seat information and appeared to say something to the crew about us. I will never set foot on another Frontier plane and I will share my experience with everyone I can. I understand that people try and get away with oversized personal items but ours fit in their sizer and we were still harassed. This is suppose to be a fun joyous time going somewhere. It is not worth the savings.

### "flights to and from were delayed"
I have never in my life experienced anything like this, all my flights to and from were delayed. I have been trying to make it home for 36 hours and these people are not responsible or accountable for their actions. I was trying to get home to Charlotte NC from San Diego, I could have driven home faster than this flight is getting me home this is ridiculous.

### "the flight had been cancelled!"
Not Verified |  I purchased tickets to fly my sons from Tampa to Atlanta for their brother's wedding. Just prior to arriving at the airport for the flight we received a notification the flight had been delayed 58 minutes. A flight delay isn't uncommon, but shortly after getting to the gate we received another notification stating the flight had been cancelled! No reason, No options, No nothing and no one at the ticket counter to assist. The staff abandoned the area and could not be found anywhere. So the airline sends me an email with a link to check alternate flights, all of which arrive after their return flight. So, we receive an email voucher for $100 each to be used on a future flight. Then they charge us $80 for a cancelation fee for canceled return flight.

### "I asked for a flight credit"
I asked for a flight credit on my return flight home because I booked the wrong day and wanted to rebook and they told me I have to purchase a brand new ticket. This reservation has been made under 24 hours and no credit will be refunded to my account or credit card. AND I have to pay a cancellation fee.

### "ended up losing money"
My returning Flight got delayed and then cancelled 30 minutes before departure. Frontiers “options” all got taken immediately by other passengers on the flight. I was set to fly out Sunday night but Frontier could only partially reimburse me for a flight back on Wednesday. I couldn’t afford to stay that long so my family had to rent a car to drive from Texas to Vegas. They refunded us for the flight back but we still ended up losing money. I will never fly with them again.

### "Worst airline you can ever pick"
Not Verified | Worst airline you can ever pick. I have seen better airlines in 3rd world countries. They have a disrespectful attitude, the charge you enough for your bags that you could’ve paid Delta or United for 3000 times the customer service and policies. They were exposed for giving incentives to charge customers extra for bags.

### "do not give this airline a dollar"
Not Verified | Whatever you do, do not give this airline a dollar of your money. The “savings” are not real. The all in cost is comparable to other airlines, the difference is other airlines treat you well compared to Frontier, and that’s saying something. The airplane is DISGUSTING. Public transit is cleaner. I understand their pricing model, and paid for their perks package. At the airport leaving my vacation, my bag magically gained 5 lbs between the hotel and the airport. The Frontier employee told me it would be $50, or I can pay him $30 cash. The airline encourages employees through commission to Nickle and dime you. That culture is evident in the entire interaction with this airline. Air hostesses are inconsiderate, rude, on their phones, and I don’t feel safe and cared for, and knowing my life could depend on them was unnerving. Nobody should be subject to this experience. Absolutely horrible. I will take a train or drive myself over flying with this horrendous company that thinks it can even call itself an airline, rather than the scam it is.

### "flight got pushed back by 12 hours"
They came out and lied to us. Our flight got pushed back by 12 hours. The staff stated it was because MIA was closed due to flooding but I called the Miami airport and was told they were fully operational. I had a time sensitive event so had to purchase a ticket on another airline to a different city just to make it on time. Frontier has consistently lied to me and refuses to refund me because I didn’t get on the flight twelve hours later. I would have missed my event. They have zero customer service. You cannot speak with a human. I hope it was worth it for them to not refund me. I buy tickets with Frontier regularly but never again.

### "hands down the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This airline is hands down the worst airline there is! They lure you in by advertising cheap flights with free personal item, but at the gate I ended up paying $100 for it, even tho it still fit under the seat with even some room to spare! And they did this to many people on my flight, not just me. I demand a refund! I've used the same personal item on many different airlines, and Frontier is the only one to charge me for it. And they charge ridiculously, only for it to fit anyway! They need to upsize their sample compartment to match what actually fits under the seats. No wonder they have so many horrible reviews!

### "I was terribly disappointed!"
We purchased a baggage carry on for my wife and I had a carry on, she boarded early and I had to board later. I had 2 water bottles purchased in the airport with me strapped to my bag and was flagged to check my bag size. The water bottle put me just over, and was demanded to pay for another bag before the doors shut! They would not let me put the bottles in my pocket or in her bag (already boarded). I was terribly disappointed! Abusive and unprofessional.

### "Horrible customer service"
I will never use this airline ever again! We had a ticket for many months to return home to Cincinnati, OH to Orlando, FL. Our plane never changed for many months. Upon arrival, we board our plane on time. Minutes after boarding, an announcement is made that this plane is now going to Iceland and we are all to get off of the plane. How does this happen?! They then had us wait for another plane for over and hour. Once that second plane arrived, we boarded and sat waiting for departure for over an hour, only to be told the plane had mechanical issues and would not be able to fly and our flight was completely cancelled? Customer service gave us “vouchers” to get a new plane that didn’t even work! Then, they ignored my calls and messages after the fact! Our family had to pay over $100 for another day at a hotel as well as over $400 for the only flight available to Ohio. An absolute nightmare! You think you’re saving money but it’s actually a huge scam. You have to pay a lot more extra to bring a carry on bag. All snacks and drinks are charged to you. No entertainment or wifi. Horrible customer service. A company full of greed. We rode with Delta on the way home and it was wonderful.

### "Never flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. Bought seats and we were placed in different seats. Also you can't bring little bag on plane free of charge. Never flying with them again!

### "never met such rude people"
It’s difficult I describe how bad this airline is. They charge for you to sit with your family. They failed to recognize my service animal. I have never met such rude people. From top to bottom they are vile. Never use them

### "you will be saving not flying Frontier"
We were charged $400.00 for small personal items that we always carry in any other airlines. I believe they are making commissions trying to charge you for your personal items. They charge you out for everything except for the air you breathe. They advertise cheap but ends up more expense and the bad experience you have on your vacation is terrible. Never fly this airline. Pay a little more at another airline save yourself a bad experience on your vacation. At the end of the day you will be saving not flying Frontier.

### "No more trips on Frontier"
Not Verified |  We arrived at charlotte and checked in at desk with our prepaid bag (which we weighed at home to be sure it was under 40lbs.) The agent was great, checked our bag and gave us our boarding passes. In Denver when returning to Charlotte, we were told if we didn't have digital pass we would have to go to special area for assistance. Upon arrival we were told $25 each to print boarding passes. No choice, we agreed and received passes. When We get home we not only have the $50 charge but also another charge for $75? Never mentioned to us at desk. My wife and I are in our mid 70's and don't do much with computers and did receive e-mail stating $25 each for bag ticket or seat somewhat confusing. We live in NC and have family in Denver area and hopefully plan many more trip for both sides of family in the future. No more trips on Frontier! I am very disappointed in these charges ($125) and requested refunded or at least the $75 which we were not told.

### "This airline is horrible"
This airline is horrible. My flight was @ 5:36pm I was at the airport @ 3:36 pm for early check in and flight was delayed 2 times and we had to de- planed for the second time because sfo wouldn’t let them land, second reason they can’t find anyone to crew up the flight. Whatever reason that maybe, I waited 7 long hours in the Phoenix airport for nothing. I could not attend my son’s important graduations and my grandson‘s bday. I had to spend extra $ to Uber home. I wouldn’t recommend this airline at all.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  First and last time with this airline. Had a 5.30pm flight schedule, got notice of delay until 7pm. Then got a notice it's only delayed until 5:45pm. Rush to airport. Delayed again until 6:20pm. Hang out at Gate. 6:20pm we barely start getting boarded. Sat on the tarmac until 7:45pm, and not a single word from the pilot or the stewardesses the entire time offering any explanation. Horrible experience and waste of my time. Just because they are affordable doesn't mean decent customer service should lack.

### "horrendous customer service"
Frontier is hands down the worst airline I have almost flown. Upon getting to the airport our flight was delayed by 40 minutes, after 40 minutes it was an hour and then we finally boarded the plane. Upon boarding the plane we were held for another 2 hours and then told to get off and go sit back in the airport. After sitting in the airport for another 45 minutes they announced that the flight was not going to go out but we needed to return at 8:30am. I picked up my bag, went home to sleep for 2 hours, went back to the airport only to find out there was no 8:30am flight and that the only option was to rebook 2 days later. I understand planes have mechanical issues but the biggest issue is the terrible customer service. From the gate agents to every Frontier employee (except 1 nice flight attendant) it was as if they did not care about the customers at all. After coming back home (3 uber trips now) the only way to speak with anyone is by Chat. Since there was no way for me to make it to Atlanta where I was meeting my husband I asked that they helped to change his flight to come home today (we were both flying home Sunday together). The agent said that was impossible and his flight had nothing to do with my flight ... again horrendous customer service. In the end, they did refund my flight but we had to pay an additional $300+ to change his flight. I had always heard bad things about Frontier and now I know why. Beware if you are going to fly with them!

### "believe a refund is in order"
I have enjoyed flying your airline occasionally over the years. My most recent trip was in December; I had a pleasant flight from Chicago O'Hare to Las Vegas that departed at 12:42pm, with a late morning return flight three days later into Chicago Midway. You have even had nonstop flights sporadically from my home airport (ORD) to El Paso, which I enjoyed on July 18, 2019. Based on my pleasant experiences, I purchased the GoWild! pass in November 2022. I was eagerly looking forward to even lower-cost flights for a year beginning May 2. Then your airline seriously curtailed service out of O'Hare, leaving just a few daily flights to Atlanta and Orlando, cities I do not visit. Midway is available to me, though it is much more distant from my home in Hoffman Estates. Unfortunately, the flights west are often late at night, particularly MDW-DEN. Tomorrow (May 12) it departs at 9:19pm and on Saturday, May 13 the MDW-DEN departure is even later at 10:24pm. Neither arrival allows me to change planes to other western destinations, necessitating an inconvenient and expensive hotel layover in Denver. Based on the reduced service out of O'Hare that occurred since I bought my pass, and the current inability for me to conveniently reach El Paso to visit my family, I believe a refund of my GoWild pass is in order.

### "The worst customer service"
Not Verified |  The worst customer service I’ve ever seen from an airline. First time flying Frontier with my 3 small children and the airline had no worry or care for anything or anyone around them. Flight was at 6:05am got to the gate at 5:55am. They would not let us on our plane and made us go all the way to luggage check, book a new flight (9 hours from then, with now a layover), go thru TSA all over and had to sit in the airport for 9 hours with our kids, and an additional 3 hours at the next airport). I never write reviews but I swear this was the worst experience I’ve had in my life. Never had I missed a flight or been treated like this in an airport. You have to pay a ridiculous amount in luggage fees, seats to be by your family (kids) and for snacks or drinks on the flight with no Wi-Fi which I’ve never seen either. Thank you Frontier! Never again

### "book a reputable airline"
Frontier trapped me and 179 other passengers for 3 hours after landing like prisoners because one of their planes was broken down in our gate. This was after the first flight was delayed two hours. They’re response was a template email offering me a paid subscription service for flights and a push to apply for a annual fee credit card. Unbelievable. Pay the extra $20 and book a reputable airline.

### "I always look forward to flying with Frontier"
I absolutely love Frontier, the flights are extremely reasonable, and for me, they have always been on time taking off, and every single time I’ve flown with them we land 30 minutes or so early. Another thing that I really like about Frontier is the how polite the flight attendants are. The planes are very clean, and well-maintained. And I always look forward to flying with Frontier.

### "My suggestion is stay away"
Not Verified |  They advertise low prices then collect everything from you starting from backpack size to seating you with your family. We bought three tickets. They put two of us together and the third person somewhere else. We asked for fix and were told to ask in the airport or buy the seat for extra $44. The original price per ticket was $48. The. Long story short at the airport we were told that we need to ask the flight attendant. Flight attendant simply told us that we should have purchased it to be together. They collect $65 for any bag each way. You can’t take carryon with you on board. They were measuring backpacks and if some passengers would have a bit more in the standard backpack they charged $99 at gate. We luckily were not among those guys. Then they scrap you with in flight sales. If you want a tea they give you the 8oz hot water for $3.53 then give you a packet tea and ask for tip with min suggested 15%. They gate checked my baby’s folding stroller that always fits in overhead compartment. They basically smashed folding hinges of a $600 stroller. My suggestion is stay away. Buy more expensive tickets you will pay less. I can tell that for sure. It was my first and last trip with this garbage airline. If you don’t think it will happen to you then good try it for yourself. I learned it the hard way.

### "ridiculous with the extra charges"
If you are thinking of “saving” money when choosing between Frontier, United or American Airlines. Do yourself the favor to paying the extra cash and go on United or American. Frontier is ridiculous with the extra charges for seats, carry on bag. Paid $100 for my personal bag to be charged as carry on because it was a few inches off the size while other people with the same brand bag went passed and weren’t asked to measure it. You are better off with American which allows you a carry on bag and a personal bag on top of the checked bag being 50 lbs while frontier is 40lbs. You think you are saving $100 but when adding up the bags and seat it doesn’t make sense.

### "I will not fly this airline again"
I am a 50 year old seasoned traveler and have never experienced the multitude of issues I have endured with frontier airlines. Three out of four flights I have taken in the last 30 days have been severely delayed due to airline error and at no time have they taken accountability, nor compensated the passengers. I will not fly this airline again and I would not suggest this airline to anyone. Not worth the time or money. I was actually anxious to take my last trip with them because of all of the negative experiences I have had with them and was worried they would ruin my vacation which is exactly what happened. The only reason I am writing them a one is because I could not give them a zero.

### "disgusting and disrespectful"
Not Verified | I hate this freaking flight they have cancelled my flight after I checked in for it. Made me pick another flight which it was 6 hours lay over , They had delayed my flight 3 time before getting on the first one. They had started to scan people but couldn’t get on the plane because they was not ready so they had to come back out. Said it was going to 30 minutes till we can get on the plane. They really took their time to get us on and getting to Las Vegas which it’s was 3 hours flight. People who had another flight right after almost miss there flight because the plane got there late. Took forever getting off the flight and they cut the light off and back on like we was not getting off. I’m not sure why it took so long to get us off like they didn’t open the door. My next plane was hours to wait but when the plane got there they were trying to get four people to give up there seat. Took a long time to get on the second flight and to take off. You have to pay everything on the flight so there drink and snacks that was supposed to be for free was not free at all. It took me 2 days which was supposed to be one day getting home from my trip which is very uncalled for cancelling people flight with out notice or even not knowing what we have to do the next day like work was just disgusting and disrespectful. They are rude and don’t care that people trying to get home.

### "service was horrible"
Worst option, service was horrible, airplane so old, we paid for one carry one $ 75, when I come back for the same we paid $ 99. Attendant so rude, the flight late. We need to understand that look “a good price” but the price and service was really bad, pay in other airlines and feel better. No wifi, no movies, no service.

### "It’s just not worth it to book with Frontier"
Don’t do it! They cancel a ton of flights same-day for no discernible reason. They’re too cheap to have “transfer agreements” with other airlines so they can only rebook you on Frontier, which often means being stuck in a city for days. They don’t provide hotel or meal vouchers, because again, they’re too cheap. Not only do they not do transfers, but the check-in staff in Charlotte got belligerent with me when I asked about it, and lied to me and said that doesn’t exist. They were shockingly rude, kept wandering off while over 100 people were in line, and were having trouble reading & writing. It’s just not worth it to book with Frontier, ever. You’ll end up paying more in the end, and you’ll lose hours, or maybe even days, of your life.

### "will never deal with Frontier again"
Not Verified | My flight was booked with flighthub to fly with Frontier in February. Frontier sent me an emergency mail to contact them regarding my flight. I did and the agent said my flight had been cancelled and they will rebook me. After two hours of back and forth I was booked on a Delta flight which cost more and my check luggage was an extra cost but was included in Frontier fare. I was also told I was going to be fully compensated/refunded. All extra cost and confirmed by a manager. Six weeks later no refund, I contacted Frontier and was told my flight is not cancelled so now Delta has charged me and I'm booked on two flights. After two weeks an agent finally told me I have to cancel the flight myself. By this time the agent phone number is no longer in service and never received a return call from her for all the messages I left her. I had to cancel it on flighthub website. I was refunded my fare only. To this day no refund for the extra fare or luggage fees. I requested to speak to a manager was told none us available. Requested that a manager contact me, nothing to this day. I will never deal with Frontier again very dishonest company and their customer service is less to be desired. After the fact I checked their reviews and no wonder they are rated a two, soon they will be a zero.

### "Do not even think of this airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible while going from Ontario to Atlanta. While going back from Atlanta to onario Canada, I was at airport for 4 hours, still don't know when I fly from Atlanta. At least ground staff in Atlanta ok. Do not even think of this airline

### "will never recommend or fly again!"
Flight was boarded and then there was some maintenance that needed to be completed which delayed the flight. Instead of leaving us on the plane, we disembarked. Then we were notified the work had been completed. Only to board the flight again and wait for 2 hours on the plane while they worked on paper work and tried to reroute the flight due to the arriving airport customs was going to be closed by the time we got there. Flight was then canceled after we has been sitting on the plane for over 3 hours. So then resulted in being suck in Punta Cana for the night. Customer service was contacted and all that was offered was a voucher that expired in 90 days! Worst airline and will never recommend or fly again!

### "a caring and kind person."
Julius was such a caring and kind person. He truly cares about those they fly with the airline. Has solutions. To complex problems. He adds so much value to the company. He made the experience possible for me.

### "Staff completely unprofessional"
One of the worst airlines I have ever had the displeasure of flying on. Came to get on the plane, agent at the front desk had a snotty attitude, told me she wasn’t “willing to deal with me today” and held me up for another ten minutes with a hissy fit. Staff is completely unprofessional, behaves terribly and runs the airport worse than some ghettos I’ve been in. Avoid if you can, save more, buy a different tickets because the service is the worse I’ve ever seen in any industry.

### "not recommend flying with Frontier"
I would not recommend flying with Frontier as of May 2023. I use their service for the lower cost flights but I ended up paying even more than Delta or Southwest with their up charge right at the gate. I was wearing my backpack for the flight and they said it wasn’t within the right parameters, and I ended up paying another $80. After doing the math, it would have been cheaper flying with Southwest, but I have less accommodations. I seriously advise not to fly with them if any other options are available. I promise if you do the math, it will cost you more compared to other flights.

### "Absolutely atrocious service"
We were seated at our gate in Orlando an hour prior to boarding, along with another woman, who was sitting in the very closest seat to both the boarding gate and the agent desk. There was not a single audible boarding announcement made by the representatives at the boarding desk or the gate. We were in a later boarding group, so waited our turn, and approached the gate as the last person in line was scanned through. The other woman also approached the gate as the last few people in line were scanned through, and had not been standing in the long line because she is pregnant. The gate was shut in our faces and we were not allowed to board the already-delayed flight, despite immediate requests made to the gate agents met with nothing but silence and then rude responses. Multiple passengers in the gate area attested to this mishandling by your gate agents, and the fact that protocol was not followed. We were forced to pay $99 per boarding pass for a later flight, as they did not allow us to board the flight we paid for, even though we were present at our boarding gate well before boarding even began. We were charged for 3 boarding passes, for myself, my husband, and the other woman who was denied boarding the plane. The woman was issued a boarding pass for a flight that had already taken off 12 hours prior, but did not realize this until she was denied entry the following day to the flight she was told she was being issued a boarding pass for, as she does not speak English, and did not expect to be issued a pass for a flight that had already taken off. There are absolutely no accessible channels for recourse, as they have eliminated the ability to call customer service or speak to a person over the phone. They instead route you to a “chat-bot” who MIGHT re-route you to an international chat center with absolutely no ability to actually assist, as they are not part of the company. Absolutely atrocious service by an absolutely disgraceful company.

### "nothing but a money grab airline"
Not Verified |  Do not fly this airline. I purchased the bundle to include checked bags and carryon. When trying to use kiosk my to print luggage tag, the purchase was not found. Apparently you have to go into the app and add the bags during precheck. Why? They were already purchased. Anyways, waited in baggage check-in for an hour. When I got to the desk the agent told me about the app check-in. I asked if she could just print it there and she told me I would have to pay an additional $25 for her to print the ticket. So I asked her if I could go print the ticket and come right back, no I would have to get back in line. As it turned out my bundle actually did include "agent assist" and it took a supervisor to come over and inform the girl who had been rude up to that point. Nasty agents and nothing but a money grab airline. You think the tickets are cheap but the ala cart service turns the airline into a nightmare. Better to pay the extra 75$ on another airline and not be left in frustration.

### "I had to pay USD100 for a personal item"
Frontier Airlines: Flight 1015: I had one personal item with me which weighed 16.5 lbs (7.5 kg) containing only clothes. The person at the gate charged me for the bag because the strap of the bag came out of the personal item measuring box. When I tried to put the strap inside, he yelled at me and won't let me touch my own bag. I threw out an umbrella and a pair of heavy joggers and put the bag in the measuring box again. This time it completely fit and there was even space on both sides, but the guy said that it's the same bag and I have to pay USD100. That was outrageous considering he let other passengers pass who put two bags in one, in front of him, to avoid paying. I had to pay USD100 for a personal item which was supposed to be included with the fare I already paid.

### "offering to pay us off 400$"
Somehow my luggage was lost on the way home. Frontier hasn’t been much help as to answers on where or how this could have been lost. They are offering to pay us off 400$. Well the issue is we have things in that bag that can’t be replaced. This trip we got married. So my wedding dress, and all our wedding paperwork is in that bag. I’d like some answers how this even happened when we watched the lady helping us scan our bag and put it on the belt to be loaded on the plane. Not to mention we paid 150$ just to check a bag. 400$ is an absolute slap in the face to offer us as shut up money.

### "Terrible day on Frontier"
Terrible day on Frontier. Orlando special services desk forced me to fly on to PHL knowing I would miss my flight. With no help to get me to my destination. They are sending me to Vegas only to have to spend the night and hopefully get to my destination tomorrow. Vouchers for food is NOT enough to cover a meal in airports. We bought the Frontier go wild deal for the summer. Totally a hoax, Fly for free. Suppose to fly for free. My first summer flight costs more than $136.

### "beware of flying Frontier"
We arrived at SLC on time and parked at the gate to deplane. Before deplaning the pilot came on to say we would not deplane as another Frontier flight was landing right behind us and would use the same gate to deplane. Our plane with us still aboard was moved to another site on the tarmac where we were allowed to sit to over an hour while the other plane deplaned passengers and then loaded passengers for the next flight—all while we waited, then moved to the same gate and were allowed to deplane. I complained and the response was a nonsense response as our delay was do to weather. It was a fine day in SLC. My advice, beware of flying Frontier.

### "no one works at customer service"
Not Verified | Frontier is the worse airline please, do not ever book with them. First of all, no one works at customer service and the stupid chat robot makes no sense. Pay and fly with Delta, and the agents in Montego Bay are disrespectful.

### "No one working at Frontier"
Not Verified | The cheapest flight because no one uses them. Won’t let you check in until 2 hr prior to the plane leaving. No one working at Frontier and between Spirit and Frontier they’re fighting for dead last! Do not buy tickets from them spend the extra money and get on your flight and have options for flights!

### "$65 for each of my carry on"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight to leave at 5:30 am and 2 days later they changed my flight to 9:30 pm and when I called to change it back to 6 am they charged me $150 and tried to charge me for assigned seating again. I paid $75 for each checked suitcase, they told me in the beginning that my carry on was free, but when I got to the counter they charged me $65 for each of my carry on luggage and was told it was for round trip, so I paid it to late to turn back now. So we fly from Cleveland to Orlando get off the plane go to get our checked bags off the carousel bags come out covered in grease and the front pouch on one the zipper was broke and rip opened. So on the way home I had frontier tape my bag up and remember they told me I paid for round trip for my carry on we’ll make it to the gate and they charged me $99 for each one of my carry on bags. What a ripoff.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Frontier is by far the worst airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying on. Under no circumstances would I recommend this airline. So, Pre covid I flew, on them. Back then they had phone customer service which I’ve heard they have since cut. So, I called to resolve an issue, their phone prompt robot asked if I’d like to leave a customer review, and if I did, I’d be immediately transferred to an agent. So, I agreed, and then tried to resolve my issue. They did not resolve my issue. So I left a bad review in their system and called back, hoping to try again. This time, when the automated prompt asked me if I’d like to leave a review, I said no. And they put me on hold. So, I finally got to the agent, and I told them the above story, and there was an awkward silence. It got kind of heated, and as the call was wrapping up I said I’d be happy to leave a review now. And the agent cut the line. Jump to today, I’m searching for flights, and Frontier keeps coming up as the cheapest option. So, I’m thinking of biting the bullet as all other flights are about 2x -3x more expensive. I get to the check out, and they say I can save money if I sign up for their membership. Which is ~$60 a year with a ~$40 processing fee. I do not want to, but they make it so you are unable to finish the booking on their website without agreeing or logging in. This company is terrible, and on all 4 variables of the business equation they fail. Service: terrible Price: seemingly good and above average, but if you dig deeper, they nickel and dime you for everything..

### "Live and learn and buyer beware"
Budget airlines are great if you don't need their expensive bags or frills. However, when they cancel your flight within hours for no reason with no options other than another carrier, it can cost you hundreds more to book with another airline. Customer service sucks! Just because by law they do not have to make it right a good company would do something for their customer!! Live and learn and buyer beware, because when it happens to you, you will understand! Their budget flight cost me an extra $500. Where's the deal now? ?

### "such poor customer service"
Not Verified | Do not fly Frontier Airlines. I have never in my life experienced such poor customer service (which can only be done through a chat service, WhatsApp, or email). I originally booked a round trip nonstop flight from LAS to IND. The departing flight from LAS got cancelled BY Frontier. The first representative on the chat service ran me through the ringer and I ended up with two flights departing from IND to LAS on two separate dates. He left the chat before I was able to get him to fix that. Upon speaking to another representative, I ended up with just a one way flight from LAS to IND. I drove all the way down to the airport in hopes of speaking to a representative (in person) who could resolve the issues that the chat service representatives had created. A customer service desk representative and the manager on shift both told me there was nothing they could do and directed me back to the chat service. The third representative on the chat service told me I would have to pay $131 for a returning flight (IND to LAS). So now I am out time and money and I don’t even know if I have a flight at all. What an absolute joke.

### "Frontier counter workers were useless and no help"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying Frontier. I started with a non stop flight to Punta Cana DR from Atlanta GA and return back from Punta Cana DR to Atlanta GA no stop. It changed from Atlanta to Chicago then to Punta Cana DR and return non stop back. Change again Punta Cana DR to Miami FL them to Atlanta GA. The change over to Punta Cana was not a problem, but flying back was. In Miami it was a 8 hour lay over that turned into 14 hours and 5 flight time changes. I tried to call Frontier and no telephone only email or chat. Which was useless. The Frontier counter workers at Miami were useless and no help. After traveling for 26 hours we finally made it back. I spent over 20 years in the military and have flown all over the world in the last 45 years of flying. The is the worst experience flying ever. I would not recommend this airlines to any one.

### "makes you pay for everything"
First and last time flying with frontier! This company makes you pay for everything. I flew American going to Vegas and flew back Frontier. American charged $30 per bag no complaints! Frontier charged $75 per bag I had 3, then 2 of my bags were 4 and 5lbs over they charged another $75 for both bags! Also they only seats they had left open we had to pay $42 a seat for 2 seats! Also if you don't check yourself in at the Kiosk they charge another $25 Then once on the plane they charge for a coke with ice! What a rip off this company should be ashamed and should not be able to call themselves a real airline.

### "pure horror experience"
Frontier sent us a message that our flight had been delayed by 1hour. This was sent hefore the 3hr arrival time requirement. We would not have missed our flight, we chose to wait to avoid some of the airport hassles and not spend an extra hour at the airport since our flight was now 4hours away. They cancelled the delay, forced us to get another set of tickets and cost me over $1,000 to get home. Because Frontier provided me with false information, I believe it was a tactical message sent to potentially make people miss the flight because of oversold flight. The streamline process in Cancun is worse than anywhere i have ever flown. When I got there to check in early they wouldn't let me, told me I had to wait an hour then we left and got that message. So I am not keen on ever repeating business. Frontier has forever lost my business. In the hundreds of flights I have taken, I have never had this happen until now. I was bombarded with rules and regulations and such restrictions I have no desire. We couldn't even bring our drinks and snacks on board we had to throw them out. Per policy you cant take snacks on board, you have to buy from the airline. Then there was no in flight entertainment on a 4.5hr flight. Constant advertising harassment about the frontier mastercard, and 3 trips down the isle selling snacks. It was a money grab and pure horror experience.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience I’ve ever had in my life. They constantly delay flights up to hours at a time causing passengers to miss their connecting flights. The gate was changed at the very last minute from one side of the airport to the complete opposite side of the airport. With the gate change, passengers were literally running and taking trains in order to get to their new gate only for the flight to be delayed for almost 3 hours. I will not be flying with Frontier ever again.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Terrible attitude at the checking area. 2 pounds over, they charged us $70. Why not have a scale for customer before they go in the line. Stay away, I will never fly with them again. I should have read the reviews

### "suggest to use any other airline"
Writing this as we back out of our gate. One small personal item is all you get with your ticket, and about half the people boarding carry backpacks. They all end up paying $90 at the gate for a carry on that is free on any other airline. So, without letting this experience ruin the start of my vacation any further all I suggest to use any other airline.

### "it’s the absolute worst"
Not Verified |  Frontier needs to get their life together. It's always a complete mess with a lack of employees and the ones do there are awful, there's zero reasons for a 60 min wait to drop a bag, they have reservations and flights logs weeks in advance and can gauge schedules accordingly. I think it's absolutely ludicrous we have to suffer through their terrible practices, years it’s been like this and they haven't figured their organization out. And it's well funded so there's zero excuse. No WiFi, terrible seats, it’s the absolute worst.

### "trick you on luggage fees"
They are the worst I've ever been with. they are dirty and trick you on luggage fees. You get a cheep flight but you pay in the end over 75$ + for carryon and 80+ checked bags it's a scam. I will make sure everyone I know understands how terrible this company as a whole. I will never do this again. I'd rather walk then go through this bullying to customers.

### "trying to reach out to them and they haven’t responded"
Oh my goodness for some reason, they marked my flight with a crossover as 2 direct flights, and when I got off my first plane, I asked the representative for Frontier if I had to go back through security because it was labelled that way, and she said no, but here I am at my last airport a day later since I left my keys in my bag (btw don’t do that, but I have this situation figured out now) and have been trying to reach out to them and they haven’t responded.

### "You literally can’t make this stuff up"
Never, ever take this “airline”. I would rather walk to my destination than to ever deal with their terrible policies or customer “service” people. On tonight’s flight, it took almost 2 hours to get a simple bag drop off accomplished, because the bag drop-off was completely inundated with unhappy customers. We finally get to the gate, and I could tell that there was a tough guy who was going to harass me about my backpack. I put it in the sizer and it slides in neatly. He then tells me to do it again as he didn’t “see it”. It slipped in neatly again, but the buckle from the strap caught on the top edge and he tells me that I cannot force it in. I left the backpack there, and was attempting to reason with him when a manager came over. I was annoyed, and she’s more concerned about me being angry, then with their employee giving me a hard time and trying to rip people off. I told them I was not paying and they could remove me from the plane if they wanted. By then they were too busy denying boarding for a small special needs child, because he was “over 2” and she didn’t pay for his diaper bag. You literally can’t make this stuff up. Friends don’t let friends fly Frontier.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed in this airline. On flight to destination seats were quite uncomfortable for my 6’4” frame. Unfortunately I was hospitalized during my stay in Tampa and still not feeling well for my flight home which had to be rescheduled for an “additional fee” and for my return trip we opted to upgrade for more legroom at additional cost. At the airport the flight was delayed and Frontier “downgraded” us to a smaller aircraft with no extra legroom seats. But still charged us the extra fee. Submitted a request for a refund for only the extra fee, with NO response from Frontier. Will never fly with them again. Very poor customer service.

### "The worst customer service"
The worst customer service in the business. Crew at airport were rude without any sense whatsoever how to treat a person nor a customer. My daughter’s luggage was 2 pounds over the limit and she decided to take some clothes out and placed them in my backpack and they took us out the line and put us back at the end of the line or the only other option was to pay the extra money if we wanted to do stay in line.

### "refused to take responsibility"
At 3am the day of our 6pm flight I got a message that our flight from Dallas to Chicago had been canceled. There was no explanation and weather was clear. The only flights available were late in the evening the following day with even further overnight layovers. With an urgent need to get back, my partner and I inquired with customer service via their WhatsApp about any available flights out of HOU or AUS that evening. We were told that there was one flight out of HOU with a layover in Orlando and would still get us back that night. Thus, we canceled all of our plans for the day and drove 4 hours to Houston, accruing an additional fee from our rental car company for changing drop-off location plus a much higher gas bill. When we got to Houston our flight to Orlando was then delayed so much that we missed our layover, leaving us stuck for the night until our eventually-rescheduled flight the next day. In Orlando, we had an inexcusably awful experience with onsite supervisors and gate agents. The first gate agent indicated that he had no authority, we needed to find a supervisor, and that the chances were low we would get any help because it was our fault for “missing the flight”. When we found a supervisor he was unwilling to help because it was near the end of his shift. The next supervisor helped us reschedule the flight and when we asked about lodging vouchers we were told to talk to online customer service agents because supervisors don’t have the authority to give vouchers. Customer service then told us only gate agents had the authority to give vouchers. After talking to another supervisor (who said she'd find *another supervisor* to help and then disappeared, never coming back) and then 3 more customer service agents online, there continued to be no one who made an effort to help us, instead continuing to defer responsibility to other people. After 2 hours of being bounced back and forth and looking around for Frontier staff, we finally found the original supervisor hiding in a corner playing on his phone. He then told us that we “really shouldn’t be flying to Florida in April and May because this was bound to happen'' and noted that our best chance to get help was to wait until 4am when another supervisor would arrive. He then checked our account and said that the way it was coded, the airline would not be taking responsibility and wouldn’t be providing vouchers. When we asked why he didn’t tell us this at 11:40pm when we first talked to him he shrugged and said “I assumed they were going to tell you that when you talked with online customer support”. At this point, hotels were full and shuttles to hotels were no longer running. We landed at a motel 30 minutes from the airport that had one room left, paying for a room as well as very expensive Ubers to and from due to “high demand”. The only compensation we received for this experience was a $50 flight voucher that could only be redeemed for rebooking the flight and could not be used on hotels or food. After our rescheduled flight we finally arrived back to our house nearly 29 hours after the original flight time. Frontier dropped the ball and at every turn refused to take responsibility for the situation, provide transparency, or even speak to us with respect. When we filed a complaint a few days later, they finally told us that to get help, we would need to talk to a gate supervisor.

### "Pathetic service, rude crew members"
Not Verified |  It is the worst airline. Pathetic service, rude crew members. Both ways on my trip my flight was delayed. Being handicapped I'm asked to put my book bag underneath seats where I can't even stretch my feet if I have pain or cramps. I have boarded the flight with lots of room in the over head compartment, but I was told to do that so other paid luggage passengers can have the spot. Anyway I will not fly this airline for free. My tickets were not cheap nor I was looking for a cheaper airfare. But company and the amenities are definitely not worth price nor your time.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  First and last time flying Frontier. Terrible customer service. The requirement to fit your carry-on bag in the size checker at the gate was ridiculous, and slowed down the line considerably. On top of that, the boarding pass scanner wasn’t working correctly, further delaying everyone’s boarding. The flight attendants were incredibly rude. Someone boarded our flight, dropped a bag, then de-boarded. Several passengers alerted the flight attendant staff but they didn’t care. One of them literally said “Unless you can identify the exact bag this person dropped off, there’s nothing we can do.” Zero concern. Very unfriendly the entire flight. They acted like the passengers were a nuisance to them, and our 4 flight attendants huddled in the front of the plane talking the entire 4 hour flight from Vegas to FLL. They didn’t offer water one time, but they definitely made sure that every small item be stowed in the overhead bins, even down to blankets, water bottles, etc. No common sense at all. I will avoid Frontier at all costs in the future.

### "refused to issue the refund they promised"
Not only is Frontier the worst airline I have had the displeasure of interacting with, but it is arguably the worst business that I have ever dealt with. They issued me a refund for a flight and said I should receive payment within a few days. They then decided to not tell me that anything was wrong but just not pay the refund. They tried to get around it by putting a credit in my account but then did not actually say anything to me. I noticed this weeks later and after disputing and arguing they have repeatedly refused to issue the refund they promised, which we relied on and booked another flight and changed our plans, after admitting that they gave us the wrong information. Even if it was a mistake, a business cannot issue a refund and then weeks later decide they just don’t want to pay it. This is extremely unethical. They also were very rude, impossible to deal with or talk to, and made absolutely no sense. It isn’t that hard to just treat customers with respect and not scam them. Had they simply been understanding and owned up to their mistake, I would have been a repeat customer. But due to horrendous customer service, lying, and extremely unethical business practices, I will never be flying this airline again and will spread the word about how awful they are. I’ve never seen a business act like this in my entire life.

### "charge $100 per personal item"
The worst airline ever. I started traveling with Frontier 4 days ago. One flight was overbooked, one was delayed due to maintenance and then left early before the updated time. Got rebooked and transferred to another layover port in Chicago. That flight for delayed for 12 hours. They said they would get us hotel rooms but did not fulfill the promise. Only thing they gave us is a voucher to get us into more frontier flights and just for the overbooked. For the massively delayed flights, all we got was a 10-15$ meal voucher. They failed 90% of their promises and were rude and customer service does not exist. They also charge $100 per personal item that does not fit into a tiny box. They will charge you $100 just for an overweight checked bag as well on top of the price you already paid online. They charge for sprites and canned soda on flights. Their employees seem like they are poorly trained and not ready to handle these situations. Overall, this airline will cost you more unless you don't have any addons and bring a small personal item and trust that their planes and times will be on time because if they're not, I hope you enjoy spending a night or two in the airport.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline is the biggest scam ever. Terrible customer service. Well actually no customer service. Flight was delayed and we were not informed by email nor text. It was not even on the app! The app stated it was on time. They charge for any little thing. You end up paying the same if not more as other airlines. There is also no customer service number. I will never fly Frontier again. First and last time I will make that mistake!

### "full of empty promises"
They are full of empty promises and lies. Long story short, they swapped out the plane for a smaller plane on the day of my flight, couldn’t fit everyone on the plane who was fully booked and paid and then refused to give the full voucher amount per DOT standards! Keep reading for more details: I received an email the day of my flight saying “FLIGHT ALERT Regrettably, unforeseen operational issues for your flight #102 with confirmation code XXXXX from RDU - Raleigh-Durham, NC to SJU - San Juan, Puerto Rico on March 31, 2023 required us to substitute a smaller capacity aircraft. If you have flexible travel plans and would be willing to switch to another Frontier Airlines flight, we will email you and each person on your reservation a $250 voucher*. Vouchers are only available if you rebook travel. If you would like to stay on this flight, no further action is needed.” I proceeded to check in to my flight, check my bag, and when it came to board the plane filled up and they closed the gate. About 10 people (myself included) were left in the gate area with the response “sorry, there’s no more room on this flight. You will get 4x the amount of the flight you paid as a voucher”. My bag was on that flight! Not only were the flight options to get to PR booked or having 25+ hour layovers getting me to my destination two days late. I decided to book another airline and not waste any more vacation time. Frontier only emailed two vouchers of $250 totaling $500, instead of the full & $1500 refund amount promised. I have tried for a month through claims, created an incident ticket, tried calling and emailing customer support, and re-visited the RDU airport twice in attempts to resolve the situation. I was told via claims that the flight was completed (sure my bag completed the flight but I didn’t!) and no reimbursement or credit would be made. I will never ever fly Frontier willingly again.

### "customer service was useless"
Not Verified | HORRIBLE experience! From the price (extra for carry-on, seats) to the flight. My granddaughter and I arrived 2 hrs. early. Flight was delayed (crew timeout), moved to a different gate, delayed, then finally cancelled. We were booked for a flight the following day (24 hrs. later). End of vacation, so no money and no place to go. Frontier offered no vouchers for food or room. I had paid for 2 carry-ons with my original ticket. When it was time to board (after yet another delay), the carry-ons did not show up (even though ticket agent "made a note"), and I was forced to pay $198 by rude, unprofessional gate agent. I was over $300 in the hole when all said and done (airport water is $8). Inept customer service was useless in refund the $198 extra and I only got results after emailing CS CEO directly. NEVER AGAIN FRONTIER!

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  We took a flight from MSP to SAN with a stop in DEN. The flight from MSP to DEN was late and we missed our DEN to SAN connection. Frontier had us wait in line for over one hour and then told us we were stuck in DEN for the next two days. We will never use Frontier again. The delay and missed flight were understandable. The horrible service through rebooking attempt (both in person and chat) is why I will never fly Frontier again and why I will tell everyone I know to never fly Frontier.

### "What a scam!"
Not Verified |  We bought Frontier because they had perfect non-stop flights to Vegas from BWI. Then after we purchased them, and made reservations for hotels and cars, Frontier changes our reservation from non-stop flights, to layovers. Then they changed it again for a third time a month before the trip. We paid for non-stop flights, and now the best flights Frontier has is 10 hrs and layovers. Not only that, the new flights they put us on, leave at awful times, like midnight and 7am in the morning. What a scam!

### "Hands down, absolute worst"
Hands down, absolute worst airline ever! We were skeptical to fly with them, but it was the only direct flight to Cancun. First, in STL all of their machines that print baggage tags were broken. So we had to stand in line 30 mins to get those and check our bags. We purchased our tickets 7 months in advance through Apple when booking our vacation. We purchased an early flight so we could get there and enjoy our day. But Frontier moved our flight several times in that seven months and then the flight also got delayed day of. When we arrived in Cancun the baggage claim was broken. Waited another 20-30 mins on bags. So by the time we got to our resort it was dinner time. Wasted first day of vacation because of Frontier. Then on the way home, our flight got delayed again. Our gate got moved 10 mins before boarding. You couldn’t understand any of the announcements. The staff was rude and not helpful. Then the thermostat broke on our flight and it was so cold it felt like you were standing outside on a winter day. Some people had on winter coats to keep warm. We were leaving Cancun where it was 90 degrees, so we didn’t have jackets. They said they don’t have blankets. On each flight, you don’t even get so much as a free cup of water. The seats are hard as a rock and there is zero leg room. I don’t care if I have 3 layovers on any other airline, I will absolutely not ever for any reason use Frontier again.

### "I will never fly with Frontier again"
Worst airline experience - they delayed our bag, said they don’t have enough staff to get the bags off the plane. Didn’t reimburse me for my delayed bag expenses because the claim was made at home not at the airport, I didn’t have Wi-Fi nor a representative to help me at the airport. The delayed bag caused me to change my flight, for which I was charged 300% of my original round trip cost. And when I asked for a refund or cancellation of the change (I wasn’t informed of the right amount I will be charged, the amount changed as soon as I hit pay now), they told me I will only get $70 back out of the $900 I spent. On my way back the flight was delayed by an hour because the plane needed maintenance. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "worst airline I've been on"
Not Verified | I am in the military and was expecting this vacation to be a nice and easy vacation. Nope not with Frontier. First of all, our flights changed 5 times within the span of 3 months of purchasing the tickets. Then when we get to checking our bags I show them I'm active military so I can get my baggage for free. They then proceed to question it and tried to charge me for the baggage. Then I show them that their app isn't working and the boarding passes aren't showing up. The agent sees that and says I'm going to have to charge you for printing the boarding pass even though we clearly showed on 2 separate phones that their app wasn't letting us open our boarding passes, and they still charged us $50 for the 2 passes. All they care about is getting their money. Never flying with them again. By far the worst airline I've been on, and I've been on a lot.

### "this is unacceptable"
Not Verified |  Booked round-trip flight tickets for my clients from DFW to CUN. First they where non-stop flights then changed to 1 stop in Denver. Next issue was boarding. When my clients purchased their tickets they paid and picked their seats. Once they boarded. One of my clients was called to the front of the plane. Her partner stay seated. While he was seated a women with 2 kids approached him and told him that the Frontier staff told her that those were her seats. First this is unacceptable to not discuss with the passengers that have paid for their seats that they will be moving them first. The staff should have approached my clients and discussed this with them before agreeing and allowing another passenger to claim seating they did not pay for. As a travel agent I will not be booking any more clients of mine with Frontier.

### "cannot recommend to anyone"
Not Verified | My recent flight from Orlando to Denver with Frontier Airlines was nothing short of a nightmare. The gate attendants caused a 30-minute delay by measuring every passenger's bag size to an absurd degree. Even the pilot had to come out to investigate the delay. It was an unnecessary inconvenience that left me frustrated and annoyed. To add insult to injury, I witnessed a family of four being denied boarding because they couldn't afford the exorbitant baggage fees demanded by the attendants. It was appalling to see that the attendants refused to let them wear a sweatshirt to make the bag fit, and it felt like a blatant money grab by the airline. The display of greed and insensitivity towards customers was truly disgusting. Despite complying with the personal item measurements as specified on the Frontier website, I was still charged extra for my bags. It felt like the airline was taking advantage of passengers who were headed home and in a rush. This experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth and a negative perception of Frontier Airlines. As a loyal customer for the past 15 years, I am deeply disappointed with this airline's behavior. I cannot recommend Frontier to anyone, and I will personally avoid flying with them in the future.

### "you get what you pay for"
Where the phrase “you get what you pay for” comes to life. Beyond the first 3 rows, the seats do not recline so kiss your comfort goodbye. Fine. Nothing is complimentary (snacks or drinks). Okay. Where you lost me is the absolutely outrageous baggage policy. If you are traveling with ANYTHING more than just the clothes on your back, you will pay for it. Fair, but $200 ($100 for each leg of my flight) to carry a bag on the plane. Ridiculous. Spend your money with literally any other airline where at least they’ll give you a cold drink after spending hundreds of dollars.

### "the worst experience I’ve had with an airline"
Where do I begin...the worst experience I’ve had with an airline. Both flights I booked were changed to completely different times of what I purchased. Then on top of that both flights were delayed. The biggest upset I’ve had was with the baggage issue. The clarification on checking bags and the pricing is outrageous. You’re basically paying for a whole other ticket with this airline or even more. I arrived at the airport 3 hours early and was told to wait another hour to get my bags checked in and was told I had to pay 25$ if I was more than 2 hours early. I was over 2lbs on my bag and wanted to charge me an extra 100$. I understand now with the pricing, (you get what you pay for), this will be my first and last time flying with Frontier. The customer service on the other hand wasn’t bad, just busy and looked understaffed but sometimes you can plan for certain circumstances.

### "money grab gimmicks"
Don’t believe the cheap flight prices. They end up harassing their passengers with money grab gimmicks, going as far as making every passenger size their bags before boarding. Never again

### "Zero customer service"
Zero customer service, zero comfortability of the seats and their predatory practices on bags makes their affordability almost the same as other airlines. At the time of composing this message, I have already been waiting for a gate at Atlanta airport for over an hour due to a flight delay that has lasted more than two hours. Unfortunately, this delay has resulted in us missing our connecting flight to Orlando, and we have been informed that the next available flight is not until tomorrow, which is over 24 hours away. This situation puts my employment at risk as I may miss work and potentially receive disciplinary action. Despite purchasing the Go Wild Pass with the expectation of an improved and cost-effective flying experience, we are now faced with the prospect of having to rent a car and drive to Orlando to make it there before tomorrow or pay for a hotel if we choose to wait for the next flight. This extra expenditure is a financial burden that we should not have to bear.

### "Awful customer service"
Not Verified |  First and last experience with Frontier. Horrible airline. Thought we would save some cash with the cheaper flights but they get you elsewhere. Have to pay $25 per person to have the customer service rep check you in. They charge $70 per bag. Also they will check everyone's bag at the gate to make sure they can't get some extra cash before you board. And they make you wait while they have each person make sure they fit. No complimentary drinks or snacks. The most uncomfortable seats that only recline in the first 3 rows, so forget about sleeping. Awful customer service. Will just fly delta next time.

### "do not take care of you"
Not Verified | This is the worst airlines to fly in they will charge you 100$ mid flight for your bag I got on in Omaha and my bag was able to fit under the seat as in picture and soon as I got to the next flight many people did not have money to pay the 100$ forced fee so they got left this is very inconvenient. I will never ever in my life fly Frontier ever again they also do not take care of you on the plane flight unless you pay them cash

### "Never flying Frontier again"
Worst airline experience ever. First, the flight was delayed by 4 hours. Instead of quickly getting the passengers in the aircraft, this extremely rude lady took her own sweet time to check if the bags fit the standard size. My bag fit but she sent me to the counter and charged me an extra $100. Everyone was very visibly angry at the lady for holding up the line and the whole Frontier service. Never flying Frontier again!

### "It's not worth the savings they claim to give"
On board was okay, but the counter experience was by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I checked in online and was still charged a $25 fee. Then because I was a pound over I was charged $50 and was told If I opened my bag I would have to go to the back of a line that I had already stood almost 2 hours in. So I had no choice but to pay the fee or miss my flight. (I had already paid $57 for my checked bag). I think Frontier needs to keep a closer eye on customer service. I will never fly Frontier again, and would strongly advise the person reading not to either. It's not worth the savings they claim to give.

### "Can't talk to a real person"
Not Verified | I can't actually review the airline because I was never actually able to fly with Frontier. Frontier was the return leg of a trip that never happened (I couldn't get to Phoenix to even try to make the flight). When I tried to cancel (maybe get credit for future travel?) they just hit me with $369 in cancellation fees on a total $303 booking!! Can't talk to a real person there - just the stupid chat bot (AI with no soul). I should have read their reviews, if I had I would NEVER have taken a chance with them. No wonder their stock price (ULCC) trends steadily down over 5 years. This company is a disaster.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Absolutely horrible company to fly for. Customer service at it's worse. Which to say is usually a chat bot no way to speak to a live person over the phone. You can only message them through chat. My flight was canceled twice in less then a month and they don't have another flight the same day so your choice is to fly a few days later which both times the next flight was booked from other cancellations or rent a car and you have to pay for it. If you cancel your flight 26 hours later outside of their 24 hour window you loose the ticket completely no refund and you can't get that ticket back even if that flight ends up getting canceled by them. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE the all you can fly pass. It's basically stand by even though an agent told me I could book in advance. You will be out the price of the pass and have to purchase your ticket anyways. Prices might appear to be cheap at first but not with all the add ons and expenses incurred from canceled flights and trying to get to your destination. Do not plan your vacation or trip if you're hoping to get there on time or at all.

### "return flight itinerary changed 3 times"
Not Verified |  They charge an extra 70 for carry on and checked bags! You have to pay 25 per person to check in at the service counter or navigate their archaic website and check in there for free. We did not have the extra $300+ and missed our flight that they had already rescheduled 2 times. Our return flight itinerary changed 3 times and what was already a long flight turned into 2 days and an overnight stay "at customers expense". We had to book through a whole new airline for the entire trip and we are down. $2000 because of it. Never book Frontier!

### "Horrible situation in every way"
After delay of hour and half They boarded us, a full flight. After they dimmed the lights and flights attendants took their seats, they announced that we needed to get off the plane because they didn't have enough fuel with full capacity passengers. After another half hour waiting off the plane, they announced that if the don't get 60 volunteers, that they will start boarding and once they reach weight capacity, the remaining people get involuntarily bumped with no compensation but next flight out which was 24 hours away. Horrible situation in every way.

### "Don't travel with this airline"
First time traveling with Frontier and it's was a nightmare, seven hours of delays and I missed the burial of my niece. What is the point paying for the amount? Worst services ever. And they moved the terminal around without notices what a horrible service. Don't travel with this airline.

### "cares nothing for their passengers"
Actually didn’t get to fly since fight was cancelled 20 minutes before boarding. Sent to customer service w no explanation and a 4 hour wait to talk to a representative. Over 1000 passengers for numerous cancelled flights and 3 agents. To get on next available flight we were being charged the additional cost. To change or told how to apply for a refund. Oh yeah, Return flights were subject to cancellation fees. No customer service reps to talk to anymore. Spent an hour online with a chat receptionist and resolved nothing,  got a flight 2 days later but lost $500 for no show on hotel and car rental. Frontier cares nothing for their passengers.

### "inappropriate and unprofessional"
The staff was badgering passengers standing in line about the size of their personal item (even though it was visibly apparent it was size appropriate). On board, three staff members openly mocked a passenger for asking to throwaway a gum wrapper. It was very inappropriate and unprofessional. I choose Frontier mostly due to price but these types of behaviors make people consider paying more just to get treated decently.

### "Last time I ever book with them"
Literally the worst airline I’ve ever been on. Their planes are never on time and don’t tell you it’s delayed until two minutes before boarding. They act like they offer low prices but look for any way to charge you more money. A carry-on costs $100. And when you’re checking in, they have all these tricks to try and manipulate you into purchasing a carry on. There’s no entertainment or Wi-Fi or even a plug in adapter like most other airlines. Last time I ever book with them.

### "My flight was wonderful"
My flight was wonderful. Frontier was amazing from start to finish. Larrice and Lisa were incredible flight attendants that made sure we were taken care of from start to finish. Frontier is lucky to have such wonderful people working under their airline!

### "just got worse and worse"
My flight was on 4/17 from San Francisco International to Dallas TX at 10:30am. Let's start off with the horrendous cost to check a bag over 40lbs. It cost us $200 total for checked bags for our trip which was the amount we were trying to save on tickets. So, if you think it's cheaper it's not. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable, they do not recline even a slight bit, their seat trays are so small they should be nonexistent and there is no Wi-Fi. Once we got on the actual plane it just got worse and worse as the flight went on. The "lead" flight attendant greeted our plane with insults and barking orders for us to "hurry up get to your seats and get out of the way". She was extremely rude to the passenger sitting in the isle across from me about his carry on in the bin above him and told him to fix it in an extremely rude manner. Another attendant was walking down the aisle doing a head count and she proceeded on the intercom barking at us telling us, "do not talk to him, do not look at him, no he can't answer your question, no he can't get you snacks or drink so do not ask him". She said this repeatedly until he was done doing the head count. By the way they charge for snacks and drinks, even water. A small bottle of water on this flight was $4.50. By the time we got in the air she was wearing a blanket around her like a cape and kept taking peoples babies away from them like some sort of super nanny and would take them to the back of the plane to "play with them". No, this is not a joke.

### "yelled at me and threatened me"
Not Verified |  I had a 3 hour layover in Denver and so went to a restaurant to work. I regularly checked the board. 45 minutes before the flight departure, the board indicated that my flight was likely to leave 15 minutes after its scheduled departure. As a result, I stared walking to the gate 45 minutes before the date it had stated on the board. However, when I looked at the board, the flight info had disappeared. I was staring to feel panicked because I didn’t understand how a late flight would suddenly disappear from the board, even before the flight’s scheduled time! I went to the gate and was told the flight left five minutes ago (15 minutes before the originally scheduled time). The person there said I would be put onto the next flight and go to the service desk. I went to the service desk, with another person who was in the same boat as me (who also saw the delay sign and no boarding announcement whatsoever). However, when asking for help, the three women working at the desk there were ruder to me than I have ever experienced in my life. I asked to please have a hotel and to get on the next flight but was told, no hotel, but you can pay around 500 for a flight the next day! They also said: we have no evidence on our screens that the flight was announced as being delayed. They also said there was an email to me stating they were boarding. These are clearly lies. The service desk people yelled at me and threatened me. It was very strange. My flights with this airline did not work out to be any cheaper than other flights, but have terrible service and provision across the board.

### "will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Never fly Frontier - horrible ! Cancelled flight day, with no alternatives. Phone numbers to call and rebook did not work. Went to the airport to rearrange flight from there since we could not get ahold of anyone and the staff were not helpful and not able to accommodate. Overall the worst airline I have ever encountered and will never fly with them again.

### "the worst flight experiences"
Possibly one of the worst flight experiences I've ever had. Frontier delayed our return flight initially for "wind issues" they said, but in reality they were just taking advantage of a 15 minute delay for a wind issue at the airport. I knew something was up when nothing was happening at our gate while I started seeing other planes from other airlines begin to taxi away from the airport towards the runway after 15-20 minutes. What we figured out was they were waiting on another flight to come in that was headed to our destination that was having problems and had been diverted to the Denver airport. In reality, they held us all back from our destination by 2 to 3 hours just so that they could save money and combine the passengers from two flights into one, and then had the audacity to be super strict with carry on and personal item size, with announcements that we wuld be charged for any bags that did not fit in their sizing apparatus at the gate. And that was after they had made us change gates. We should have been home shortly after midnight that night, but instead didn't arrive home at our gate until after 3am because of the departure delay. Frontier is awful in it's present budget airline mode. I flew them several times when they weren't in the budget category and their service was great and seating was fantastic compared to Southwest airlines economy seating, for example. There was more legroom and seats were generally more comfortable, but now it's 180 degrees the other way! Even my 5 ft tall wife just barely had enough leg room, but anybody much over that was pretty cramped. That was on our outgoing flight. On the flight back home we chose the extended seating, which I will give them definitely gives more leg room, but the seats are still hard as a rock. Generally airline seats have been comfortable in the past, but Frontier has definitely shifted towards the negative in a huge way in that realm! And none of the seats we had reclined at all. There might be a few select seats that do, but in general most do not from what I saw. If there was anything positive, the flight attendants were friendly, cheery, and fairly attentive, despite the late hour.

### "I’ll never fly Frontier again"
This was the worst airline we have ever traveled with. We missed our first flight cause we couldn’t find a single frontier person at the desk to help us and so they put us on a later flight and we finally made it to our vacation spot. On the way home our flight was completely packed and after they got us all on the plane and we had messaged our kids to see you soon, they announced they didn’t have a 1st officer and the flight was delayed and everyone needs to get off the plane. 30 minutes later they said our flight was cancelled and good luck getting home. They were rude and said they wouldn’t be able to fly us home for 2 more days. Didn’t offer us a hotel to stay in didn’t offer us anything. Just basically your stuck here good luck. I’ll never fly Frontier again and I’ll make sure every friend of mine knows the same. Trash isn’t the word good enough for this airline

### "customer service is such garbage"
Avoid Frontier and Fly Any Other Airline. Back in the day before it became the abomination it now is, I flew them out of Denver almost exclusively, but when they emerged from bankruptcy with new investors and owners, things have gone nowhere but south - and I don't mean Mexico. I tried making reservations for my Den-Sea flight with the over 50k miles I have in my account. Sure, the flight was 10k miles and small processing fee with taxes, but by the time I got to my various baggage and seat selection bundle options (carryon, checked bag, privilege for seat selection), my ticket cost exceeded the price of other airlines that provide one or two free bag checks. And what made matters even more infuriating, when I was about to pay for the ticket and baggage bundle ($92 each way), the site glitched and I had to start over again. When I got back to the bundle page about three minutes later, the bundle package had gone from $92 to $116 each way! There were tons of open seats ... literally maybe 10 seats were occupied, so I can only assume they were gouging me to make up for all the lost revenue in flying that near-empty plane. I tried reaching out to customer service, which since November 2022, you can only reach via a text chat, and that starts with an AI bot. Total When you finally do reach a person (still not sure if it was AI or not), they could not understand the problem and kept referring me to start over. Not surprisingly, I gave up at that point. what's the point of flying Frontier when they are so disingenuous and their customer service is such garbage.

### "Rude and disrespectful"
Not Verified |  Worst service ever! Rude and disrespectful and purposefully lied to move the line forward. Terrible! Will never fly Frontier again! Can't believe a company actually gets away with treating its customers this way.

### "Never will fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Late flying out from PHX for no apparent reason. Took 30 minutes to get off at Denver. Then connecting flight was delayed 1.5 hours. No announcements no emails no updates. Never will fly with them again. Seats are cramped. Now I’m getting into DC at midnight with a 2 hour drive home. Terrible airline.

### "left around 8 people from the flight"
We have flight last night at 11:45am. The airline change the Gate and does not inform by Speakers. At the end we notice that flight was overbooked and because not information they left around 8 people from the flight. We were in the gate and they did not announce last call or any information. At the end I lost connection from Fort Lauderdale to Bogota and the ticket because of this. Frontier admit the mistake but says that could not pay for hotel or other connections of different airlines or send us in other airline. They just locate in another flight of Frontier next day. Ticket cost me around $500us with frontier and I had to pay additional $500 in other flight. This was not a low cost ticket and did not provide any support with other airlines. I will never used when I have connections with other airlines and will avoid it to used to earn a few dollars.

### "my first and absolute last flight with Frontier"
Not Verified |  It is now 1.10 pm and I finally sat down in my seat. We are still boarding. This has been a poor show from the start. My precheck wasn't on my digital pass, no one stated I had to have a paper ticket to board. The major delay coupled with the extra cost of a carry on bag was ridiculous! This is my first and absolute last flight with Frontier. I'm late arriving to meet my husband on our honeymoon. 4 days together quickly turned to 3.

### "they had already given my seats away"
Arrived at the airport to check in but the kiosk would not let me. Had an email stating that my flight was crowded and I could swap it out or keep it. I decided to keep my flight but could not get a check-in ticket because they had already given my seats away. Then told me that I could reschedule but I would have to pay the $99. This was on a Friday and If I rescheduled I could not leave until Sunday. Not to mention you have to email them or talk to an automated service because they don't have a phone number that you can call. Now I have to buy another ticket out of pocket and hope that I'm refunded for the flight missed.

### "worst airline I've ever flown on"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is without a doubt, the worst airline I've ever flown on. Don't be fooled by the cheaper prices you find online in your searches, they will KILL you with additional fees. They are full of sneaky tricks to get you to pay more money when you arrive at the airport. Additional Fees: Need help checking in at the front counter? $25 per person in your group for that service. Need to check a bag? It better be under 40 lbs (most other airlines are 50 lbs so they trick you there) or you'll get charged an overweight fee, in addition to the checked bag fee. I had a suitcase that was 39.6 lbs, and another suitcase that was 46 lbs and my total luggage cost was $230! Got a carry on? Plan on a fee! Personal Item like a backpack or purse? It better fit in their little box before you step on the plane! Doesn't fit? Expect a hefty fee at the gate. They must have charged over 50 people on my flight for their small backpacks that didn't fit in their little box. As a result, we were an hour late taking off and everyone was furious on our flight. The Frontier flight attendants were furious at the delay by their own gate check agents. Want to sit together with your family? Better pay extra for your seats or you'll be spread around the plane. Seriously, you have to pay for even the backrow middle seats if you want to sit next to your party. Extra fees! If you think your flight will take off on time, you're dreaming! Frontier flights are delayed more than any other airline. I'm willing to bet that has something to do with all the time at the gate dealing with oversized bags and angry people. No TV's, no wifi, no snacks, no drinks, no nothing. Hard and uncomfortable seats as well. Do not fly Frontier Airlines for any reason. Most unreliable, sneaky, evil airline on the planet. It's shocking to me that they are still in business!

### "Charged my family $99 per personal item"
Charged my family $99 per personal item when the measurements were exactly what was specified on their website. Then when I contact Frontier customer care they tell me it’s the airport that designates the measurements. The gate women were very rude about any personal items and acted as if they received commission forcing people to pay that ridiculous fee. I will never fly frontier again and would recommend any person to stay clear of this airline. Lastly, the seats were pretty much like lawn chairs crammed into the plane.

### "not worth saving the money"
Not Verified |  For the last past 2 years I’ve paid for their membership. This year they charged me twice and won’t return the money acting like they didn’t. It’s so frustrating not being able to talk to someone on the phone. They take forever to respond your message like you don’t have anything better to do. The employees at the airport are so rude it’s unbelievable. It’s not worth saving the money. You’ll always end up with a headache trying to deal with them

### "fly a different airline"
I purchased myself a summer gowild pass for $399. As well as each one of my adult kids and my grandchildren. They do not tell you that it’s only 1 adult per child. 2 of my adult kids have 3 kids of their own and they’re not able to book their whole family unless another adult flies with them. Will not refund my money either. Save your money and fly a different airline. I’ll never do this again.

### "employees were really rude"
I would never recommend this airline to anyone. They employees were really rude, they were to help! This airline seems like it’s cheap but in reality it charges you for every single thing it ends up being more expensive then if you were to go with a better airline. You will most likely spend less on a higher end airline also with better customer service as well. We chose are seats together and once we got to the gate they stayed that they moved us to sit on different seats from one another, they even charged us to sit closer together and yet we didn’t even sit never to each other.

### "cancelled our flight"
Not Verified | They cancelled our flight without telling us anything when we had air BnB and everything booked. The people checking us in didn’t want to help with anything and they were trying to ignore us so we could leave. Unacceptable.

### "horrible customer service"
It’s a pretty well known fact that Frontier has the most horrible customer service. Only a good airline to fly if you’re carrying nothing on you. They will make a deal out of every item you are carrying and try to make you pay for bring it on the flight.

### "Book with a better airline"
This airline is terrible. I tried to give them a chance but each time I do my flights are delayed or cancelled. It’s not worth trying to save the money. Book with a better airline! I know I will going forward.

### "never fly with this airline again!
Not Verified |  I will never fly with this airline again. First off it cost us $280 to check 3 “carry on” bags. And that was only one way. Second, you can’t even provide free water to your passengers? ?They lost my sons car seat on our flight to Atlanta from Orlando ($250 car seat). We wandered back and forth between carousels for over an hour looking for his carseat. We had no choice but to drive 3.5 hours home at 1:30am with him strapped in on the seat with the regular seat belt. The guy working the frontier office at the airport told me to write down some information on a piece of paper, I didn’t even get any kind of confirmation number or anything from him. I got an email from the airline a couple days later with a number to call about our missing item. I called every day for a week, multiple times a day and left messages every day, even sent them two emails. I never heard from them still and that’s been a month ago. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Their fees are ridiculous.

### "very rude about the process"
My flight was canceled and I had paid for a checked bag. We were told we needed to see an Agent to ensure our bag would transferred to the new flight without additional fees. When I went to the Frontier ticket counter at Columbus the General Mgr told me I had to pay for my bag (AGAIN) and was very rude about the process. He charged me $79, I asked if he could charge me the same amount I originally paid ($58) and he said absolutely NOT! Because it doesn’t show in his computer system that I had paid for a checked bag. He even refused to look a my phone or at my Frontier account. I can’t believe a Manager would conduct themselves in such a manner! Never again!

### "Worst airline ever"
This is my third flight on frontier. I have never had an issue on any other airline before. Every one of my Frontier flights have had issues. I have had my flight listed as on time and then cancelled while waiting to board. And now 5 minutes before boarding they delay the flight over two hours. This will be my last flight with them as you cannot contact customer support for anything. Even their chat fails. They even said the flight is delayed due to weather in Nashville which has little to no wind and no chance of rain for the entire day. They seem to have forgotten people have weather apps. Worst airline ever.

### "last time I will fly Frontier"
This is the first and last time I will fly Frontier! Not only was the cost of luggage ridiculous (3 bags were $263!) but the flight attendants were rude, had little knowledge of anything and seemed to goof around with each other the whole time we waited. Our flight was delayed 3+ hours and all they could tell us was “we’re waiting for maintenance and have no idea when we’ll be ready to board”. I have a 1 year old and 3 year old and this was an absolute nightmare.

### "double the cost because of carry on policy"
My round trip flight was double the cost because of their carry on policy. The measurements for the personal item in the email are not the same at the cubbies they use at the airport to measure the size of a “personal item.” Today my flight was delayed, and rather than say what was happening over the intercom or say the information to the crowd, the attendants chose to tell one person at the front of the loading line and have them pass the word down. This took a very long time to get the information relayed. There was no update emailed until fifteen minutes after everyone had sat back down.

### "Do not recommend flying Frontier"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. While boarding the plane the attendants were standing in the aisle hollering at everyone confusing everybody and making it take longer to board the plane because they are standing directly in everyone’s way. Then once we boarded they overbooked the flight and it took them like an hour to figure out if we could fit everyone, then because they took so long we got delayed 3 hours because of a storm (which would have been avoided if we could have left on time). Once on the plane the 2 flight attendants gossiped back and forth the entire flight about other co workers and how much they didn’t like certain people. They spent so much time talking during the whole flight, nobody at the front of the plane could get any sleep if you didn’t have headphones. These were the most unprofessional flight attendants I’ve ever had. While stuck at the airport for weather we were ready to leave finally after waiting hours and the flight attendants realize that the plane is completely out of bottled water (they haven’t handed out a single water to anyone on this plane, I would know because I’m in the first row). Then attempting to get home from Orlando, I get to the airport to find out that my flight has randomly been cancelled. Do not recommend flying Frontier. This is the first and last time I’ll be flying with them as I’ve never had an experience this poor.

### "worst experiences by far"
We flew with Volaris to start our trip back home. Even though they are owned by Frontier it was a way better Experience once we got to DEN we had to switchover to Frontier we had a six hour lay over at DEN we were at our initial gate which was already a far walk since we did have a six hour wait it was fine, However the flight before us got delayed, which made them move our gate right before initial boarding chose a further walk may not seem like a big deal but since we were traveling for a long time that day, it was just a little frustrating, had no issues with Volaris with my personal bag like mind you they’re owned by the same company Frontier however made me pay $99 for a bag that fit perfectly under my seat and this is my biggest issue with them they have us measure our bags as we’re walking in to give our tickets to get on the plane which also holds up a line because if it doesn’t fit, then you need to step aside I feel as they’re measuring system isn’t accurate flying with Frontier has been one of the worst experiences by far

### "purposely creating confusion"
Awful airline, recommend saving your money, time, and stress and going on a different airline like Southwest. The amount of stress and lack of compassion with every one from their team locked in that I would never fly this horrible airline ever again. Not only do they charge you for everything, they try to finesse everything out of you by arguing and purposely creating confusion. I would not wish this airline on my worse enemy. Spend a couple dollars more and pick a different airline.

### "Honestly, just a true mess"
Literally the worst flight experience of my life. Staff had no idea what was going on, it felt like it was everyone’s first day working there. Extremely rude, probably because they were stressed because they didn’t know what was going on. Honestly, just a true mess. It was to the point where I wasn’t very comfortable flying with them.

### "Poor planning"
Not Verified | Two hour flight and we were held up for wind shear for about about hour. Once cleared we had to return to the terminal to fuel. How can an hour delay force you to return to the terminal for fuel. Poor planning. Mark Wahlberg said it best "running out of fuel as the wheels touch down is using hope as a tactic. Hope ain't a tactic Frontier!

### "will never fly this airline again"
Horrible. Waited in line to drop baggage off for 1.5 hours in Tampa. The baggage people were over 30 minutes late. Then after we landed in Rochester we waited well over an hour for baggage because Frontier had two employees working. I will never fly this airline again.

### "Frontier showed zero compassion"
I checked in and left my checked-in luggage 2 hours before my flight. I entered the security line in SeaTac 80 minutes before boarding time. The security line took 2 hours and I was late at my gate. Frontier showed zero compassion to me and 2 dozen other passengers. They pretty much told us, "How did other passenger came on time?". The plane was still there. They never made any announcement for the late passengers. And they knew they had 20+ people late but decided not to care about it. Also they sent our checked-in luggages with no way to track their status.

### "my flights were horrible"
Not Verified |  Unbelievable! I understand that they are less expensive than other airlines, but they should still have a little bit of pride in their company. I flew home yesterday from Phoenix. Both of my flights were horrible. I purchased a ticket for my grandson with his caraway. I entered his age (1) and that I had a car seat. They assigned the seat both times in the middle seat. Per their policy, car seats have to be in the windows seat. Both times I had to ask someone to switch their seat so he could sit at the window. The attendants both times could care less! There were several other crazy incidents that I can’t fit in this box. Do better!

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. I am a frequent traveler, I had this flight because of my last minute travel plan and the flight cost was cheap too. But speaking honestly about the service this airline is unreliable, irresponsible and the employees are rude, unprofessional. I am writing this review after my second worst experience with Frontier airlines (twice in a same month). Friends never suggested me this airline, now I understand the reason. Book this flight only if you are not in rush or have nothing planned for next 32 hours. My flight was delayed three times on march 16 2023. And twice on return flight of march 18 2023. Now today again april 7, 2023 my flight is delayed then canceled. I had connecting flights which is obviously not possible at this point. This is so much frustrating and irresponsible behavior at airport I have ever seen from the frontier airlines and their employee at gates

### "impersonable and uncaring"
First of all, I understood the bag policy and I adhered to it. So when I get to Rochester and they Weigh it and move me along. I expect to have the same experience on the way back to Rochester. What I do not understand is how I had to pay for a bag that I did not add a single thing to, that somehow grew 10lbs larger. I do not understand also why the people working the counter have to be so impersonable and uncaring and stare at me like I grew twelve heads. I will never use this airline again. So I sure hope keeping my $50 was worth it when I fly a lot and could have used you guys again. I’d rather take a propeller plane. Do better.

### "Never again"
ATA Rated flight case of 18x12x5 didn't fit their 18x14x9 box. When asking about the ridiculous slot size, I was told to fork over $99 or miss my flight. When I asked for a manager, I was told "Sir, pay me or don't fly". Was told to not photograph the ill-fitting box (which I did).No free water services for a 2.5+ hour flight. I was told the flight was not full and we could relocate ... when we got up to grab an unclaimed seat, I was told it would cost an additional $50 to do so. Never again.

### "seats are very uncomfortable"
Flights are cheap and seats are very uncomfortable. Charged me $100 for a carry on the fit in the measurement tool. This company is scamming people. Absolutely 0 customer service!

### "the worst experience I’ve had"
Not Verified |  I have flown a lot throughout my life, domestic and international, and this is the worst experience I’ve had thus far. I began my journey in SFO with a connecting flight to Denver with my final destination in DCA. SFO to Denver was fairly smooth. However, the last half of my journey was pure mayhem. They had delayed my flight 1.5 hours hours before even arriving in Denver, and then 30 minutes before its new departure, they cancelled the flight. Everyone scrambled to the front desk to receive new flights/be refunded. I then proceeded to wait 4 more hours for the next, which they also delayed! Finally we take off, after 8 hours of being in the Denver airport. Then the pilot struggles to land our plane to due winds. We circled for almost 45 minutes, before we finally landed. It took me almost 20 hours to arrive from the west coast to the east coast. Absolutely absurd. Also this airline nickel and dimes you for everything. Nothing is complementary, poor customer service and unreliable. I paid additional money to fly a different airline home and ate my original ticket because this experience was so bad! Invest in a better airline!

### "I hope they were delayed for cleaning"
Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia on 03/31 was delayed 90 minutes. That was annoying, but the flight was fine. Flight from Philadelphia to Nashville on 04/02 was on time, but ended up being one of the worst flights I've ever been on. During boarding, I commented to my husband that the entire flight crew seemed under the age of 35. They joked during announcements, which is pretty standard for budget flights these days. Overall flight wasn't bad. Some turbulence, but we made good time and arrived in Nashville early. But then we tried to land, and that's where things got bad...really bad. The pilot had to abort mid landing and go around the airport. It was abrupt and unnerving. It's a rare occurrence (estimated 1-3 in 1,000 landings), but it happens. We circled for several minutes before the pilot came on and confirmed that he had to abort (didn't explain why), and said essentially we were going to circle and land. 10-15 minutes later he tried again. On his second attempt he aborted again. After the 2nd abort, the pilot did explain that on the first approach the tower asked him to pull up because another plane was in the way, and on the second approach he didn't have enough speed to manage the wind. He encouraged us to turn on our air and that he had lowered the temperature in the cabin. Why? You may ask. Because it turns out that two aborted landings with tight pull ups and hard banks will make people sick. A lot of people. They told us to use the bags in the seat pockets. But there weren't any. Like none on the entire plane. At one point while we were circling, a man got up to ask for a bag and the flight attendant started yelling at him to sit down. He explained he needed a bag, and she just kept yelling at him. Others were shouting for bags, and no one had any. Someone several rows away managed to find a paper bag for the woman next to us, and she started puking. We were begging the flight attendants for help, and their response was that people should just pass around bags if they have any. The entire cabin is yelling back that there are no bags. Someone asked her what she wanted us to do if we needed to throw up. Do we throw up in the aisles? She got on the microphone and said she didn't feel safe getting up to find bags, so we just needed to "do what you need to do. At that point it got pretty quiet except for the sound of people puking. It was probably another 15 minutes for the second go around. On the third landing, we made it. The plane was dead quiet. Another flight attendant tried to break the ice by making a joke that the final attempt was "smooth like butter". It was not appreciated. Someone went off on him that "he needed to know when it was a time to joke and a time to pray, and this was NOT a time to joke. As we were trying to leave, the poor woman next to us, who had been puking into a *paper* bag for 15 minutes, stood up, and the bottom of her bag gave way. She, and the seat, and the floor were now covered in puke. We finally managed to get out and were met with a crowd of people who were already lined up to get on the plane we just got off. I hope they were delayed for cleaning. The lack of experienced flight crew turned a rough situation into a horrific situation. The pilot's inexperience likely contributed to the two aborted landings. Cleaning crew had not prepared the plane appropriately. And the attendants did not know how to diffuse a bad situation and made it much worse.

### "Customer service is shocking"
After purchasing a ticket months in advance we were told after checking in and arriving at the gate that the flight was overbooked and we probably won’t have seats. After waiting until everyone was boarded we were finally given seats. Our connection in Denver was awful. A staff member was on a power trip and said that all of my party of 3’s back packs that we brought with us from Seattle and fit under the seats were too big and not allowed so we had to pay $99 per bag to take them onto the plane! We ended up paying $118 to check 2 bags initially then $297 to bring back packs onto the plane. So you may think you have a deal with Frontier but they will nickel and dime you for everything. It cost me $415 to get our luggage to our destination! That’s almost as much as the initial ticket. Customer service is shocking. They even charge you $3.50 for a bottle of water! I will never use Frontier Ever again and I advise anyone considering it to think twice. Pay the difference to fly an airline like Alaska where they appreciate their customers and don’t charge you for everything. It will save you money in the end!

### "First and last time on Frontier"
First and last time on Frontier. Worst airline and rude customer service. They nickel and dime you to death. Nothing is included. Unlike any other airline that allows a carry-on, here you pay (a lot) for even a carry-on. And bring your own drinks and snacks too - you can get a cup of water. I would rather pay a little more and not be nickel and dimed to death. It isn’t any cheaper than any other airline once you pay for all the extras that are not extra anywhere else. And rude. Do not ask anyone at a counter a question or you will get rude snarky comments (such as - I just answered that for the guy in front of you! Sorry I didn’t hear what you told him, you don’t have to talk to me like I’m dirt on your shoe). And make sure you know how to check in and tag your own bag at the kiosk because any help at check-in is another $10 - I didn’t need it but seriously people? Do yourself a favor and fly another airline. Any other airline.

### "bad experiences every time"
The worst airline. I did my due diligence in measuring my bag and then they proceeded to charging me 100 dollars for it on an empty flight. We have had bad experiences every time we get on one of their planes. Not worth it!

### "worst customer service ever"
Never flying this airline again, worst customer service ever. I tried to give them another chance after another screw up but this drew the line. 350 bucks for a flight and I wanted to go in and update my city of arrival. They don’t give that option and online customer service says to cancel for a credit then re book, did that and did not receive any credit. Chatted back into customer service and told me that there was nothing they could do and I was getting a cancel charge on top of losing my booking. When I asked to speak to a supervisor they stated “we understand you want to speak to a supervisor but it won’t make a difference” how could you possibly treat customers today like this. In todays world customer experience is key for customer retention, you totally lost me as a customer and I am sharing this experience with everyone. Tired of these airlines taking advantage.

### "charge passengers for personal bags"
Almost two hours delay. Then they tried to charge passengers for personal bags as carry ons, causing passengers to start going over their personal belongings). Employees are unprofessional.

### "It’s all about the money"
Everything about my travels with Frontier airline was horrible. All but 1 or 2 of the self check in stations at Philadelphia were out of paper. My flight to Orlando was over 3 hours late for no apparent reason - the weather (the usual reason they give) was great. We lost our whole afternoon in Fl as we didn’t get in until after dinner time. The staff was abrupt and not friendly - especially the person hawking the bag drop line in Orlando who wouldn’t let people get in line while a family member went to check in and get the bag tickets. She made people get out of line until the bags had tickets on them even though the line was long and it took over 30 mins to get through it. Only 4 people were taking bags while 5 other employees stood around talking and laughing. Other stations could have been opened. And frontier charges for everything - from sodas on the flights, $25 per person if you didn’t check in in the app and need them to check you in, suitcases o we 40 lbs, to charging you for carry on bags. It’s all about the money. And in Orlando, there was no place to sit anywhere near my gate. People were sitting on the floor. We had to go to a whole other area to find a place to sit.

### "pick different airline"
Not Verified |  If your are a choosing Frontier Airlines for lower price, I would recommend you to pick different airline because this airline frequently delays flights, if you have connecting airline better to choose different airline. This is worst airline in my life, kindly save your money they don't even give your refund. I faced lot of differences with this airline. Choose different even though if it costs more then this.

### "attendants were completely wonderful"
Not Verified |  My family recently flew Frontier Airline. Our daughter has some chronic health issues. She became ill on the plane and needed medical assistance. The flight attendants were completely wonderful. They paid very close attention to my daughter and moved her up to the front of the plane where a doctor and nurse happened to be. They got oxygen for her and checked on her often. They arranged for an ambulance to meet us at the airport where my daughter was taken to the Cleveland Clinic. The pilot was great as well. I was very impressed with the entire staff at Frontier.

### "Quit playing with peoples money"
Not Verified |  Inconvenient is the word I would use to describe my experience with booking with Frontier Airlines. Replacing by the phone customer service with online "chat bot" that doesn't work should be illegal. Quit playing with peoples money.

### "tortured by their incompetence"
Not Verified |  Took a flight for my wedding and let’s just say I have been TRAUMATIZED never again!! Horrible airline and horrible customer service. You can’t call anyone and then you get this horrible automated chat. Then once you break through that you get agents who don’t help and you can tell are just reading a script. I might as well just talk to the automated system. Your guidelines unclear and when you spent time thinking you made the right decision they come out of nowhere with something that wasn’t on there. Oh but they can provide you that link if need be. I have gotten credit after credit with an airline I will NEVER fly again. Avoid at all cost. Hopefully they get shut down so we never have to be tortured by their incompetence ever again.

### "we will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Frontier is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown. They nickel and dime everything. Even though they impose the highest cost for checked luggage, they have a 40 lb weight max whereas all other airlines is 50 lbs. Their app and website are constantly breaking down. It wouldn't even allow me to purchase baggage. I finally had to call Frontier directly (never allowed me to speak with an agent) and purchase the baggage via chat. (Very cumbersome and time-consuming.) When checking in online, it took at least 10 pages and asked for information (ie., KTN and passport) that I've previously entered. Upon arrival at the airport, there were no kiosks where I can print out my own luggage tags so that I may do self-service check-in as described online. On our return flight, the app/website didn't even allow for online check-in. There were only 2 kiosks that worked for Frontier, even though there were 20+ that were available for all other airlines. The ticketing agent used fear tactics to try to force us to purchase carry-on luggage for our personal items, even though our personal items met the dimensions specified on Frontier's corporate website. When we arrived at the gate, the agent refused to help any non-Spanish speaking passengers. She literally helped 3 Spanish-speaking passengers and just left without a word to the rest of us. I couldn't believe it. The seats on both flights were hard as plywood with minimal padding and zero recline. From this point forward, we will never fly Frontier again. I'm willing to pay double for any other airline. It just isn't worth it.

### "Lots of people were frustrated and angry"
Worst boarding experience ever. Lots of people were frustrated and angry. The lady forcing bag measuring was unfriendly and strict. She wouldn’t even let you assist your bag into the measuring box and said it had to fall in freely. Backpacks have air inside and straps that get in the way. We’ve traveled Frontier for years with the same backpacks. My daughters favorite travel backpack had a handle that stuck out less than an inch from the box. The charge for that was $99. I couldn’t afford to pay that. They said no exceptions. Explaining to my 8 year old that we had to put her favorite bag in the trash was heart breaking. Only positive thing was the passengers sticking together and supporting each other through the trauma induced by Frontier. Once on the plane there wasn’t even water offered. Within 2 hours of the 4.5 hour flight the ran out of water for purchase. They’d bring a water in a cup if requested, but the crew seemed inconvenienced by that. I heard lots of “we’ll never choose Frontier again”.

### "our last travel with this airline"
Not Verified |  Our flight was supposed to depart from Aguadilla, PR at 8.21 pm. We were advised one hour prior to the departure time that the flight would be delayed for two hours. We departed from Aguadilla by 11.00 pm and arrived at Orlando by 2.00 pm. This situation meant that my family stayed in the airport until 4.30 am. The parking where we left our car closed at 2.00 am, we got stuck two and a half hours at Orlando airport. Then we had to travel two hours and a half to our home. Because of the negligence of this airline we spent a complete night at the airport and our son got sick too. When I asked an Frontier counter employee at Aguadilla about the situation and tried to explained him, his response was that he was in there to help travelers to board the plane and he was not a direct Frontier employee. Also the baggage charges are very high comparing with the service. We chose Frontier considering flight tickets prices but when you see the baggage prices it is better to choose other carrier. Definitely this was our last travel with this airline.

### "this airline is absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  I had a flight out of O'Hare on March 20th 2023, tried to do a check in and baggage online the night before with no success, arrived at the airport to be told that I would have to pay $25 check-in fee and had to pay $79 per bag. Had I been able to do it online I would have only been charged 50 to $54. On my return to O'Hare flight 81 on March 27th 2023 I needed a wheelchair which I tried to do online with no success again and still had issues trying to do check in and baggage, so had to pay $25 again for check in at the counter and $79 per bag which I had two of them so round trip I ended up paying almost $400 for checking in fees at the counter and for my bags. Ask for a wheelchair to be told my name was not on the roster well how can I do that if you can't do anything on their website, no customer service number to call only chat which is absolutely horrible so now I had to sit and wait almost 50 minutes for someone to come and transport me through customs, the seats are so uncomfortable and tight no button to recline the seats you just have to sit in an upright position, this airline is absolutely horrible and I never want to fly with them again the only good thing that I can say is that the landing was the best I've experienced. I'm not sure who the woman was at the gate but she was as helpful as she could be didn't get her name but was told that she would put in a complaint for me somehow I doubt that's never going to take place so to some the whole frontier experience up I would say just don't use a totally different carrier!

### "Do Not Fly Frontier"
Do Not Fly Frontier. We were flying home from an awesome trip. We boarded the plane sat in the plane at the gate for an hour and a half before we were informed they were having issues with the plane. At 1hour 50 minutes they announced they were bringing a piece or a plane from Orlando or Denver and had us deplane. We then sat at the gate for another 45 minutes when they announced the flight was cancelled go get our checked luggage and see the Frontier desk out front. When we arrived at the desk they provided us with a business card with a QR code to scan and submit for reimbursement. The next flight out would be a day away and they could not guarantee us a seat. This was a trip we had planned for over a year and had our flights purchased months in advance. At the least they should have to compensate us for our tickets home, hotel for the night, transportation cost and food. We planned ahead but that did not matter because Frontier does not have pride in their work or appreciate their passengers. I can guarantee I will never be their customer again. When you are contracted to do something you don't just quit in the middle and not finish the project. Any other company would be held liable Frontier should be too, this was not an act of Mother Nature this was because something was wrong with their equipment. The need to be held accountable!

### "Stay away, for your own sakes"
Stay away from Frontier if at all possible!! My wife's oldest friend (54 years), died of a relapse of non-smoking related lung cancer on the evening of 3/24. Funeral was 3/27 in Bethesda, MD. We live in Denver, needed to get to DCA on Sunday. Only direct non-stops with compatible timing were on Frontier. We hadn't flown Frontier in a long time, since we lived out west last time, and we remembered good experiences. A lot has changed! We chose an 11:49 flight outbound. Frontier charges extra for every single thing you want, including seat assignment, overhead or checked bags, etc., so we did not select specific seats, b/c the tickets were already over $500 each for roundtrip. And they do say on their website that if you choose not to pay for a seat assignment, one will be assigned at the gate. Turns out that that really means that they overbook, and you are in line just ahead of standbys to get seats assigned to no-shows, which fact is NOT in the online material. Sure enough, we were bumped. And they lie. At the check-in, I was assigned seat 7B, my wife got seat ZERO. When I asked what that meant, I was told "seat will be assigned at the gate", not "no seat available for her yet". After we were bumped a supervisor tried very nicely to help us out, but nothing worked. He told us not to worry about our bags (which had some essential medicines of mine inside, another mistake) - he said DCA baggage claim was open 24 hrs a day, they would be waiting patiently for us. Finally called a manager, who came over 30 minutes later, advised us to get on standby for 6 pm flight, got us seats selected, and told us per FAA policy that they would reimburse us each 4x the outbound fare, which they did. We actually did get on the 6 pm flight, made it to DCA and our hotel, and were able to get to the funeral. Review: From 7 hours at DEN watching and interacting: Frontier is trying to lower costs drastically, and they're obviously cutting as many humans and as much labor costs as possible. Which means shifting everything online, and they have totally eliminated the customer service line, so everything has to be done by chat. More on that later. They also charge more for everything you do at the airport than online. The human labor is now significantly overstretched, and they are multitasking, having to do everything from manning check-in counters to boarding flights to assisting at baggage claim to solving problems. So they are really overstretched. Many are really young, not American, not native English speakers, and seem really ignorant of what customer service means here. DCA Frontier Baggage claim is not open 24 hrs, and after de-planing we had to wait 40 minutes for someone to show-up and unlock bag storage so we could get our bags. As for the flight, the only thing you can get without paying is a cup of water. Seat depth is literally only half the length of my thigh, and I'm 5'6", so you can see how many rows they're trying to cram in. My seat did not recline even 1/2". And ultimately, they're not that cheaper than competition. Stay away, for your own sakes.

### "charged my daughter $100 for a bag"
I wouldn’t fly Frontier to pick up a lifesaving organ. I’d take my chances on a bicycle. It’s no wonder they ended their customer service line. The charged my daughter $100 for a bag that was regulation size and took advantage of her being young.

### "used to be my favorite airline"
My outgoing flight out was delayed by almost an hour - after all were boarded and we sat on the Tarmac with no reason given. Coming back home, the flight was delayed again, this time citing weather. It was to be 38 minute delay and ended up being over an hour. The gate was switched but no announcement made at the original gate. An announcement was made at the new gate but was impossible to hear - I only knew because of an email I received. The woman working the gate was very rude. I had trouble with the boarding pass scanner and she literally grabbed my arm and pulled me to the side and then scolded me for going too far. Very rude. The extra charges are ridiculous. The woman behind me made a reservation for 3, for herself and two grandkids. They were not seated together. When she asked why they weren't put together, a crew member said, "You could have reserved them all together. Frontier used to be my favorite airline when flying to and from Denver. I will never use this airline again. I did book my flight through Cheapo Air and they were great. Oh, and when I did have a question regarding my reservation, there was no customer service EXCEPT for booking a reservation. I called that number twice to ask a question regarding my reservation and both times the agent HUNG UP on me.

### "no number to call"
Not Verified | Frontier has no support I tried to change my departure date and there is no number to call and their online chatbots could not reschedule my flight. I will NEVER do business with them again and I will tell all my clients to never do business with them.

### "never fly this awful airline"
Not Verified |  Please save yourself the energy and nerves and never fly this awful airline. Spend extra 200 5o 300 dollars and fly with a trusted one! Our initial flight was delayed by 7 hours with no specific reason. We wouldn’t make it to our second flight. We had to reschedule the flight completely. The best we could reschedule it to was with a 11 hour wait lay over. The first one (surprisingly) took off on time; but the second one was delayed for 1:30 hours, when we already waited in the airport for 11 hours. Don’t make your flying experience so awful as hours.

### "Do not fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Do not fly Frontier! I boarded at 8:56pm, it is now 11pm and we are still sitting here. They are giving us very little information. The flight attendants look drained.

### "We will never fly Frontier again"
Worst experience! Baggage handlers completely ruined my golf bag, travel bag for the golf bag and my range finder that was inside a pocket of my golf bag. Dragging it off the back of the luggage cart across the asphalt. Holes clear through both bags. It's nothing short of a miracle that the clubs weren't damaged. We spent 3 weeks going around and around with Frontier's central baggage claims dept and without all of the receipts for the items from when they were originally purchased, they only will reimburse $75 per bag. Are you kidding me? Plus they changed the weight allotment on the checked bags (from 50lbs to 40lbs) conveniently just in time to charge us an extra $50 for a checked bag that was 42 lbs. $700 in damage to my bags and items that you now want to give us $225 after charging extra baggage fees at the ticket counter. Such poor customer "care". We will never fly Frontier again.

### "Flying from Chicago to Orlando was a disaster"
Booked my flight through expedia (which I will never do again) to fly from Orlando FL to Chicago IL, there were problems with expedia that I will deal with later, the greater issue is the fact that Frontier wants to have an airline but they don't want to provide customer service, based on my latest experience, I think they just see people as marks to take their money, you want to provide the most minimal service and get the maximum amount of money for this poor service, there is no one to speak to on the phone, they don't publish their customer service number, I had a few questions when I arrived at the airport in Orlando and the people were rude, only answered with the most minimal response (no, over there, not here, check your bag), it was hard to find someone that was courteous to deal with. Flying from Chicago to Orlando was a disaster, I showed up 2 hours ahead of time to check in at Frontier, there was no one at their counter, I found out later these people dont show up until a maximum one hour ahead of their flights, no one can answer questions because no one works for Frontier and their employees are no show, found out I was scheduled to fly out of Midway and not O'Hare, paid 178.00 for my bags to Chicago, paid another 99.00 to bring the bag back to Florida, had to take a 90.00 taxi ride from O'Hare to Midway and actually got there on time for the flight only to rush through the airport and find out the flight was pushed to 7.15pm instead of 3.30pm, the airplane is hot, the seats are terrible, you are definitely crammed in like sardines, and it's still something off about the service. I am confused as to how this company is in the business of flying people around the Earth, taking our lives in their hands and they don't want to speak to customers in any fashion whatsoever, I am befuddled and I will save money, get a second job to fly with a better airline or ride horse and buggy before I book with Frontier again.

### "need to pay extra ($99) per bag"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline, highly recommend using another. Customer service is terrible and they wait last second to make you check your bags so they can make commission after telling you your bag is too big and that you will need to pay extra ($99) per bag.

### "no kids fly free as advertised"
Not Verified |  It seems like this company wants to make people who don’t have a lot of money feel bad for looking for discounts on airline tickets. What is bad about that? When you’re looking at paying thousands of dollars for tickets of course you want the best deal. That’s not bad. It’s like buying clothes off the discount rack and someone trying to make you feel like you did something wrong. They advertise green air or whatever yet when I was looking at tickets from Fayetteville, AR to Orlando, FL they wanted to fly me to Denver on a 22 hr flight before getting to FL. There was no kids fly free as advertised. Plus they were charging $679 per round trip ticket when Allegiant charged $200. I mean has anyone actually flown on a Frontier plane or is the whole thing some sick mind game to make people feel bad about something they shouldn’t feel bad about?

### "very rude and disrespectful"
Gate agent on flight 1582 was very rude and disrespectful, her customer service skills were poor and she needs to be replaced, she was rude to several customers and I'm sure we'll get a lot of compliance. I will never fly Frontier again and I hate that I have to return on Frontier, she really put a bad taste in my mouth.

### "states my credit is zero"
Not Verified |  I had to cancel trip booked in December cause my husband got hurt and had to have knee surgery. I was given frontier credit to use by March 24,2023. So I go on today to frontier and it states my credit is zero cause I didn’t use it by 5:45 pm. No where on my email from frontier does it state I had a time of day it was to be used by. How is that justified to their customers the email never stated a time of day! And now I’m out the money. How is that fair to me ? ?

### "attitude was so reckless no courtesy"
I've booked my CLT to MCO ticket thru Priceline with Frontier airlines, arrived 1-1/2 hrs early (8pm) as i have a check-in 45lb suitcase but no one was at the frontier desk on Mar 19th at 8.30pm, finally the staff came-in at 9.10pm and talking on her cell phone until 9.15pm, flight suppose to take off at 10.05pm. I interrupted her and said i have a check-in, she replied... "it got cancelled" and she started talking over her cell phone again. Then i said what are my options, then she replied i can give you for tomorrow evening flight (i.e. after 24hrs) or you can apply for a refund. i told her i didn't get any notification, then she said your third party agency should have informed you. Then i called Priceline they said there was information for them as Frontier don't have electronic update capability to all the ticket booking agencies. They tried conferencing Frontier but no one answer their call. Then again i went to Frontier desk, she was saying she can't help it. First of all, her attitude was so reckless no courtesy. I can understand sometimes flights get cancelled or delayed, but customer service reps will handle that so smoothly but this lady was talking on her cell phone, my understanding was she was talking to her friend (or) some family member, she don't care about a customer standing in front of her. I asked her name, but she didn't tell me. My point was not about refund or the next day flight, i already booked my hotel and reserved my Disney tickets so can't afford losing all that. Since it was too late i can't even drive to Orlando. If i came to know the flight got cancelled at-least few hours before i would have prepared for driving. so i finally i drove in the early morning but i lost hotel money and half-day park.

### "Do not fly Frontier"
Do not fly Frontier. We chose to try and save money by flying with them, but ended up having to spend even more. Frontier decided to give us a ghost flight that never even existed and we were basically left with no other option than to purchase another flight on top of the flight we already bought through them. We were never notified that our flight was canceled or anything even could still check in, and see our flight in the frontier app. They are now only offering a refund for the ride back, when we had to pay even more than that to get home because we had to purchase day of plane tickets from a different airline. We are lucky that there even was another airline there flying to our destination. I am more than unpleased with this airline.

### "Everything with them is about charging extra fees"
Worst flight experience I have ever had. Frontier used to be a good airline, but now its just a big "money-grab". They have fees for everything. First they have lower bag weight limits at 40lbs when most other airlines are 50 lbs. Large fee if you are over the 40 lbs. You have to pay for checked and carry on bags. I have never had to pay for a carry on before. We chose to use the "Self-Serve" check in to avoid the fee to go to the ticket counter for help. (It's $25 per person to get help) But, there was only one self serve kiosk and over 100 people in line to use it. Had to pay the fee at the counter or miss our flight. Everything with them is about charging extra fees. At the gate they were charging some people $100 if their carry on didn't fit in the box. The seats were the worst I have ever experienced. They were hard with very little cushion. Clearly the cheapest seats they could find. Employees were not friendly at all. I have flown a lot and this was the worst flight I have ever had. There is nothing good or redeeming with this airline and I will not travel with them again.

### "read the extra fine print"
I highly recommend you read the extra fine print before considering this airline. They would not even given me a flight credit. The US advised travelers not to go to Mexico. I had already booked the trip prior to the advisory. Therefore, I wanted to book a trip to a new location. Frontier Airlines did not give me a refund or credit. I lost all of my money. You must change your reservations within 24 hours in order to get a credit. Do not book a flight with Frontier Airlines.

### "pay overhead baggage fee of $100"
Bought a round trip ticket with one stop each way. I only had a personal item and packed specifically so that I wouldn't have to pay for an overhead bag. I made it through both legs to my destination without any issues with my personal item. I also made it through the first leg of my trip back, with the same bag and the same items in my bag. However, at the stopover, with only an hour's trip to get home, they suddenly said my bag didn't qualify as a personal item and I would have to pay the overhead baggage fee of $100. My bag has a waterproof coating that does not slide smoothly into their metal measuring boxes, so they claimed it was too big because I had to push it down. I would have been fine with them telling me it was too big on the way there, or even on the first leg of the trip back. At least then I could have given some of my items to my friend and have her ship them to me for much cheaper. But they charge me in the middle of the trip back when the bag passed three previous times?! That means not only am I stuck without a way to unload anything from the bag, but I also couldn't take advantage of the overhead compartment for the whole trip even though I paid the full amount that would entitle me to use it for the whole trip. The single reason people fly Frontier is the lower price. But when they corner you into paying that much for a one hour flight on the last leg of your trip home, you might as well have paid more for a higher quality airline.

### "harassment with hand luggage"
What cheap insolence. The staff makes such a harassment with hand luggage because the tickets were sold specifically without hand luggage. It's best to fly there with just your underwear and nothing else. For a normal hand luggage you pay 3x as much as the normal ticket. DE: Was für eine billige Unverschämtheit. Das Personal macht so eine Schikane bei einem Handgepäck, weil die Tickets nämlich extra so ohne Handgepäck verkauft wurde. Am besten fliegt man da nur mit ner Unterwäsche und sonst nichts. Für ein normales Handgepäck zahlt man 3x so viel wie das normale Ticket.

### "will never fly Frontier again"
This airline is garbage, worse than Spirit. Flight delayed an hour in perfect weather, trash accommodations, will never fly Frontier again.

### "Frontier Airlines is unprofessional"
My original flight was suppose to depart at 5:45 pm March 21,2023. I recieved several emails stating that the flight was delayed, come to find out the flight departed on time and boarding was not announced over the intercom. The first email said the flight was delayed 5:45pm to 7:00pm and every time the time got close the delay got pushed back 8:08, 8:35 all the way to 9:30, so when 9:30 got here I went to the gate to ask what time are we boarding and the rude gate captain says that the flight departed at 9:01pm, 20 mins ago. On top of that the flight had several gate changes and boarding was not announced again so if you were not sitting at the over crowded gate you did not know about the boarding. Now it's a lot of people from Detroit stuck in Vegas, so now I have to rebook my flight and pay $99 on top of what I already paid for it its ridiculous!! I'll stick to flying Delta, Frontier Airlines is unprofessional

### "This airline is pathetic"
I got to the airport at 1:00 pm for a 4:45 flight. It's now 11 PM and there is no plane. It was supposed to depart at 10:45. This airline is pathetic. And they offer nothing. Just funny comments from the gate agent. Do yourself a favor and just walk to your destination. This was for a 1 hour flight from Salt Lake to Vegas.

### "luggage was not delivered"
Not Verified |  Probably the worst flight experience we have ever had. First, our luggage was not delivered to our destination. We had to go 4 days without our luggage. We spent over $400 in clothes, which we were told would be reimbursed to us by check. We received the check and then the check was returned as no good. Not sure how the airline issues a bad check! Not to mention our flight was delayed by several hours and the Frontier Airlines employees were very rude in Denver. We won't fly Frontier again.

### "I would need to pay $99"
We boarded in El Paso with no problems. The agent at the counter even gave us no fuss when our checked bag weighed in at 41.5 lbs. (We've had Frontier agents in the past berate us for weighing 40.7lbs). The first flight went fine, then we had a layover in Denver before our final flight to Baltimore. When boarding there I was asked to "size" my backpack, which of course didn't fit in the tiny cube next to the gate counter. I was informed I would need to pay $99 on the spot even though we had just flown from El Paso and my backpack fit under the seat with no problems on that flight. I shared all of this with the agent who was abrupt and dismissive of me. There were many other passengers being fleeced just as I was at this same time and the collective frustration was clear. We got on our plane and I needed to access the computer in my bag for my 3 yr old daughter to watch a movie. I opted to keep it with me instead of putting it in the overhead space they had just forced me to pay for... and like magic, it fit once again under the seat. I'm not sure whether to direct my frustration at the agents or the airline. The agents had the power to treat paying customers well or poorly, they chose to treat us poorly. The company probably earned a few thousand dollars more from that one flight because their agents treated passengers poorly regarding their personal baggage. I doubt that the company is too upset about making more money, but I have no way of knowing conclusively whether the situation was prompted by the company or the agents themselves.

### "I will not fly this airline again"
I will not fly this airline again. I don’t blame this experience on the people I encountered, I blame it on the company. The company website is hard to navigate without them trying to sell you upgrades. I bought the ticket and that’s it. Left Omaha with the carry on bag fitting, great, now leaving Denver, they made everyone do the same thing before boarding. You think the bag police could tell the size of bags that can pass and get people moving quicker, they did it in Omaha. Bag passed just like in Omaha and I paid no more. Flight from Omaha was maybe 40% full to Denver (I see why now), nobody in my row, but I still had to sit in the aisle seat due to “plane balancing issues”. Never again and I would recommend not flying this airline if I were you. If I used their add-ons and had more than my computer bag, the price to fly would be more than most flights. Don’t get caught up in their schemes.

### "I will avoid Frontier in the future"
Not Verified |  This Airline bills itself as a "A la Carte Airline" but their base level of service is quite lacking. I had an issue getting my boarding pass printed and they were going to charge me $50.00 to print 2 boarding passes. This was on top of an email sent me that encouraged me to check-in early. The check-in seemed to require me to purchase a seat upgrade for me and my wife and a baggage fee for me and my wife, whether we carried the bags on or not. By the time I got checked in I had been charged about $200+ in extra fees. I think that the fees were for round trip. The check-in email notified me that there was a charge in the event I needed help from a ticketing agent. When I had problems producing my electronic boarding pass and was confronted with the $50 charge the ticketing agent was telling me she couldn't help unless I paid the surcharge. I do not understand how an airline can sell a fare, but not provide the services to get through security and onto the plane. The ticketing agents response (to my refusal to pay the fee) is that I was not listening to her. I will avoid Frontier in the future because it will cost a few extra hundred dollars from the planned travel costs.

### "not be traveling with this awful company again"
Their employees are a great representation of the awful company this is. First, they closed the gate early and didn't have a good reason why. Their were 10 of us left at the gate not able to get in our plane. They made us rebook for 12 hours later. Then on my return trip home they charged me for a bag they allowed me to take as a personal bag on the way there charging me $99 for a bag I had already brought on the plane. I will not be traveling with this awful company again and if you care about yourself you will not be traveling with them either.

### "the service is awful"
Not Verified |  The worst flight company that I’ve ever used. Not only they charge you S100  for a carry on bag, the service is awful and they changed my seat from a window to a seat between to other people because they sold more tickets that they had space for. Seriously some people even had to get another flight because their seat was somehow allocated to someone else. So please do yourself a favor and never ever use this people as they just want take your money and offer a garbage service in exchange.

### "no provision for food or anything"
Not Verified |  Cancelation of flight while already in a aircraft. Inability to connect a real person. Calls were constantly disconnected while going through extensions. Plane staff didn’t even know that flight was canceled. That day flight was already fully booked, next one only next morning and the only offer that came from airline via text was refund, rebook and $50 coupon for the next flight. No Overnight accommodation, no provision for food or anything. We, two 75 year old Seniors were just left with that.

### "they charged me 2x for bags"
Not Verified |  I have never had more of a terrible experience with an airline, not even spirit. On my way to Denver, they charged me 2x for bags. So that was an extra 300 dollars and then our flight home was just canceled with no options of getting home or a hotel and just a $50 voucher which is a joke. We then had to book with another airline. I am about $1,000 out right now. There was no help with refunds or any help with money back.

### "a complete dumpster fire"
Never again! And that $50 voucher email I received is laughable. I left El Paso at 1230 MTN and arrived in Atlanta at 0445 EST. 10 hours waiting at the Denver airport for my connecting flight because of a 5 hour delay is beyond ridiculous. And to add insult to injury I waited another hour for my luggage. The money you “save” isn’t worth the hassle. Oh and rumor has it the folks at the gate are so strict about carry ons and personal bags because they’re making money for each person they can charge. And I don’t blame em after looking up what the CEO makes vs. airport employees. Frontier is a complete dumpster fire.

### "Worst experience in 25 years of flying"
Worst experience in 25 years of flying. I already had issues with Frontier airlines from decades of horrible service but when my ticket was purchased my a family member I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. But I should have. I show up at the airport three hrs early and come to find out a conveyer belt for baggage is down which puts all of our flights in jeopardy since we have to wait over 2 hrs in line to check our baggage. My flight is at 9 and 830 I'm denied the right to check my bag and run to my flight and forced to stand in another line to rebook. Knowing very well where this is going I book a flight with another airline and continue to wait in line for a refund. Well, guess what? Not only will they not refund my money they want to charge me $100 to fly out the next day for their screw-up. I will fight this company and/or these charges until I'm blue in the face. I've never had such poor customer service and I have no idea how this company is still in business. I will never recommend you fly Frontier.

### "Not worth the hassle"
Worst airline ever, horrible staff treated us and the other passengers like we were beneath them. Had a bad attitude. Tried charging $99 for a personal item that just needed to be registered in the bag and fit perfectly. Pass said doors closed at 6:22 instead waited till 640 on a severely overheated plane which caused one man to have a medical issue. Then they finally closed the doors leave almost 30 min late. Requested a gate pass to escort my minor children to the gate and got a total Attitude and woman had no idea how to do it. Never again! Not worth the hassle, Attitude and severe price scamming and gouging! !

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  After today's experience I will never fly Frontier again. Staff was rude in the way they spoke to and ordered passengers around from entry gate thru flight. The attendant sat near back bathroom door and when passenger asked if that lavatory was free she said yes, but use the other one. Sat on tarmac waiting for another plane to leave our gate, then another delay before we could exit plane. Girl crying at baggage claim because they lost her bag. Big delay waiting for our checked bag. For a customer oriented service, experience pretty well sucked. Only a cup of water was free on flight if requested. Never again.

### "absolute worst airline ever"
Not Verified | Had 2 round trip flights for me and my lady to go to Punta Cana. When we arrived at airport to check in, they told us that our flight was canceled because the pilot was sick. They did absolutely 100% nothing to help us, or put us on another airline or anything whatsoever. No hotel for the night or anything. They told us good luck and have a nice day. Nothing done whatsoever. Cost me an extra $1,000 now to get to Punta Cana and it took 30 hours to get there (when our original flight with Frontier was a non stop 5 hour flight). To make matters worse Frontier has no number to call to speak to anyone and even more worse, is that without any reason or communication to me, they went and canceled my flight home as well. In all it cost me another $350 to get home, a day and a half of lost money and vacation time at our chosen resort. A total loss of an additional $1,500 out of my pocket. In all, the absolute worst airline ever and I fly a lot.

### "I will not fly Frontier again"
I purchase a one way ticket for around $120 on my Frontier app., using my Frontier card. I was sent a confirmation number GCBD2G. It was put on my app as an upcoming trip. Everything looked normal as past trips. On my way to the airport March 15 I tried to pull up my boarding pass and it said my flight was non existing. I went to the counter and the Frontier representative researched to see why I wasn’t in the system, but yet I had a confirmation number. She told me my payment was received and then Frontier cancelled it. I had to purchase a full price ticket of $596 one way. I couldn’t call Frontier because they have no phone numbers. I could only use the online chat person who sent me a link for a refund. And you only have 24 hours to request that refund. So I completed the online form while walking thru the airport. I got an email response with their apologies, but there would be no refund difference—very rare not-like responses. I requested a supervisor, but ignored, only more repetitive responses. I will continue until I get a refund. I will not fly Frontier again because I cannot trust that I actually have a ticket, even though they sent me a confirmation code and placed it on my Frontier app as an Upcoming trip. I hope you aren’t a family of 5 and you think you have tickets and you go to check in to find their computer system cancelled your tickets and you now have to pay full price.

### "I would not recommend Frontier"
I was waiting in line to drop off my luggage, and when I get to the counter I was told my flight got canceled. I didn't mind that it's was canceled, but it bothered me the way it was handled. Staff was rude saying "didn't you get an email". The app was still showing the flight was on time, and the screen at the airport didn't say canceled. It took 20 minutes before we got notified. You are pretty much left to fend for yourself. The email said you can get credit or refund. I would not recommend Frontier.

### "worst customer service experience ever"
One of the worst customer service experience ever, my bag was 2 inches over their specifications and they asked us to pay for it, while I go to the counter to pay for it then the lady changed her mind and ask us to pay for my wife handbag, my wife just had a laptop bag and small handbag we said we will fit the hand bag into her laptop bag. She wouldn’t agree for it and even we tried requesting her again as we’re already paying for my bag. Then she wont listen anything we speak just do you want to pay for 2 bags or I will close the gates. We have no choice but to pay as the gates will close soon. Then the same lady at the flight entrance looks at us and says ‘oh my god’ is that how you treat your customers. Never in my life I will fly with frontier again and I will suggest my friends and family not to do so. Never seen a flight charging for purse/wallet.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had flying"
Frontier Airlines has taken the cake for the cg. The weight of my bag was inspected closer than most prisons do to their new inmates. After determining my checked bag was an acceptable weight, I was confronted about the size of my backpack. They considered my backpack too large to be a personal item, and were trying to make me pay $40 to have it as a carry on. I put on both jackets and the hat that was packed in there. Finally. My bag was smaller than a 2 liter soda. By the time I had gotten on the plane, (which was an hour late due to the fact they didn’t know what plane to put at what gate) I had completely run out of device battery. No problem right? Wrong. There was no outlets on this plane. During all of this I was informed all about the safety procedures. After this horrible flight, I had to try to find my luggage. The claim our luggage was at was occupied by a different flight, Spirit. I waited for 40 minutes for all the Spirit bags to be taken, and unloaded my soaked bag.

### "didn't have any contingency plans in place"
Not Verified |  Our evening flight from Orlando to New Jersey was rerouted to Philadelphia. Upon arriving we discovered that Frontier didn't have any contingency plans in place for us. This left us all having to fend for ourselves in an empty airport at one o'clock in the morning. After several attempts to get a rental car, we had to hire an Uber to get us back to New Jersey.

### "not worth the harassment"
This airline was terrible. I was harassed and called a liar by the airline agent since she thought my bag didn't fit in their box. I initially checked on my own. Then the worker who checks made me check again and saw it fit. Then the agent right after tells me to check the bag again because she saw that it didn't fit which was a terrible lie as it was just verified. I told her her coworker just made me put it in and saw it fit. Her response is I don't care I'm the agent. Total power trip for a low paying job might I say. I then showed her again it fits and she said nothing. Not a sorry for calling me a liar and persisted to talk to us with an attitude. I guess she was mad she lied and all the passengers saw it since she was yelling at me during the encounter. The money saved is not worth the harassment and embarrassment.

### "my first and last flight with Frontier"
Not Verified |  Was flying from SFO to BWI on 14th March 2023. Flight was delayed and was missing connecting flight from LAS. They asked me to book another flight which I did. But there was no luggage at the destination. Airport agents are worst. No responsible answer. I was told that I would get a call after 5 pm but no calls until 8 pm. Started chatting and finally someone appeared after 2:30 hrs. According to her, I should wait another 4-6 hrs to know about the status of my luggage. I understand about this kinds of issues in the flight. But a customer has rights to receive good customer service which you can never ever expect at least with Frontier airlines. Please do not trust this airlines. They don't have customer service number. You need to depend on the chat and you will find a live representative at least in an hour and more. If you need immediate assistance, what would you do? Pay little more with any other reliable airlines and be free from hassles. This is my first and last flight with Frontier. I would suggest at least to my friends and families not to travel with this airline. You not only pay your money, but your time and tension as well. And one more thing, they cancel/reschedule your flight anytime. However, I should thank the flight crew members and their services.

### "Passenger beware"
Not Verified |  Passenger beware. When booking a flight with Frontier Airlines don’t assume that what you booked is what you will get every time we fly with them. The flight gets changed several times on March 18. We are flying from Cleveland Ohio to Florida, and both legs of our flights have been changed by almost a whole day, for some reason, Frontier believes that when you book a flight with them, they have the option of changing your flight itinerary whenever they want! Heaven forbid you schedule your airline travel around your vacation schedule.

### " will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  My bag was lost, still trying to track it down. I understand that you can get bag insurance but isn't the point of paying $50-60 extra per bag, so that they don't lose it? They have been kind of helping me out and reached out to let me know that my bag will be delivered before 8pm today. But after reaching out to them again, it appears it got lost again. I lost a day of my vacation, still don't know if my bag has been found, let alone if it will be delivered today. I get it that bags get lost, but this is the first time in awhile I've flown Frontier. I do believe I will never fly this airline again and would advise to not get tricked by their "low" prices for flights.

### "irritated with the entire experience"
I will do everything I can to avoid booking with them again. The hidden fees for tax, security fees, facility charges, etc, plus the cost to have a carry on bag were $102.00, the "ticket" price was $140. What a rip off! Also, there is no way to talk with an agent. You have to use a chat bot, or chat with a live agent. It takes forever to accomplish anything over a chat. Very irritated with the entire experience.

### "horrible customer service"
We ended up paying around $540 for 2 bags and a carry-on. They charge you on every connection. It is like you are paying for a new ticket again. The first flight was delayed and they have a horrible customer service.

### "atrocious airline experience"
Terrible airlines, incredibly uncomfortable. I always tell myself that I'll never fly with Frontier again but sometimes their ticket prices just seem cheaper than other airlines. I've taken a total of 15 Frontier flights in the last two years and this is the first time they wouldn't let me fly because of my personal item. They charged me an extra $100  for something they only charge $50 for at check out. I tried explaining that I've been a customer of Frontier for this long and they've never been as flat out rude as they have at Midway to Philadelphia this time. Aside from the discomfort and lack of leg room in the plane which I've had to put up with before, I've never experienced such genuine rudeness and terrible behavior from airline service before. Frontier lost a returning customer for good today and they should look into their flight policy as well as their hiring processes if they ever want to be recommended as an economical option. As is, however, this was the most atrocious airline experience of my life.

### "Never ever again"
I hadn't flown in about eight years. Could not figure out how to check in. Despite having tickets, the website was asking me to buy seats. I knew I had to pay for luggage (a 47 pound suitcase means $50 for the extra 7 pounds). I was certain I'd done everything but the kiosk would not print a luggage tag. I asked a Frontier representative who was helping at the kiosk. She told me to go up and talk to an agent. I followed her directions to the Agent Assistance Required sign. Immediately a Frontier employee pointed at me and told me to get back in the other line. I said "I'm having trouble checking in and she just told..." and he laughed, waggled his finger at me, and told me to get back in line. Apparently, "agent assistance required" means "wheelchairs and military only". Furious, I went back to the kiosk. Still could not get a luggage tag. I finally paid $31 (times 2) for some of the few remaining seats on my phone. Boom, text message from Frontier with a boarding pass, and the kiosk let me print a luggage tag. Fortunately I got to talk to the same agent again, who again laughed that I couldn't figure out how to check in. Several other passengers and I waited for our 10:56 PM flight at a nearby gate. At 10:25, about the time I expected boarding to start, there's a sudden announcement "Last call for flight 756, if you are not making your way here we will close the doors and they will not reopen. Well this was quite a surprise to all of us sitting there in the late night quiet airport, as it was the only announcement that had been made. As far as I can tell, the flight left BEFORE its stated time. Never seen such a thing. Flight itself was smooth and uneventful...and landed 20 minutes earlier than expected. I still burn with anger, shaking, about the way the guy at the desk literally laughed and pointed at me, without listening to a word I said. I rage at buying $45 tickets and still having to buy SEATS before it would let me "check in". I rage at the way the website fills the check in page with ads to bundle with cars and hotels and upgrade this and that. Never ever again.

### "Delays, incompetence"
Not Verified | Delays, incompetence, and hidden fees. Never again will I book through this airline. Please save yourself from the same mistake I made in booking this flight.

### "150 dollars for a small carry on"
Never ever again with Frontier Airlines, I bought a roundtrip ticket philadelphia to Jacksonville for 277 dollars and they charged me 150 dollars for a small carry on. Plus if you dont check in on line for getting assistance from the agents behind the counter they charge you for another 25 dollars each way. So I had to pay almost 500 dollars for a two hours flight. You feel  robbed when you are using this airline. !

### "good customer service and legroom"
Maybe its because the plane was nearly empty, but I had a lovely time on my Frontier flight. As long as you come in with the expectation that this is a budget airline, it's unlikely that you will be disappointed. We flew with one checked bag, no carry on, and two small personal bags and it was great. Checking your bags saves a ton of money, and you don't really lose much time on the back end when you arrive, so its worth it compared to their somewhat pricy carry-ons. Overall, good customer service and legroom for the price.

### "denying my claim"
I have been fighting with this airline for three months to refund my $69.99 carry-on baggage fee for a canceled flight. They sent me another notice today denying my claim.

### "still made me pay for a carry-on"
By far the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. I fit my personal item in the box and they still made me pay for a carry-on and the assistance fees, which came to $125 extra. The desk attendants were horrible and power-hungry. I will never fly this airline again due to the way I was treated. I submitted a complaint and became even more disappointed, in that you could tell that my complaint was not answered by a human being. I flew from Denver to Tampa, and the auto reply message mentioned Orlando and something about a kiosk. They keep going back to their policy instead of offering any type of resolution.

### "it’s always delayed with issues"
Frontier never stop to amaze me of how trashy and unorganized they are. They are always delayed. And if they are not they board the travelers then start figuring out what they should’ve figured out before the flight (now they didn’t log info of previous flights and now they are trying to log them), that’s so stupid and even unsafe. Been sat in the airplane for close to an hour now. Stay away! It’s always an issue! Someone can understand once or twice but I used them every week for the past couple of months and it’s always delayed with issues, took me a while to learn the lesson but will never use them again. Plus it’s not even cheaper than other companies.

### "you are completely robbed"
Never ever again travelling with Frontier airline, Worst airline I had to deal with. After using this airline you feel you are completely robbed and I am frequent traveler. While they claim they give you a cheap price, they charge you for the smallest carry on for $80 each way. Seats for $70, Even they charge you $25  extra for getting assistance from the staff behind the counter. Staff are not that friendly either. And they fool you to download their app to get cheap service which is not true.

### "stuck at the airport for 4 hours"
I have been stuck at the airport for 4 hours due to a delay. But because my flight was delayed 2 hours and 59 minutes there is nothing Frontier will do. They will only offer any assistance/vouchers if the flight is delayed 3 hours. Such a joke of a company. ONE MINUTE and they really won’t bend of offer anything. Please don’t waste your time, money or energy on this airline. They steal money from you left and right and have absolute no regard for their paying patrons. I would give them 0/10 but I am required to give them a rating.

### "flight was delayed 6 times"
Such a joke of an airline. I just flew to Tampa and my flight was delayed 6 times, four of which occurred while we were sitting on the plane with absolutely no apologies. They didn’t even offer us any water or food while we waited for HOURS. The flight was originally delayed but the website was never updated, I chatted with a rep and they confirmed my flight was on time. I get to the airport, my flight is delayed. Their website was NEVER updated. I would never fly this joke of an airline again. STAY. AWAY. The only reason I am rating this a 1/10 is because I am required to select a number.

### "Stay clear of Frontier"
Imagine parking your car in the airport's long term parking and carrying your bags to the door of the terminal, and being told that your flight is cancelled. No need to imagine for us. On February 16, 2023, at Stewart International Airport, under clear skies, that's what happened. No delay, no alternate options, just cancelled. The ticket agents were rightfully surrounded by angry travelers, many with young children. They offered no information, not even on if the fare would be refunded. They kept repeating, "read your email". We tried to stay calm, knowing that the cruise we booked would no doubt leave without us if we didn't get to Ft. Lauderdale in the next day. We checked our phones for other flights out of the NY/NJ area; only single seats with fares over $1000 for one way. We saw only one option: we got our car out of long term parking ($12 for the hour) and drove (straight) to Florida. Twenty-eight hours later we were able to get on board of the ship. I can only imagine that I'd be trying to sue Frontier Airlines for the cruise cost, the rental car and the hotel in addition to the airfare, instead of calmly writing this review right now. Incidentally, there was no email at the time, however, we saw one later that was sent one hour before we were to be at the airport saying the flight was cancelled (no reason given) and that we should be glad to know we had a $50 voucher for future Frontier flights (never going to be used). Again, no mention of a refund. Stay clear of Frontier.

### "Frontier lies about it's personal size"
Frontier lies about it's personal size. The website says 18x14x8. I measured my bag before leaving and it was 16x12x7.5 in according to my measurements. When I got there it would not fit in the bin. I believe this is so they can charge the outrageous carry on fee at the gate.

### "last time  I will travel with this airline"
Not Verified |  My experience when I returned to Orlando was very bad. I almost lost my flight because with the suitcase that I traveled from Orlando to Puerto Rico it was with the same one with which I was returning from Puerto Rico to Orlando and he wanted to charge me $100 because the suitcase charged him left the wheel by the measurement that it had, but that was the correct measurement that was 18'' and it really is the last time that I will travel with this airline! I even had to break the suitcase, not at all because I had to leave it in Puerto Rico because otherwise I would miss the flight.

### "cannot give a low enough review"
I cannot give a low enough review to this company. They made us stand in line for almost an hour to check our bags, then we were told our flight was overbooked and we could not board. It felt like falling victim to an elaborate scam. The price for the flight was not even cheaper than delta, and the flight was delayed twice anyway. Ironically, I was sent an email about the flight delay, but the service desk employee said he had no knowledge of a delay. Also, when I contacted “customer service” about the incident, they said they had no record of the flight being overbooked. Incredible how nothing is consistent in their operations. They just walk away with your money without letting you board their plane, even though you were at the airport an hour and a half before departure.

### "Bad customer service"
Bad experience. Bad customer service. Our gate got changed from Gate 10 to gate 9 without any announcements made. We haven’t heard them call or notify us. They didn’t even call our name. When we checked our bags, they didn’t even notify us with the changes made. There was no notifications in the app either or no email received.

### "better off paying more for another airline"
We had no issues with this airline light wise, however we came back to Houston at 10:13 pm and had to sit on the aircraft for 45-55 minutes due to a plane ahead of ours getting delayed. Instead of the company moving us to another gate we sat there until the other plane moved. This was very inconvenient for everyone. Another thing you have to pay for every bag that you bring, including snacks/water while being on the plane. Your better off paying more for another airline and being comfortable then waiting last minute to be told you have to pay for xyz.

### "pulled out of line to pay the fee"
The staff at Islip are truly the worst I have encountered flying. I get the policies, and the need for take off times to be completed however, I flew with a backpack which everyone in front of me was able to fly with yet I get pulled out of line to pay the fee. I took my laptop out and rearranged until the bag fit and they said no it didn’t fit when you had the laptop so we can’t have you go. I understand if I came on with a huge carry on and didn’t pay, we are talking a backpack people that I kept by my feet. I tried to purchase the bag online for a $30 less fee but was yelled at and berated by the airport attendants.

### "I am done using this airline"
Had a return flight home, an hour before our flight and arriving at airport, the flight was canceled due to an operational problem. This caused a lot of issues. Although there credited us for another flight home, our only option was to pick from one that was two days later. This caused me to have to return and rental car, and get a taxi back to our home that was an hour from the airport. Also we had to stay an extra two days. Frontier Airlines is always inconsistent. As good as the price might be, they charge you for everything. Now the carry on bags are getting smaller and smaller. This airline has done stuff like this to us in the past. I am done using this airline. You never know what your going to get. I can't risk the last minute cancellations. I get it if the weather is bad, etc. I gave them a chance, and they could of had our continuing business, we fly once a month with our staff. Not so much anymore.

### "Absolutely the worst experience"
Absolutely the worst experience I ever I had flying anywhere. I book them because of last minute flight to see my mom in the hospital. I wasn't going for long so I figure cheapest price is fine even though they charge a lot for carry on. I figured I don't need carry one so I book it with them since their price is the cheapest by far. Book the flight at 11:40pm, got there on time, check in on time, the e check-in gave me gate D16 even to the almost last minute. At 11:40 still no one line up and I got a little concerned, I check the gate TV screen and it didn't show the flight. I went to check at the bulletin board and the flight gate has changed and left already. Ok, maybe it was my fault didn't hear the gate change, maybe they announce in the wrong section. I am leaning toward announcing in the wrong section because I didn't hear they call my name, Their system never update the flight gate on my phone. I didn't hear anything about my destination. No text, no phone called when I already check in and they have my number. So I asked what now, they told me to go to gate D17 to rebook the flight. The lady that was there said, she was leaving at 12 and I look at my watch, it is 5 minutes after 12, so she left without helping me and told me to go back to ticket check in. After bouncing from one person to the next asking for direction, a whole tour of the airport . They gave me bad direction for something as simple as return back to ticket check in. I rebook another longer flight paid for it but their own employee didn't print my boarding pass and check me in. I didn't realize how big a problem that is until I tried to board the plane. The lady at the gate told me to wait since I didn't have boarding pass, after she let everyone else one she said go to gate D17 rebook the flight. Funny thing is no one was there to help, I had to go back to ticket check in again. I ask to talk to one of their manager after explaining to one of the concierge what happened. The concierge said that the reason that they didn't let me on the flight is because they overbook it, great news! Their manager explain that the person that swipe my credit card should have printed me a boarding pass. Despite admitting that it was their own fault, they won't refund and only offer another flight which I would have to wait a whole day or book another flight and paid them again. In order to use what I have paid, I would have to stay in the airport for more than 30 hours, with total flight and wait time in the airport almost 48 hours and return just in a matter of 3 or 4 hours.

### "frustrating and stressful"
Not Verified |  MCO had longer than expected and inaccurate wait time description on boards. Lines wrapped well beyond and down long hall of MCO of restaurants before security check point. Started security wait line at 5am for a flight leaving at 6:38 am . Was pushed around different lines of security and still had yet to put my bags through the conveyer belt for inspection as my gate time closed at 6:08. Made it to my gate 6:10 door closed plane still attached to the jet way an NO customer service at the front desk. The plane was delayed to leave at 7:10 for aircraft maintenance. I watched from the window as my plane sit there. Unable to use the support system or get a hold of any representative through their new automated chat system. I had to buy a new flight with another airline to fly home. One way ticket costing 330 dollars. I flew American home and was able to buy a ticket at their service counter. We boarded and were up in the air in less than 15 minutes after final boarding. Frontier is garbage, they are rude, Nickle and dime for everything seats and bags that are even semi larger than a kids backpack. Their hands off customer support is frustrating and stressful.

### "they're no longer worth it"
Not Verified |  I've flown Frontier Airlines in the past and had a good experience. Lately they're no longer worth it, too many fees and staff with a bad attitude. You will pay a lower initial fee for the ticket. These are always cheaper than other airlines. Don't be fooled. You will pay the same if not more than other airlines. Here are details: *$19 to $35 per seat, or you will be "randomly placed". Forget about keeping your family together. A free personal item, but $50 for a carry-on sized suitcase. $50 for checked luggage up to 40lbs. $50 more if your bag is from 40-50lbs. Total, $100. Everything food & drink related during the flight is charged. You check-in online or he charged $25 for assistance at the counter, or $10 online. The only thing the workers will do is take your bag after putting on the handle sticker. You find out the weight of your bag at that time. If you are 0.1lbs over, you will be asked to pay $50 more bucks and $25 for the assistance. Make sure you travel with a travel scale so you can weigh your bags beforehand. When you're at the gate, there is a thing that your personal item must fit into. If there is any perception it doesn't fit, they will consider it carry-on luggage and charge you $50. Any resistance to paying the fee, they will threaten to kick you off the flight with no refund. Their online system for purchasing a seat location, baggage, looking up your tickets, needs improvement. After you check in, you must screenshot or somehow email yourself the tickets. Otherwise, after that, you will not be able to look up the tickets again. You will have to ask an associate to print them out for you, which they'll grumble about. Seriously...I've never had this level of runaround and ridiculous issues with any other airline.

### "I will never fly with them again"
The first time I am flying with this airline. I will never fly with them again. When we were going to Atlanta we didn’t have to pay for our bags. Leaving to go to Fort Lauderdale they decided to charge us $100 a piece. Never again.

### "Terrible experience all around"
Terrible experience all around. Nickel and dime for every little bag, or assistance you need. Delayed flight, missed connection and no in-person customer assistance. The ticket agent even told us she wasn’t able to help us cancel a flight since we rebooked with another airline. I will never even consider flying Frontier again.

### "Very rude staff"
Not Verified |  Terrible service, excessive bag check pricing. Very rude staff, aggressive to sell cheap food (chips only) and offer only water that takes 15 minutes to get and comes in a very small cup. Tried to make me pay my my purse which is no where near the size of a bag or back pack. They order people in line to move for no reason at all. Same experience on my 2nd leg of the flight to Seattle. 5 hour flights with no food should be illegal. No Wi-Fi, no service of any kind

### "such a terrible company"
Not Verified | Horrible service. I can't check in and there is never anyone from their customer service to help. Even worse is they thought it was a good idea to go all automated so you can't speak to a person when you need assistance. Should have known this is one of the worst airlines to fly. The CEO should be ashamed to be in charge of such a terrible company.

### "not hesitate to fly Frontier again"
I flew Frontier because it was the least expensive for the departure time I needed. I booked from the website, did not choose seats, bags, attendant, etc. and therefore did not expect extras. The attendants were pleasant as was the boarding agent. If you don't give grief you usually don't get grief. We were lucky enough that a couple sitting between my daughter and me offered to move over to let us sit together but we did not 'expect' it and would not have asked. The flight was on time, arrived slightly early and uneventful. The seats were some of the least comfortable I have experienced, but again, I booked for the price and wasn't expecting a 1st class seating or service as it seems many do. I have no complaints and will not hesitate to fly Frontier again. Using the app was straightforward since I know how to 'click no' to the screens asking to select seats, add baggage, wifi, priority boarding, etc. My boarding pass appeared with no problem, I was notified that online checking was opening 24 hrs prior to departure and it was flawless and took all of 2 minutes so when we arrived at the airport we went straight to security and then the gate. I certainly feel I got what I paid for and expected along with the added perk of kind and courteous seatmates.

### "Very disappointed in this experience"
Not Verified |  Definitely do not recommend flying with frontier. Very disappointed in this experience. I booked through the Hopper app and chose frontier, as they were the cheapest tickets available. I expected that with being the cheapest option, you get what you pay for, so I was prepared for poor service. When booking with other airlines on the same app, you select your seats and baggage at the time of purchasing your tickets. This was not the case with Frontier. They wait until you are checking in for your flight to select your seats and your baggage/carryons. They also make you check in for each flight individually, and pay for your bags for each leg of your flight. I paid about $350 for my tickets round trip and thought that was a great deal, but ended up having to pay almost an extra $100 per flight (4 flights) in carry on purchases and hidden fees! I chose not to check a bag and only took a backpack, and it was $65 by itself, plus another $30 in "processing fees. The overall service was fine, but you do have to purchase everything from drinks on the flight, to services from desk agents. It ended up costing me more than it would have had I purchased tickets through American Airlines or United. Tray tables were dirty, but the cleanliness overall was okay. If you're not going to take any carryons on checked luggage, then by all means go with frontier. Otherwise, save your money and book with a different airline.

### "nickle and dime you for everything"
Horrible airline. They nickle and dime you for everything. And they recently started checking personal item sizes and forcing passengers to pay over $90 just to board the flight with their slightly oversized personal items that completely fit under the seat in front of them. This combined with no personal space during your flight makes these flights not worth the money. My advice, spend a little extra money for a real and decent airline.

### "source of unnecessary anger and stress"
Not Verified |  This is a constant source of unnecessary anger and stress. There is no customer service reps to talk to, it's all AI. The phone number doesn't work, no email correspondence. It's like no one actually works at Frontier. The rates aren't even the cheapest as they claim to be. Often times they are just as high or higher than Southwest, Delta, and American Airlines. So what am I saving by buying a Frontier ticket? Nothing.

### "Frontier is the absolute worst"
Frontier is the absolute worst! I paid to check my instrument as a "bike" because it was larger than a checked bag and was the only option that I saw other than a regular sized checked bag when I purchased my ticket online. This worked perfect for 2 out of 4 of my flights that i had the instrument with me  (I had 6 flights with frontier altogether in 10 days) On my 3rd flight: After being told to go to a wrong line 3 different times (and spending 30-45 min in each line), they told me that my instrument (that I already paid extra for) was going to be considered "oversize" and there was going to be an additional $89 oversized bag fee (because a bike isnt already oversized?). My instrument is smaller than a bike. There is absolutely no need to charge an additional oversize fee Now I have paid for 1 checked bag, 1 bike, and an additional oversized bag fee (for the bike/instrument). For reference, the case that holds the instrument below is 60" long. A bike (on average) is 69" long. So, I get in touch with customer service on chat - since they no longer take phone calls (I wonder why) and the agent was sarcastically rude and leading me on once I ask them to escalate the chat to a supervisor and instead of transferring me, they leave me on "hold" or on a blank screen pretending like a supervisor will come at some point but never actually gets one. Ultimately the agent brushed my claim off by stating that what I was telling them was hearsay and that they "wish they could have been there to see it but since there is no way to back up my claim, there was nothing they could do".

### "Delayed, and clueless staff"
Not Verified | Delayed, and clueless staff. We were delayed on the incoming flight by 2hours, and return flight by another 2 hours. The attendant was extremely rude when I asked about our flight. It was erased from the electronic signage at the gate because it was so late, so I was worried I missed it, although I was waiting at the gate for over 4hours! This airline is terrible! JetBlue has always been consistent. Never again for this lousy airline that could care less about your time or schedules!

### "This airline is a joke"
I will never fly with Frontier again. Went on a business trip and was told that if I go to the counter, I will be charged $25 for an attendant. Once I was checked in online, I checked a bag. That was a $60 charge. Didn’t have to measure my book bag at any airport except Denver. It fit in the personal bag compartment but because the fabric was showing a 1/2” above, mind you it was just fabric, I had to pay $99 to carry it on. This airline is a joke. I will stick with American or Delta. I have already warned my entire family that it’s not worth the cheap prices.

### "extremely frustrating to deal with"
The company is extremely frustrating to deal with. The website continually locks up if you try to purchase without adding luggage and when you refresh the prices increase. If you have any issues it is impossible to get ahold of anyone. If they change a non stop to a lay over and you want to change to a different flight you can not speak with anyone and the chat is a dead end that never allows you to get answers. Anytime you need to update a flight you just have to take the loss on that ticket and purchase a different one. Never get round trip tickets so when you waste a flight it will only cost you half the amount. They have the only non stop flights from TPA to CLE so i am stuck flying them. They have the cheapest tickets but by far the least value for the money.

### "I feel bamboozled"
Not Verified |  I have flown with Frontier many times. I tried checking in at the kiosk center which is what I always do no matter who I fly with. When that didn't work I went to the ticket counter and the ticket agent said it was $25 per person for my husband and I so that's $50 because I didn't check in online through my email, and I only had 24hrs to check in? I didn't know? Our plane was scheduled for take off at 9:30pm. We didn't board until 3 hrs later. Then was charged for basic drinks and a snacks on the plane which is also normally complementary. Then, flying back home. Our plane was scheduled to fly out at 3.30pm. We weren't notified about a delay until it was time to board which was 2.45pm. I do understand that the weather can be the cause for delays and that's no ones fault. But when you have to spend extra money on food, and drinks, when customers are already being inconvenienced. Then my husband and I were not charged for a carry on bag going to our destination, but coming back he was charged $99 for the same bag he came with?? It caused quit an uproar. There was no explanation for the charge? It was just pure attitude and rudeness. Then the frontier employee stated that she could charge him an extra 100 if she wanted too?? The ticket prices where amazing but I feel bamboozled, because Frontier charges for everything else, that usually is included. Basically what I feel is lacking is communication of what the airline policies are. Better customer service, compensation on basic snacks and drinks

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Worst airline I have ever flown on. Don't waste your money. The employees are extremely rude, planes are dirty. Then they actually charged me $298 00 for luggage that was not mine and refused to reimburse me after I had paid prior for my luggage. They used my information to charge for other people's luggage. I tried to contact them. They only have a chat system which told me basically to bad. I will never fly with them again. I am disputing all charges with my bank.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. The first flight to Florida was honestly very smooth and not all bad. Seats are not comfortable (expected) and leg space was just enough. Online check in was not horrible except for the million times i had to say not to adding luggage and no to choosing a seat. The price for choosing a seat and adding just a carry on is so ridiculous that you may as well go with another flight with better seats. Now for the reason I will never fly with them again. Out flight was delayed for 7 hours. We had an email saying it was due to the airline helping with another late flight, a hostess saying the plane needed maintenance, and finally the pilot saying there was not an available plane. The fact that there was 3 reasons means all it was was a bunch of excuses. We had our whole day stolen from us as we were stuck in an airport and all they could do is give $50 towards another flight and a $20 food voucher. Only props was when they checked the bags to make sure it was the right size was that they let you force it in. If you want a carry on and and easy to deal with flight, go somewhere other than Frontier.

### "Very satisfied"
I was charged what I felt was an excessive baggage fee on my return flight to Cleveland. I tried to call to discuss the issue and was disappointed when I could not locate a customer service phone number so I completed a form online. I was told it could take up to 7 days for them to review the matter. They contacted me within 4 hours and will be issuing a full refund. Very satisfied.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
I will never fly with Frontier again. Flew to DC for a weekend trip with just a personal item. Before boarding the plane on the flight home they forced us to measure our bags to ensure they qualified as personal items, but the individuals at the counter said bags “didn’t fit” if you had to use any force at all to get them to slide into the measuring tool. Bags literally had to slide down by the force of gravity alone or you have to spend $100 to “upgrade” your ticket to a carry-on. I get that Frontier is a budget airline. I can happily put up with the uncomfortable seats and terrible service knowing I’m saving money. Being pulled out of line to perform an absurdly strict bag measuring exercise and then being forced to pay for a last minute, unnecessary $100 upgrade is ridiculous treatment of customers. If I had known my ticket would cost an extra $100, I never would never have settled for frontier in the first place. It seems like a company that has to force its customers to pay for more expensive services by increasingly drastic measures to stay afloat probably shouldn’t exist in the first place. If you’re thinking about flying with frontier, reconsider. I won’t ever be traveling with the airline again.

### "fly another airline"
Not Verified |  Spend a little more and fly another airline. The seats are rock hard. No snacks, no tv, you pay a ton for assigned seats and baggage fees. I can handle all of those things for a short flight but checking in made this a no go for me. Instead of checking in online and printing your bag tags to just drop off, you have to stand in ridiculously long lines for them to do it for you. Makes zero sense when they have machines at the Atlanta airport. Every person I spoke with said that this was their first and last flight with frontier. I agree.

### "Absolute worst experience"
Absolute worst experience with the app, staff being rude, and kiosk. After kiosk didn’t work I went to the counter only to be sent back to the kiosk instead of them helping and wouldn’t assign a seat until I got to the gate. App wouldn’t recognize my confirmation number so I couldn’t check on to request my seat.

### "just did not give me a seat"
My flight was overbooked and when I tried getting a refund not only did they make it impossible to get in contact with them, but once I finally did, they denied it. I was not able to fly because my flight was overbooked and they tried to say that I didn’t make my flight on time but I checked in and everything, they just did not give me a seat. Do not fly with them and refrain yourself from wasting time contacting their support.

### "Stay away from this airline"
We flew to Orlando to pick up our new motor coach. This Airline has all but peppered the experience in a negative way! First we booked on Priceline, as it showed the price was with one personal carry on, and one checked bag. The airline stated “ Oh! Priceline always makes mistakes! Okay that “Mistake” cost my wife and I around 500.00 for bags. Next I paid an extra 60 or 65 per seat for the exit row! I got 2 non reclining prop up seats with the padding of a cheap ironing board. So we flew non stop it seemed like a eternity to get to Orlando. We get there only too find “No One” can locate out fire arm case? After waiting an extra hour, we filled out there form as apparently fire on bags seem to come up missing there? as there was another one with the same problem. We were promised the bag would be delivered to our hotel. Well apparently we were lied too according to the  young lady that finally called us back as I booked our room an extra day as the airline wasn’t communicating with us after leaving them a message! She called as I’m sure because I mentioned will they be reimbursing me for the extra night? Well she stated not her dept! And they wouldn’t be delivering the bag to our hotel and I’d have to pay Uber to come and get it. And again I asked who'll will be paying me for my expense for there dereliction? Again she stated “Not my Job”. Stay away from this airline.

### "the customer service was terrible"
Not Verified |  We were already delayed and really late. Then the staff were super slow to board the plane and they were incredibly rude. The plane was half empty and still the customer service was terrible! This was not our first time with this experience on Frontier Airlines.

### "Worst airline I’ve ever flown ever"
Not Verified |  Only flew this airline because it was a direct flight and the fastest way. Right off the bat checking the bags was a problem. I had a small carry on suitcase and they didn’t tell me it was too big. Then I get to the gate and have to pay a $100 fee for it with no warning (from the beginning when we started checking bags) that it was too big. Worst airline I’ve ever flown ever. Getting our bags from bagging claim took 2 hours. Please don't fly this airline it is terrible.

### "absolute nightmare of an airline"
What an absolute nightmare of an airline and I thought Spirit was bad. Not only was our flight delayed 3 different times, there was no communication about the delay or the gate change. According to their app, there were no delays or gate changes but when you got to the gate, you were told something different. (By the screen as no physical person could be found). We finally boarded 4 hours late. I will never fly this airline ever again.

### "the same boilerplate response"
Not Verified | Total rip-off! The day before our return trip, I went online to check-in and to purchase seat selection and pay for luggage. I went through the checkout procedure successfully. When we arrived at airport to drop off luggage at Frontier (after waiting 30 mins in line), I was told that I had to pay $25 per passenger for "Airport Assistance Fee" because I did not check-in online. I explained that I did (i.e., seat selection and luggage). The staff was not interested and told me I could get out of line and check-in online. I decided to pay and dispute later (I didn't want to hold up the line and have to get back into the end of the line). I've had two email exchanges with "Johnny" from Frontier and I get the same boilerplate response. Avoid Frontier!

### "Cheap tickets are not enough"
Not Verified |  Staff at the front desk never said anything to me regarding my carry on bag. They wait until I'm about to walk on the plane to tell me I need to pay for my bag. Online they charge $64 but in person charged me $100 to carry my bag on board. Also you must be aware when checking in or purchasing your ticket online as they have boxes preselected for you and if your not paying attention, you will be significantly up charged for your bags. I think this will be my last time flying Frontier. Cheap tickets are not enough to retain me as a customer, I'd rather break my pockets from now on to enjoy a much better airline, a more professional airline, and a much more comfortable airline.

### "fly with someone else"
Not Verified |  Spend more and fly with someone else. Cancelled flight and terrible customer service. We got vouchers but they will never be used. I refuse to fly with them again no matter how much we can save. I can deal with a cancelled flight. That happens and I am not upset about that. I am upset about being told "I don't see what the big deal is. You're on another flight. The big deal is that I wasn't given an option to choose a flight that would have worked better for us. Yes we got there, 24 hours later, but we missed so much that we had planned for that day.

### "spending an extra $500 to fly"
Not Verified |  They dropped their checked bags weight to 40 lb, and if you are over 1lb they charge you an extra $50, even though they are charging you for a checked bag which should be part of the price that you pay for an airplane ticket. If you want to reserve a seat they have a chart of the plane and the prices go up the closer you get to the door which is average of around 50 to 60 to $70, we flew to Cancun and how are you supposed to have enough clothes and supplies for 9 days with 40 lb luggage, you can't. We ended up spending an extra $500 to fly with them because of overweight check bags and assigned seating.

### "Cabin is hot and stuffy"
Not Verified | Frontier Airlines has passengers trapped in plane for over 4 hours including my wife. Attendants refuse to give passengers cold water or something soothing to drink. Cabin is hot and stuffy. As it turns out Frontier has one single gate at Salt Lake Airport and one of there planes is broke down in the gate. Remember in the past, the airport would roll out stairs to walk down. Nope, let 'em sit.

### "cancelled and Frontier did nothing"
Not Verified | My flight was delayed from 5:40 AM to 9:00 AM than to 11:30 than my flight was cancelled and Frontier did nothing so I went to Delta and they had no delays or cancellations

### "Absolutely horrid airline"
Absolutely horrid airline. Disrespected by employees and so poorly taken care of upon cancellation of flight due to mechanical issues that its comical. They don't hold to their word what so ever. They informed me I would get reimbursed for the hotel I had to purchase due to THEIR cancellation and when the time came to reimburse, they refused. Disgusting. My credit card bills are high and I'm struggling to pay these down now. I was under the impression I would be compensated, as I did not have any friends in the departure city and was self reliant on finding a place to sleep and a completely new flight, since Frontier didn't have anything available for TWO DAYS after the original flight. And they are holding me responsible. I mean what in the world kind of policy is that. I needed to get to work the next day. Would they pay for the two days of missed work? I highly doubt it. It's like punching someone in the face and then when asking for a bag of ice you just get punched again. So rude. I will never fly with this airline again and I HIGHLY encourage others to never fly with Frontier. It is NOT WORTH IT. Just spend the extra money on a better airline. You won't have to pay extra for every additional thing on the fight and you'll actually get compensated and reimbursed for the airline's failure to do their job. I'm out $500 due to this situation. Ridiculous. Do better Frontier.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer support. I paid extra for seats and when i got to airport they told your seats not available for you. You paid for your seats we are not accepting that, and they were were so rude and unprofessional airline! I’ll not recommend this airline.

### "cancelled flight right before flight time"
Not Verified |  This is the second time that Frontier Airlines has cancelled my flight right before my flight time. Very frustrating. I had to ask for a refund. The first time, they did not give me a refund. Hopefully they will this time.

### "charged $200 for 2 checked bags"
First and last time traveling Frontier. They charge $25 pp to check in at airport. They charged $200 for 2 checked bags. My friend’s weighed 37 pounds. Mine weighed 22 pounds. The service was awful. The agent at check in typed the DOB wrong and my friend had to go back and correct it before security let them pass. Awful.

### "the most misleading airline"
Not Verified |  I purchased the WORKS which allows for free changes of flights. Except try changing the flight and they will make up some story as to why there is now a significant fee. I find Frontier to be the most misleading airline in the US - they continually do stuff like this. This was the straw that broke the camels back - I will fly any other airline and pay more than use these guys.

### "Unacceptable horrific customer service"
Worst flight and  airline experience ever. The check in desk workers are unkind and untrained. I told them I was having trouble loading my TSA pre check # on the app and my boarding pass and she continued to tell me I was fine and would not print me my pass after asking twice. The airport had some issues w/ lines but that’s not about Frontier. I went to the line for TSA after a 60 min delay due to the airport but they would not take my pass on my phone. I had to go back to the check in. The woman was very unkind and proceeded to tell me it was a TSA issue not a Frontier issue. I have traveled for work for years and this has never happened. She proceeded to tell me that she won’t argue with me, shrugged her shoulders and that it just must not be my lucky day. I barely made it on my flight. Unacceptable horrific customer service. I will be writing a review on every platform. This was infuriating. 0/10 if possible.

### "Do not fly on Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified |  My flight from Las Vegas to Denver was canceled the same day with no explanation as to why. The Frontier website suggested I book the next available flight which would’ve sent me to Raleigh, North Carolina and I wouldn’t be home until 24 hours later (11:30 AM the next day). I booked this flight via my phone thinking I’d be home the same day as I didn’t see the discrepancy of leaving the same day but arriving the next. None of the details about the flight and its overnight connection were made clear during the process of rebooking through their website. Once the transaction occurred the details were emailed to me and I then saw that the flight would not get me home until the following day. I’d miss work and my kids would be left home alone on Presidents Day as they had a day off from school. All of this happened while I was in an Uber traveling to the airport. I visited a the rebooking desk at the Las Vegas airport to ask for a refund of the new charges as I had accidentally booked a flight that I didn’t understand and couldn’t see the details for. I was told that this was all my fault (as in they literally said it was my fault to my face), there was nothing they could or would do, I’d have to cancel it myself, and to leave the desk. They actually shooed me away yelling for the next person. The representative wouldn’t even look me in the eye. She adamantly refused to even try to help me. They wouldn’t even cancel the flight. I had to do it myself and still be charged for it. I’ve never been treated so rudely by an airline in 30 years of flying. I was shocked. I sat down and canceled the flight myself and was able to rebook with another airline. Do not fly on Frontier Airlines.

### "incredibly disappointed and infuriated"
Not Verified |  I am incredibly disappointed and infuriated by Frontier Airlines. We ended up having to cancel our entire trip (that had been booked for months) the night before due to Frontier Airlines canceling our flight and leaving us stranded at the very last minute. I received absolutely zero communication from Frontier that my flight had been cancelled. The only way I found out my flight was cancelled is because when trying to check-in the night before I kept getting an error message. I reached out to customer service who told me my flight was cancelled earlier that day. After cancelling the flight, Frontier offered little to no solution. I was told I would not be able to reach my destination until 2 days later. Never again. I will never ever book with Frontier again. Next time, I will absolutely pay more money for a more reliable airline so I know I will reach my destination without having to worry that my flight will be cancelled and I will be left stranded. I understand last minute cancellations can happen due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, mechanical, etc) but this situation was not one of those reasons. I wish I would’ve done a little research on Frontier prior to booking. I have read so many other recent stories similar to mine. Frontier’s treatment of their customers is completely unfair and irresponsible. Aside from this, when I booked I didn’t know Frontier is a budget airline. Frontier is a budget airline and it shows. They will nickel and dime you for everything. The prices of checked bags and carry-ons is outrageous. The price to select a seat is significantly more than I’ve ever paid with any other airline before. They also charge extra if you check-in at the airport with a live agent instead of using the kiosk. Ridiculous.

### "delayed for hours without any reason"
I had to fly from Atlanta GA to Hartford CT for work. I got early flight and came to the gate on time. All people were there waiting for them to start boarding. One hour later we are still in line with no explanation what is going on. One hour later we got to the plane, but we still have to wait another hour to leave our gate. Not the first time when they got delayed for hours without any reason.

### "Never again"
I purchased a ticket from Dallas to Detroit, there was a layover in Atlanta. I needed to change my flight from to instead just be from Atlanta to Detroit. But they don't have phones apparently. I had to text with something and eventually a very unhelpful someone. I wanted to switch dates also. I went and looked at flights they were about 100 dollars. When I tried to switch they wanted me to pay like 145 dollars to switch a flight I already paid for to a flight that was only 100 if I just paid cash - so either way it was gonna cost me the cost of another flight. I decided to buy with another airline and just let Frontier eat the cost of the original ticket. Never again -  this was my only flight I never made it and won't waste my time or money again

### "the worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  We had to fly with Frontier Airlines on February 16 from Orlando to Detroit. The flight was cancelled 10 minutes before boarding, the explanation was bad weather. The reality was that there weren't enough passengers. There was no help from Frontier Airlines; they were very rude. They said we can fly on February 17 for free, because this is the next flight for them. The Frontier Airlines customer service does not exist at all, they just recommend online chat that is a robot, the worst experience ever. As a result, we were forced to book a flight with another company without assistance. The tickets were a lot more expensive and it went out of my pocket because we could not postpone the trip. The worst experience in my life.

### "Avoid it at all costs
Bought 6 tickets from Chicago to Los Angeles on January for the flight in the end of April. After a month I'm receiving email that non stop flight "has been affected by a schedule change". And now we have to confirm back and forth flights with 1 stop. Both more than 10h duration. For customer service you can chat only. Waited an hour for representative and when she connected I've asked why you selling tickets when you can't keep with your schedule. She disconnected. But the interesting part is that same thing happened to my daughter a month ago with Frontier. So I'm assuming they selling cheap tickets few months upfront but when ticket prices going up and on demand they just can't keep up with "the schedule". Never recommend this airline to anybody. Avoid it at all costs.

### "Don't be fooled by GoWild Pass"
Not Verified | Do not be fooled by Frontier Airlines GoWild Pass. Don’t think that this is marketed for most people. This is STRICTLY for people that are ok with picking a flight to go somewhere on 24 hours notice and you CAN’T book your return flight so you will NEVER know how long you will be there as you CAN’T book your return flight until 24 hours before you hope to leave. So you will never know how long you will be at your destination. It is worth paying the extra to use any other airline so you can actually plan for your stay and not be worried about the hotel being sold out and being left living like a homeless person while you wait for a flight from Frontier.

### "never recommend flying this airline"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service I've ever experienced from an airline. I would never fly frontier again even if I was paid to do so. Baggage check was confusing and the person behind the counter was extremely rude. Would never recommend flying this airline to anyone.

### "made to pay $99 for a carry on bag"
I was made to pay $99 dollars for a carry on bag that clearly fits under the seat in front of me. I have flown Spirit Airlines dozens of times and this bag had always made it in the flight with no one stopping me. This is so frustrating.

### "charged for our personal items and cabin bags"
My mother and I were traveling from ORD - LAS ( Flight # 1419 ) on 02/10/2023 and on my way back LAS - ORD ( Flight #1418 ) on 02/13/2023. We were charged for our personal items and cabin bags both the times ($158/- and $198/- respectively). They made me pay for them both the ways despite the items met the standard per the frontier airlines website. I have the Samsonite bags  Costco receipt for the both the bags and they told me the items they sold me were based on the Frontier Standards. Also once on the flight they don't even give you water for free, they charge for everything and also when a person is fast asleep they wake them up and ask if they wanna make a purchase and on saying no they still push you to buy things they don't need --- the height is when they also woke me and my mother up again to ask if we have any garbage to throw, isn't this ridiculous of them to ask. the staff was rude as well.

### "Ruined literally everything"
Not Verified |  They last minute changed my Sunday 6 hour flight to a Sunday 16 hour layover that was going to get me home at 11:30am on Monday when I was supposed to be home Sunday night at 6pm. Ruined literally everything.

### "staff ruined my experience"
Not Verified | You know not for anything I gave this airline a chance and once again this airline and it’s horrible staff has ruined my experience! I paid almost $100 for a front row seat only for the flight attendant to take my bag and move it down 3 rows because they needed more overhead bin space. Now I will be even more delayed in deplaning. The whole reason for the front row seat was so I could get off the plane in a timely manner and not right thru a crowd rushing off a plane to get my bag! In addition to that I was stopped prior to boarding to size my small backpack which fit perfectly yet people in front and behind me were not stopped and asked to do this task! Meanwhile my sandwich I purchased in the airport is completely smashed now due to me shoving my bag in a sizer that clearly fit! I strongly suggest not flying with this airline the staff is poorly trained. I fly Spirit all the time and never have any of the issues. No wonder Spirit chose to merge with Jetblue in the end and back out of the deal with Frontier!

### "worst experience in my life"
Not Verified |  I had to fly with Frontier Airlines on January 26 from Chicago to Cancun Mexico .The flight got cancelled 10 minutes before boarding, the explanation was that the pilot forgot his passport. The reality was that there was no plane and no crew on the gate. We didn’t receive any help from Frontier airlines to book another flight. The person that gave me my luggage back said we can fly on February 1 for free because this is the next flight for them. Frontier Airlines customer service is not existing at all, so we had to book a flight with another company with no help. The tickets were a lot more expensive and it went out of my pocket but we could not postponed the trip. The worst experience in my life.

### "paying the same as a better airline"
I traveled on Feb 11th and 14th from Houston to Orlando and they charged me $25 for my confirmation that was not coming up on their system and their self check in machines were down, I showed them the receipt that it gives me with no boarding number so I had to pay, which I did. Then, I flew from Orlando back to Houston and was charged me $100 for the same thing I had when I came and they did not charge me for the first time. If they charged me the first time I would be ok with it and understand and prepare myself but that did not happen and is why I did not pay for my bag before hand. Also, the first one that charged me the $25 in the front desk did not gave me my receipt. I am not happy with this because everyone should be on the same page not sometimes charged and sometimes wont. The prices are affordable but if they charge you for whatever they feel like that day, depending on their mood, then is not worth it because you end up paying the same as a better airline. I am not happy, it was my first time flying with them.

### "they failed on every possible point"
It spent nearly 5 hours in total to book. Once I finally made it through the end of booking, it said no more seats were available at the price they advertised. I used the online chat to book after the hours of difficulty with the website. They charge for this. I was specific about only needing to check 1 bag and no carry-on and have the screenshots. They booked my flight but said I had to go back online to their barely functioning website to add the rental car as well as my known traveler number for TSA Precheck. I then began getting daily notifications that no bag was added to my ticket so I went back on and added my checked bag. Then I was charged for 2 checked bags even though I only had 1 as well as a carry on which I did not have. My flight from philly to Orlando did not have the precheck stamp so I just rolled with it. The desk folks at PHL gave the impression they did not care folks were waiting in line having conversations amongst themselves and one clerk with her back to the customers at her computer station fiddling with her phone. From Orlando to Philly, I attempted 3 times with the desk to get my precheck added but they had no idea how add my TWIC card so I went through standard 40 min. TSA security again. I also brought up the fact that they charged me for bags I did not have and the desk person gave me a card to address the issue. When you follow the link on the card, it says no refunds are given for bags even if you don't check or carry them on. Follow up with customer service provided no resolution. On the flight, there was food left in the seatback from the previous flight. We ran into turbulence and the lady next to me started getting motion sickness. I looked in the seatback for a barf bag and there were NONE! Fortunately she kept down her dinner! 1 out of 10 is too high of a score since they failed on every possible point except I did arrive at my destinations albeit late.

### "Very bad customer service"
Do not believe their price. They are cheap for a reason. I flew in from Atlanta and had to problem with my computer bag then in North Carolina time to go home these people said my computer is a personal item and charged me $100 dollars just for a computer. They told me to either throw the bag away or pay simple period. Very bad customer service.

### "not worth the hassle"
Very frustrating experience flying out of Cancun to Denver. Traffic to the airport terribly slow once arriving at the airport. The lines were long to frontier. They did not have enough agents working to process baggage check in slow going, and once we reached the front of the line, we were told we were supposed to have printed our own baggage claim tags at the kiosk. If the agent printed our tag out, it cost $25 per bag. Ridiculous! There were agents there, who could’ve told us to do that prior to standing in the long lines. We ran back and printed our tags. Then we were told our luggage was 1 pound overweight and needed to pay another $50. They are nickel and diming their customers to make some extra money. Frontier is one of the cheaper airlines to fly, but not worth the hassle will not fly frontier in the future.

### "never fly Frontier ever again"
I booked this flight back in Oct, 2022 for $268 RT and the day before my flight, I was able to check in. At that time, everything appeared on time. My flight was for 7:45am on 1/31. I decided to wake up earlier just because I was excited to see my family that day on vacation and I had a rental car booked when arriving into Phoenix, I received an email from Frontier on 2;01am stipulating that my flight was cancelled without a reason? Their customer service dept was closed and finally I was able to chat with frontier online. They gave me an option to take a late night flight to Vegas which I would be stuck in Vegas overnight at their airport and lose my car rental reservation, get their next direct flight on 2/5/23 or get my $$ back, I opted to get my $$ back right away as their options were horrific. Now, I no longer can trust frontier to do business ever again. I then booked American Airlines that same morning on 1/31, ended up paying double the cost but that flight left Detroit on time and I ended up getting to see my family almost an hour earlier]. My return flight to Detroit on American was on time and got me home 13 min earlier than expected on 2/9/23. The moral of the story is that (moving forward) I’ll now only fly American or perhaps Delta. However, I most certainly will never fly Frontier ever again as they’re disreputable and can not be relied on to get to a destination. My trust for Frontier is done!

### "never fly with Frontier"
Not Verified | The worst and most horrible airline. There are so rude agents at Denver airport. They are trying to make money from everything, because of their behavior in front of the gate for a standard and small personal item that was exactly fitted with Frontier dimensions but they prevented me to go to the board, and a long and horrible experience after that - never fly with Frontier.

### "Frontier is really the worst"
Not Verified |  I have flown with many airline companies. Frontier is really the worst. I have done it once and said, "never again". I just booked another flight for the second time, and it was instant regret again at the airport. Why did I book them again? Cheap! They ripped me off with the baggage and charged me 124$ for the roundtrip, only because I carried a small carry-on bag. I did this upfront, not last minute at the airport, otherwise, it would have been over 200$. Upon arrival, I walked to the check-in desk because I had not received any boarding passes. The lady (who was helpful) said that the flight was delayed for 5hrs. I did not know. She checked my information and gave me an email address I had never heard of in my life. That was why I did not receive any communication (funny, I did receive the confirmation from trip.com). She told me to go online and get the boarding passes myself, otherwise, she had to charge me 25$ per person. When I opened the browser on my phone, it only showed me errors, so she friendly helped me print out the boarding passes for free. After waiting for 5 hrs, the gate changed, and everyone had to change the gates. after a total of 5.5hrs, we boarded, and once everyone was in their seat, we were told to move 20 people to the front of the plane. What the heck, the plane wasn't even empty! We left with a total delay of 6 hrs. The return flight we had another misery of 4.5hrs delay, gate change several times, etc. No matter if it's cheaper, at the end you pay and suffer more.

### "don't understand how they can just cancel a flight"
Horrible experience today. Frontier cancelled our flight hours before we were supposed to leave. Their approach was to send an email apologizing that our flight was "disrupted". We had no idea what that meant so we tried to call, but they have no phone number. They require you to chat with a representative, which we did. The rep, who struggled to communicate in English, confirmed that our fight was still booked and leaving on time. So we headed over to the airport only to find the flight was canceled! All the passengers there were as shocked as we were. Their agents offered us a refund or to rebook...but all the flights were sold out! We would have to rebook the next day from another airport. When I asked the agent why the flight was cancelled she said "air traffic control" but could not explain what that meant or why our flight was canceled. It was certainly not due to weather because it is a beautiful day and there are planes flying over us as I write this. I don't understand how they can just cancel a flight and not notify you that the flight is cancelled. Very upset and now have to pay 4x the amount and miss my meeting tomorrow am. Not right.

### "now officially worse in class"
The Frontier of old is dead the once great, affordable, and caring airline is now officially worse in class in just a few short years ... it just isn’t worth it. They have completely abandoned the concept of service, let alone customer service. I recently purchased 5 tickets to take my family from Denver to San Juan on Jan 27th. During the first leg of our flight Denver to Tampa Fl our Frontier plane had a mechanical issue, so our flight was diverted to Atlanta Georgia. Here is where the nightmare begins, after being abruptly dumped in Atlanta the gate agent tried to get us to our final destination San Juan but was unable to through any city Frontier flew due to the severe overbooking of Frontier flights. She advised the best Frontier could do is maybe get us to our final destination 3 days into our 5 day vacation if it at all. So this gate agent being a normal human knowing our situation (that one of the passengers a Type 1 Diabetic that required the constant insulin and pump accessories which extra now needed days worth were in her checked bag that Frontier was going to send off to San Juan to sit in the heat for 3 days) had the common sense that this would not work so she advised our family to book with another carrier. Per her advice we did at a cost of over $2500 almost 300% more than our first round trip tickets. This gate agent then provided us a card to get a refund for our travel costs which Frontier was unable to provide. Now a normal person would quickly look at the situation and say Frontier did not provide service from Denver to San Juan at all and Frontier was not able to produce a solution to even get us there reasonably delayed. So, at minimum this customer is owed for services Frontier did NOT provide and the right thing to do would be compensate them the extra travel cost that a Frontier Rep in Atlanta advised them to book. Instead, Frontier flat out refused any refund stating “I review all the information to make sure that I did not missed any information but it shows on our end that more of the flight a on time and there's a segment that delayed more than an hour so for this type of information, I am sorry but we're unable to process your refund request.”  Only delayed more than an HOUR… Frontier couldn’t provide service for at min of 72 HOURS!! That doesn’t make any sense at all you dumped a family of 5 in Atlanta, in turn missing the flight to San Juan. You then only offered the solution of staying a night in Atlanta then going to a different city than planned Miami staying the night there because there was a better chance of maybe going to San Juan 3 days later. What world does that make sense to anyone? I have flown Frontier for years; This is not the service I received in the past at all. A few years back I was once delayed a little over hour at a gate and got a travel voucher offered (I didn’t even ask)

### "nickel and dime you for everything"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst business ever conceived. They nickel and dime you for everything and their cancellation policy is worded to purposefully confuse you. They won't refund or provide a voucher for necessary cancellations unless you pay up front. So they keep your money and then resell the seats. They advertise cheap prices but then charge you for everything but air to breath. They even discontinued a customer service phone number because they couldn't keep up with the complaints. The most uncomfortable seats ever made.

### "read all of the fine print"
Please read all of the fine print before dealing with this airline. I booked a flight for my sons and I for a sports trip. We ended up not having enough players for the trip so I had to cancel my flight. Well, there are no refunds or cancellations so I lost the entire $600 plus that I spent. The airline conveniently charged a $99 cancellation fee plus taxes per person with conveniently equaled the exact same amount that I paid for the ticket. On top of that, there is no way to get a live person on the phone, only email or chat. I was able to cancel all of our other arrangements and got my money back. I didn't necessarily have to get all of my money back but if I could have gotten a credit to use towards another trip, I would have been satisfied. But there was no money left over after their fees. So please make sure you have some insurance or better yet, just fly a better quality airline.

### "don't let them rip you off"
Just wanted to remind everyone to take pictures of your personal item in the sizer and screen shot the dimensions they allow on the site so you can easily file a charge back when they try to hit you with a $100 bag fee for a bag that should be free! Their sizers seem to be smaller than the website says the max dimensions are too so maybe bring a tape measure. Get your cheap flight but don't let them rip you off just because they're scrambling for money after all those forced refunds! I would wait until after your return flight to file the charge back so they can't be petty and strand you.

### "Horrible experience caused by flight attendant"
Horrible experience caused by flight attendant. There was a situation where there was something wrong with the one of the windows. We were on the plane for over an hour and a half. Someone asked if we may please get water since some of the guests were not able to get something to drink prior to getting on the flight. The flight attendant told the passengers to be patient and to STOP complaining! She stated that she would not be able to provide water because it would prolong us being there and that they too want to get to their destination. Unfortunately that’s  unacceptable being that she’s being paid to work and as customers we paid for a service regardless of the cost of our tickets we should all been treated fairly and properly. There were infants and children on the plane. A gasp was heard throughout the plane with disbelief of what and how she said it. After two other really nice flight attendants did offer water to the passengers. In my opinion it was the way the passengers were treated. They should have allowed those that needed to get off to do so and return. This was a inconvenience to the passengers so they should of been a little more compassionate. Also they broke my sister new luggage and refused to replace it because she didn’t call within 4 hrs.

### "Very unprofessional"
Not Verified | Absolutely ridiculous!! Never flying with Frontier Airlines again! We booked a flight that was supposed to leave at 6:30am, had 4 delays and waited at the airport for an extra 3 hours for them to tell us the flight was cancelled. Luckily we were able to book with a different airline for the same day since we both have to get back to work the following day. Then when we tried to get a refund at the desk where the attendant told us to go, they told us we just had to wait for an email. Very unprofessional! !

### "absolutely awful experience"
Completely incompetent airline, arrived over an hour early for our flight, had to wait in line for 45 mins to get our boarding pass, they let half the line cut in front of us for a different flight causing us to miss our flight. Thenthey told us we would have to rebook, pay another $100 each for rebooking for a flight out of an airport that's a two hour drive away from where we are staying and we have no way of getting there. Received no apology from anyone and was patronized by Frontier staff the entire time. I will never fly Frontier again, absolutely awful experience.

### "rude and unacceptable behaviour"
I flew with same bag while coming to Orlando from Cleveland, but while traveling back they want my bag to be in the bin and my handle was out side,. They want me to pay 99 or they will close the doors. Very rude and unacceptable behaviour.

### "They had definitely lost my custom"
Frontier team at the gate in Atlanta was humiliating every passenger by making everyone put their clearly correctly sized bags through the size checking box. Very rude and condescending. If the passengers were holding slippers or pillows out for the flight, they were made put everything back in the bag and test it again. Very, very unpleasant. I was my first flight with Frontier, and i will not be flying again. Humiliation should not be a part of an economy experience, and if an airline is determined to get their money one way or another, they should not sell basic tickets under false pretence. They had definitely lost my custom.

### "overcharged for my baggage"
Got overcharged for my checked baggage and than it was a different charge for the same checked baggage. Gate agent kept pulling people from the line to check their carry on and once we didn’t meet requirement, charged us an additional $100. Staff member told us with a bad attitude “we warned you 3 times. Other airlines significantly cheaper when you calculated the additional fees. Never flying Frontier Airlines again

### "Not a single apology"
Was delayed 2 hours. Made the passengers spend an hour inside the flight. There were pets on the flight. Poor things were agitated waiting for the flight to depart. They could have waited until the flight was ready to depart to board. Nickel and dime everyone for every single thing. Not a single apology from anyone for the delay.

### "disgustingly horrible"
Not Verified | This flight was disgustingly horrible. We started out boarding at gate D1 then they switch our gate back to E4. Then when we got there they proceeded to switch our gate back to D3. Needless to say everyone on the flight is exhausted and sweaty from running around the Atlanta Airport. Then when I went to inquire about the actual flight departure time the agent at the front desk was rude and nasty with me as if she had to run around the airport herself. I rest assured that me and no one who is boarding this flight would recommend that NO ONE EVER FLY FRONTIER. They charge for everything and are super unprofessional. If you dont take my word for it you will see yourself.

### "will not fly with them again"
Rude and pushy gate attendants, 2 hours late, charged me 100.00 at the gate for my personal item that meets airline requirements. Bag had small wheels that would not fit into the rigid sizer but was actually smaller than what is allowed - 15x13x8. And fit no problem on my flight from Buffalo to Tampa. Needless to say will not fly with them again. Big money grab and unprofessional, not to mention the terrible seats. Emailed customer service but said they could not refund as no report was submitted at the gate.

### "charge me again for the luggage"
I purchased a round trip ticket from Chicago to Orlando for a funeral. The funeral was delayed so I called 2 days prior to my return in order to extend the date of return. First of all you can't talk to anybody in customer service because they don't have one. I was attended by a third party (orbit) and they charged me an extra $133 dollars per traveler in order to change our flight. Next Frontier charged me $118 for my luggage and $40 to get my seats. When I arrived to the airport they couldn't find my tickets and said I took off to Chicago. What, I'm right here! Well they said that they had to charge me again for the luggage because I missed my flight! Well its $158 dollars and you could call customer service for a refund. They charged me $5.00 to talk to an agent, $3.50 for water on the plain. Everything cost money on these flights.

### "stroller was completely damaged"
Traveling with young kids can be hard, and incredibly stressful. Traveling with young kids by yourself is harder, which was my case It sounds like helpful, understanding, compassionate, and owning up to their huge mistakes were unfortunately not the words of the day for a mom who was recently traveling on a Frontier Airlines with my three-year-old daughter from Santa Ana to DFW early January. My child's stroller was completely damaged upon receiving it at our layover in Las Vegas (where Frontier airline attendants told me to tell them at our final destination of the damage). I then had to somehow with no help from the airline and my situation of having no workable stroller to transport my carry on, diaper bag, toddler, damaged stroller to our connecting flight, with our flight being delayed by 5 hours. I was furious! After landing finally at DFW at 2am in the morning, I went to the baggage claim office, and the process to figure that out, what to do about my situation of my trashed stroller, took way too long, and resulted in my finally being told by Cecil who was solely handling the incident at customer service from the baggage department that the manager the following day would call me for an update, and she ordered me to let her take the stroller, and that she would give it to their department that fixes items like baggage, and if Frontier could not fix it, they would reimburse me for the stroller if I could give proof with a receipt of how much it cost. She then got all of my information, my drivers license, phone number, trip confirmation number etc. and this would be given to the manager the following morning. I am guessing you already know the outcome of this, that this did not happen (the manager contacting me), nor did the airline fix or reimburse me for my stroller, hence my having to write this letter. It was actually way worse (after I finally was able to get an update on it ultimately by going all the way back to the airport) that they threw away my stroller, or one of the workers took it. I contacted the claims department online and tried to file a claim there, but they repeatedly told me to take pictures, even though I repeatedly told them that they took my stroller and it was in their possession. I have never faced a customer service department that is more difficult to contact. They have no phone number, just an automated chat that I am questioning even has a real live person option, based on my communication with a supposed "live" representative. I had to travel 1+ hours with my toddler all the way to the airport again just to receive a status update (where I found out it was thrown away and that Cecil the customer service representative that took my stroller and assured me it would be fixed or replaced was lying to me. She offered sympathy at that time, that she too had kids. This makes me wonder if she took it, because when I went back to DFW airport and spoke with Nenita, she aggressively said that it was against airline policy to fix damaged strollers. My stroller cost 300$ and I bought it used, but that isnt the entire point. They took my stroller and either threw it away or stole it for themselves. Nenita said that Cecil said I no longer wanted the stroller and that I accepted a 20$ umbrella stroller from walmart in replacement, being content. If this is the case, why was it held for 3 days at the airport having Nenita wonder why I wasn't picking it up.

### "please learn to be honest"
Told maintenance issue and would be a bit - 1.5 hours later they announced they were waiting for the okay to fix the plane. Flight delays, 7 delays in total. Arrived at 5 pm and its now 10:48. No more Frontier, glad they fixed the plane, but please learn to be honest and tell time. They may have the lower prices, but you pay for your seat, carry on, and check in individually. So its still Cost you.

### "just absolutely terrible"
This airline sucks but if you read the reviews you should already know this. Delayed flight, horrible seat, lost luggage, just absolutely terrible. That was the last time I will ever fly that airline. Just simply awful. Pick literally anything else.

### "Extremely unorganized and unreliable"
Absolute lame excuse for an airline. Extremely unorganized and unreliable. Grossly overbooked my flight as spent an hour trying to convince passengers to fly to a different city altogether. Forced everyone to size their bags and anyone whose bag was too big had to get out of line and pay. Those who tried to pay online couldn’t due to the poor quality of app and website. They charged me more than my flight cost just to bring a single bag onboard. It seemed as if more people boarded than there were total seats, and by the time the plane was supposed to be in the air people were still shuffling around the cabin trying to find seats, often separated from traveling companions. This airline is absolutely horrible and I will never fly with them again. I strongly suggest no one does, as the headaches, zero legroom, and insane overcharging of customers is not worth saving a few bucks. Their lack of organization directly caused delays, possibly affecting layovers. I’ve never had an experience this poor, and after trying Frontier once over a month ago I decided to give them another shot. They failed miserably yet again.

### "changed our flight"
UNACCEPTABLE! Frontier Airlines changed our flight from a NONSTOP 3-hour flight to TWO 3-HOUR FLIGHTS with a TEN HOUR layover and a 4:30 AM arrival time. And then did not offer a full refund. Absolutely ridiculous!

### "avoid flying with them again"
Frontier Airlines' customer service is nonexistent and shows no appreciation for their customers. There is no complimentary tea, coffee or water. It is not possible to print your boarding pass, not from a computer at home or at the kiosk when you get there. When I could not print my boarding pass from home, I assumed I could print it out when I got there from the kiosk but that was not an option. I was told if I wanted it printed out the charge would be $25. I had to put the App on my phone at the airport in order to board. For those reasons and a bigger one - that you cannot call and talk to a live representative - I will avoid flying with them again.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | Worst Airline Ever. First I paid upfront for a seat upgrade, only for my flight to be canceled, 45 minutes before boarding. Then I asked my flight attendant, she told me they were over booked, and my upgrade was invalid, then asked how to get a refund, she said to call customer service, easy enough, right? Only customer service is all automated, so you can imagine how that went. Then I thought, I would ask for some sort of compensation for having to stay another night in Vegas @$250+ a night. Once again not even worth the time and frustration/disappointment. So in conclusion, I will never fly Frontier again, worst customer service, by far the worst experience I've had flying. One more thing I paid for WiFi and I didn't work, for half the flight that had paid for it.

### "not worth their horrible service"
When our Zone (Zone 1) was called to board and our boarding pass was scanned, we were told that we were bumped until the next day as the flight was overweight and there had been no volunteers to fly next day! We had one carry on and one personal item. It is not our fault Frontier let people check the multitude of large, heavy baggage! There were a total of 10 passengers that were told they would have to fly next day! We were called to the boarding desk and they stated they were able to get us on the flight as another passenger volunteered to fly next day. We were given our boarding pass but we were not in our original seats we PAID for. The staff response was they needed our original seats for wheelchair passengers. UM, we PAID extra for those seats they shouldn’t have been available for anyone to purchase! We were then told that they would refund us. The crap show did not stop there. The refund was placed as a credit and the system would not let us check in for our return home as it stated we had a balance due! It was a CREDIT not a balance due. We had to buy a service we already had in order to get rid of the credit so we could check in! You can’t have any type of help as you are charged a fee. Frontier fees their passengers to death! This was a direct flight: No complementary beverages, i.e. soda, water juice; no in-flight internet or entertainment – You PAY for everything!! This will be the last time we fly with Frontier, the direct flight is not worth their horrible service!

### "customer service is paramount and this wasn't it"
Pleasant flight from Bush Intercontinental, desk agents were great even though I had a gift bag with me. However, leaving Denver Colorado with a shopping bag of things I had purchased, thinking ok. Houston was fine. So I have my personal bag and a shopping bag, small not too big at all. The gate attendant was rude, condescending and no compassion whatsoever. In my world customer service is paramount and this wasn't it. I took flight 760 and all employees servicing this flight was horrible. By the way, I had to pay $99 for a small shopping bag. Unacceptable.

### "Frontier didn't help us at all"
Frontier canceled my flight today at 3pm, it's 11pm and I'm still here, I'll be here till 8am in the morning, why you ask? Well because Frontier didn't help us at all and just stranded us here. I had to spend $300 to get a ticket with another carrier and the soonest was 8am in the morning. They have a hotel in this airport but nope they wouldn't get us a room. Many restaurants nope no food either. They are horrible.

### "complete lack of organization and communication"
The most disorganized airline ever. My fiancé and I were scheduled to fly out of Cancun to Chicago on January 4, 2023 on Frontier Airlines flight 45. We checked in ourselves and our luggage and then went to the departure gate about an hour before boarding time and heard other passengers talking about a flight cancellation. We then checked our app and saw that my ticket said canceled but that of my fiancé said nothing. We had received two emails about flight delays, but neither of us got one in reference to the cancellation. Due to this confusion, we began searching the airport for a Frontier Agent but could not find anyone. We then went back down to the check in counter where a Frontier Agent told us to wait at a different counter for instructions on how to rebook as well as find our luggage. After an hour, we were told to once again pass through security and go to our original departure gate. When we got there, a Frontier Agent was present but told us that she had no information and that we should go back to the original check in counter. We ran back down, were told to go back up and so once again passed through security and returned to the same gate. At that point, we were told to go to yet another gate on another level where we waited an hour only to be told to go back to the original gate. At that point, we were notified that we could not be placed on a flight until January 9th so it was up to us to figure it out. We were then escorted to our suitcases which required us to go through both passport control and security. As we were not offered a reasonable alternative from Frontier (we did not have an extra 5 days to spare), we booked a ticket on Southwest for $932.08. We had to once again go through the whole check in process and security. Frontier has only agreed to compensate us for $422.66 of this ticket cost as the delay was weather related. The refund was supposedly processed on 1/5/2023 but as of today, 1/28/2023 it still have not been processed. The complete lack of organization and communication has given us the worst travel experience ever.

### "You're not saving any money"
Not Verified |  It costs more for your baggage to fly than the people. Carry on + checked bag + seat assignment is $160 per person. Industry standard weight limit for checked bags is 50lbs - they drop it down to 40lbs and charge you an additional $50 if you're over that, which is damn near guaranteed. Then they charge you $3.50 for a soda and it feels like you're riding a not so well cared for bus. Flight delayed twice and we were told it was because they were having trouble finding crew to staff the flight. They have this scam pretty well figured out. Now you know to save yourself some aggravation and just fly one of the legit airlines. You're not saving any money here.

### "First and last time flying with Frontier"
First and last time flying with Frontier airlines on 01/05. I purchased tickets through Priceline in November for a straight through flight to Phoenix. The aircraft I was supposed to board with the flight number they gave me on my boarding pass was destined for Las Vegas and one of the Frontier ticket agents on that floor near the gate I was supposed to board at “fixed” my flight and their supposed error in the system. You’re on the manifest for Las Vegas but not Phoenix let me call my manager and we’ll get this fixed”. I walked all over that airport to try and make this flight they changed the gate twice and had to go to the corrected gate after given the new boarding pass. Apparently, not that I was told, I was put on standby and after getting aboard and getting comfy was kicked off and then when they were kicking me off was told I was on standby. (And that they had overbooked the PHX flight and I was pushed to a flight to Las Vegas … with no second boarding pass from Las Vegas to Phoenix. how would that have even worked I wonder?) Apparently NONREV is for standby, I had no clue. No hotel voucher, however they did get me a flight the next day with a connecting flight in CO. The next morning that flight was delayed by like an hour but I was told by the ticket agent that I was on standby and it was a full flight so I just decided to go home, get some sleep and cry that whole weekend.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown on. They lost my wife's and I's luggage, delayed or cancelled every single flight we were on, and had awful customer service. We were going to a friend's wedding in Chicago and our original flight out of Phoenix was 'disrupted' by over 3 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight in Orlando. After standing in line for 3 hours in Orlando because they were severely understaffed to rebook our connecting flight, they told us the only flight we could get out on today was landing in the other Chicago Airport. We were told our luggage would make it there, but after arriving it never came. We filed a claim but lost all of our clothes and items needed for the wedding. When returning from Chicago they cancelled our flight and told me my only option was to travel to the other Chicago Airport and catch a flight there (which also ended up getting delayed). When arriving in Las Vegas (our layover) we attempted to get our boarding passes for our Phoenix flight. We found out the employee from Chicago cancelled our connecting flight and gave us a one way ticket to Las Vegas. When we explained the situation that it wasn't our fault, the employee said there was nothing he could do because the flight had been over sold by 17 tickets. We were placed on stand by for a flight I booked 3 months in advance because an employee messed up. I never write reviews but I hope someone reads this so they never experience the horrible business practices of Frontier. Spend the extra money for a reliable airline, I will never fly or recommend Frontier ever again.

### "not be flying this airline again"
Not Verified |  I am not a fan of this airline. The first time I flew with them boarding started and an alarm went off causing a 20 mins delay before boarding started back up. The second time flying with them, I was heading back to the military base where I am stationed and they refused to give a family pass to my mom because I am not ”leaving for deployment today” even though I’m scheduled to leave for a deployment soon. This is also the only airline that I have ever flown that doesn’t give active duty military the option to board early. Along with this the people I dealt with in getting my bags checked and boarding passes didn’t ask me how many bags I wanted to check - I wanted to check both bags but they went and printed only one tag without ever asking me) and were very rude towards me. Will not be flying this airline again. I’d rather pay a little more money to get the better service.

### "most horrible flying experiences"
One of the most horrible flying experiences you can have. Their seats are horribly uncomfortable. Their bag policy is brutal. Ground service is very rude. Every item sold on plane are absurdly expensive. Not so friendly for families with little ones. Cheap tickets are available only for the days when people are not traveling a lot. Zero out of 10.

### "not worth the cheaper ticket"
We arrived late to check in because of the horrific traffic situation at Cancun International Airport. It was 30 minutes until take-off. I had prepaid my large suitcase to be checked and of course they told me they could not check it. We were told the next flight was in 2 days, but we all had to be at work the next morning. We asked if they would put my bag on the next flight, They said no. We asked if they would ship it to me, I would pay whatever amount they put on it. They said no. They literally told me the only way we could get on the flight was to take our boarding passes, run for the gate and leave my bag there. We asked what do you mean leave it here. She said "Throw it away". I left it at the Frontier counter and ran for the plane. We got on. The pilots were stuck in traffic and didn't arrive for 90 minutes! I was not permitted to leave the plane to go back and get my car keys I left in my suitcase! No one would go to the counter and get them for me. A gate attendant boarded the plane, came to my seat and gave me a number to call once I got home. I called the number. It was to the airport lost and found director. He said they did not have my bag, to call the airline. I have contacted the airline by submitting a lost bag claim, chatting to an agent online (they have now closed down any customer service phone numbers) and they are telling me they do not have my bag, to call the airport. Vicious circle. I emailed the airline and asked what their policy was if there was a bag left unchecked at their counter. I was told Frontier had no policy regarding that, but the counter agent should have turned it into Lost and Found. Are they serious? No policy for an unattended, unchecked bag at an international airport check in counter? This is beyond outrageous. Talk about not having any concern for me, their customer. And on top of that no policy in place for the security of anyone coming through their check in counter. Stay away from this airline. It is not worth the cheaper ticket.

### "An absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  The staff at the front desk extremely rude and inconsiderate. We have to pay. Frontier Airlines was charging $80 for a little back pack, aside from the $25 boarding passes. (3 of them). An absolute nightmare to say the least. I would never recommend this airline or flight with them, ever.

### "not recommend this airline"
Wasn’t able to use self check in kiosk, wasn’t working when I went to drop off my bag, the attendant said I wasn’t allowed to board saying I was too late. I was at the airport in plenty of time to board my flight. I was treated as if I missed my flight entirely and wanted to charge me an additional $99 to take a flight the next day and also said I would have to repay the baggage fee and the seat fee. I said I wasn’t paying twice and asked for a refund on the fees which she explained I wasn’t entitled to a refund and gave me a card with a qr code explaining the refund policy. I said I’ll be disputing the charges through my bank she said good luck to me. I’ll try again with another airline that’s more friendly and accommodating definitely will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### " wouldn't let us get our tickets"
Frontier is a garbage airline. On Delta or United, I arrive ~1 hour before departure with Precheck and no issues. Frontier wouldn't let us get our tickets. They disabled the app so that you could not pull up your tickets.

### "wouldn't reinstate my flight"
Not Verified |  Very unsatisfied. They cancelled my booking, then wouldn't reinstate my flight or refund me and had to re pay a different airline to get my flight. Spent hours trying to contact someone and only got automated system. When I finally got a human she was friendly but still was unable to get me anywhere with fixing what the airline did. Never again will I waste my time or money with them.

### "The absolute worst experience"
The absolute worst experience with any airline of all time. Gate attendant extremely rude. Your personal item literally can't be bigger than a medium size purse. Extremely rude flight attendants. Constant confrontational attitude with passenger. In my many years of flying I have never seen anything like this. The airplane was extremely hot. This was my first and last time ever flying Frontier. I wish I could give 0 stars.

### "agent at the gate was extremely rude"
We bought our tickets in November in order to go on a direct flight from Orlando to Rochester. When we got into the airport there was no one there to help you on the kiosk machine. Our boarding pass would not load on the machine. We finally gave up on the kiosk machine and walked over to the baggage claim and asked them to help. They told us we should have taken a picture of the machine. We told them that there was nothing in the fine print that told you to take a photo. They told us our seats would be assigned at the gate. We walked up to the gate and asked them to assign a seat. They told us that they would be right with us. They told us we would have a seat in a few minutes. A half hour later they told us that the flight was overbooked and that we voluntarily needed to not be on the plane. So in order to get the better policy we had to say we voluntarily didn’t want to take the flight. Even though we had taken the flight because it was direct. They were rude and not listening to anything that was being said. We then were told to go back to the main frontier entrance because Jim would give us a check. We walked back to the front with a father and 15 year old daughter that were in the same position. We waited at the front desk for another 20 minutes for our checks. Once the checks came out they only gave the father and daughter one check because they said that the daughter should fly back to Rochester herself. It was never told at the gate that if they hadn’t taken the seat they would not be getting money. The agent at the gate was extremely rude and told us that is was none of our business what happens to the other couple because we were taken care of. She then walked away and never came back. I would have been ok until they wanted a 15 year old to fly home to Rochester alone.

### "Our flight was a fiasco"
Our flight to San Francisco through Phoenix from Salt Lake City was a fiasco. We arrived in Phoenix only to see that our flight to San Francisco was cancelled. We went to the gate and were informed that were no more flights for that day and that the only thing they could do was to get us on a flight late the next day that would take TEN hours to get to San Francisco. We asked if they could put us on another airline: "No, we don't do that". We asked if they could pay for a hotel and/or meals: "No, we stopped doing that in September". The 4 gate agents were very immature and were goofing around and laughing with each other while they had a line full of very stressed out passengers. Looking around at the other airline counters showed an immediate contrast in professionalism compared to the absolutely ridiculous experience at the Frontier counter in Phoenix. We were given the option to get a refund on the portion of the trip we didn't fly, which we eventually took as we looked for other flights that we would need to spend MORE money on to get home. We ended up driving back home from Phoenix to Salt Lake City (which was a horrible experience for other reasons). We had our New Years weekend ruined by Frontier Airlines. We only had two days planned to spend in San Francisco. I will *NEVER* fly on a budget airline again. To summarize and add a few things: Baggage Fees: $65 and up each way for one bag. Allowed Free Item to Carry On: A small item such as a small purse or bag. Backpacks: No Laptop Bag: No. Talk to an Agent at the airport: $10 fee Reserve a seat: A fee. Support Phone Line: Refers you to CHAT online. There is NO customer service avenue where you can speak to a person over the phone. The phone says that it's website offers several ways to get a hold of customer service. Here is what they are: CHAT, EMAIL, and FILE A COMPLAINT.

### "seats feel like wooden seats"
Worst airline to fly. The seats feel like wooden seats with no cushion for back and neck. Leg space is almost nonexistent. And on top of it they made me pay 65$ for laptop bag because it wasn’t fitting inside their box.

### "I’ll never fly with them again"
I arrived early to check in early for my flight. I waited for 2 hours because I know it would be busy because it’s Martin Luther King day. There was no agent in their booth. I tried to message the Frontier Customer Service and the agent just left me hanging, telling me that she’s receiving a high volume of messages which is impossible because it’s a one on one chat. I’ll never fly with them again.

### "the agents were very rude"
We boarded the plane, sat there almost an hour and then had to deplane because a pilot hadn't been scheduled. After a 3.5 hour hour delay we boarded again and the agents were very rude. They made us each go through and put our personal items in the bin to ensure they fit, even though we had done that earlier and everything fit then, but this was another waste of all of the passengers time.

### "I will avoid them at all costs"
My backpack fit in the measurement box at the gate, but they would not let me on the flight until I paid $99 for it claiming that the straps were too bulky. I have flown with the same backpack on Frontier with no problems, but the agent at this gate was particularly rude and aggressive. Half my flight had the same fate and were all shocked and angry. I filed a complaint through the website, and was given a mere $25 voucher for the inconvenience and "sincere apologies". Overall, this airline is terrible and I will avoid them at all costs. Customer service is awful at the gate. The only highlight was some of the flight attendants had a pretty good attitude.

### "they have no customer service"
Not Verified |   I had to pay to get a seat after booking the ticket, I had to pay to take a carry on, I opted not to pay for the opportunity to speak to a representative and that was not smart with this cut rate airline. The unfriendly online booking put most of the emphasis on trying to get me to purchase a deal to get me cheaper rate, which I did and was it not applied. My TSA Pre-check was not applied either, but since I didn’t pay extra for the privilege of being able to call someone, I timed out on the chat several attempts and was unsuccessful in any contact after several hours of trying. There is no phone number to call after booking and if you don’t get the booking right online after paying so much extra for things included on economy airlines you are just out of luck. They boast about being a green airline, but that just means they have no customer service and a rude airline staff. They also nickel and dime customers for things that are normally included on reputable airlines. As unscrupulous as they are, I would be willing to bet Frontier starts charging for using the restroom in -flight. Never again!

### "flight home was cancelled"
Worst airline ever! My flight home was cancelled and Frontier did nothing but leave me and boyfriend stranded. I called several times and one of the people even hung up in my face. The next person I talked with wanted to charge me $950 to get my boyfriend and myself back home. What I couldn’t understand is why I would I have to pay when my flight was cancelled? This totally unfair and you shouldn’t treat your customers like this. I'll never book with you again.

### "I would rather pay more and get better service"
Frontier Airlines has been the worst airline company I've ever worked with. They have zero customer service and you will wait in line for hours to speak to someone. I missed a flight going from Orlando to Cincinnati because Frontier listed the incorrect gate number on our boarding passes. We waited at gate 111 for hours until I asked someone and they said our flight was actually leaving from gate 11 and our boarding passes were incorrect. We were late to the gate because Orlando airport is a mess and you will wait in the TSA line for hours at a time. Frontier did not care that they listed the wrong gate on our passes and were very rude about the whole situation. Then I waited in line for additional services at Frontier for hours before speaking to someone. They had 3-4 Frontier personnel working with people until right before 5 pm and then they all disappeared at one time and didn't return to the desk for over 40 minutes. I will never fly Frontier again, I would rather pay more and get better service. I highly recommend against this airline.

### "the worst experience I have ever had!"
My flight was delayed 3 times starting at 6pm. At almost 9pm the flight was cancelled with no flights departing until 2 days later. I was offered a $50 voucher with accommodations and every employee was rude! I was then given a “refund voucher” that had to take 7 business days to see if I was eligible even after the fact that Frontier cancelled on their end! I lost money on my original vacation hotel stay and was charged a fee for cancelling my car rental! This was the worst experience I have ever had!

### "Extremely poor service"
Return flight cancelled 12/23/22. Tried to rebook. Made a mistake in booking 12/23 and immediately cancelled flight. Frontier took almost $900 out of my account for rebooking and guarantees full refund. I have not received a refund as of 1/14/22. I have yet to receive a refund for the cancelled flight home that was pre booked either. There are no Humans to talk to in customer service. Extremely poor service.

### "a very dismissive attitude"
I fly Frontier very frequently and am an elite member so I am familiar with their onboard services. I fly from RDU to Philly every other other weekend and the flight is always 51-59 minutes. I flew up on the flight last night and was very pleased with the equipment. That flight is usually a A320 but last night was a sparkling A321 and the flight was right on time. I was disappointed with the flight attendants though. On this flight they do not routinely do a beverage service but sometimes they do. But they always at least will sell you something if you ring your call bell. I actually personally asked the flight attendants for service and was told that due to the short duration of the flight they could not serve me. I have taken this flight 16 times in the last 8 months and never was not or did not see service upon request. One more thing I observed was a young woman was going to the forward bathroom and the flight attendant refused her access to the bathroom and said we were landing in 2 minutes. We were at least 15 mins from landing and there was zero turbulence at that point. My feeling is this- they just did not want to get up and do their job and had a very dismissive attitude.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Cheap tickets but not worth it because they will charge you fees. Horrible workers and customer service. Avoid at all costs! Horrible.

### "poor customer service policies"
Not Verified |  Talk about poor customer service policies and scheduling! My wife and I fly 2-3 times per year, and have flown with several different airlines over the years. Our recent experience with Frontier is the worst we have ever experienced. Our flight was scheduled January 2 from Ft Lauderdale to Phoenix. When we went to check in 24 hours prior to our flight, we found that our flight was rescheduled and was to depart 5 hours earlier than scheduled. No justification for the change was given, but luckily we were able to easily adjust our schedule, but many travelers were certainly not as flexible. When we arrived at the airport, we found that the flight was delayed an hour, and it was delayed again and was finally, unfortunately, canceled. Again, no justification was given. I noticed that another flight was about to leave for Phoenix in a half-hour. I spoke with the Frontier gate agent about getting on that next flight, and she said that was not possible because she wasn’t able to sell me a ticket. I said that we didn’t need other tickets; we just wanted to fly standby? Again, she said that wasn’t possible and said that we needed to reschedule our flight using their online chat. We found it very frustrating that Frontier didn’t have a phone number to speak with a real person (undoubtedly to save money). We spent the next 2 hours trying to reschedule our flight using their chat line, which was no help (again a way to save money). For example, unless you tap their chat line every minute you lose your connection and have to start all over again. In desperation, we finally visited the ticket counter and were able to reschedule our flight for 2 days later. We boarded our rescheduled flight, following 2 more delays. When we reached our layover in Atlanta, my neighbor told me that many airlines were compensating travelers for hotel costs and per diem because of canceled flights. I checked with the Atlanta's Frontier gate agent, and she said that I should have received a cancelation email and that I was supposed to handle this issue using their online chat. I told her that we didn’t receive a cancellation email (certainly a way to avoid compensating passengers), and I showed her my chat that said that I was supposed to contact an airline agent in person. Then, she gave me the old runaround and responded that I should have inquired about compensation at the Ft Lauderdale airport. Now I was real mad, and said that it shouldn’t matter what airport I was in, that they were all part of the same airline. I boarded the flight in frustration, vowing to never fly with Frontier again.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience, the airplanes are uncomfortable as hell. I experienced a lot of issues with the itinerary as well. If that wasn't enough, the application does not work well most of the time.

### "lack of customer service was appalling"
Not Verified |  On 12-30-2022 TPA TO GRR flight 2510 original flight departure time 4:36pm - delayed to 6:30pm, we understand that the weather was bad. We got to the airport early and there were no kiosks to print out our tickets and they would not pull up online. The lady at the checked bag counter could not get our tickets printed and was very rude. We almost missed our flight because they tried to make us get in line to check our bags even though we didn't have checked bags. They finally got them printed and we rushed to the gate. While standing in line the airline manager aggressively told our party that we needed to check 4 bags and we had too many. We talked to him in a reasonable way and he demanded that it at least we had to check 3 bags even if they were small enough to be personal items. He was very disrespectful and yelling loud enough to humiliate us in front of the other passengers. We showed him that our bags were small enough to fit as personal items, putting them into the personal item measurement tool. after we demonstrated the first bag fitting in the measurement tool he said "I am not going to let you measure anymore, you have to pay for at least two bags or you can't get on the plane!". After we proved the first one fit, he prevented us from measuring the other bags by standing in the way of the measuring tool. He told us that they would leave and we would miss our flight. He forced us to pay $198 to check two very small bags. He was so angry that he wouldn't let us on the plane two different times and the flight attendants and ladies at the gate had to re-open the door to the boarding bridge after he closed it. We got to the airplane and he closed the airplane door in front of us and said to stay there and wouldn't let us in again even though we paid so much for the two bags. They said they had to check and see if there was enough room on the plane, even though we purchased our tickets online a month in advance. The boarding passes already had our seat numbers on them (31 A, B and C). Then they changed our seats to (9 E, F, and G) there were so many empty seats that people took their un-checked bags and were putting them above other people's stowing areas because there was so much space. The all the rushing to make sure we paid our bags was pointless because the plane still was delayed another 30 minutes on the tarmac. We were polite and just wanted to make our flight. The lack of customer service was appalling.

### "publicly embarrassed and mistreated"
The gate Manager hated himself and his job, you could tell by how he treated the customers including myself. I purchased Zone 1 tickets on the way to Denver & Zone 1 tickets on the way back to Tampa. I had a bad experience already because the plane departure was almost 2 hours late. Then the gate manager charged passengers 100$ for their backpacks. The manager follows me onto the plane to force me to move from my 550$ Zone 1 seat to zone 3. I was publicly embarrassed and mistreated by this staff.

### "rude and with horrible attitude"
Service agents at Orlando are rude and with horrible attitude. Service agents tell you you are charged to get service even with their own system problems. Agents are on their cell phones on their work station. If you ask for service you are ignored and they overreact just not to service you. No supervision whatsoever. Walk away when see customers and the first word out of their mouth is how much you need to pay to get service from them instead of the basic how can I help you?

### "This is the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Flight was at 8am but it got delayed then changed then at 4pm it was cancelled. The terms & conditions clearly state they are to provide reasonable hotel & food accommodations. Frontier is not willing to help. Wont allow us to speak to management at the airport. I have tried calling and using the online chat but no one answered. I have been waiting at the airport to speak with someone for over 2 hours. This airline has no accountability, they have lied numerous times. This is the worst airline.

### "cancelled our flight without notice"
They cancelled our flight without sending any notice, drove to airport for them to say flight cancelled no explanations. Really bad service, and have only refunded partial amount!

### "flight attendants inattentive, loud & unfriendly"
The flight attendants both ways, were inattentive, loud and unfriendly. On a flight from 1-5am they would not stop talking for a second and made sure the entire plane heard it. The seat quality is below poor, you can quite literally start taking the seat apart. The flight itself was fine, wouldn't travel through here again.

### "service agent’s are the worst"
Our return flight was cancelled for two day’s and they didn’t even accommodate us in any way or form. Their service agent’s are the worst, they give you attitude and are very disrespectful. First time flying this airline and not ever doing it again. Flights were being delayed every two hours. So if you don’t want to go through what my family went through avoid this airline.

### "food and drinks outrageously expensive"
For starters this airline is supposed to be the cheapest airline to fly. The tickets themselves were moderately priced for the flight which was decent. However, the add ons such as checked baggage and seat selection are incredibly overpriced. It was an extra 500$ for both ways just to have seat selection and checked bags. This was the same price we paid for the plane tickets themselves. Our flight got delayed for over an hour. The baggage loading employees were severely understaffed. At first we saw that the wrong baggage vehicles were brought to the plane. Then eventually taken away, and returned with the correct ones. There was only 1 female loading the entire airplane by herself. This is something that a team should do. The flight staff didn’t seem to care about the delay. There was no accommodation, reimbursement, or incentive for us being so delayed. We paid for a flight to be on time and prepared. We didn’t pay this much for a late flight, or the delays. The food and drinks were outrageously expensive for tiny portions. Everyone on the flight were furious the entire time. And the staff just kept brushing it off because they knew that everything was ridiculous as well but they couldn’t do anything about it. On top of this the seats are the worst. Most uncomfortable seats ever. It would be more comfortable to sit in an old pick-up truck. Everyone was in discomfort and complaining the entire flight. Airlines have gotten worse and the only way to have a decent experience is if we pay thousands of dollars for a flight with adequate quality.

### "left us stranded in Mexico"
Not Verified |  Do not ever use this airline. They left us stranded in Mexico and had to pay 9k to get home, by far the worst experience of my life. I wouldn’t fly with this airline again if it was free. The customer service won’t even reimburse us. I’m glad my parents had a big limit card on them or we would’ve been stuck in the country for over 2 weeks.

### "disgusted by the way we were treated"
Horrible experience! I booked ticket through Frontier website for my 80 yo mother to fly from Newburgh NY to Orlando FL. They didn't have any flights to Tampa airport which I live closer to so I booked it to Orlando which is 2 hrs from me. To start her flight home was cancelled a week after I booked ticket so I had to pick another day for her return flight. I checked flight status right up until we left for our 2 hour drive to Orlando it was still on time. We left at 3:30am so I could have her there 2 hours before her flight. We get to airport and the flight status changes from 8:10am takeoff to 9am. I waited with her on line for 3 hours to check her in. While on line the flight status changes again to 7pm takeoff. Now my mother had a ride if she was going to land in NY for the original time but being that her flight was delayed so long she will not have her 80 yo friend waiting for her to land. She will now have to pay for an Uber which will certainly cost a lot to get her home at night. I had to leave her there to wait because I have to go for radiation treatment for breast cancer back home where I live 2 hrs away from the airport. She is afraid they will again reschedule flight. Needless to say we are both so disgusted by the way we were treated. I had a woman that works for Frontier roll her eyes at me when I asked what my mother was supposed to do with a refund they offered her or a voucher. She needs to get home what is she supposed to do with a voucher?

### "This is truly unacceptable customer service"
Frontier delayed my bags for 2 days on a recent flight. I filed a claim before leaving the airport, and the gate agent told me he would input it into the system, so I handed him the claim (paper form). I asked who I could call to check on it and he gave me a phone number. The next day I hadn’t heard anything, so I called the phone number and they hung up on me - 3 different times. I then went to the online chat support and was told that a claim was never filed! I filed a claim online, followed up on it every single day for a week and still didn’t hear back. I now am trying to get reimbursement for my things that I had to replace, at first I just kept getting hung up on or when I use the online chat, agents stop responding. 3 days later, I had to physically go to the airport to check if my bag was there because I was never contacted that it had been found and was at the airport despite filing multiple claims (which it was, for who knows how long). When I finally did get a response (over 3 weeks later and only immediately after I posted a review of the airline online), I was told that “agents were responding in the order in which they received requests” (which I know is a lie because I only received a response after posting a negative review), and that my items cannot be reimbursed? I had to buy a whole new car key because mine was locked in my luggage and they won’t reimburse me. This is truly unacceptable customer service and I can hardly believe they can get away with treating people like this. I will never be flying with them again, and would advise you not to if you can at all help it, because god forbid something should go wrong (even if it’s their fault), you will not receive any help or resolution.

### "Simply the worst airline"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience in the summer where I paid about $1,200 for two tickets to CO to FL to visit family. We were supposed to arrive at about 5.40 am but because of issues with weight and fuel they kept us herded on the plane for hours before telling us we need to move to another plane at a different gate. So many people missed their connections because the second flight also had about an hour delay. We landed at about 8.40 am. Flying from Denver to Las Vegas this time we were delayed about an hour. This time now we have "On Time" listed for a 6.48 pm departure and were to be boarded at 5.53 pm. It is now 6.29 pm and we have yet to start calling zones. What is wrong with your system? And your monopoly charges for bags is insane. The flights are always so uncomfortable and they charge for everything. Simply the worst airline. My fiancé and I got a credit email from the CO to FL, went to use it for this flight and it said the credit does not exist. Absolutely pathetic company, not even going to try to call them given my previous experiences. Some of us only have Frontier for certain flights so it's a shame that they're this terrible for those forced with no other options but to literally drive to destinations other airlines besides Spirit (which is just as bad) do not go through. If you're seeing this or care, listen to the people and get yourself in order with flight times and actually credit people when you mess up.

### "Their customer service is terrible"
Not Verified |  Their customer service is terrible. The flight got delayed multiple times. When we arrived to the airport we were checked in for our flight. Apparently we were the only passengers they checked in for the flight. The passengers who came early and didn't read the delay email were turned around and given a resort voucher. We however, were stuck in the airport with no Frontier representatives for 4 hours trying to figure out what was going on. Eventually American Airlines allowed us to leave and we had to come out of pocket for a place to stay.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. They change policies constantly to screw over their customers (ie bag weight, credit timeframe). You can’t even speak to a live person anymore because they did away with that option. Email and chat gets you no where. They are the worst to fly with and my family will never book with them again. They took over a $700 credit from me because I didn’t book within 90 days! I was not notified I only had 90 days by the representative I was able to speak with at that time. Now I’m screwed, they have all my money and I got absolutely nothing out of it.

### "Awful service, unprofessional staff"
Awful service, unprofessional staff. Have little to no respect to their clients, regardless of disability or age. Running a business right at the gate of the plane. I was blackmailed today, first she told me gate is closed boarding is over as soon as I said I would pay for my small purse she opened it back up, while half of my family was already on the plane. Worst airline in the world, will never fly them again.

### "Frontier airlines is a joke"
I was supposed to fly home for Christmas on Christmas eve. They boarded the plane and we sat there for over 2 hours. They then made everyone get back off the plane and canceled the flight due to not having a "full" tank of potable water for the 2 hour flight. I had to buy a different flight and they refused to refund the ticket but instead said go to dinner and use your credit card to pay for it and they'd reimburse that cost. Then as I'd already purchased a round trip flight I had to fly back to work with them on new year's day. Again they loaded the plan and made everyone sit there for over 2 hours because this time they had no crew for the flight that they charged everyone for. I ended up being late returning to work. Frontier airlines is a joke. They may start out being cheaper than other airlines but you'll end up paying for another airline anyway and at a much higher rate as they cannot manage to make one flight on time so you'll be forced to buy a last minute ticket elsewhere if you actually want to get where you plan/need to go.

### "disregard for flyers"
On Monday, January 2nd, I departed from Montego Bay Jamaica and had a connecting Frontier flight from Orlando, FL (MCO) to Providence, RI (PVD). My flight (Flight 1182) began boarding at 2:23 PM and I arrived at the appropriate “bag drop” area for Frontier domestic flights with more than adequate time to drop my checked bags and head to security. However, the line for bag drop was longer than the intended space to hold waiting flyers and moreover, there was only one frontier agent working to check bags in when the area had five working stations. I was still waiting in line when my flight began boarding and finally made it to the front of the line at 2:37 PM. When I got to the front, the agent told me it was too late and that I had to rebook across the hall. I headed to the redirected area where there were already 3 families complaining to the supervisor due to their flights being cancelled by Frontier. When I was finally addressed, I was told that the next available flight to Providence was Wednesday, the next flight to Boston (closest city to Providence) was Thursday, and that I could not get a refund for the inconvenience. In the end, I had no choice but to rebook a flight to LaGuardia (Flight F9 1334) upon which I had to pay an additional $99. This inconvenience has cost me over $500 in unexpected expenses as I now have to arrange for transportation to get to Providence, RI from Queens, NY. The unprofessionalism and disregard for flyers by the Frontier employees at MCO is unacceptable and I will not be flying with this airline in the future.

### "pay $100 because it didn’t fit"
Not Verified |  From Miami to Atlanta I traveled with a duffle bag which fitted perfectly in the airplane compartment. I didn’t pay a dime. On my way back from Atlanta to Miami I traveled with the same bag they asked not only me a bunch of us to pay $100 because it didn’t fit according to their measurements devices. I will advise you not to travel with Frontier.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Departure flight I got an email saying it was delayed an hour. It was not delayed and no message to clarify. My husband had to pay 100 dollars to bring his small backpack that fits under the seat. We both had to do this on our return flight. 300 extra dollars for baggage that fit!!! Both our backpacks fit under our seats. Return flight the gate was changed and we got no notification. Rude airport staff, especially in Vegas. Have to buy drinks on board. Will never fly Frontier again. It's not a discount flight company when you charge extra for everything. Also the worst up and down seats I've ever ridden on.

### "overall trip was pretty good"
Not Verified |  The overall trip was pretty good and the workers were very nice and respectful. While we were boarding the flight crew member helped my family all sit together when our seats were not next to each other. There is not a lot of food choices and I think that was the only thing I did not like.

### "literally a hour to deboard a plane"
Not Verified | This airline needs some work: - terrible customer service at the counter - takes literally a hour to deboard a plane - will not announce delays/cancellations - employees look unprofessional and don’t know anything about their jobs - the $100 charge for a carry on that’s fits perfectly on the plane.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Do not fly this airline. Spend the money to use an airline that actually cares about you. From a half hour delay because no one was working the baggage check line, to a cabin that was 80°, then while sweating being told we have to wait for another in the hot plane because the taxi wasn't ready to bring us to the gate, to finally over an hour delay just to get our bags from baggage claim. Not to mention the seats in front of you being so close you can't take your knee out of back of the person in front of you or being told everything costs, even water. This 4 hour flight took over 6.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed 6.5 hours due to crew issues. Then we waited at the baggage claim for 3 hours. I never received my baggage. I entered a claim and didn’t hear back for 48 hours and then my bag was delivered to the wrong location twice. When I got my bag it was broken and the wheels had come off. I finally got my bag the day before I had to return. Customer service refused to reimburse me for clothes for the week and refused to credit the $64 baggage charge. Terrible experience.

### "received nothing but rude treatment"
Not Verified | I paid for my child backpack $200 both ways and received nothing but rude treatment. I will never use them again. They have lots of unscrupulous practices.

### "entire system could not possibly be worse"
There are literally no words to adequately describe how incredibly terrible every aspect of dealing with Frontier Airlines is. From the horrible online booking experience to the extreme customer dis-service to the level of incompetence and malevolence of the personnel when you arrive at the airport, the entire system could not possibly be worse. Stay far away from this incredibly lousy airline. I rate it a 1 because there is no negative 10.

### "Not worth the cheap fare"
Not Verified |  They lost my luggage. I filed a report within the same day - a Friday. They said they would get back to me within 4-6 hours. They did not. They have no one to call only a chat feature. When I did chat with them, they put me through three people to finally be told their central baggage department is closed on weekends. They now no longer respond to my chat. Not worth the cheap fare.

### "they hit you with lots of fees"
Frontier was the worst airline I have ever flown on. Good luck getting anyone on the phone, they make you do a chat but no one answers. Their check-in counter opens only two hours before a flight so you and the entire plane of people are all waiting in line to get checked in and delayed in getting through security. Delays to and from on our trip, they couldn't find the pilots, literally that's what they said over the intercom. Then when we landed another plane was in our spot so we had to wait again! They do not run efficiently, not worth saving the money plus they hit you with lots of fees, for bags to check in at the counter its ridiculous!

### "I felt disrespected and cheated"
I spent a lot of time and care and thought and money to ensure that my personal item fit within the Frontier guidelines. However, the man by the gate Yanked my bag out of the measuring device and tried to stuff it in sideways. Since it didn't go in smoothly the way he was putting it in he charged me $99. I asked him his name and he began to yell at me. In order to prevent this humiliation and exorbitant cost from occurring again, I prepaid $64 for my personal item for the return trip. I felt disrespected and cheated by these matters. This same man was also yelling at all the other passengers who were trying to board and were trying to act respectfully.

### "be ready for delays and cancelations"
1 hour delay, 2 hours delay, now a 3 hour delay. They don’t pay even money back they just giving credits. Poor service, so if youre ready to fly with Frontier you have to be ready for delays and cancelations. Cheap company. cheap service.

### "Thank you to the flight attendants once again"
Not Verified | The staff are doing their best to cover up for a top flight executives mistake. This airline is clearly trying to compete and can’t do it earnestly. Many thanks to the airline staff doing their best to help when they can only do so much. Especially the flight attendants. My little 18 month wasn’t so happy and she was made priority. So thankful for that. I’m talking to the higher ups. Clearly you haven’t worked from the bottom up and think you can regulate this airline with no knowledge of how the skies work. Maybe you’re just starting and trying to work your way up as I am in my profession. Your business is people. How they make it to and from their home. The love and cosy feeling as if you haven’t left the comfort of home. Frontier Airlines is far from it. I guarantee they are on a fast track to recover from deficit taking advantage of the working class that provides many a tickets for these biscuits. Thank you to the flight attendants once again and flight staff for getting us home safely.

### "The worst customer service system"
Not Verified |  Dec 29th 2022 flight from Punta Cana to Cleveland was cancelled. We were told no pilot, we were then told mechanical issue and then weather issue by the frontier chat. No customer service to call and speak only chat. Offered a flight to Chicago with no guaranteed flight to Cleveland. Offered us a flight to Orlando at 930pm with a possible connecting flight at 530am from Orl to cle. Would not pay for hotels. Could not guarantee final destination up to 2 days out. Some people were told to drive to Cleveland from Chicago. Then told to call frontier for reimbursement. Knowing there is no one to call. Other airlines offered one way flights for $650. Flying with 7 this was not an option. No guarantee of frontier even reimbursing for those flights. Basically we can get you part way to your final destination. The worst customer service system I have ever felt with. I’ll pay double before I fly this low budget rip off airline

### "Never had a good experience with Frontier"
Not Verified |  Never have had a good experience with Frontier. They are so cheap with every charge. Next thing they will do is add a charge to fasten your seatbelt. When you call them they direct you to their instant message chat in which the responsiveness is less than desirable. Very frustrating you can't talk to an actual human over the phone. I think they intentionally do it to screw their customers. Originally was booked to fly out of Philadelphia then ended up having to drive all the way to Cleveland to get a flight.

### "how awful this Experience has been"
First - Expedia was unable to help - Frontier won't allow them system access. I can't express enough how awful this Experience has been. On the day of our flight we had to cancel one of our 3 round trip tickets from BUF to FLL and back. We called 800-616-9631 (Frontier CS #) because the website would not allow us to cancel one of the tickets. We spoke to the agent who understood the request and advised there would $150 fee for the cancelation but i would receive a voucher to use on a future flight. I wasn't expecting a voucher so this was good. We thought we were all set until my wife checked her and my sons tickets on the way to the airport 2 hours away from our house, the agent cancelled all three tickets! Let the nightmare begin. My wife called 800-616-9631 immediately and was on the phone for 50 minutes with someone who was telling her they were working on getting the flight reinstated. The person that answered asked her to pay for the flight and she told them she was not going to pay for anything additional since the two flights never should have been cancelled, that was an error on their end. My wife kept being told that she would get a call back and they were working on getting the two flights reinstated. Once she got to the airport she was told to go to the Frontier ticket counter, and they would be able to help. When she got to the counter she spoke to a wonderful manager with Frontier named Jill. Jill checked to see what happened and saw the entire reservation was cancelled and there was nothing she could do until they reinstated the flight reservations. My wife called #800-616-9631 again and the person that answered spoke to Jill and assured her they were working on reinstating the reservation and would call back in 30 minutes, at this time there was less than an hour left until the flight was taking off. They never called back so my wife had to make the decision to buy 2 new tickets (one way) from Frontier ( $370.96), If she had waited any longer and they didn't reinstate her flight, they would be stranded. They got through security and to the gate and never received a call from anyone about the flight reinstatement. my wife called back numerous times before they got on the plane and no one answered. Once they landed in Fort Lauderdale she called again, a person answered and told her that the flight on Monday would be reinstated and she would be reimbursed for the $370.96 she had to pay for the flight, but she had to call 801-401-9000. My wife asked if they would be able to help her right then as it was after 11PM and was told yes.. She called the number and it was for Frontier airlines and they only accept calls Monday-Friday. Such poor customer service! Once she got to the destination she called #800-616-9631 again numerous times and was hung up on twice and no answer the other times. For peace of mind she booked a new flight for her and my son because she had no confidence they would reinstate the original reservation. This flight cost her $443.96. This whole experience was horrible and what should have been a relaxing 3 vacation turned into an incredibly stressful situation. This was a simple request. Original flight - $ 527.88 One way to FLL from Buffalo for two - $370.96 One way to Buffalo from FLL for two - $ 443.96 One flight cancelation fee $150 - I was told i'd be credited within 10 days, but it's been over a month and I'm still waiting.

### "never again for the extreme discomfort"
I have travelled all over the world for decades and December 2022 with Frontier Airlines aboard an A320 was the most uncomfortable and painful seating I have ever tried. I understand ultralight chairs for fuel efficiency but that was hellishly uncomfortable. Not reclinable, virtually no padding on the seat, and no padding on the back rest at all. No room to the sides. No room in front. After a 4h 30min flight I was sore for a whole day. All the rest is what you can expect from a cheap company. You pay less, you get less, sure. The crew was even nice, maybe even sympathetic. However, never again for the extreme discomfort.

### "refusing to refund the full amount"
My husband and I traveled on frontier to see my parents out of necessity. My dad is sick so the travel was last minute and because of the holidays the flights on my preferred airlines (Delta and Southwest) were booked. We paid $500 for the tickets on frontier. Unfortunately, the return trip our flight was canceled 20 minutes prior to departure (after they had delayed it several times) because of weather. I completely understand that this happens and is just a function of flying to a state that gets a lot of snow. However, when we asked the gate agent about our options, we were told we could not rebook a flight for 2 weeks because all of their flights had been oversold because of the cancellations. I asked if the agent could look at other airports nearby and I even showed him an open flight I had found and he said that even though it looked like I could book it online, it wasn’t eligible to o be booked because of the cancellation. When I very kindly explained that 2 weeks was really too long to wait, he said he would recommend a refund. When I explained that I really didn’t want that and asked again for him to check and see if there was anything in the next couple of days, another gate agent started openly mocking me. She pretended to cry and told me to get over it, weather happens and I shouldn’t travel if I’m not prepared to deal with the consequences. Neither my husband nor I was crying or being pushy in any way and the response was so heartless and cruel I told them to just refund us. We then went on to call Southwest who miraculously pulled some strings and got us on a next day flight. The one way tickets were $600 but so worth it. (I love Southwest always and forever.) After all of that, Frontier is now refusing to refund the full amount of our ticket because we “didn’t cancel within 24 hours”. I am baffled. They canceled the flight. We have a copy of the notification saying they cancelled the flight due to weather and they still are saying that they can only give us a partial credit. I looked into it and they don’t have to do anything if they don’t want to. So we are out over $1000 for the tickets back and the original flight that never left the airport. It does not matter how cheap the tickets seem, it is never ever worth it to fly this airline. Please believe me and avoid them at all costs.

### "my bag didn't fit their bag checker"
Frontier has just given me a terrible experience. As there are many instances that happened, i'll just say this one to keep this experience shorter and to keep your attention. I've been flying at least 4 times a year with the same personal items for over 4 years now, and I have never paid for a carry on bag, but because my bag didn't fit their bag checker they have at their gates, they made me pay $100 for it!

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
6am flight from Atlanta , GA to Chicago, IL. Frontier had a few flights this morning leaving at 6am. There was a Denver, CO, and a Baltimore MD. The only reason I know this is while I was waiting in line to check my bags ( here were a lot of people behind me in line) all of the sudden everyone going to Denver Co leaving at the same time as me got to skip the line. The whole line and check in. Ok no problem, I’ll still make my flight I got here on time like a responsible adult. 25 mins go by and now hey everyone on the Baltimore MD flight, yea you guys go ahead and skip the whole line and check in. Keep in mind they have the same exact boarding time as me. So then now I have to wait behind literally everyone for no reason other than they should make their flight and I shouldn’t. So I go through the entire line. I get to the front desk, 30 mins left before they stop boarding my flight. Give them my military ID to check my bags, they then look at me and saw we are no longer accepting Chicago. You are going to have to re book your flight. 30 mins still left to board keep in mind. I have to get to Chicago today. Currently trying to get a least a refund for my flight and messaging an agent for frontier but they no longer have a phone number that you can call. Was told I was transferred to another rep. Been waiting to be transferred for 20 mins now. I had to book a flight for 700 plus dollars and as I type this the frontier rep disconnected and did not transfer me. I will never fly Frontier again. You cannot ask for worse service.

### "Fully incompetent chat service"
Not Verified | Fully incompetent chat service, trying to accomplish the simplest task of resetting my password getting this error after following all directions completely, "ERROR We are unable to change the password. Please contact the airing anline. customer service rep tried to help but when the error was still appearing she asked me for my ideal password I said No, because I'm not giving some stranger my password, and asked for a secure password reset link, after that didn't work again she reset my password for me to Frontier2023! (wonder how many people have that password) and when it let me log in I tried to change my password for security and got the same error as above. Asked to speak to a supervisor and she just refused to reply to my chat forcing me to open another so someone else would have to speak with me. So disrespectful. Do not use Frontier since it's obvious they can't even communicate over the phone so they force you to use their "Chat' which they ignore so how can we trust them to operate or review plans properly for flight without ignoring issues that may arise?

### "what a horrible airline company"
Not Verified |  Worst Airline ever. I had heard bad things about them but I guess needed to learn on my own experience what a horrible airline company Frontier is! They cancel our flight on a Christmas Day without any support or help. Pretty much washed their hands off by making an announcement of cancellation, without any support at the airport or even trying to give any option to travel. I have never experienced anything like this.

### "We had to cancel our flights without refund"
Absolutely terrible. We were supposed to spend Christmas with family. Our flight was so delayed that we would have missed our connection (a different airline). We had to cancel our flights without refund and plan for another time. They didn’t bother to tell us it was so delayed until the time we were supposed to fly out.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight for April 2023 in December 2022. 6 days after I booked the flight notified the flight out was cancelled and there are no other flights on that date. Requested a refund. Was given refund for everything except the "discount den" which is a membership to get cheaper flights. Seeing as we don't even fly once per years this was only purchased to allow for cheaper air fare. The discount den purchase was not refunded and am now out $99 because the airline canceled our flight and had no other options for us. Highly recommend against. Morally bankrupt company just looking to make a buck off of the average person. Customer service all online no person to call. Very disappointed.

### "online chat is awful"
Not Verified |  You’ll pay extra fees for bags and seats that are outrageous compared to other airlines. 2. You can’t get ahold of anyone on the phone. The online chat is awful don’t use it. 3. When a flight is canceled - good luck! We had to rebook multiple times and just ended up with a different airline to get home. Stay away from Frontier!

### "worst experience I've ever had with an airline"
The worst experience I've ever had with an airline. We had a return flight from Nashville to Denver. First of all, we had a delay at the booking counter (there was no structure, whatsoever, all passengers were bundled up, no lines for boarding, even though we paid the extra few $’s for priority boarding, seeing that we have a baby and to not have to stand in lines for ages - this wasn’t the case!) The staff - from beginning to end were unfriendly, miserable, unhappy people. There was little to no communication on why we were so delayed - starting with boarding then we had to wait another 1,5 hours onboard - before take off. Cabin crew were a nightmare in my opinion. Unfriendly, biggest attitudes, one specific lady was on her cellphone the whole time. The pilots were out of the cockpit and into the lavatory more than I have ever seen. When announcements were made the speakers were so loud, you almost jumped out from the plane as a fright. We also attempted to order a few snacks on the plane, they should just scrap this option from the list. Most of the items we asked for was not on the plane, also some of the items were paid for then the crew member came back and said “sorry we are out of stock”. We just paid for that, now you are telling me there is no stock, we were sitting in the 3rd row. Upon arrival, having checked in our baby stroller, my husband had to wait a mere 20mins for the stroller at the door also being asked to move. To say the least we were very dissatisfied with the service (if that is even called service). Needless to say if we hadn’t booked our return flights already, we SURE as HELL wouldn’t have used FRONTIER AIRLINES to get back home. After a visit to family, we put the first flight behind us and said the return flight will go well. Biggest mistake ever. At check in of luggage it all started. Firstly if your bag tag machine doesn’t have enough paper to print the tags, do not fight with your passengers and give them attitude when they ask for assistance. Secondly, now we have to stand in a line for (not kidding 40minutes) to get one bag tag printed because we cannot use the self help desk as it doesn’t allow (because apparently it was printed already - WITH NO PAPER). Time for boarding, you guessed it - another delay - 50 minutes at the gate, with again little to no communication as to what is happening. Oh and yes, the staff - lets not go there. This plane also took off a full 55 minutes after scheduled time. Again the announcements over the intercom was pathetic, it was like we were being yelled on from pilot to cabin crew. Like seriously, we all have speakers right above our heads, stop yelling. We finally made it to Nashville. Here we were greeted with another welcomed delay - at the baggage collection. By this time it wasn’t even a surprise anymore. This airline will never see me, nor my family ever again. Worst experience ever. Worst time management. Worst communication.

### "Please do not fly this airline"
My first and last trip with the worst airline company. They made us come to the airport at 6am saying the flight was on time during the snow storm, checked out bags in for $80 bucks and then sent us our way to the gate. We waited an hour to find out that the flight was cancelled with no rebooking. Now almost 5 hours later we our still waiting to get the bag that we checked in the morning back. There is absolutely zero staff here let alone any help from the check out counter. I wish I could rate this airline with negative stars. We are traveling with a 1 year old and had planned this trip for a while. Please do not fly this airline

### "I will not consider Frontier"
Not Verified |  I have been using Frontier almost every other week before COVID. I planned to spend the holiday (Christmas & New Year) with family members in Virginia, and we had the cheapest possible flight Denver to Baltimore, car rental booked without cancellation option. The day before our flight day the weather was bad, but the next day was no reason to cancel flights, but Frontier did. My compliant is not the cancellation, but there is no option to arrange to fly on the next flight. The flight next to us to the same destination on the same day which is just in about 4 hours difference was not cancelled. The only option we had was to have refund. As you all know the time is a holiday season, it is not easy to find flight with a reasonable price. The funny part is Frontier also have flights when you search to purchase. The plan we had for more than two months, the vacation time planned, the craving the kids had to see New York at the new year eve was taken away (stolen) by Frontier. If the flight price is in cents, I will not consider Frontier. The service they provided was not acceptable, and the pain they caused on my kids is unforgivable.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified | The worst day ever. First, the line was wrapped around the corner to check in. I didn’t need to check in because I had all personal items. In my email it was said to go to kiosk because they didn’t have my boarding passes available online. As I walk to the line to speak to a representative I’m told that I have to pay $25 just got them to print out a ticket that was never sent to me. Luckily, the same employee recommended I download the app to get my ticket off of there so that’s what I did to avoid the cost. Going through TSA was a breeze compared to what we had to endure while walking up to that gate. Next, there are already announcements from other airlines that all flights to Chicago were canceled. Frontier gave us the run around, changing our gates multiple times, to delaying our flight, having us board then deplaned not mentioning to us that we are actually cancelled. If I didn’t speak to other members on the plane I would’ve been lost on where to go with my 2 small children. We met the agent with the nastiest attitude not being apologetic not considerate of what we all had to put up with. They denied us any vouchers for food and hotel because they had a later flight coming out which eventually got canceled at 5:30 being it was suppose to take off at 11:30pm. Worst experience ever I would never fly with them again under no circumstances! The absolute worst.

### "pay $100 because it won’t fit"
Not Verified |  Do not be lured in by their seemingly cheap prices. They now force every single guest to check their personal item in the sizer and then will force you to pay $100 because it won’t fit. I’ve used the same small duffle bag for years in every airline as a personal item because it fits perfectly under the seat and meets the size requirements mentioned online. Frontier will charge you unless your personal item is a tiny purse. My flight was also extremely delayed with no updates because of a maintenance issue after the pilot claimed maintenance cleared us to go then we all had to get off the plane. Please stop flying with them so they get the message. The staff are extremely rude, and honestly I can’t blame them because they have to enforce extremely strict and awful policies all day that upset paying customers.

### "had to stand in line for over an hour"
Not Verified | This is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. First the pre-flight check in was horrible, second the flight was moved twice to different terminals after being delayed, then it cancelled and we had to stand in line for over an hour just for them to tell me that they did not have anymore flights to the destination. The person behind the counter was completely rude, the company would not compensate us for any inconvenience. The lady was actually upset that my daughter was crying about not being able to go

### "losing a cherished holiday"
Not Verified | Cancelled flight with NO warning 10 minutes before on CHRISTMAS WEEKEND. Thanks to Frontier Airlines I will not be seeing my family and loved ones for Christmas this year. I will never in my life be flying Frontier again. I submitted for re-imbursement but honestly deserve much more after losing a cherished holiday with my family and friends I haven't seen in months/years. I work in healthcare, my time off is valuable to me.

### "not worth the headache"
Worst airline ever. I paid for insanely overpriced tickets. They had a Black Friday sale the following week. They wouldn’t give me the $250 difference. There’s a now seven-hour delay. They just let you sit in the airport all day. I’ve lost a day of my vacation and I can’t adjust it on the back end because I have to be back at work. Frontier is not worth the headache.

### "carry-onfee is $99.00"
I got to the airport 3 hours early just in case. I paid for my bag in advance to save time, but when I got to the frontier window, the line was so long that I couldn’t see where it ended. The line just to hand over your bags was 45 minutes. It’s finally my turn and my bag is 49 lbs. I was then notified that while the industry standard is 50 lbs, Frontier has recently changed it to 40 lbs. I was given 2 options, to pay $50 for the 9 lbs, after already having paid almost $70 just t I check a bag in the first place, or I can take items out and hold them in my hands for the duration of the trip. I ended up taking 1/4 of my clothes out and draping them over my arm. The line for security I can’t blame on frontier as it was a mix of all airlines, but that took an hour and a half. But with all of that extra weight in my arms, my body was in severe physical pain. At this point I have 15 minutes to get to my gate, so I’m running like a bat out of hell. I have really bad asthma but I ran anyway. I get to my gate and someone tells me that they switched to a completely different terminal and didn’t update the app or my eticket. I now had 7 minutes to take the concourse to a different terminal and then run 16 gates to get to mine. I get there right when the door was supposed to close, but they were held up harassing people about their carry on bags so it wasn’t too late. I get to the counter clothes in hand and my jansport backpack as my personal item. I was told that frontier considers anything bigger than a purse is a carry-on and that the fee is $99.00. I finally get to my seat, trying to breath, dripping sweat, red like a tomato, sore and exhausted. The moment my butt hits the seat everyone’s phones go off “flight delayed 2 hours.” An announcement on the speaker “sorry everyone, we need to de-plane, we are not sure why.” It’s 6:00 am and we are unloaded. At 6:15 once everyone gets off they say never mind and have everyone get back on. Apparently the pilot did not have the appropriate paperwork he needed for flight which is why we needed to get off. This is the worst experience I have had traveling and with an airline. All the disgusting money grabs are horrendous, from dropping allowed bag weight, restricting the size of a personal item, and hiking up costs. A checked bag at any other airline is $30, frontier is about $70. A personal item is free with other airlines, frontier claims personal items are carry-on’s and charge $99.00. I’m in so much physical pain right now from having to carry so much, from sprinting repeatedly, and getting off and on. Once we finally took off the stewardess had the audacity to thank us for flying with the worlds greatest airline. The audacity.

### "Worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airline needs to stop giving me the run around and provide me with an update on my luggage. Frontier decided to leave my luggage in Miami on Monday due to plane weight issues and I have not received a call or update as to its status or whereabouts. Your associates are going above and beyond as to avoid doing their jobs to get me my belongings which includes my infant's item. Worst airline experience and very unprofessional.

### "never fly with Frontier ever again"
They messaged twice that there was going to be a delay on 21st of dec 2022 for flight evening of 21st. Initially one hour then 2nd message was 2hrs so decided to get another flight since thought this one was going to be cancelled. Well right after I purchased another flight they sent a third message that the flight was going to be on time. I tried to call customer service and figure out what to do with this situation and if I could get refunded since they messaged delay which urged me to get new ticket. They said no that they would not refund since now back to on time! I can’t believe them. Will never fly with Frontier ever again.

### "takes the cake for the worst airline"
I've flown several budget airlines - Spirit, EasyJet, RyanAir, Norwegian and normal airlines Delta, Wingo, Avianca, China Air, Alaska, Southwest, etc - and without a doubt Frontier takes the cake for the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of flying on. It isn't just a flight being delayed (that happens to all airlines, often for reasons beyond their control) or the insistent and unapologetic effort to milk you for every penny, but the complete lack of communication, unprofessional staff, and the general chaos associated with all aspects of Frontiers operation. No one seems to know what's going on or what should be going on.

### "I will never take this airline again"
This was the worst flight I have ever been on. I had to repay for a checked bag I paid for in Seattle due to a booking era but that bag weighed 34.4 in Seattle cost me 79.00 in Denver for the same bag same weight when I asked about this because the website said bags under50 lb was 30.0. I was the told by a very rude customer service women that was that was what Frontier charged. No other explanation. Every person I can in contact with was rude or dismissive. Then I had my luggage and everyone had luggage lost I had to wait for half an hour hope I did not miss my connection flight half hour later I got. At that time my lock tsa approved lock was still on my bag which contained all my grandkids Christmas gifts in it. But by the time my family picked me up in Dallas my lock was gone and the bag had clearly been gone through. Frontier do better with hiring customer service people that actually want to help people. I will never take this airline again.

### "worst experience I have ever had"
It was the worst experience I have ever had! The tickets are low but they will charge you for carry-ons bags so the flight would not be as cheap. If you want to print tickets, the company would charge you $25 for each. Horrible customer service, horrible pilots, just overall horrible experience. The flight took 6.5 hours instead of 4 hours as it was saying on the ticket.

### "Customer service was absolutely awful"
Not Verified |  Customer service was absolutely awful. Each interaction I had with Frontier Airline I wasn't impressed. They were all so rude. First thing I needed was my boarding pass and the front desk lady was very rude, I was needing help because their APP wasn't allowing me to open my boarding pass. So as I'm explaining this to customer service, she proceeds to tell me we're not even checked in treating me badly when on my phone I have actual proof I checked in the previous night. She ripped the boarding passes out of the printer and told us to run because our flight was about to leave us. So we were in complete panic mode. Trying not to miss our flight when we get to our gate there's a line to our plane we had plenty of time. This was my three-year-old's first time flying so I asked the flight attendant if she could please sit with me because our seats were not together, and she rolled her eyes right in front of me, and walked away. She came back and rudely said Yeah it's fine I had to go let them know. Customer service is not that hard if you can't handle it then don't work it!

### "Horrible experience"
My first experience with Frontier airlines today, I had two flights both delayed two hours each! Horrible experience. I will never book with this unprofessional airline ever again. Frontier is more like Low Tier at this point. It’s a cheap option, but believe me you’d rather pay more to save yourself from unethical and unprofessional airlines.

### "horrible all around"
Cannot say enough bad things about my experience. Absolutely horrible all around. I will never fly this airline again after the way I was so disrespectfully talked to and the way that I was treated by their incompetent employees. I have never been talked down to or disrespected in such a horrible way. Ended up having to pay $600 on another airline to get home. Then they lost my luggage and would not even begin to help reimburse me for my travel cost when their delay of my flight for over hours made 20 passengers miss their connection. My luggage with original personal items is lost and one airline employee in Hartford said “I don’t know why you’re mad about your luggage being lost”.

### "simply not worth the discounted rate"
Not Verified | Yep, the worst possible airline. Customer service is guaranteed 24/7 on their website, yet non existent. I even tried to talk to two employees, both of whom told me that they could not provide customer service for at least another 2 hours. There is no telephone number that is answered, they communicate via chat only, but I've tried eight times to talk with a representative, only to have them disappear. I will never fly this airline again, It's simply not worth the discounted rate.

### "lost all customer service value"
Have been taking the same personal item for a year now and never had an issue getting on the plane and never had to pay for a carry on. Today I leave out of the San Diego International airport to Phoenix AZ, and they are having every single person size their bags while not even accepting bags that FIT IN THE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL SIZER!! There were at least 8 people (including me) that had to pay $100 for a CARRY ON. The people checking everyone in were extremely rude and did not take a second to listen to anyone regardless of the fact that many people were on their returning flights and did not plan to get charged $100 for a bag as they did not get charged on the first flight. My card dropped when I was handing it to one of the ladies because I was shaking so much and she threatened to add a note to my account to make sure I would never fly with frontier again. This all happened right before Christmas too. They are extremely money hungry because no one wants to fly with the, and they have lost all customer service value. Even sitting on the flight after getting charged, there is no AC and they proceed to say “we are aware that it is hot in the aircraft but touching the AC dials will not help…” DO NOT FLY FRONTIER

### "stuck in Atlanta for 2 more nights"
Get to airport at the gate that my plane was supposed to be at but they tell us the plane had no gate # yet then as I was going to the restroom I see on the board gate had been changed plus the concourse too. Get there no one is there but someone in line said he just a email that gate and concourse had been changed again. So we looked at the board and it had so we went back only to get there and they said it was delayed 30 minutes. Needless to say we were supposed to start boarding at 8:15 and boarding stop at 8:44 but at 12:15 we get told our plane was cancelled. No communication in between except between all the people waiting. Very few people was getting emails . Then we was told we could either get a refund or rebook. So I wanted to rebook and I was one of the first ones in line. All of us was asking for hotel vouchers and food vouchers and staff was very rude and said that they were told not to do anything but refund or rebook. Then I heard some people after I left was told they were getting hotel vouchers on their emails. My rebooking has me stuck in Atlanta for 2 more nights at a hotel then I fly to Las Vegas only to have an 18 hour layover there. I’ve tried serval ways to get in touch with someone but they have cut all ties with the public except for Facebook or Twitter but they still don’t talk to you.

### "Worst customer service"
Do not waste your $$$$. Frontier chat agent canceled my reservation for the departing flight in error forcing me to repurchase a new departing ticket for twice the cost and offered no remedy for the original flight cost. Looks inexpensive when you book but they charge for anything and everything. The seats are tiny and uncomfortable and if you don’t pay a big fee to pick your flight they cram you in like a sardine to the least desirable seat on the plane I was in the last row in front of the bathroom, in a “window” seat that had no window and no overhead bin space. Details I was interested in leaving a day early for my trip so I reached out to Frontier via chat (only option for customer service) and learned I couldn’t change the departing flight without incurring $99 fee plus the flight cost difference of $9. Since the new departing flight was only $47 I asked if it was possible to cancel the departing flight without impacting the return flight, the chat agent confirmed it was possible and asked if I would like to cancel it. I asked if I could do that myself on the website once I decided whether to rebook the departing flight, which had gone up to $78 while i was waiting over an hour for customer service. The chat agent confirmed I could do it myself and said she’d send a link. Instead I got an email that appeared to shown my departing flight was no longer part of the reservation. I chatted again and was told the departing flight was cancelled. I explained what happened and they said there was nothing they could do and refused to help me or connect me with a manager then just stopped answering my chats. So I ended up having to pay twice as much to get a departing flight and lost the $ from my original booking. Worst customer service I’ve ever received from an airlines.

### "Customer service was non existent"
Absolutely awful. Customer service was non existent to the point of being rude. They simply did not care. When on the way home, our flight was delayed, delayed and then cancelled. That was bad but things happen. When they basically refused to tell me how I was supposed to get home, offered zero empathy and said not their problem. When I asked about an email that I had received telling me the flight was not cancelled just further delayed, they were rude and said, I don’t know what to tell you. The flight is cancelled. I don’t get an email. I am not a screamer, it is not their fault, but sine human decency goes a long way. We will never fly this airline again.

### "It's basically a scam and they don't care at all"
Don't fly Frontier. Our flight was originally supposed to be at 08.40pm. We drove 3.5 hours to Atlanta to get the flight cheaper due to local airlines coating 1K or more for regional. When arriving to the gate we were told the aircraft has no gate at that time and to stand around waiting for an announcement. Then the aircraft was delayed until 10.30 for maintenance issues. Our gate was then changed but still no plane was present and there was no staff at the gate. The flight was delayed again until 12.30 midnight. Once 1 am rolled around we the flight was cancelled. The staff informed us only 30 minutes after the site stated the cancellation and provided no follow up. Upon pressuring the staff we waited an hour to get re-booked a flight that is 3 days away. They stated they would provide hotel vouchers via email. Apparently they had already been aware that it was likely the aircraft would not show up and decided to delay the flight multiple times and change the gates instead. When arriving to the hotel no voucher was emailed. We attempted to call their customer service and was hung up on repeatedly. Their chat services decided to call us only to tell us the voucher would arrive for a 3 night stay within 30 minutes. No voucher was emailed. Calls continued to be made and contact with live representatives was made only for them to hang up after I kindly got one sentence out. Don't fly with this airline. It's basically a scam and they don't care at all. So we'll be in a hotel for 3 nights out of our own pocket.

### "Will never fly this airline ever again"
Not Verified |  My boyfriend and his brothers flight were delayed on Sunday coming back from Orlando from 2:30pm to 4:36pm and then found out from a passenger from the plane that it had been cancelled. No email or no change in the app. Then waited in 2 hours worth of a line to find out our flight back home was re-booked til 3:50pm the next day. I work at a hospital in Massachusetts so I had to take another day off of work. We were lucky enough to find a place to stay in Orlando (of course not offered by the airline) for that night our flight was cancelled. Then found out at 11am our flight was delayed to 6:45pm that day. We went to the airport, it surprisingly took off that same day however, they made us pay for a carry on that we did not have to pay for before. They charged us 99$ for this stupid thing when they literally cancelled our flight the day before and didn’t tell us. Will never fly this airline ever again. Worst experience.

### "been canceled since this morning"
Flight was supposed to depart on Sat Dec 17th at 12:01Am, at 9:00PM and after 1 hr in line to check baggage i noticed the self service kiosk wasn't finding my flight so i approached a representative and that when we learned our flight was canceled i explained that i checked in before heading out to the airport and ingot a confirmation, thats when the representative told me "well, its been canceled since this morning" the rest of the passengers were learning this at the same time with me. We were all directed to a new 2 hour line to re-book our flights. Thats when it went from bad to worse, we were told theres nothing until Dec 19th and our only options were to either get on that flight 2 days later or get a refund. Since no one was notified about the cancellation of this flight it was now too late to try and find a fligh, and the only options available bow had overlays and for my particular case had to pay an unexpected $1300 dollars with a different airline. To make things worse the refund wont be available on my card for up to 5 business days, making really hard for some ppl to afford this.

### "worst experience I have ever"
This is the worst experience I have ever had with customer service. First of all, the flight was delayed for more than three hours and no one even cared to apologize. Second, the assistant are plain rude and disrespectful. Many of us had to pay 90 dollars for a carry on just because we had a bag with an item we purchased at the airport. Just pay the extra dime and avoid this airline. I think they are trying to copy Southwest but without the politeness, the customer service quality, and with employees that do not respect customers. This airline is simply a disgrace. While I don't usually write reviews, I felt compelled to write this one to save someone else from going through what my wife and I went through.

### "Definitely do not recommend to anyone"
Not Verified |  Definitely do not recommend to anyone. Pay a bit more and get 10x better quality through other airlines. I will never fly Frontier again! I still don’t understand how 1 checked bag was $95.00. Ridiculous!

### "dont include Frontier in any of your holiday or any key travel plans"
Customer service non existent, in fact they had proudly announced it on all media, so its my fault that I ended up buying a ticket. Their chatting service is bogus, no use for any customer. Clearly no one in this company has brains, from CEO to the entry level employees. Only useful if you are travelling light and possible alone. Please dont consider this airline and especially dont include Frontier in any of your holiday or any key travel plans. If you do, do it at your own risk.

### "shocked at the customer service"
My girlfriend and I were boarding a flight from Orlando to Philadelphia. We were both told to check out backpacks for size restrictions. After dropping my bag into the size container the attendant cleared me to proceed to scan my ticket. My girlfriend was requested to pay for her bags. I went ahead and scanned my ticket and stood aside and told the ticket agent I would like to wait for my girlfriend to finish ticketing before stepping into the jet bridge. There was an argument at the ticket counter between the attendant and another customer. As my girlfriend was finishing paying for her baggage online the attendant (emotionally) told the ticket agent to close the door. Everything happened so fast that I was not able to remind the ticket agent, that I was still waiting for my girlfriend. We both were denied from getting on the flight along with 8 other people who were waiting in line to get on the plane. I was shocked at the customer service and rudeness of the agent to me (after the incident) and others was unreal. I have never witnessed such poor management and communication between Frontier Attendants. After the incident the attendant continued to argue with the majority of the folks who missed the flight because they were still standing in line. During one of the arguments the attendant explained how the PA system overrides any type of Frontier notifications received via text. At one point arguing and demonstrating how the PA system works. With the P/A system activated for the entire airport to hear the discussion.

### "most greedy, most non-helpful airline"
They are the rudest, most greedy, most non-helpful airline I have ever flown in my entire life. In spite of the fact that our party of 10 people all missed the flight because they told us to go to a different gate, and we walked up and said we are here for the Cedar Rapids flight and they said oh they haven’t boarded. Only to find out the plane took off. We were told by multiple frontier employees that the flight had not left, and it was the app where we realize that we had already missed the flight. We were also told that it would be next,. We could not get a straight answer from anyone.

### "will never fly with them again"
We will never fly Frontier again. We carried on one bag each (there were two of us) and bags were the size specified on Frontiers web site. When we checked in they made us place our 2 bags in a smaller than specified on the web space and charged us an extra 99 dollars per bag to board. This is false advertising. We could have flown American or United for what we ended up paying and would have had we known Frontier had a screw the customer policy. There were many others having the same problem. Our bags fit under the seats just fine but we got the Frontier bait and switch screwing and as said previously will never fly with them again.

### "last time I'll ever fly Frontier"
This was the last time I'll ever fly Frontier. The gate attendant was shaking passengers down for 100 dollar penalties if she felt that you're personal item required being pushed on to fit in their sizing box. She was antagonistic, rude and hostile about the whole thing, stating she wouldn't argue with "nobody" and she would kick you off the flight if she seemed that you were arguing.

### "Don’t ever fly with Frontier"
Ridiculous staff at the gate charged me $100 for a handbag. I then watched them torture a woman who’s bag fit perfectly into the carry on sizing contraption. When they said she had to pay, she took out a few items and they still made her pay. Her bag fit WELL within the guidelines and she was on the verge of tears. I wish I had the names of the ridiculous workers there. Don’t ever fly with Frontier.

### "you can NEVER find a real person to speak to"
Not Verified | I was flying from HOU to MCO during the hurricane in September. I paid for my ticket in full from MCO to HOU and my flight was canceled the way back. At the airport I was boarded with out issue. When I went home I saw that they charged me $92 for my bag. When I wrote multiple emails to Frontier they made excuses about charging due to the size of the bag. I was NEVER asked to size my bag. They charges my card without my knowledge. When I explained this through an email (because you can NEVER find a real person to speak to on the phone), they continued to make excuses and denied a refund. This airline is the worst airline out there. DO NOT ever give them your money. If I could give this airlines a 0/10 I would

### "I am very disappointed in this airline"
Not Verified |  I am very disappointed in this airline. I couldn't check in from my phone. They were trying to get me to buy another seat and flight. Went to the counter to check in all the staff were rude. I flew from Minneapolis to Denver and never had to pay for my personal bag and they watched me put it in the size container and made me pay $100 on the flight from Denver to PDX. I had to deal with the expense of my father's funeral and then this. The whole last flight, the flight attended was yelling, she was very unprofessional. My family and I are very unhappy and will never use Frontier again.

### "No help was offered to us"
Not Verified |  We had a flight leaving from FLL at 11.23am on Dec 10th. The airline kept delaying the flight every single hour, until they finally told us the flight will be leaving at 2.23pm. We are finally ready to take off, the pilot announced that there's something wrong with some circuit. Therefore, we had to wait until the circuit is fixed. It was 4pm in the afternoon inside the aircraft without AC or water. Everyone was dying of heat and frustration. It was 4pm when we took off to our destination Atlanta, which was too late to connect with our flight to MSP Minnesota. No one was there to help us with our connecting flight. And you can only communicate with Frontier Customer Service using the APP CHAT. No help was offered to us and had to purchase three tickets from our pockets to get back home that same evening to Fort Lauderdale. Please make sure to read my review before you book or use Frontier Airlines. Not worth it using these cheap flights. Pay a little extra and fly in peace. Hopefully everyone can read my comment before making that purchase/mistake. Thank you for reading!

### "Just don't fly Frontier"
Just don't fly Frontier! Pay the little bit extra, because you will anyway, to fly a decent airline. The hidden fees eventually add up to sometimes more than a flight on an all around better airline. If they delay, or altogether strand, you on your trip they will lure you onto another one of their flights with a minimal credit only to repeat their atrocities.

### "seat felt like sitting on a ironing board"
Not Verified | I booked a flight for me and my boyfriend first of all the made him pay a hundred dollars for a book bag that fit under the seat. Secondly, the seat felt like you were sitting on a ironing board. Third they had 3 delays and keep sending wrong gate information just a total waste. The flight was really reasonable but now I see why will never fly them again there worst than Spirit.

### "charged 100 bucks for it to be a carry on"
This has been my worst flight experience both ways! On the way to Phoenix the lady next to me threw up all over me. Thank God I had additional clothes to change, no accommodations were made because it was a full flight. On the return flight, flight was over 1 hour late. After attempting to board they stopped me because they said my backpack was too big to be a personal item. Same backpack I had no issues with arriving and same backpack I use every time through other airlines as a ‘personal item’ I was charged an extra 100 bucks for it to be a carry on. I’ll never use your flights again, and I really hope others aren’t deceived by your prices either because when all is said and done I could have spent exactly the same amount on a delta flight!

### "worst airline we’ve ever taken"
Do yourself a favor and never book Frontier. Frontier changed the gate at the airport with an hour to spare, we had to get out of the D terminal to the E terminal and they forced us to go through security again. This caused us to be late to the flight and they shut the door in our faces then the attendant laughed at us for being late. After talking to gate agents, the “help” desk at the airport, and the chat bot online they said there is no way we can possibly get a reimbursement and they cannot get us out on another flight today. There were several other people that went through the same thing we did. We have kids at home and are having to rebook with another airline just to make it home today. By far the worst airline we’ve ever taken and will never again book on Frontier. Our fault for trying to save money and get home early.

### "Frontier is always late and slow"
This airline is a joke. I wouldn't wish flying with them on my worst enemy. First we took off late from Grand Rapids which put us into Orlando at a later time. Causing all the restaurants in the food court to be closed. I have an 8 hour layover here in Orlando and now I can't even eat. All because Frontier is always late and slow.

### "absolute worst customer service"
Frontier Airlines has the absolute worst customer service ever. They changed their baggage policy recently and I’ve experienced and witnessed this causing issues with customers. The people ate the gate seem to be annoyed at how many times this causes issues and refuse to offer any help at all. I recently had a staff member be incredibly rude to me and when I contacted customer support they didn’t apologize or offer to help. I was told I would need to personally “find the CEO” myself if I wanted any direct help. I am completely over this airline and will not be flying with them anymore. Absolute garbage company. I had to fly home for a funeral this week and still need to fly back on Frontier this week. I am thinking of just paying for a new flight to avoid having to fly with Frontier again.

### "zero regard for their passengers"
Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown on. The service I received was horrible and both my flights were delayed, causing me to miss my connection. There is zero regard for their passengers, and it shows. Extremely disappointed in this experience and I will make sure to tell everyone I know to stay away from this airline!

### "would have cost me $400 to cancel a flight"
Extremely frustrating to have a flight changed to an inconvenient schedule by this company and not be able to modify or cancel your flights! Low costs should still maintain a minimum standard of inconvenience mitigation - it would have cost me $400 to cancel a flight - more than the ticket! And of course, you can't modify your itinerary and are told to "call reservations" where you are then told you can't speak to anyone but have to chat instead. So angry about this whole situation  I let them know I will fly with any other airline at all costs in the future. Their decision made my low-cost flight more expensive than with a regular airline seeing as it is cheaper to rebook than pay them to cancel and then book a new flight. Unreal.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. How are we the first flight leaving out and still got delayed. Talking about maintenance. All that should have been done this morning. I will never fly with this airline again and y’all make us pay for a damn book bag.

### "It is always their incompetence"
Every flight I have taken in the last year has been delayed or major problems. I reached out to the airline that promised me a voucher but never received anything worthwhile to compensate me for my time. One flight was delayed four hours because of their incompetence. It is always their incompetence. Never any other reason. They can't even make things right by compensation. They have just repeatedly blown me off. This is the last flight I have booked with them and once again we are waiting around past the delay time and with no answers as to when we will even take off.

### "Terrible seats, and terrible service"
They removed all customer service access and only allowed you to use an app and continually times out, giving you no actual time and when someone can talk to you, or they want you to use Twitter. So use a free platform because they can’t be bothered enough to provide you with. Even with flight insurance, I could not circumvent the fees to change my flight. It would be cheaper for me to get a new flight than it would for me to change the flight that I purchased. When I was flying to New York on Delta, I missed the flight. Delta told me it’s OK, you can hit the next one, which was in an hour with no hassle. I am trying to do this appropriately actively, and Frontier is giving me a fight. Through the app, when I tried to change the flight, the fee was $10, and I thought great, that’s more than reasonable. As I continued through the app, the fee increased 13 times more. Why? Why would you do that? I went through Expedia initially, so I circled back to Expedia; they explained the fees, even though you have insurance, still apply to you. I spoke with the representative through the chat because, as of November 2022, Frontier removed all phone customer service. They state they have affordable flights, but after buying the carry-on, the flight price would be the same if I went through any other carrier, so what’s the point? Terrible seats, and terrible service, I was on a three-hour flight, and they didn’t even offer us a beverage. They didn’t even offer us water. I will never fly this again. Sadly, it’s pathetic, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

### "You will be charged for everything"
The employees has no manners, poor communication, with attitude that makes me feel I am a burden to them. There was a long line to enter to the plane to board and the lady who was in charge of checking us stopped us from letting us in at 0545 even if we were in line. She told us that plane will be close even if we were in lining up by the door to enter. She told us to rebook our flight for 14 hrs after which I end up purchasing from Alaska Airlines and fly an hour after. Generally the service was disgusting, I will not recommend frontier airlines for any body. On my flight from Chicago to las Vegas, I have to pay $215, no snack, not even a water. You will be charged for everything including for your carry on, and you will get the worst service in the earth.

### "Frontier will find a way to mess it up"
I’ve always said I’ll never fly Frontier again after every flight but this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. On December 6th, 2022 I was on a night flight from Houston Texas to Denver Colorado, departing 21:05pm CST, arriving 10:43pm MST. After paying extra for extra leg room at the front I was subjected to what seemed like the brightest light on the flight. After the first 30 minutes to 45 minutes it was clear that the light was needed for flight attendant purposes which is understandable, majority of the time the light was left on. As a result I ended up wearing my hoodie backwards to shade my eyes from the light. Obviously there was no way I could duck down behind the seat but as a paying customer I shouldn’t have to. The picture below clearly shows the reason the light was kept on majority of the time was because a flight attendant was reading a book. Also attached to this review is a picture of what it could have looked like if the light was not on. We all know Frontier Airlines is terrible but it seems that regardless of how much you can pay for comfort Frontier will find a way to mess it up.

### "I feel I am being robbed"
I had a flight that was heading into a hurricane, and after all my accomodations cancelled on me I was told by Frontier that I would get a flight credit issued to me, but I had to send an email for it, whatever. I submitted a form and got a response relatively quickly saying they would issue me a credit. Amazing! But then nothing. I got no follow up, no flight credit code, nothing on my account. I spoke to chat and they said they couldnt help me. I spoke to a manager on chat, she had me on the chat and was essentially telling me their systems were my problem, and then at some point just left the chat on me. No word or anything, just up and left. I waited for 30 minutes messaging every few minutes and got nothing. I have never had such a bad experience with any support team ever. period. At this point I feel I am being robbed, they promised a credit and now wont deliver on it. Stay away from this airline.

### "poor communication and horrible attitude"
I was leaving from Denver and they were fairly helpful. They felt the need to send my luggage in another plane which I don’t think should’ve been necessary because I had time to pay and make it through TSA. I landed in St. Louis and was told I need to ask the frontier airlines desk when to come in for my luggage and I was told, after the lady at the desk began ti act annoyed with me, “I don’t know. Probably around this time tomorrow,” even though she had a computer in front of her to tell me what time the next flight would be arriving at. I came back at the time she told me to and none of the frontier reps were there to help. I had to go tio the information desk to find out that they had another flight coming five hours after I had come in looking for my luggage and a flight left about an hour before I got there. There was poor communication and horrible attitude in the part of the frontier staff and I highly recommend you don’t fly with them.

### "audacity to cancel and change flights"
One of the worst airlines I've flown with. My flight was changed from 1 day to another, I had to stay in Seattle and pay for a hotel. The same day of my flight that flight was delayed by an hour then my connection flight was delayed for 7 hours. After I had to wait 9 hours so that was more than 12 hours in the airport with no explanation. There was no way to talk to someone over the phone, only by a chat room and they will not do anything to compensate us. They just have the audacity to cancel and change flights without giving any explanation.

### "Unable to reach out to human help"
Not Verified | We will never ever fly Frontier again. The worst experience in my life and I have flown 100s of times on all airlines. If you are not savvy on their app you will definitely pay more. Page after page to go through to confuse and manipulate the customer. Unable to reach out to human help without a cost attached. Don't walk, run from using this airline.

### "Terrible communication and inconvenient rebooking"
Had a flight scheduled for 12/4 early afternoon. It got delayed and I received an email/text update. I hung out at my terminal until about an hour before my flight then headed to my gate. Noticed gate said different flight info than was expected. Employee working the desk told me the flight had been cancelled! No reasoning given or email sent. I told her I hadn't received any notice. All she said was announcements had been made but I know I didn't hear any. She directed me to go back to the check in desk to get rebooked. No flights were available until a couple days later for same location so while waiting in line I had to purchase another flight with a different airline to a different arrival location. Wasted 350$ and had to inconvenience someone to come pick me up at the new arrival location. Will NOT be flying Frontier again. Terrible communication and inconvenient rebooking process.

### "waited over 3 hours for my delayed flight"
Not Verified | This is the absolute worst airline known to exist. I waited over 3 hours for my delayed flight, waited in the plane for 45 min and then was told that there was no pilot available to fly the plane. I spent well over $200 for my ticket and they said that they can't refund me because they have no history for my seats. Also all the employees were all disrespectful and did not help me throughout any of this process. Also about 7 months ago this company made me wait for over 10 hours and they just kept delaying the flight every couple hours, as well as lying to my saying they will offer me free tickets and they never did this company should disappear and no one should ever ride this airline.

### "Customer service doesn’t even exist for them"
Frontier is by far the WORST airline I have ever flown. When I say I will never ever, ever fly with them again I swear by it. My boyfriend and I had a connecting flight flight to Phoenix in which we had to make because of a tournament he was in. The flight was already delayed from the weather but by the fault of Frontier over booking multiple people in a few seats we were delayed further resulting in multiple people, including ourselves, miss that connecting flight to Phoenix. The flight attendants were rude and unprofessional and I heard her yell “I don’t get paid enough to do this” while trying to figure out the seating situation. The employee at their gate was also incredibly snarky. Like if you hate your life and job, just say so. Once we got off in Vegas, their so called “customer service” was unwilling to work with ANYONE to try and help their situation. Their next flight out wasn’t until Saturday NIGHT and we needed to be in Phoenix by Friday morning. They wouldn’t give any full refunds - only a measly partial refund of 80 dollars out of the 300 we spent, since we technically “already took the flight” to Vegas. So we said fine, book us back home to Denver on the next flight. AND THEY WOULDN’T EVEN DO THAT AT NO CHARGE. So I asked wait… I thought you guys said either partial refund or rebook and they said yes… ONLY a rebook to Phoenix because that’s your original destination. Oh my lord just a bunch of stupid people working for a stupid airline with zero empathy for customers. Do not ever take Frontier. You will never save that much anyway because they charge up the wall for luggage and they are all forcing people to pay $100 for even a personal item at the gate. Customer service doesn’t even exist for them, as you can see. A joke of an airline. Our only saving grace that trip was that we booked through Hopper and they were able to give us our refund.

### "online chat is a complete joke"
This airline is plain and simple a scam. I first booked round trip flights for my boyfriend and I departing on different days. I needed to change either one of our departing flights to leave on the same day. I called their customer service number nearly 15 times within 2 days. They sent me the link to contact their online chat every time because they have no customer service representatives answering phone calls. Said online chat is a complete joke as I waited hours every time I attempted to contact them without anyone ever responding. On the way back, they lined up people and made them fit their personal bag in the sizer. My boyfriend’s bag, which he brought without issue on the departing flight, did not fit in. The lady in the front was extremely rude to us. She told us to step aside and that we wouldn’t be able to fly if we didn’t pay. When we moved to the other line as we were paying for the carry-on online, she yelled to the other agent in the counter to not let us in because we didn’t have a paid carry-on. The seats are literally bricks and they don’t have ports to charge electronic devices. You have to pay for every beverage. Crew is disgruntled.

### "This is a terrible airline"
This is a terrible airline and always my last choice. They are draconian about carry-ons and personal items policies. Bag fees are very high Then, they make it a game by charging you more if they determine at the last minute, your bags don’t qualify as either personal items or carry-ons. On this flight, it wasn’t enough that my bag fit in the measuring bin, it had to fall end of its own weight. Seats are uncomfortable and small. No USB charging ports.

### "I couldn't get my boarding pass"
I booked a round way ticket and checked in early for both my flights. For the first flight I couldn't get my boarding pass and after speeding hours on two different devices, I was still the "next in line" for both and when I got a representative. I was told the reason I could check in was because I booked through expedia and their system was not updated. On the was back I experience the sma etching only when I received the booking I was unable to download and the rep kept telling me it's on the website however, I could not access it on the website because i was automatically sent to the check in page but it was also showing that I checked in. And at the airport I was to be charged an additional $25. When send did the self service to avoid this in the first place. And in order to get the pass sent to my email like they did on my way to Georgia I had also pay 25 dollars. If I do everything self service online, I should have access to my boarding pass online. Expedia is not an excuse and the website is not an excuse. Seat comfort is zero stars.

### "charged extra for every single detail of your travel"
Only fly Frontier if you want to get charged extra for every single detail of your travel. You even get charged $25 to speak to an agent at the ticket counter. My experience started there. This was very frustrating as I was trying to get my boarding pass on the piece of shit app they have. Didn’t work! Then you get charged for a seat assignment. Then you get charged for any carry one larger than a purse or small backpack.

### "luggage was $87 +$50 for 4lb extra"
It was my first time flying on Frontier Airlines and it is my last time. I have 2 luggage and a carry-on the first luggage was $75 +50 for 4lb and the second luggage was $87 +$50 for 4lb extra, on line it shows 50lb at the airport its 40lb I can't believe that they change me $50 each for 4lb in my 20 something years I have been Travel never have any experience like that. Attendant ask me what wrong and I told him he was so sorry for my bad experiences I told him that this is my first and last, I will continue fly on AA and I change my flight coming back and I came back on Delta .

### "Never Frontier again"
Plane was delayed and we would not make our connecting flight. There was another flight that had been delayed from the previous day and was mostly empty but they could not place us on that because it was not in the system since it was from the previous day. Postponed the flight for 13 hours. Customer service is horrible, basically it was "take it or find another airline. You betcha I will find another airline. Never Frontier again.

### "my worse experience"
This airline is a scam and will suck you dry. Don't fall for the cheap ticket prices because you will be overcharged for your bags. The person at the ticket counter in Atlanta had no customer service was rude and vindictive. Delays, cancellations, changing of gates, my worse experience, this is truly the flight from hell.

### "The customer service was terrible"
Frontier Airlines is terrible. The customer service was terrible. The woman at the desk in Orlando was not just bad but downright mean. I watched her tell an 80 year old woman to figure out how to check in online or get in the hour line and pay. And she rolled her eyes at her. Also she told me the same. People were missing their flights due to bad customer service and just plain rudeness and not giving a care. I will literally never fly Frontier again. It’s like shopping at Walmart on Christmas Eve. Actually Walmart has friendly employees. The flight took off 40 minutes late due to seating discrepancies which should have been handled by the staff. It was just the absolute worst experience from start to finish. I fly 4 times a year and I have never been so ready to never fly again. If I do I will be going to Southwest on their site. I’ve never had an issue with Travelocity. You should consider dropping Frontier if they don’t correct their issues. I mean do they actually hire just plain bad humans? I’ve never seen anything like it.

### "never experienced these kind of delays"
Last flight with frontier. What is a 4.5 hour drive on road took 4 hours on Frontier because the boarding, take off landing was delayed by 20 min. And even after landing we waited 25 min to get off the plane because some gate was not available. Even the baggage delivery takes a lot of time if you have checked-in the luggage. Have never experienced these kind of delays in flight ever except when weather was bad.

### "first and last trip with Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified | This is suppose to be economy, but it is far from it! I should have read reviews before I booked a flight with them! All negative reviews. The flight may be cheap, but when you add paying for a seat, one check in bag $49.00 a carry on $54.00 (which is way more than your regular airline and they only allow 40lbs not 50lbs) like regular airlines the flight winds up being much more! Don't take this airline, it is awful! My first and last time! I had to take my wife's beach bag cause I read a man took a small back pack, a personal idem and they charged him $100.00 at the gate! They are cons, my first and last trip with Frontier Airlines!

### "I wouldn't recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  This flight from Orlando to Seattle with a 2.5 hour layover in Las Vegas ended up costing me more than my one way flight from Seattle to Orlando on Alaska. The seats are ridiculously uncomfortable, no padding and no recline option. The leg room is claustrophobic, and I am only 5'2! I chose this flight only because it had the time I was looking for to arrive back in Seattle. I had never flown Frontier before and was surprised (to say the least) that my boyfriend and I had to pay an additional $280 to choose our seats on the two flights, and carry on our 2 small suitcases. We had no idea until we went to check in online the night prior. I wouldn't recommend this airline, ever. Spend the extra to fly on Alaska, Delta, heck any other airline! Shame on Frontier for all the upcharges. If you still chose to fly this airline, bring your own water and snacks. Don't say you weren't warned, just read all the reviews!

### "don’t bother with Frontier it’s absolutely awful"
Not Verified |  So my boyfriends family and I flew out of Tampa Florida into Grad Rapids Michigan November 19th, 2022 - everything went smoothly other than a slight 20 minute delay. Saturday November 26th was our flight back from Grand Rapids to Tampa and at the absolute last minute they completely canceled our flight and offered no hotel accommodations and said there wasn’t going to be another flight until Monday, the 28th. They didn’t refund us for the checked bag we paid for OR the seat selection they made us pay for as well (which is ridiculous we just wanted to sit next to each other). So not only did we get stranded across the country we were told basically nothing about why our flight was canceled and why we were in no way accommodated. In the end you spend just as much money that you would’ve flying with a bigger airline - don’t bother with Frontier it’s absolutely awful.

### "I felt this airline is a big scam"
I felt this airline is a big scam. Myself and my wife travelled by this airline, ticket price showed us $19 each and they made us to pay total $600 one way for both of us. It’s more expensive than any other airline with such low quality. Frontier staff were very rude and they don’t respect the customer. I met two people, one at bag drop counter and she was so rude and unresponsive, the same with the person at gate. They stopped us at gate for bag size. I travelled with same bag on many airlines but they said it was a little big and I needed to pay $99 for a small personal item. I would suggest anyone to not to choose this airline. If you choose you may suffer, mostly they will try to loot you in every possible way. We have many good airlines in the country and prices may show a little high but they are trustworthy and providing very good service to customers and respectful.

### "It felt like a scam"
Not Verified |  It felt like a scam, advertising for cheap flight and then charging for everything, including customer service, small hand item, cup of water, etc.. The service people at the gate are very unfriendly. It was my first and last time to fly with Frontier Airlines.

### "nickel and dime you for everything"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. You think you are getting a good deal on ticket prices, but they nickel and dime you for everything. You have to pay for any bag you bring, even a carry-on. If you want to be confirmed to sit next to who you are traveling with, you have to pay for a seat. If you want to speak with a representative you need to pay for that. If you need help with your baggage, you have to pay for that. The seats on all of my flights did not recline. I will never ever fly this airline again. It cost so much money when it was all said and done and it was not worth the money! !

### "don’t bother saving your money"
Not Verified |  It’s saddening to see an airline able to get away with so much. It starts before you even board: instead of the industry standard bag weight limit of 50 pounds, you can only bring 40. Anything over that is $100 out of your pocket. Same goes for your backpack if it doesn’t fit in their tiny bag sizer. The seats feel like cardboard, are too short to rest your head on, and are so cramped that anybody above six feet is not going to reasonably fit in one without perfect posture. They were also 30 minutes late to depart with absolutely no warning or explanation, and when we landed we inexplicably sat on the tarmac for another half hour. Absolutely awful, don’t bother saving your money. I don’t know how the FAA allows this. They cut corners at every turn and we’re expected to bear the brunt of it as the customers.

### "surprise you with ridiculous charges"
You think their tickets are cheap, but they will surprise you with ridiculous charges all the time and their customer service will never help you with anything, I have always bought tickets from them and every single time I ended up paying 2 times more than my ticket ... they always find ways to rip you off, and their employees are rude and disrespectful. I went to Atlanta, my backpack was a bit fat, I rearranged my stuff and it fitted in the box perfectly, but their employee refused to look and made me pay 99$ for it. He was super rude and when I asked his name, he refused to answer.

### "charge you for every single little thing"
Not Verified |  Flown all sorts of different airlines. Literally the worst experience possible, I would rather fly Spirit and that is saying something. The customer service will just piss you off and I have low standards. They lost my bags and was the only airline that didn’t not have agents available to ask where they lost it. Waited for hours and they were extremely rude. They will charge you for every single little thing. Forget anything they can consider “extra”. Oh and the flight isn’t even advertised as cheap and cutting corners like Spirit, that’s just how they are. You will get screwed if they change your flight or cancel it or forbid you miss your flight or need to change it for a medical reason.

### "placed my minor child’s seat away from me"
The most ignorant employees who talks down to you, late, unprofessional and most unhelpful people. They placed my minor child’s seat away from me. Then I cannot call them to speak to anyone. It tells me to chat, and when you try to chat, no one answers. 24/7 chat is nothing but lies. Bags are extremely expensive. Dont ever use this airline unless you want to spend a fortune on bags just be talked down to & to ruin your vacation. Be warned, choose a different airline. Tickets may be cheap, but they will make you pay the price via bags.

### "charging $99 for a carry-on bag"
Worst airline experience I’ve had in 30 years. The Philadelphia staff is a group of utterly miserable people that are pretty aggressive and unsympathetic in making the entire boarding line measure their carry-on begs like they’re a bunch of children. They were pulling people out of line and charging $99 for a carry-on bag if the bag was an inch over the height limit. $99 for a carry-on? The flight was late with the plane still in Florida for over an hour without any update on the flight status. People were just standing around clueless to where it is. Left 90 minutes late for no reason communicated. Staff is miserable, customer service is atrocious, seats are solid rock, flights are perpetually late or cancelled, no Wi-Fi, “options” are standard on every other airline, and by the time you buy what you need, you’ve paid more for an experience that is an order of magnitude worse than any other airline experience. This was my final time getting sucked in by “discount” rates, only to fly on an airline that should be an example for every major company on how not to operate and treat customers. Worst airline on the planet.

### "charged $200 for two backpacks"
I was charged $200 for two backpacks on my way back home to Florida. We didn’t have any issue on our way to New Jersey with the same backpacks but magically the two ladies scanning the boarding passes claimed they were too big and we needed to pay $100 each , I tried to explain them we we used the same backpacks with no issue before and they just ignored us and asked for the $200 payment or threaten us to close the gate so we had no choice but to pay for the ridiculous amount.

### "definitely our worst experience"
Not Verified |  This was not our first time flying with Frontier but it was definitely our worst experience and our last. We were talked to and treated like inmates upon arrival instead of like paying customers. All of the employees that were checking in bags had terrible attitudes and were very disrespectful. I did not witness one out of line customer only Frontier employees. We were also charged close to $600 for our luggage. Upon boarding was more extreme rudeness as they had everyone with backpacks try to fit them into the bag sleeve to see if they needed to add a carry on. Once we boarded it was obvious there was something wrong with the plane although they did not give us an update for thirty minutes. After an hour on the plane we were told to get off. We then waited another two hours before being told our flight canceled. Terrible experience and they do not deserve anyone's business.

### "talking down to everyone"
Not Verified |  Check in and baggage check. The staff was rude and talking down to everyone in line. When we got to the area to board the plane the staff was rude and disrespectful to almost everyone. I heard at least 12 to 15 people saying they would never fly with Frontier again. I feel the same the experience was awful. I fly across the country four times a month and I don’t deserve to be treated like I’m below the staff.

### "In the future I’d never fly with Frontier"
I would never fly this airline again. My husband thought we were saving money. We had to fly five people due to my mother having a stroke. So a completely unplanned trip. We paid for our bags prior to getting to the airport. We had no issues flying from Orlando to Dallas but trying to get home after purchasing nothing new to add to the weight of our bags. Also using the exact same backpacks I’m hit with an additional $200. On top of choosing my seat fees paying for my checked bags and of course my tickets. So in addition of our original ticket prices we ended up adding and adding almost $1000 in fees. In the future I’d never fly with Frontier. That’s not even taking in account the unfriendly service and lack of staff. Oh don’t pay for reclining seats they forgot have any. I flew first class.

### "Stay away"
This is was my first flight with them and my flight was delayed for 12 hrs. The person at the gate was rude didn’t care or gave a solid answer. It was just an awful experience. I had to pay for a hotel room and an Uber ride. I will never use them again. Stay away.

### "Won’t recommended this airline to anyone"
Today the Frontier Airlines staff decided to charge me $199.00 for the bags I normally brings as my personal item! The only difference I found today in the flight was that the flight was empty...maybe 50 or 60 people the most flying, and they were reaping off the customers. This are the reasons the airlines go out of Business. Won’t recommended this airline to anyone.

### "I am in complete disbelief"
I am in complete disbelief regarding customer service policies of Frontier. My wife and I arrived early to our gate, we listened as Frontier agents made continual announcements about how personal items or carry-on baggage needed to fit into a metal bag checker or be charged $99 when boarding the plane. For the agents, the process seemed to be a game similar to over-zealous security guards, who get drunk with a taste of power. When boarding, we were extra patient since I wanted to see the process unfold. These same agents ordered some passengers to place their bags into the slots. Several bags slid into the slots, yet were snug and told they still had to pay. Then, these customers were ordered to pay the $99. There were at least a dozen people who went through this ordeal. I am sure there were eventually many more. Once on the plane. I spoke with the people sitting next to me, who mentioned on an earlier flight that every single passenger were ordered to test their bags. We all know the Frontier game and many of us get lured in by the low fares and up-selling. However, it has become a bridge too far. Bag fees have increased from $30 to $40 each to $60 to $80. Seat fees have gone up from $10 to $20 to $30 to $40. With one bag plus a seat, a couple is now paying an extra $240 for up-selling fees beyond the ticket prices while having to endure a whole lot of attitude. After spending the day in Las Vegas, we were unable to check-in early. At the ticket counter, having a bit of service would cost us an extra $25 each. As a college business instructor, I became fascinated. If the purpose of business is to create satisfied customers, then Frontier is in trouble. Four other people around us said they would never fly Frontier again in addition to us. What about the approximately 25 people, who were humiliated and embarrassed by the Frontier treatment while boarding? Will they fly Frontier again? Probably not. Paying an extra $80 for a seat and a bag is a reasonable trade given the low fares on a round trip, yet paying an additional $180 extra with horrible treatment is crazy. We have decided to never fly Frontier again and gladly pay extra for peanuts, reasonable bag fees and employee smiles from other airlines. We will practice the discipline of rejecting the temptation of ultra low fares. Self respect is important and often has a price. Saving $50 or $100 is not worth the poor treatment. One mature lady said it best, "They take the fun out of flying!

### "The worst airline experience"
This is the first and the last time I will ever fly this airline, their phone number is disconnected, their 24 hour chat service doesn’t work. They were supposed to add my TSA number to my ticket so I could access preflight, they failed to do this and I could not contact them to fix it. They charge me for a carry-on bag because they said no carry-on of any sort was allowed. They failed to inform me of this prior to me booking the ticket. On my return flight from Atlanta to Phoenix I had to go to the ticketing counter to get my seat issued because it disappeared from my booking. Not only did they charge me $25 for the rebooking of my seat they charge me another $104 when they told me it was 79 for my bag. Sat for three hours at the gate they were supposed to leave at 8:59 PM. No plane no people no airline personnel. I looked online and seen that it was booked at another gate in another concourse. I went there and it was a different airline. Ended up going back down to the gate which took 45 minutes to get back there come back through check-in and security which took another 45 minutes. My new flight will leave at 12 PM. No email no text message no notification whatsoever. Did I mention that they have no phone customer service anymore? There a 24 hour Chat customer service disconnect you within three seconds of connecting, after 15 attempts I gave up. I go to the customer service counter and they say they have no more customer service or customer service phone numbers, how are you supposed to serve your customer? The worst airline experience in 40 years. I will never fly this airline again

### "charged every tiny thing"
Don’t be fooled by their cheap price. They charged every tiny thing and the final price is a huge number that you will never expect. They will not help you check in any more while all other airlines still provide that as free service. You need to check in by yourself. Otherwise pay for $25 for their agent service. Very strict on luggage size. Their plane was 1/3 filled only but they stilled charged me $100 for my school backpack when it could not fit in their measurement, more than the flight ticket itself and is equal to 2 checked bags. And i’m pretty sure if i tried to reorganize my backpack more (because it’s not that big) it could fit in well but they insisted my backpack is oversized. They want to make money anyway. Airlines and all of their employees, they are all the same. Just think, they charged 60 for a carry on bags and 55 for a checked bag while other airlines offer 30-40 for a checked bags, free for carry on and the flight tickets are just $10-20 more expensive. Frontier used to be an acceptable service but they have many new policies recently. All of their changes are just about making customers’ money. Nothing’s else. Money doesn’t go along with the service quality we should deserve. The service used to be average and now not acceptable. I do not think I’ll use this airline again.

### "charged me $99 for my backpack"
Not Verified |  I have flown with Frontier multiple times. I typically take a small backpack with me when I travel that easily fits under the seat when I sit down as my personal item. Today, I was one of 5-6 randomly selected passengers to get told I have to check my bag. This was not a consistent process and many guests didn’t even have to check their bags even though they were larger. It literally felt like they had to hit a certain quota of fees because they let most people board without checking the size of their bag. They then charged me $99 for my backpack. I never write complaints, but the lack of consistency and customer service has been ridiculous. Do not fly this airline!

### "Charged $100 for a backpack"
Late, delayed, rude service all around, tiny seats, very rude and unnecessary comments towards other customers in line. Charged $100 for a backpack that fits under the seat easily- not worth your savings. Don’t even remotely consider this airline. Would rate less than 1 star if possible

### "lacking integrity and humanity"
I bought a ticket to fly to see family. Then my son ended up in the hospital with RSV. I was promised that I would get my $503 back that I paid to move my flight. Now they are refusing. Lack of moral, dishonest, lacking integrity and humanity.

### "I will never fly Frontier airlines again"
I purchased a flight for my sister (who needs a wheelchair) to fly to Las Vegas (from DFW) on November 22 and to return to DFW on November 29th for the Thanksgiving holidays. The ticket was purchased and confirmed on Sept 3rd. Then Frontier sent out another confirmation on Sept 22 and they had surreptitiously changed the return flight to DFW with no warning and no indication on the email that the original return flight had been changed. Instead of departing Vegas at around 11:24 AM (original time), they moved her to a 6:33AM departure time. It is impossible for my wheelchair bound sister to have gone at that time given that we live outside of the Las Vegas area. It took several hours to reach a human at Frontier (after passing through all the "bot" gate thresholds) only to be told that they had the right to change our flight without notification. Fortunately I am a frequent flyer on American and was able to purchase for her a one-way ticket on American with my miles. I will never fly Frontier airlines again. They may be low cost, but the other "cost" of inconvenience, missed flights, hotel stays, etc could have ended in unmitigated disaster. Fortunately, we caught their "covert" email in the nick of time. so my message to flyers: Buyer beware. You get what you pay for on Frontier and it is simply not worth it.

### "This is the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. They have a 4 hour delay PHL to FLL. Minimal staff to answer questions. Telling customers they’re not entitled to a refund when the Frontier website/Legal Section specifically says refunds will be given if more than a 3 hour delay. Not an isolated incident. I had the same problem on a flight from FLL to PHL last week a 4 1/2 hour delay I’m retired military. The 3 times I flew into Afghanistan were easier than flying Frontier. Avoid this airline at all costs; take the train or the bus.

### "$99 each for their personal bag"
Worst airline ever. Save your money. Do not travel on Frontier! This was my first and last flight with them and I believe 90% of the people on this flight 1362 to FLL feel the same. Flight was delayed twice for hours. Instead of making up for the inconvenience, they charged almost every single person $99 each for their personal bag, even a backup. The manager called 911 on a lady because she came up with zone 1 and that wasn’t her zone and I guess she didn’t want to repeat herself. Horrible customer service. They made so much money off of us today because we didn’t want to be stuck in ATL. Never ever again

### "zero value on customer relations"
Not Verified |  We booked tickets to see our daughter in Seattle for her birthday as a surprise. Due to a conflict, we had to cancel them. Since most airlines allow you to cancel within 24 hours, I thought we would get a full refund. As it turns out, their policy is that if you are less than 7 days out, the ticket is non refundable. We were 6 days out. That in itself is BS. Then when trying to contact them to discuss the matter you ONLY have the option to chat with a BOT, and then with an agent. I did get through to an agent but she could only repeat their policy and would not let me connect with a manager. I have had a lot of issues with Frontier over the years but now I am done. This airline puts zero value on customer relations. Looking at all their terrible reviews on this website it's remarkable that they are still in business.

### "refused to let my daughter fly"
Not Verified |  We had a group of 9 people going. to cancun for my 50th birthday. 2 weeks prior to date Frontier cancelled 2 of the 9 flights as they overbooked, my friends had to rebook with Southwest and pay a lot of money out of pocket. The day before the departure 5 of the remaining 7 were able to check in online and obtain boarding passes, 2 my daughter and her boyfriend said there were flight restrictions and to see attendant to check in. Day of flight we approached attendant and they refused to let my daughter fly stating her passport was not acceptable and wouldn’t even look at her boyfriends passport. When asked what could be done I was told to see what TSA said about the passport. We spoke to a Team leader for TSA whom said it was acceptable, when we told this to the attendant along with the TSA team leader the Frontier supervisor said it was his decision and he was not allowing them to fly. We then hurried down to Southwest airlines and had no issues getting a flight with them nor a problem getting through TSA, immigration at Cancun or getting on returning flight with Frontier in Cancun or customs at ohare on our return. The frontier flight to Cancun was completely full even though my daughter and her boyfriend were denied their flight. How is this possible unless they overbooked and used my daughters passport as an excuse or were discriminating against my daughter due to her being hispanic. When our travel agent contacted Frontier they said documentation was unacceptable then they said she was a no show. We lost over $600 due to this issue. Never use Frontier. In addition on our flight back my husbands and my seat were double assigned. What a mess.

### "Fly with anyone else,"
Not Verified |  As I write this, me and my family are stranded in Miami, and will be spending the night in the airport terminal, thanks to this farce of an airline. Chronologically, we first were charged for baggage that was, until recently, quite acceptable as carry-on. This alone wasn't an issue - The fact that their website wouldn't process the transaction was. Until it did. And the staff didn't accept it, instead insisting on charging a second, higher, fee, while simultaneously agreeing that we HAD paid. That was the start. Our first flight was late by two hours, which in and of itself wasn't much of a problem. Except the connecting flight was also two hours behind. Then four. Then canceled after a mechanical fault was found with the aircraft. The first thing the staff did, which clearly was important, was promptly inform us all that no recompense was, or would, be on offer. And that we were to deal with it ourselves. Right now, that leaves us, a group of four, and the remaining other passengers, stranded in the terminal after the employees promptly left. Save your money. Fly with anyone else, lest their problems be dumped on your head, and your family ends up stranded on the other side of the country, as mine is.

### "This was the worst experience"
Not Verified |  This was the worst experience I've ever had while traveling. I genuinely think it took 10 years off my life. I arrived for a flight that was supposed to depart at 8 am. However when I got there to check my bags, nobody was there and there was a paper sign saying my flight has been delayed until 1:57 pm. So that’s 5 hours. But it’s not only the delay that made me upset. it’s the fact the app did not say a thing about it being delayed and when I finally did get notified, it was 7:50am. How does that make sense? Then it made me miss my connecting flight and there were no others that day so I can’t get home. They did refund me but not without being rude and completely unhelpful. Who knows if that will actually even go through.

### "Frontier is the worst airline ever"
Frontier is the worst airline ever. I purchased a ticket for my daughter to fly home from college on Expedia for $137. Somehow my name got on the ticket instead of hers. I spent forever trying to call/chat with an agent. When I was able to get one on chat they told me it would be $524 to change the name on the ticket. I was able to purchase a new one with United for $425.

### "does not care about its customers"
Not Verified |  If this review prevents even one hard working person from giving a disgraceful business like Frontier Airlines their money, I'll feel a bit better. My 4pm flight out of PHX has been delayed 5 hours to depart at 9pm. Frontier gives no reason for this delay or any compensation besides a small voucher to be used withinn 90 days. After spending hours on a customer service text chat (Frontier no longer has voice customer service?) the agent firmly stated that this is the maximum amount of compensation that can be offered besides canceling the flight all together and to take it or leave it. My wife and I now need to come up with an additional 5 hours of childcare cost as well as parking fees for our vehicle because Frontier found it convenient to push our flight back half a day. The airline clearly does not care about their customer's, only their own wallet. We normally do not fly this airline, but they had flights that fit our schedule very well for this trip. Unfortunately, as we've found out, they change times to whatever is convenient for them and all of our planning now means nothing. We could've flown a real airline if we'd known we'd be flying out so late. The sad part is that a company like Frontier airlines preys on customers with less resources and takes their money while providing truly unacceptable customer service with a "Put up or, shut up! business model. When other airlines make mistakes, they at least try to take responsibility and better the situation. Frontier Airlines clearly does not care about its customers. Please please please do not continue to hand your hard earned money to such a poor excuse for a business. Let their disgusting morals and terrible business tactics run the business into the ground. Upper management should be ashamed and concerned but I won't hold my breath.

### "would rather get my money back and drive 6 hours"
Not Verified | My flight was supposed to leave at 12pm. I get multiple notifications that it has been delayed. It is now delayed until 1am. I try every number I could find to talk to a human and get this figured out. Every number just sent me a link to click. I click the link and it's just an automated message. I am unbelievably annoyed at this point. My flight is one hour from a sunny place to another sunny place. I can't begin to understand why it would be delayed so drastically. I honestly would rather get my money back and drive 6 hours then deal with this airline.

### "a confrontational employee"
This is the worst airline in history, I've seen them do this to others for having massively oversized bags but never for my backpack until now. During the boarding process of this flight and only this flight in my history with Frontier, the boarding attendant told me my bag was too big and commanded me to go and pay for a carry on. I don't like being confronted and told that I have to do something, especially when the boarding agent got in my face and violated my personal bubble. He was aggressive and when I fit the bag in box he still told me it wasn't good enough. So I asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't enough time to do so before the plane took off. So I had to pay 100 dollars additional for absolutely no reason other than a confrontational employee. I fit my bag under the seat no problem when I got aboard the plane. I even flipped the bag to the side and it fit in the container sideways.

### "the worst airline I have flown"
I had a round trip from Houston to Las Vegas, Houston Frontier staff showed up late so checking in bags was slow, after getting past TSA they were late boarding to the point where they tried to close out zone 4 forgetting them. Seats are uncomfortable. Now leaving Las Vegas back to Houston was the worst of the worst with Frontier Airlines, first they had long lines on every bag check in, even an outside one where the outside staff basically clocked out with people in the line and walked away making them go inside with the line getting longer, now we had a 6.05am flight, that’s was our boarding time, we were there an 1hr ahead but at 5.30am their system supposedly shut down and wasn’t letting them check anybody in so they forced us to switch our flight, didn’t get us a hotel room so we stayed at the airport until the next day just to run into more problems with baggage drop. First off the computer cut off and started messing up again and we then got told two different things on bags, where we had to pay for a check bag and our personal item which were normal size backpacks but said they were carry on but back in Houston got told differently. This is the worst airline I have flown and I would not recommend it to anyone!

### "they lost a customer already"
The plane hasn’t taken off yet and I already know this is mediocre airline. The flight was delayed more than one hour because of some mechanic problem, which doesn’t make me happy, who wants to fly on a plane with mechanical problems. Also, you check the dimensions of you personal item and it meets the measurements, when you arrive to the gate they asked you to fit the bag in square, and mine did not fit, so I had to pay $100. I only hope is a smooth flight, but they lost a customer already. Keep taking advantage to whom pay you. It is really sad these so called “low cost” airlines exists what a shame

### Frontier Airlines customer review
People were forced to either pay the 100$ carry on fee or throw away enough things to let their bag fit in the space without forcing it. Plane was switched an hour after scheduled flight time and different gate assigned. No services or compensations for any of the inconvenience. No in flight entertainment, just pure trash.

### "charged $100 for my case"
Extremely rude staff at the airport! I was charged $100 for my case that fit into their box because "you can't stuff it in like that". Ridiculous!

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service starting from luggage check-in till end. What is the point of having staff if we need to do all the check-in process. Never flying in this airline again. Gate changed too and flight was delayed. Highly not recommended to anyone.

### "I’ve been hung up on four times"
Let’s start with I have been trying to get a hold of a representative either chat or telephone and to my surprise no luck. I’ve been hung up on four times, no one has ever answered my chats. So how do you fix something if you can’t even get ahold of anyone.

### "I am so unbelievably frustrated"
Had the flight canceled due to mechanical issues. Understandable to cancel. I swapped my ticket to go from DFW to DEN then DEN to PHX. However, I asked for a hotel voucher to go rest since I have nowhere to go and my flight is now nine hours away. I have a spinal issue where I am in extreme pain constantly and would like to lie down and feel better. Still over 4 hours have passed and have not received one. Spoke with the front desk agents that were very nice. However, their superior has been ignoring their messages and calls. I’m sitting here writing the review right now as I am still waiting for something which will be completely worthless at this point. I am so unbelievably frustrated with how the superiors behave towards their customers by completely ignoring them when there are cancellations. It seems they don’t care one bit about the people that fly with them. If I could have gotten another ticket with a refund I would have. However, I bought the ticket over a month ago for a cheap price and now the flights were 5-10 times the price I originally paid. It shouldn’t be my problem to solve when they have issues and if they can’t accommodate things quickly or efficiently I shouldn’t be made to suffer. I understand this happens sometimes but there should be some better protocols than we will refund you the small amount you paid or change your flight for you and you’re on your own for anything after that point. It’s just ridiculous to be going through this especially when someone is suffering from a medical condition and can’t do anything but wait in the airport or pay for my own hotel room.

### "haven't returned my voucher"
I have booked my flight through Frontier last December and the flight got cancelled, they gave me a voucher for that amount, I have booked my flight again with the voucher and had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances, they haven't returned my voucher and haven't returned back my credit card pay

### "never had an issue with this bag"
I usually have had great experiences while flying Frontier but this was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. My bag fit in the personal item container before boarding and I was charged 100$ when it clearly fit in the sizing slot. I have never had an issue with this bag in the past on Frontier. The seat had crumbs on it and the window was greasy and covered in finger prints from the person before. There was no way that the plane was cleaned before the flight. I wanted to talk someone at the front desk for Frontier at MSP about the issues but the front desk was closed. Absolutely ridiculous.

### "Worst airline in existence"
Not Verified | Worst airline in existence. 3 days on hold for 2 hours to be hung up on by their automated line. Submitted a call back from chatbot got the call back as I should have been next - waited on hold another 40 minutes before I hung up. Messaged on fb and twitter as directed - no response. Hello bankruptcy - goodbye Frontier

### "Really bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Really bad customer service and cancelation terms. Be careful if you want to cancel your ticket, they will show you an amount it will cost you on the webpage, but its not the amount they will take - and they don't do anything for you at customer service. They don't even answer you

### "be my last time flying with them"
They changed the gate number at the last minute and the plane didn't leave until 10 mins after the departure...there customer service representative are very rude and not helpful at all this will definitely will be my last time flying with them.

### "3 flights back to back are delayed"
Not Verified |  This airline should be banned. 3 flights back to back all are delayed. 4 hours, next one 2 hours and last one 2 hours again. Came to Orlando at 1.30 am after 2 hour delay and waiting for luggage another 45 mins. They penny pinch you for everything. Stay away from this airline. Disgusted.

### "Absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible! Booked a flight today and it came to 273$, once I go book it then says 303$. Can’t get ahold of anyone! Went on a trip before and the flights kept getting delayed so they gave us vouchers to use next time we fly for 50$. Go to use the voucher today and it doesn’t work. It says it had to be used within 90 days. I’m sorry I can’t go on vacations or book every 90 days. So basically you gave us something that we couldn’t use. Stayed on hold for 2 hours today just for someone to pick up and hang up. So I call back got some one who does not speak English. So I call back, now I’m on hold for another hour! The customer service sucks, that’s what I get for trying to be cheap! I regret it I can tell you that. Can’t wait for my discount den to expire.

### "such a terrible experience"
They are a swindler of an airline. I booked a flight that THEY rebooked me from and told me that I can either accept the new booking or cancel for travel credit. I cancelled it for travel credit but they rebooked me on the other flight anyway, which was not the option that I chose Then I cancelled it, took the cancellation fee ($120) hit so that I could book a different flight path with the credit. When I put in the travel credit through their checkout for the new flight, they also asked for my credit card information, which I understood, a lot of companies do just in case the credit is not enough or it is expired or something, but they changed the full amount to my credit card instead! After I saw the charge on my credit card, I tried to use their chat feature on their site and told them I was charged to my credit card instead of the travel credit, and they said that they cannot make a change to a paid reservation even though the error was on their side. I also trying to contact Chase because that was the card I used to fill a change back but Chase said that I have to talk to the merchant. So I am out the original amount that I paid for the first flight that was changed and this flight. It is so bad and the review are so terrible on here that I don't even want to fly with them and booked another flight with Alaska just so I would not have to start my trip off with such a terrible experience.

### "Customer support is horrible"
Not Verified | Customer support is horrible. My Credit Card was charged twice while purchasing tickets and it was impossible to get assistance from the airline. Because their support staff is apparently severely understaffed. I tried calling support the minute they opened in morning (multiple days) only to hear "please call back the lines are busy. When I finally was able to get a position over the phone (meaning...not disconnected because they were to busy), the call timed out after 1 hour. I contacted online support...only to find out that if you don't keep an eye on the chat, when the rep finally does respond (for me took about 45 min) if you are not looking at your browser and don't respond inside of a few minutes, they will say "you must no longer be there" and the support session is disconnected. So it is important to keep an eye on the browser window (which has no notification bell on the chat, come on, get a web dev to fix that). One would think, Frontier is doing everything they can NOT to assist their customers.

### "do not risk with Frontier"
Not Verified |  By far the worst! I've never been the one to write reviews, only read them. Please do not risk with Frontier, regardless the price. My ticket was cancelled and only received partial of the refund. I called trying to get information and currently on hold for 4.5 hours, and with three different phones. I tried the online chat and was also waiting for hours. July 2022 similar situation but due to lost of family member. I lost a total of $239.92 and could not get in touch with anyone. Again do not risk it.

### "do not fly Frontier"
I left Colorado on the 29th of Oct with a bag and my service animal. I had to check into my flight almost 4hrs before take off due to me having a service animal. I arrived in san Francisco the same day at approx 11pm California time, I attempted to retrieve my bag only for the agent in frontier baggage claim to admit to me that they left my bag in Colorado. She filed a claim for me and stated that someone will contact me about my bag. The next day my flight for Hawaii took off and I still didn't have my bag. I landed in Hawaii to a voice-mail stating that my bag had arrived in San Francisco. I stated that I'm currently in Honolulu Hawaii. The agent then caught an attitude and stated that I need to come back to san Francisco to get it. I stated that it's not possible because I had just moved to Hawaii. So I provided my address here in Hawaii. She states that my bag is being sent to Atlanta to their central baggage claim. A few days pass and a guy for frontiers central baggage claim calls and states that he has my bag but it's ripped open and he will be sending it via fedex - that was on the 4th November ... it is now the 15th and I've received multiple delays, attitudes from all frontier agents and even ignored completely when it comes to receiving my package or filing a claim against them. If it's possible do not fly Frontier.

### "I'll never book with them again"
I had booked a daytime trip from PDX to BWI (8am-7pm) a couple of months in advance. A week after booking, I got an email notifying me of an itinerary change, and my daytime flight had turned into a redeye arriving the next day (7pm-6am). I was given the option to choose this new flight itinerary at no extra cost or cancel for a full refund. I chose to cancel. I received an email saying my refund was being processed, and then 20 minutes later received an email confirming my booking (for the redeye). I tried calling, but the number on their website would not connect. I spent two hours on chat, and found that my reservation was indeed still standing. Finally got it actually cancelled. It felt super scammy and like they were hoping I'd just give up and accept the new flight with the terrible hours that didn't even arrive on the day I needed to arrive. I'll never book with them again. I'd rather pay extra to fly with one of the other airlines I've never had trouble with before.

### "Pointless, never again!"
Purchased a ticket to leave 2:06 arrive same day. Frontier emailed me saying flight schedule changed to leave 11:38pm arriving next day and gave me options to change flight to new time sent or refund. I chose refund, got a email confirming refund then 30mins later got an email confirming new flight to leave at 11:38. No one picks up the phone. No one Responds to emails. Pointless, never again!

### "the worst flight I have taken!"
This was the worst flight I have taken! I had heard terrible things about Frontier, but I did my research ahead of the flight. I purchased a carry-on that was in compliance with the bag dimensions provided on the Frontier website. The sole purpose of doing so was to avoid carry-on fees. Well, that failed. When arriving to the gate, the gate staff was extremely unprofessional. One of the ladies was arguing with customers while the other was just flat out rude, telling almost half of us that we would have to pay a $99 carry-on fee. Although my bag was within the dimensions, I was charged that fee. I did not argue because I saw how other customers were being treated. Of course when I was on the plane, my bag fit comfortably under the seat in front of me, but this is no surprise. I will never fly with Frontier again. I do not care if the flight is free!

### "carry-on bag policy is a joke"
Not Verified |  Their carry-on bag policy is a joke. It's all about charging a person $99 per bag when you get their gate. Their policy has your bag so small that if it's anything more than laptop bag or a purse you'll be paying extra. Their gate customer service reps are rude and aggressive. It's like they get paid a commission to charge you the extra fees. Our flight was delayed solely because they were collecting fees from passengers. Fortunately, I wasn't carrying a very big bag but the rude agent asked if I had any personal items in my medical bag (which is exempt from being counted as a bag), that she was going to charge me if I did. She didn't inspect the bag, I assume, because we were 30 minutes past the departure time. I dislike Frontier now. I used to love them and their prices.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
Worst airline experience ever. I did not actually think it could be this bad. I believe this company hates their customers, and that is not an exaggeration. The ticketing agent had a bad attitude and was unhelpful, the boarding agents were making everyone weigh their bag causing frustration and delays, and lastly we have had an impossible experience dealing with customer support to use a travel credit. It takes 2ish hours to get a hold of someone by phone or chat and even if you do get someone there is no guarantee they will not just hang up on you or refuse to help. It seems like agents are micromanaged such that they are not even able to help you if they wanted to (and them wanting to is a 180 degree stretch) because they have no authority to. It is clear that the company culture encourages anti-customer sentiment from the top down. 0/10 in every category. They are not even cheap once you add all the hidden fees. I will never fly this airline again and will actively warn others not to.

### "Avoid at all cost. You have been warned"
Worst airline I've ever had the misfortune of using. Just for context, we are a travel nurse couple and fly a minimum of once every 3 months. When boarding, they had two staff members at the gate making everyone check the size of their personal items. If you had to "force" the item into the sizer (aka it didn't slid in on its own with no friction) it didn't count as fitting. Is your bag kinda poofy but with a little push can be almost flat? Doesn't matter. You forced it, it doesn't fit. Go pay $99 to use the overhead bin. Add on to this, the actual space under the seat in front of you is LARGER than the sizer they use at the gate. My girlfriends bag easily fit under the seat, with room for her feet, but she still had to pay $99 for it. The flight took so long to board, due to everyone having to pay more for their backpacks, that we were 45 min late to get into the air. Which, the flight getting to us was delayed by an hour as well, since it was clear skies at our destination and at the airport, I can only assume it was late because of the same reason. On the plane, the seats are basically rocks with a fake leather covering thinly stretched over them. The seats have no headrest to speak of. Zero lumbar support. And not even God can help you if you are taller than 5 foot 3 inches, because you will be sitting with your knees inside your chest. The staff are rude and ruthless. This is not an airline, it is a scam. We will pay more to be with other airlines from now on, we will rent a car and drive 36 hours to our destination, we will cancel vacations or contracts, rather than ever fly with Frontier again. Avoid at all cost. You have been warned.

### "service is just terrible all around"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible. Frontier scams you for your money. They charged an extra 100 for a single bag that weighed less than 40 pounds, then charge over 100 to cancel a flight after 24 hours. I'd pay half price at the most. They charge so much for no reason. They also served half of the plane and then never returned to the second part even though there was no turbulence? So I never got water. Their service is just terrible all around and they are so disorganized. Honestly worse than Spirit.

### "Frontier was hoping I would cancel"
My trip was cancelled due to weather, which is understandable. However it seemed every website knew my flight was cancelled expect for the website for the actual airline I was flying with. Google and the departing airport showed the flight as cancelled before 4:30pm CST, Frontier didn't show the flight as cancelled until after 9pm CST. In fact, at 6pm - two hours after the flight had been cancelled, Frontier asked me to pay for a carry on. I'm not upset that my flight was cancelled, at all. I'm upset that Frontier had the clear opportunity to notify customers in a timely manner and chose not to. Frankly, it feels like Frontier was hoping I would cancel before they did so they could avoid refunding me.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. I had a very small bag (the only item) which can be considered a personal item. Got to the gate, which two employees are stationed to watch and stop each person with items that appear to be oversized as a personal or carryon at the door. The employees direct any to use the carryon or personal item measuring to indicate if any are oversized. If your items are oversized, you’re charged $99 to bring the items on the plane as a carryon. This is a straight rip off and sudden needs to be done about this. Frontier used to be the GO TO airline, but now has become the Run From airline. Everything has become a charge for this and that. Quality airlines let you have a personal item free of charge and make free changes. Don’t waste your money here.

### "the most uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Seats are the most uncomfortable seats i have ever has the displeasure of sitting in. Staff is more concerned with upcharging you for luggage than providing service. Flight was delayed. 2 days with no offer of rebate. It doesn't matter though, the seats are enough to make me never want to use this airline again.

### "they nickel and dime the passengers"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is in the luggage and snack business. They are not in the transportation of passenger business. It was sickening how they nickel and dime the passengers and how they emphasize charging for bags. This poor lady was being charged $99 for her bag which would fit except it had a hard bottom and couldn’t squish the .25 inch. She was so confused and disappointed. Felt for her. They also wanted to charge me $25 for one of the lazy attendants to actually work and print a boarding pass. I had to show him that I can’t check in on the app because it was showing that I can’t connect to their server. Not if I can help it again would I use this airline.

### "I will not recommend this airline"
This is the worst airline ever, happen to me twice they cancel the flight and no refund bad service and charge for everything. You trying to pay less but at the end you pay for first class in another airline so you are paying more for nothing, I will not recommend this airline

### "aggressive and rude staff"
Washington to Denver. Very aggressive and rude staff, they were having fights with everyone boarding the plan with carry-on, they didn't have any customer service attitude. Made me pay $99 for my carry-on and they didn't even check it in. I took it with me to the flight but still had to pay. Total rip-off.

### "would not let us on our flight"
Not Verified |  When we showed up at the airport, the line was wrapped around the corner and the airport was understaffed and slow paced. By the time we got up to the front the woman would not let us on our flight. Even though we were there early. I was very disappointed. We then waited on a line for customer service for about 25-30 minutes to be told that the next flight we could get on was 9:50 P.M. the next day. They were also not confident in the fact that they could request a refund for us. She also kept rolling her eyes at us. I asked to speak to a manager and the woman was very disrespectful and refused to bring one for us to speak to. This is extremely unprofessional. The next day, when we showed up for the 9:50 P.M. flight we were told that we were not on the flight. They had to adjust this and get us back on the flight. All we were offered at the time was a credit toward another flight at your airline. We should have been offered a refund back on our original form of payment.

### "Don't ever fly with Frontier"
Frontier takes "budget airline" to a whole other LOW point. Horribly uncomfortable seats that have zero cushioning (except for premium seating that you will pay $80 for on top of your flight, bag, airport fees, etc. After being nickled and dimed for every little thing (an advertised $89 flight ended up costing $357 total because you have to pay for everything. I didn't even check a bag, just had my purse and a small carry-on) and then when you fly they try to enroll you in their "program" as well as their credit card offer. (listen carefully to the fine print as the flight stewards tell you all about it while you wait to de-plane). It's nauseating and very clearly set-up for them to win, not you. There are no in-flight comforts, none whatsoever, and it's really quite uncomfortable (I'm a small-ish woman). But the real horror was when my return flight was delayed, then we finally boarded only to sit on the plane for 2 hours while they tried to remedy a technical issue. We were finally permitted to de-plane and were told to hurry to another terminal to catch a new plane which didn't actually arrive at the gate for another 2 hours...and we couldn't board it because of technical issues. In total we waited in the airport/plane for a total of 10 hours before they announced the flight was just plain cancelled. Then we're told that if you want to be re-booked OR refunded (and not have to pay extra fees) you have to march down to the ticket counter at the main terminal and wait in line with the 250 other people you're supposed to be flying with and wait for their 4 attendants they have on duty to reschedule or refund you. (please don't expect a full refund, not happening!). By the time I got to an attendant I was told that they couldn't rebook me (and my two minor children) home for 5 days. Because they only had one seat available on this flight and one seat available on that flight. The people next to me in line (a couple) were being separated to fly home and sent all over the country to puzzle-piece their return flights. I was straight up told that unless I was willing to send my minor children on their own flights home, "m'am, I can only refund you, I can't get you and your children home unless you want to wait 5 days. Obviously I could not extend our vacation for 5 more days so I took a measly little partial refund and then had to go through the effort of finding us a flight home on another airline because that is not a service Frontier provides. They have no partner airlines or ability to help you book with someone else. You're on your own. I heard some awful stories from other weary Frontier travelers. People who keep being lured in by "cheap" prices, only to miss weddings, birthdays, reunions, funerals, dying relatives, etc. It's horrible, Don't ever fly with Frontier, Just don't. It's not worth whatever low price they try to get your attention with. Not by a long shot. P.S. We flew home the next day with Southwest. They were amazing. My new favorite airline.

### "they have zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Before and during the pandemic we knew it was a cheap airline but had a good route Fort Lauderdale to Trenton. It was cheap but that’s not why we flew. It was one of the few direct flights! Moving forward, they have zero customer service. Try and call, 2 hr wait time and no call back. Go to the airport early with a concern, forget about it, they are too busy to deal with you unless your concern is boarding that flight. It’s the only airline I fly that doesn’t apply my global entry number, my TWIC number or my TSA number. It’s a mystery to me!

### "boarding process was chaotic"
My husband and I went from GRR to DEN with a connecting flight to SFO. We got off the plane at gate A44 which was the exact gate we were boarding the connecting flight from. From GRR to DEN our personal items passed inspection, even put them in the holder to make sure and an employee approved. When boarding our connecting flight (same exact plane, same seats) the boarding process was chaotic, aggressive and urgent. The employees were making every person measure their bags. They were hastily announcing that they were shutting the doors with no exceptions and making that announcement several times in a short period. The employees still had people lined up as they stiff armed them about bags and the kicker is when bags weren’t fitting they would deny entry and made them buy carry ons, while threatening to close the doors. Some of these bags would fit but the backpack straps would be hanging over the edge and they were still forced to pay, come on! As I was in line waiting (and panicking) there was a place to buy bags online, I desperately tried that and of course the link didn’t work. First my bag passed, then my husbands didn’t, we moved to the side to figure out what to do and I get forced to measure my bag again and it didn’t pass. Ultimately my husbands bag didn’t pass and we purchased a carry on. This is where I lost my wallet (my fault but the circumstances didn’t not help). The employees were just mean and many people were left embarrassed, I saw two women crying. In conclusion, I’d rather spend my money on a flight that doesn’t leave me and fellow passengers embarrassed.

### "This is ridiculous"
Not Verified |  I had a direct flight from Grand Rapids, MI to Fort Myers, FL scheduled on December 11, 2022. I was informed by Frontier via email that my flight had been changed. New flight Sun, 11 Dec 2022, F9 499, GRR-DEN, 07.35pm-08.43pm, F9 486, DEN-RSW, 7.41am-01.20pm. They now want me to fly to Denver with an overnight layover and fly to Fort Myers the next day. Seriously? The only option they provided was a refund or a similar flight the next day. I now have to book a new flight through another airline and pay 3 times as much because of the late notice they provided. This is ridiculous.

### "I will never fly Frontier airlines agan"
Upon waiting for the flight to arrive 2 1/2 hours late, when boarding the aircraft your employees did not use the microphone at all so no one could hear anything they were saying. Then in the middle of boarding your employee took it upon herself to close the door to the aircraft and stop the boarding while screaming at all the passengers that there wont be anyone boarding until everyone is sitting down. She almost caused a riot with the crowd. First off you don't talk to a crowd of over 100 people like they are children, 2nd there was no where to sit down due to the crowded airport! This was very disturbing behavior to many many passengers as well as myself and should be addressed in a serious manor. Personally myself I will never fly Frontier airlines again after what i experienced today simply due to the fact your employees at the Las Vegas location made me feel unsafe and even potentially threatened.

### "Sat on the tarmac at DIA"
Sat on the tarmac at DIA while the cabin filled up with jet exhaust for 50 min at midnight. As if there were no gates available, got passed by other Frontier planes that motored right up to the gate.

### "clearly don't care about anything"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed for no reason. Another 30 minute delay to disembark from plane. Another 30 minutes for luggage. They clearly don't care about anything.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Avoid at all costs. Worst airline ever. Every time I fly frontier it gets delayed or canceled. Always completely unorganized, and the most inconvenient and terrible way to fly.

### "I had to pay $99 at the gate"
The Frontier Airlines site was not working correctly when I went to purchase my carry on cost. I had to pay $99 at the gate. Not the $57 that was on the site when I paid for my previous flight today. I was told I wasn't the only one having issues with the site, but they couldn't change the cost at the gate. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and Frontier. Let's see if anything comes of it.

### "rude, unknowledgeable staff"
Not Verified |  Their agents at in Denver are very rude and not knowledgeable at all. I had to purchase a ticket at the counter asked agent to add checked bags, which she didn't. I did not know this until I got ready to check my bag and was told by another agent that my checked bags were not added. I went back to the ticket counter and was told 3 different prices to have my bags checked. Asked for manager, the manager refused to speak with me, called customer service and waited almost an hour for someone to pick up, yet and still the customer service agent over the phone gave no help or insight with my issue and didn't take my complaint nor did they address any of my issues that I had with these rude, unknowledgeable staff.

### "Plane got delayed 4 times"
The back of their seats are metal. Tray table is a metal flap. Feels like prison. The absolute worst. I flew standby all through college. And this was a worse experience than those anxiety full memories. The experience was the worst experience before arriving to the airport. When I checked in they made me pay to pick a economy seat and to place my carry on in an overhead bin. TALKING ABOUT SCAM! Plane got delayed 4 times we where suppose to land at 9pm did not land until 2pm. The Uber to the hotel was expensive.

### "atrocious customer service"
This airline cancelled my flight with no explanation at all. The weather was fine so it was not that. The crew only told us that they were not being given any information (probably true). They all looked like they had delivered this kind of unbelievable disappointed 1,000 times. I had a Sunday afternoon flight from PHX to ATL at 2:15pm on 10/23/22. The soonest they could rebook me was the Tuesday redeye that landed on Wednesday morning. Waiting 2 1/2 days was unacceptable. They only offered to cover 1 night of hotel so that made it even more ridiculous. I tried to call their customer support line and the recording said it would be 1 to 2 hours before anyone could help me. Their online customer support chat feature had a couple auto responses for me. When it came time for an actual person to show up there was no one there. I eventually gave up, which I am sure is what they wanted. This airline is seeking to establish new all time lows for atrocious customer service.

### "better driving to your destination"
Not Verified |  To the ridiculous baggage rules to the ridiculous delays, you'd be better driving to your destination than flying frontier. From the fact that I had to be at the airport at 830 pm for our delayed departure at 2am, to the fact that every passenger has to fit their carryon in a small box. There is no way I'd ever voluntarily fly this airline again. They gave me a $100 dollar voucher to make up for the inconvenience.

### "if the flight is cheap they get you with the bags"
Not Verified | Terrible I would give zero stars. Charged me $200 for bags that were under 45 pounds. Customer service was rude. They are money grabbers. With rude employees. Have your money. And even if the flight is cheap they get you with the bags and everything so overall paid $375 for a flight that is only 1 hour. Will NEVER EVER fly this airline again.

### "checked everyone's personal bags"
Warning do not fly Frontier. Worst experience. I'm aboard now sitting out a delay from MCO to LGA. On my way in was over hr delay from LGA to MCO. That's not the biggest of deals. The absurd baggage prices -  70.00 one way! At 40lbs max., 50.00+ extra for 41-50lbs. They literally checked everyone's personal bags to ensure they fit in sizing display! Upon boarding the woman working the aisles was extremely rude verbally and visually to a guest who had a hard time understanding. If I could give zero stars I would. Even if I was traveling with only a personal item it's still not worth the price in exchange for rudeness, disfunction and steady delays.

### "This airline is worse than terrible"
Our flight was canceled with no reason given. My husband received $50 vouchers for each of us which expire in January. Because we had to take extra vacation days from work to get home (thank goodness we weren't fired) we can afford a trip between now and January. I got a sorry excuse for an apology on Twitter, so I'm going to do all the reviews I can so others don't have to go through what we went through. Getting a flight back home took over 2 hours to work out the details. We received our cancelation notice on a Sunday. So we had to do it over chat since they have no one to answer calls 24/7 and offer assistance. We had to keep our rental car an extra day, which cost us money. We had to pay to get a hotel at between flights because of how we were able to arrange flights home. This cost US money. We had to pay for a cab to get us to our hotel because we arrived so late there wasn't a shuttle available. Cab driver took cash only and we have no receipt. So that was an unexpected travel cost. I had to pay for a bag in Denver that I purchased because of its exact dimensions, but for some reason it was too big in Denver. So that cost $$ 6.We had to pay for two extra days of parking at our home airport. and that was an expensive parking payment. With all of these expenses plus food for my family and I, we spent close to $400 just to get back home. Also, all of their flights get delayed because of how they hassle people about their bags at the the gate. All of our flights left and arrived late. This airline is worse than terrible.

### "Worst check-in customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst check-in customer service I have ever experienced in my life. The girl rolled her eyes like 5 times and said she was frustrated with us, when it was her fault for not explaining things correctly and having an attitude in the first place. We were charged 80 dollars for each carry on when the bags were clearly able to fit under the seats. I just cannot believe how rude she was.

### "Astonishingly bad customer service"
We were flying from SFO to DEN. Astonishingly bad customer service and rude for absolutely no reason at all, these employees are poorly trained. The manager in the end didn't let about 10 passengers board on our flight for absolutely no reason, just because she feels powerful in her role. I was already past the hallway, just waiting for my partner and the employee kicked me back out to the gate exit. Some others were trying to pay for their oversized personal items and were denied to do so. Another passenger was refused to board the plane, even when his family of 4 were already on it, his family had to get off the plane because of course they weren't going to fly without the complete party. We all missed our flight and she didn't offer a reason as to why, I asked the other crew members what her name was, they stated she was the manager and that her name was confidential. In the end we lost not only our money, but our time as well. We had to book another same day flight via United Airlines. I've been trying to get my money back for the Frontier flight, but customer service 1800 says that their system shows that I did board the flight. Which also raises a myriad of questions about liability, security, customer service, and reliability of all the computerized tracking. Shouldn't it be important to know who's on the plane? What an unforgettable experience. I will ensure I do not travel with Frontier again. I should be entitled to compensation and the airline should take disciplinary action against flight attendants that are too heavy-handed. The law prohibits air carriers from denying a passenger traveling on a confirmed reservation permission to board, or involuntarily removing that passenger from the aircraft, once a passenger has checked in for the flight and had his/her ticket scanned.

### "the worst flight I have ever taken"
This was my first time traveling with Frontier, and I must say this was the worst flight I have ever taken. From the frivolous additional baggage fees, to the fees for snacks & beverages; and more importantly this was the most uncomfortable flight I have taken. It felt like I was sitting on bricks & the seat was extremely tiny, no leg room at all (I'm only 5'4). I wouldn't take a Frontier flight again even if they were giving it for free.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Terrible customer service, can’t reach anyone one the phone. When you try to talk to a representative at the gate they are rude and very cooperative. Will never fly Frontier again. Their flights are cheap but you get what you pay for seats are very uncomfortable. Zero rating is what they deserve.

### "carry-on bag price was ridiculous"
The flight was cheap but the carry-on bag price was ridiculous almost $70 both ways and then the top it off when I got to my flight my first flight was delayed an hour and a half. Coming back my flight was supposed to leave at 8:45 in the morning and landed at 11:05 with delays they boarded us on two broken planes that to our flight turned into a 10-hour flight. I didn't reach back to Providence until 7:00 p.m. at night. Absolutely horrible they were lying to us as customers it was absolutely terrible everybody on the flight was furious and they had the audacity to give us a $10 food voucher as an inconvenience. I missed work. I missed spending time with my kids and everything because of this mishap which they didn't tell us anything but not one but two broken planes they put us on. First time they said wing defroster was broken and then the second time they told us the radar wasn't working. It was my absolute worst flying experience ever

### "I will never fly Frontier Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled after having waited 2 hours at Orlando airport going to Philadelphia. They refused to give us a hotel voucher or food voucher. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "way they treat their customers is unacceptable"
My flight was canceled due to mechanical issue fuel leak. We were on the plane for over an hour before the pilot announced that the flight was canceled and another flight would not be available until Monday the 24th. Our luggage could be available for pick up at carousel four. We went to the ticket gate to get information about booking another flight for Monday the 24th of October. Customer service was very rude had no answers after two hours. We laughed and had to get a hotel room at that point we booked our flight online. I have been trying to get somebody from frontier on the phone since October 22 I have yet been able to talk to anybody nobody will answer the phone. I have sent an email trying to find out about a refund. I sent documentation receipts again this was no fault of mine that it was canceled. It was a fuel leak and their customer service and the way they treat their customers is unacceptable.

### "request was denied and we were offered nothing"
St. Louis to Denver. Frontier cancelled this flight at the last minute. Then as passengers got in line for Frontier to help with the process of finding another way home, we were told there were no more Frontier flights and we were on our own. The Frontier employee said don't stand in line because we will not help you. We were forced to book another flight on our own on Delta at a significantly higher price of $1048.60. We were offered absolutely no help at all at the airport. Since no assistance was given by Frontier, we asked for a refund of the difference between the price of the Frontier flight ($139.98) and the cost of the Delta flight ($1048.60). After numerous calls to customer service the request was denied and we were offered nothing.

### "no concern for customers"
Not Verified |  I would have given 0 star if possible. Worst experience of my life. Flight with a stop, delayed for 3 hours and then got cancelled. We got a rebook with the same Frontier airlines to fly next morning via layover stop, so we had to stay in the airport overnight. The next day, once we reached the intermediate stop/layover(CLE), we were supposed to travel to our final destination(Atlanta) in the evening. Again delayed for 5 hours and then cancelled after we boarded the flight, just before 5 mins to the door close. The reason Frontier Airlines staff told us is, one of the crew members couldn't show up on time. The staff were rude, no concern for customers. Finally, We travelled with a different airline, to reach out destination

### "Very rude staff"
Not Verified |  Very rude staff. My last time traveling with this airlines. They don’t know how to talk to customers. They need to be retrained. I regret buying a ticket with this company. The most terrible experience so far and for the record I travel at least more than five times per year.

### "never take this airline again"
They waited 30 minutes before our flight to let us know that it was delayed almost two hours, okay it happens, but the staff clearly did not want to be there. She rolled her eyes every time someone asked her anything , and was being very rude while checking bags to make sure they would fit under the seats. She was doing her job but in a very rude manner. The attendant could have been nicer to my autistic son when telling him he needed to buckle. He didn't even know what what going on. My family and I will never take this airline again.

### "Worst flight of my life"
Was pulled aside in line to check bag size. Bag fit in compartment. Was told I can’t have two bags referring to my tiny purse for my diabetic needles. Lady told me I needed to pay for one bag because there is no reshuffle. Last person on the flight and rudely was told the flight was leaving without me unless I paid $99!! For my emergency medical supply’s, I literally had a panic attack. Worst flight of my life.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
A group of 10+ of us coming back from a wedding had one of the worst flying experiences you can imagine. Our biggest mistake: we entrusted Frontier to safely get us home. After constant 30 min delays due to “cleanup/maintenance” we become aware our flight has been cancelled. Not via the overhead speaker but from various emails that are received by passengers. This is due to not being able to find a pilot despite constantly reassuring us that everything is fine. So we trusted Frontier and waited patiently, although that all changed when they canceled the flight. It became a mad rush of booking new tickets which increased the demand exponentially and forced us to buy new tickets at more than double our original price (also being red eyes). To make matters worse, their customer service was awful. All Frontier did was refund the ticket and wish us good luck. I will never fly Frontier again and I recommend the same to anyone else

### "Very rude staff"
Very rude staff. Poor boarding process unprofessional. Good value but poor everything else. Fly spirit, another budget airline but better customer service.

### "worst staff, attitude and airline"
I had a flight from Denver to Philadelphia October 26 with 2 years old toddler. It was night flight. The agent on gate was extremely rude and unprofessional. I asked her to give me the tag for the stroller (I was in long line online before) and she said “go to other agent. She will give it to you”. Then I asked “why did not you tell me that before? I spent long time online”. She answered “why did not you asked before?” I was so surprised. I had to start other line from the beginning. Ok. Other agent acted like I was not there at all. She ignored me, than she gave me a tag for stroller, I wanted to go to my plane, but the previous agent did not allowed me to do that and said that I have to scan my onboarding passes one more time, but she did it before. I asked why is needed again? She said “ you have to do that again. You are so annoying” . How is possible to talk like that?!! Ok, I asked her to provide me her last name and she hide her employee ID than. She said to her co-worker “I’m so done with her. Close the gate. She will not fly”. I made a picture of her then, cause she did not show her name. She did for me and my 2 years old baby a hard time, we spent full night at the airport. When I asked her where is the next flight, she said at 5 pm which is not true. I saw that the next flight was at 5.30 am with one stop on Cleveland OH. When I said it to her, she said “do we have tickets?” I said that I can show it to her. After that they will give me those tickets. In Cleveland was very “friendly” agent as well. She said “I wish it will be never ever again any flights to Philadelphia” to her co-workers. So I said then “Frontier never ever again. This is the last time”. She answered “I am not talking with you. Do you wanna fly next week?” Please tell me how is possible to talk like that for staff?! The worst staff, attitude and airline I have ever seen in my life.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Both flights delayed, on my way back to SF My flight was delayed and I was going to lose my connection flight and when I told them they offered me another flight with over 9 hours delay in las Vegas or canceling my flight and find another one on my own! I end up canceling and finding another last minute flight to SF for 500$ (which they didn’t care). Very mean customer service and rude people at the gate and you won’t be able to get anyone on the phone. Not to mention All of their flights on other gates were delayed and people were frustrated with the situation. I will never fly with them again and won’t recommend this horrible airline to anyone else!

### "I do not recommend this airline"
I read the instructions on what classified as a personal item before getting to the airport. When getting to the airport my bag wouldn’t fit in the “bin” that they claimed were the dimensions for a personal item so I said I would condense it so it would fit and the employee then proceeded to tell me that he would still tell me no even if it fit. This is all happening while they’re talking to me condescendingly and being very rude. WORST experience I’ve had with an airline and that’s saying a lot! I do not recommend this airline and will never fly with them again!

### "refused to offer any kind of apology"
Not Verified |  Flight was originally scheduled for 9 pm, delayed two hours day of. OK not a big deal. Get to airport, delayed for another two hours, then another two hours. Ended up not getting to Vegas until almost six in the morning when we were originally supposed to be there before midnight. 3 in the morning and they are still measuring peoples carry on bags and up charging anyone whos bag was even slightly too big. Was traveling in a large group and was charged over $1000 for hotel rooms we didn't really need since we didn't get into town the day we were supposed to. On top of this we were only there for 3 days and the first day was pretty much wasted due to catching up on sleep. Frontier customer service was rude and refused to offer any kind of apology, travel voucher, nothing. Will gladly pay more for a ticket on any other airline from this point forward. To add insult to injury they have the most uncomfortable seats that I've ever experienced. Would give zero stars if it was an option

### "This is my last flight with them"
Not Verified |  Most inefficient airline ever. Everything is self serve and half the time machines don't work. Today I tried to tag my prepaid bag, waited in line, machine said "out of paper. See attendant". I waited again and their employee a) virtually yelled at me that "this always happens. And then b) walked off saying "pick another line. I tried to explain I'd been through two lines already with the same result. She stormed over slammed a sign on the machine out of order and walked away. I stood in line again tried another only to be told I may not check bag more than 2 hrs before flight. Family needed to drop me early so here I sit with no food, coffee etc because I can't go through tsa yet. In an hour I get to start all over. This is why I don't fly these guys anymore. You have to work to get such nasty temperaments in employees also. As I left one of them was berating a woman over the cost of an overweight bag--now max is 40 lbs. 41 lbs? It's $100 total for your bag. It's too bad. I used to fly them a lot. This is my last flight with them though. The problem isn't the planes etc it's the check in process and those employees. It's really too bad.

### "Flight attendants were polite and efficient!"
Flew with Frontier this morning BWI to Orlando and the flight was flawless! Pilots gave us a smooth take off and a landing that was absolutely butter! Flight attendants were polite and efficient!

### "Spirit was a better flight than Frontier"
Not Verified |  Scam artists airlines, they want you to think your carry-on will fit. Rude and miserable staff. Not one thing during my trip was enjoyable. Spirit was a better flight than Frontier. I would wish those flights on anybody, really not sure how they're in business.

### "Staff lacked compassion"
Our flight was set to board in Phoenix AZ at 2:15pm & land in ATL,Ga. At 2pm, they said a latch needed to be repaired & would take 30 mins. At 3:30pm they said it would be another 45mins. Flight was then pushed to 5pm, then 7pm then canceled. We waited in line until 9pm to ask for help with this situation. Frontier said we could have a flight the next day then changed it to a 4 day delay. The only option we were left with was a $563 Delta flight next day. I have a sick child at back in ATL who was only left with one extra day of medication in family care. Frontier offered a refund which would be fraudulent for them not to for a service that was not provided, but in no way compensated for the 5hr delay & cancelation. By law, passengers are the airlines responsibilities. They left all passengers high & dry. Staff lacked compassion & had terrible attitude. This ordeal left many families with emotional distress and cost an unexpected $600 + out of pocket. I have never been do disgusted by a company before.

### "The worst experience"
I booked two one-way tickets from Dallas to Ontario with a layover in Denver. We arrived 2 hours in advance to anticipate delays with TSA. We proceeded to make our way to our gate. We boarded our flight at approximately 1700 even though our flight was scheduled to leave at 1643. Once on board we ended up setting in the aircraft for more than 3 hours due to some maintenance issues they were having. We were told repeatedly that it shouldn’t be much longer and that paperwork was needing to be completed before we leave. This was terribly handled. Frontier should’ve been able to cancel the flight at about an hour into our wait time so that the passengers would’ve been able to find another flight to get to their destination. Instead we waited more than 3 hours on a plane that never moved and ended up having to stay in a hotel overnight because there were no more flights. The worst experience with flying I have ever had. I’ll never fly with Frontier. I have no idea how Frontier is still in business. Extremely disappointed.

### "a refund but not in full"
The flight was cancelled by Frontier Airlines due to "flight has been disrupted. Yes I received a refund but not in full. I was told that there is a $59.99 membership fee that is non-refundable. So I called the airline customer service and waited at least 20 minutes before I was answered. I explained to the customer service representative that I was not expecting a membership fee for $59.99 as other airlines charge nothing to enroll in the mileage program and that you will sometimes even get miles credit for enrolling. Additionally, since the flight has been cancelled few hours before departure and i had to find a last minute flight, then I was hoping for a full consideration in good faith by the Frontier Airlines. I don't have any use for this membership since I am not flying with Frontier Airline due to this flight cancellation. Specially when I learned that there are additional charges to get a seat assignment, check in and carry on bag charges, as well as membership fee. Then the customer service representative's only reply was...I'm sorry but the membership fee is non-refundable. I spoke to the supervisor asking for reconsideration but was told the same thing.

### "never fly Frontier ever again"
Not Verified |  The staff on our flights were very nice however the nickel and diming of everything got to be so frustrating. Want to have an assigned seat? Pay. Want to check a bag? Pay. Want to enjoy a cup of soda, pay. Don't be deceived when you see that their initial pricing is "cheap" - you end up paying hundreds more in add-ons. If your checked bag is over 40lbs you will be charged $100 more each direction. Insane. I will never fly Frontier ever again.

### "It's a miserable experience"
I tried to cancel my flight with Frontier Airlines. They cancelled my flight without informing me that I would not be given a refund of any kind. 1. I cancelled within 24 hours and should have received a refund. 2. If they could NOT provide a refund, they should not have cancelled my flight without notifying me that I would not get a refund. Now, I've waited for hours on both phone and online chats to talk with representatives who have said nothing other than "we can only enforce the policy. I will not be flying with Frontier ever again. This mistake cost me $600, and I have been offered no reimbursement or support. I'm out $600, and I have no flight or refund to show for it. Steer clear of Frontier. It's a miserable experience working with their team.

### "Staff were not pleasant or accommodating to anyone"
Absolutely the worst airline I have ever flown. 5 hr delay due to mechanical issues in Philadelphia. The flight had been delayed in Philly since 1.30 pm. We were not notified until boarding time 5.00pm. Didn't leave until 10.45pm. People could have come to airport later and not sat for 6-7 hrs. That was not the main issue. Ground staff were unprofessional, down right nasty. (No I didn't complain and I'm not a Karen). I was told one employees life story about her kids etc. while waiting in line, and she should have been at the counter, ok she was friendly. Meanwhile her boss was yelling at customers, and down right rude. People were tired and cranky and sure they were as well, but...staff were swearing, when asked by other customers what happens if flight cancels the customers were told in a snotty way 'what would you like us to do? We cant make a plane appear', not alternatives were offered, no assistance. They were told if they wanted to rebook next flight was Wednesday and fees would apply. It was Monday. Plane was not cleaned once it finally appeared. Then this staff member was making sure that personal bags fit in their item size box, even after a 5 hr delay they sure made sure those customers paid the $79 fee for it as a carry on. Even after the delay. Staff were not pleasant or accommodating to anyone. Oh and they do an inflight ad about their credit card and even being applications down the plane. They were more worried about getting extra money than their customers. I have travelled on many airlines, including other low rate and full service airlines and never  have I seen customers be so disrespected by staff. Its a shame their planes are very nice although seating is tight. Pricing is great until u pay for all the extras which are more expensive than other airlines.

### "you can have a little decency"
Seriously every customer device agent / ticketing agent in Dallas and online have been so rude. Flights were cancelled due to a bad storm, ok I get it. Your swamped. But you can have a little decency and way less attitude. I'm just trying to get home.

### "last time I’ll fly with this airline"
Do not waste your money on Frontier, the so called “budget airline” will charge you to unbelievable baggage prices. We paid for checked baggage, expected, but couldn’t understand for the same 2 check bags in the way back were $50 more, but weighed less!! And on the way home from Cancun they pulled me aside with the same shoulder bag I carried on the trip down. Told me I had to pay $99. So total baggage cost for 2 people on this trip, $500. The tickets were not cheaper than other more favorable airlines, so I don’t understand why they insist they are a budget airline. Then once we landed the flight attendant yells through the speaker, we’re unloading from the back rows 27-41 or the plane is gonna flip over, seriously who says that. First and last time I’ll ever fly with this airline!

### "extremely forceful and rude"
Not Verified | We have flown Frontier Airlines several times over the past 5 years. We always travel with same backpacks. Today as we are boarding in Denver on October 24,2022. An extremely RUDE agent, demanded we pay $99 each for our backpacks. Would not let us show her that they would fit In the examples they have at the gate. She was pulling people out of the line and was extremely forceful and rude. I will NEVER fly Frontier Airlines again, even if I have to pay excessively to fly another airline.

### "probably will not fly again Frontier"
I get a notice from Frontier to arrive at least 3 hours in advance because of TSA delays. I arrive 3 hours ahead of time but now my flight is delayed 2 hours, and I can’t print my bag tags because you have to wait until you are in the 3 hour window for departure. This is a big deal since I am traveling with a small child and would rather sit were there are seats and food to wait. I probably will not fly again Frontier

### "they nickel and dime you"
Not Verified |  Charged an extra $99 for a bag at gate and then a miscommunication caused for another $99 missed flight fee. Don’t fly Frontier, they nickel and dime you. Spend the money with a better airline you’ll end up spending the money anyway.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Horrible experience. I have a personal bag that I brought from RI to Florida and there was no issue. My bag was actually smaller coming home, it fit into the personal item holder and the woman working the front desk kept telling me it was too big. This wasn't an issue coming down and I'm not overpaying the $99 for 1 bag. That is the whole reason people fly frontier is for it being affordable. Everyone didn't have an issue coming to Florida but all of a sudden every bag is too large. The staff is ignorant and very controversial. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "awful customer service"
My carry on fit perfectly in the measurement bin. However, the very rude staff would not even look at me or my bag and demanded my credit card and charged me $99 I have pictures of my bag in the measurement bin to prove. Terrible attitude and awful customer service. They are rude and condescending. I will never fly with Frontier again. Save yourself the humiliation of their bad attitude and travel with another airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Checked Bag overweight. They changed from 50 pounds to 40 pounds in January. They didn’t tell me I could have saved $25 if step out of line and upgrade the weight amount online instead of at counter. They also make you get out of line to board and measure personal items to be sure it isn’t a carry on. For cheap tickets they get you for these and ends up being same price if go through better airline. Won’t fly frontier again. Don’t even get water or coffee on flight. Terrible airline!

### "were treated terribly"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed due to engine trouble, we sat in the plane for 2 hours while they addressed the issue. In that time no one communicated anything regarding how this would affect our connecting flight. We had to ask, once we asked they had us de plane , when trying to re book they were less than helpful or empathetic to our situation. We had to cancel the flight and get a refund. Then re book through a different airline and get a hotel for the night. We paid decent money to go on this trip and were treated terribly in a stressful situation.

### "lucky if you get hold of customer service"
Not Verified | This airline is by far the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL service I have ever come across. Your lucky if you even get a hold of a customer service representative, but when you do they hang up. I have been calling since 8am (eastern time), I have “tweeted”, “Facebook messages”, contacted the website “chat” and still have not received any help. At 5:15pm, I finally was able to talk to someone and STILL, NO HELP. There’s nothing we can do” (in their words). Coming from the customer representative, the supervisor and the supervisors manager. I could go on and on all night about what I have encountered through this airline; but I’ll keep it short.

### "trash customer service"
Trash company, trash customer service, trash reliability. You get what you pay for” is not excuse for their awful awful awfully horrendous business. I always make the mistake of thinking “maybe they’ll be better this time” and they never are. They delay my flight almost every time and that’s if I get lucky and they don’t cancel it. This time they cancelled my flight and moved me to one that gets in at 4:30 am the next day. When I called last week they said I should be able to change it for free because it’s their fault. That’s the first and last decent customer service person I’ve ever spoken to there. At this moment I have been trying to get ahold of customer service for 4 hours. I have been hung up on 5 times now. When I finally made it through to someone we either got disconnected or he hung up on me. That was 2 hours ago. They scam you out of your money by messing up on their end and refusing to refund. They began charging $99 at the gate for your personal item even if it fits in the box and you’ve travelled with that same bag under your seat 10 times now. What’s even the point of having a customer service team if they aren’t going to do anything. Sometimes I wonder if they’re just sitting around laughing while the phones ring because even if they do answer they don’t do anything. They’re rude, unreliable, and have absolutely no care for how awful they are. Instead of making improvements in the company to make more money, they scam their travelers out of their money and time.

### "a joke of an airline"
This airline and customer service is extremely rude and difficult to work with. After purchasing my tickets online, i noticed my carry-on was now recorded as a checked bag. i tried rectifying this with the airline via phone and their website but to no avail. I again tried correcting the problem at the ticket counter in the airport and the incredibly rude lady told me i needed to do it online, which i tried again, but you can’t. When i brought this up at the gate to the same rude lady from the ticket counter she stated that Frontier just audited them and they’re to give no leniency when it comes to bags. i was forced to pay the $79 (even though i already paid the $64 online with my original purchase) to carry my bag on. another gate attendant who was slightly more helpful did say that they would put a note on my account so i could be refunded. while on the flight, the lady in front of me had a cat and instead of stowing it underneath the seat in front of her, she had it sitting on the seat in front of me. the cat urinated which ended up soaking my backpack that was stored under the seat. Being that our flight was delayed two hours, we arrived in Vegas at 3am and no one was available at gate check to assist with my cat pee covered bag (which was contained in a garbage bag now). I ended up having to throw the backpack away because the hotel doesn’t dry clean back packs. The flight attendant was as accommodating as she could be and said that if i file a claim, frontier will replace my bag. she also said she would not it under my account and that the airline will know what happened because they will have to schedule a special cleaning for that area of the plane. I made multiple attempts to reach frontier while on vacation (auto recording that the hold time was more than 30 minutes so couldn’t connect me), and when I did talk to a person, they put me on hold for 47 minutes then said they couldn’t find my booking, put me on hold but i could still hear them, and they intentionally hung up on me. Again, got to the airport and had to pay another $79 to carry on my bag, but again they noted it on my account. After spending 2 hours trying to sort things out with them when i got home (they repeatedly told me they didn’t have record i was on the flight and acted like the couldn’t see the notes that were entered on my account) they kept arguing with me saying they would only refund me the original $119 that I paid online because its more to add a carry on at the gate. After finally getting them to agree to refund me the $158 that i shouldn’t have had to pay in the first place, i check my bank statement only to find that they lied and only refunded me the $119. i haven’t been able to get a hold of them since. I filed a claim in regard to my bag and it’s been 10 days and i still haven’t heard anything. This is a joke of an airline that has zero value for customer service.

### "lost my business completely"
I bought another flight and tried to cancel another. Their customer service was absolute trash. The employee did not understand what I was saying and did not bother to work with me. They lost my business completely.

### "rude and disrespectful"
My family and I flew from Denver to Las Vegas on Frontier. We all had a backpack for a personal item when we got on the plane. My young daughter's (6 and 9 years old) have rolling backpacks so they don't have to carry them on their backs. When we flew out of Denver there wasn't any issues. When we were heading back to Denver from Vegas, we were waiting in line and a customer informed us that the E-Tickets provided by Frontier on the phone isn't working for TSA and they need paper tickets. When we got to the counter to drop or bags I informed the employee of this information. The employee advised it will cost $25 to have tickets printed. We didn't pay, waited in line to be told that or E-Tickets don't work and we need paper. I went and explained this and the employees were very rude, didn't want to print the tickets and advised they will only print my ticket. Once I was able to get through this issue, we are walking to board the plane and the lady stops us and tells us or daughters rolling backpacks are to big. Their backpacks were the same size as the backpacks my wife and I had on our backs. They advised they have to fit in the size box or it will cost an additional $100 dollars. We have traveled several times with the same rolling backpacks that fit under the seat and it has never been an issue. Every staff member I spoke to was rude and disrespectful. I don't think I can ever stomach flying Frontier ever again! It is a cheaper flight, but is it worth the rude employee's, being disrespected, being talked down to and the upcharge for a backpack if they choose to do so?

### "pay $100 at the gate for a bag"
I am livid. I brought a backpack to put under my seat (like I have done on many flights with Frontier before this). The gate agent looked at every single person’s bag and stopped people from boarding if he believed the bag was too big to fit under the seat. I was forced to pay $100 at the gate for a bag that I have never had an issue with fitting under the seat. If I had known that my usual bag was “too big” (which it’s not, I could have easily fit it under my seat) I would have paid for a carryon beforehand and saved money. I am a struggling college student and they are scamming their customers. I have been a loyal Frontier customer since I was 10 years old as an unaccompanied minor, and now I will never fly Frontier again.

### "made me pay $100 for my backpack"
At boarding there was a lady who made me pay $100 for my backpack claiming it was too big since it didn't fit the measuring bin. I've been traveling once every week to San Diego carrying the same backpack since last March with frontier and Spirit airlines. No one opposed that backpack size or made me pay $100. How can someone pay $100 for a backpack for a one hour trip. This is unacceptable. One of the staff told me the rule has been always there but now they started to enforce it. What's the whole point of purchase a cheap ticket (that is no longer check due to inflation) if you end up paying for your backpack. I'd rather purchase a United or Delta airlines since they don't make you pay for a backpack and there service is way better as a whole.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
Not Verified |  This was my first time in frontier. Flight was over 2 hours delayed and running behind, and they held everyone checking bag sizes and while up charging fees, also for my backpack. I have traveled many places with the same backpack but no one ever said anything but here they stopped me while boarding and asked to step aside. They are rude and not at all customer friendly. Never flying Frontier again.

### "didn't allow me with my backpack"
Worst airline ever. This was my first time in frontier. They didn't allow me with my backpack. I have traveled many places with the same backpack but no one ever said anything but here they stopped me while boarding and asked to step aside. They are rude and not at all customer friendly. Never ever flying in frontier again.

### "worst airport and plane experience"
Not Verified |  The worst airport and plane experience I've ever had. Very rude, and tried making you pay for everything. Most didn't even know their job. Had to keep getting different tickets because the first ones given to us were no good. Waiting on tarmac 30 minutes or better, because they had no place for us to go. The great deal turned into your worst nightmare. Don't waste your money there, go elsewhere and enjoy your flight.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Frontier again. I had a party of 3 (myself, husband and sister in-law) for which we all had the same "personal item" sized bag that was within Frontiers measurements as a "personal item". I have used these same bags many times flying Frontier and ordered these specific bags because the measurements are within their guidelines. My husband got thru with his bag after arguing with the workers that it was indeed within their guidelines. The employee said the "personal" item needs to simply fit in their box and it cannot be forced in. My husbands bag clearly fit in the box and they let him thru. Myself and sister in law (remind you, same bags as my husband just different color) did not pass their inspection because of the way we packed and our bags were sticking out. After arguing with the rude staff, I was left with no other choice but to pay for our bags. Little did I know, they charge $99.00 per bag at the gate!! That is $198.00 for the 2 bags. On our flight back from from Las Vegas to Denver; all 3 of my bags were not an issue. I don't understand how my bags magically shrunk especially since I did some shopping and was able to fit it in my bag! I contacted customer service for which I was on hold for over an hour before I could get to someone, all for them to tell me bag fees are non-refundable and they leave it up to the workers at the gate to determine if a bag is within or not within their guidelines. I submitted a claim to their claims department and even provided pictures that we took and it still wasn't enough! There are some major inconsistencies with Frontier. If Frontier wants to check everyone's personal item, that is fine however, you should note the personal item needs to be smaller than the measurements of 14"X18"X8". And you should be checking those carry on bags to make sure they also fit in your measurement bin because I guarantee they will not fit! And if that is the case, they should not be considered a carry on item, they should be considered a checked bag! Frontier has lost my business along with my family and extended family!

### "such a lousy experience"
Not Verified |  I have never had such a lousy experience with an airline in my entire life. And it isn't because of the uncomfortable seating, which is another problem all together. The problem with Frontier is that not one employee I spoke with is helpful in anyway. I opened a credit card with Frontier for the mileage program, and the company will not allow me to book a flight with these miles. I called on Monday, they say to call back because their system is down. I call Tuesday, same answer. On Wednesday I give one representative my information and spend over an hour and a half on the phone waiting to be transferred to the person who can help me. After waiting for that long the same guy picks up and says there is nothing he can do the system is down. So I ask to speak to his manager. He then puts me on hold for another 30 minutes and gives me to some guy who was not his manager and just said they couldn't do anything. So I asked to speak to an actual manager and they hung up the call. This company is poorly run to say the least. Have people who are passionate about your company who can help with issues, not just foreigners reading scripts who have absolutely no idea what to do.

### "my refund was denied"
Not Verified |  I did not fly on the flight because my 9 year old daughter (also a passenger) tested positive for Covid-19 on a home testing kit administered an hour before we had to leave for the airport. I gave her 3 tests to make sure the result was accurate. We were scheduled to fly on an overnight flight from Las Vegas to RDU. I called Frontier and told the agent the circumstances and he told me that he would cancel the flight and that I would get a refund if I could provide a positive lab administered PCR test the next day. I submitted the positive PCR test, but my refund was denied. I have appealed that decision and the refund was once again denied. I asked the agent what I should have done, and the agent inferred I should have flown because I did not have a PCR test. Frontier in effect encourages passengers to fly with Covid-19 and yet does not require that passengers wear masks! I feel like I am being punished (to the tune of nearly $600 for being responsible in my concern for the safety of other passengers!

### "Unfriendly flight attendants"
Not Verified | Ontario to Boston via Orlando. Tiny, cramped seats that did not recline. Tiny tray table. Unfriendly flight attendants. Exorbitant prices for counter check-in and baggage fee. I did not receive an email with a check-in link prior to the flight. There were no check-in kiosks either which would reduce the fees and streamline check-in. I can only conclude that this negligence was purposeful so that you are forced to pay the additional fees: 25.00 just to check in! and an additional 79.00 for the bag. They punish you for not checking in online but they did not send a check-in email. Also, there was no food offered on the 5-hour flight. Will not fly Frontier again.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Will never fly Frontier again. The worst customer service and rudest people I’ve ever dealt with when I’ve flown. During a “system maintenance” their entire site was down and tickets couldn’t be accessed. I had my ticket and was at the airport an hour and a half in advance and yet because of the maintenance, they had a line wrapped around the airport as people had to wait to get their tickets printed. They didn’t care about urgency. They didn’t care that I was going to miss my flight. I tried explaining and they just rolled their eyes at me.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
When i tried to check in for my flight online the day before the flight, it gave me a notification saying ‘It is the country rule that you have to check in at the airport with a flight agent’. We were returning home to Denver after our vacation. When I got to Cancun airport 3 hours before my flight, I was told at the frontier counter that my 6 month old baby that was flying with me was not checked in. I had email confirmation that the baby was added as lap infant and i even presented the email sent to me by Frontier airlines, but staff who was at the counter was very rude, she barely knew what she was doing and charged me for the baby plus assistance fee for me and my husband. She refused to listen to any of our comments and said if we refused to pay right away, we had to go behind the line which had at least over 200 people. She charged us $60 that we did not have to pay in the first place. Lap infant is free but I am disappointed that I was charged for the baby who was already on my ticket plus she charged me and husband assistance fee because we stood at her counter to resolve the baby’s ticket issue. Never flying Frontier again and would not recommend it to others either.

### "We had a 15 hour flight delay"
We had a 15 hour flight delay. The flight was to leave the airport at 10:45am and we did not leave until around 3. We were to be to Disney the following morning. The employees were extremely unprofessional and to top it off we each got a $10 voucher to eat during a 15 hour flight delay. TEN DOLLARS! The water is $5 alone in an airport. Children were missing birthdays and Disney as well. The pilot walks by us and says he's going to sleep first then we can fly. The police were called because of this issue, and when the police arrived to the scene it was the Frontier employees that were being so unprofessional that the police left and told the employees to figure it out for themselves. There were 10 different excuses for the delay as well. There was no definitive answer as to when the flight would come. Every hour it would change so we couldn't even leave to spend the day outside of the airport. I had my own five year old with me and many other kids the same age. They behaved better than the employees. It was the most unprofessional setting I have ever witnessed. Pathetic airline.

### "they can’t communicate with their customers"
We had an early morning flight and arrived to our assigned gates to see a ghost town. Upon verifying the gate, we discovered it was changed from D gates to E gates in LAS, causing us to have to haul ass to get to our gate on time. There was zero communication about this change from Frontier via email or via their app. In this day & age, most people are not visiting ticket counters, so this is not only an oversight on Frontiers last, but it’s also hugely embarrassing that they can’t communicate with their customers.

### "baggage is not included"
Horrible airline. They nickel and dime you for everything. Purchased 2 tickets at 1400 and baggage is not included, never again. The seats were the most uncomfortable, they do not recline, worst experience ever.

### "one of the worst airlines to fly"
My family and I have been flying Frontier since 2012 and by now it is know as one of the worst airlines to fly. Frontier has now made it a primary priority of cutting corners and hiking prices while decreasing quality of service. I always travel with a backpack as my personal item and the first time, most recently, I tried to slide it into the bin it didn't fit and the Frontier employee said, "Sorry, you will have to step out of the line and pay for the bag. I then turn it at a different angle and slide it in so that it does fit but the Frontier employee had already made up her mind that I will be paying an extra $100 no questions asked. When i asked an Frontier employee about this they just shook their head and said, "I'm just doing my job, and these are the regulations for flying on Frontier, i don't make the rule. As a fellow business owner, a business should never treat it's customers like this in no way, shape, or form. I will never be flying Frontier any time soon in the future and I recommend to others that they avoid this airline at all costs because no matter what you pay for the ticket in the beginning there is always a hidden cost at the end and Frontier does their best to keep that motto their public standard.

### "I was told to go back into the line"
The trick is to just get into Zone 1 to avoid paying for the bags. When they asked for Zone 2-3 I scanned my ticket to get inside, the attendant stopped me and about ~40% of the passengers to check for the bag size. Okay, who carries only a purse to travel? Not many. Of course many of us were flagged and had to pay $90. My bag was really close to fitting inside the tiny dimension so I pushed in the corners and the attendant says “ma’am, you’re not allowed to push inside. It doesn’t fit. You need to pay $90”. They were looking for the bag to slide inside by itself via gravity, which is ridiculous. I tried a few more times and she then told me to stop holding the line. I then consolidated and  my backpack slid inside by itself. I was told to go back into the line and when I scanned the second time, the attendant flagged me again  and said that backpack looked too big to be a carry on - he asked the other attendant who saw my bag going in said “she’s okay” multiple times but this attendant didn’t believe it. I had to go through it one more time- which was utterly disgusting that they really wanted me to pay that badly. I showed it again to both attendants and it was fine. Please avoid this airline as they prioritize ripping off $90/bag and losing customers (many were pretty upset about this whole bag situation- someone even said “I’m not riding this airline anymore”). Frontier needs to less enforce this or the airline goes down with a lot less customers.

### "Do not use unless necessary"
Not Verified |  They are the cheapest flights for a reason. Do not use unless necessary, you have to pay for water. I have used just about every airline service and this is by far the worst. Carry-on bags cost money and if your personal item is too large they make you pay for it.

### "knew I would have terrible service"
Not Verified | I knew I would have terrible in flight service, but that's what I paid for. Was not expecting to have lost luggage considering I had a 2.5 hr lay-over in Denver. Luggage was missing and they had no idea where it was, come back in 2 hr when the next flight from Denver arrives, and by the way we will not deliver you luggage if it does eventually arrive since your final destination 2 hrs away.

### "Frontier is arm wrestling with Spirit to become the worst airline"
Not Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight on Frontier to RSW, didn't pay for seats. Flight is relatively empty. They put my wife in a window seat, and me in the window seat immediately behind her even though the middle seat beside her is unoccupied. What airline does that? Seems like Frontier is arm wrestling with Spirit to become the worst airline in the industry.

### "The customer service is horrible"
When I booked my flight it cost $100.00 and I redeemed miles but did not know there was a $75.00 redemption fee. I contacted customer service to ask if I could pay for the $100.00 flight cost and get my miles back to use another time. The customer service cancelled my flight in error and disconnected the call. Then, I received an email flight cancellation and a $75 cancellation fee! I was supposed to fly out the next day. I called customer service back to explain what happened and asked that they correct the error. After being on the phone for 2 hours, I was told that I would receive a call back in 48 hours. I explained that my flight was in 24 hours and I can't get on the flight since the representative mistakenly cancelled it. I was told that I just had to wait until they could review the recording of the call and it will take up to 48 hours. They would not expedite the issue even though they knew that I was supposed to get on the flight in less than 24 hours. I asked if they could escalate the error to a manager and was told no. They said they need to review the recording of the phone call and it will take 48 hours and that's all they can do. The customer service is horrible. They just don't care about their customers and will not take the time to help you.

### "The customer service of Frontier is insulting"
I used to be a loyal Frontier flyer. While they never provided any extras, I always found the aircrafts to be clean and on time. After my experience with Frontier today, October 2022, I will never fly Frontier again. The customer service of Frontier is insulting. Our flight was already over 30 minutes late and the gate agents had every single passenger put their backpack in the luggage check. For reference, my backpack contained two outfits and a toothbrush. If your bag did not fit, you were charged one hundred dollars, additionally, a man behind me was having technical problems with his phone and asked for his boarding pass to be printed. They charged him twenty five dollars. These charges are no way to treat passengers at all. I encourage everyone to choose another airline. While it may look more expensive when booking, if you account for all of the hidden fees of frontier, you are in fact saving money.

### "Never using them again"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Do not use. From Charlotte to Orlando I checked with them at the counter about my bag. It was considered a personal item and ok. At Orlando on the return trip I was charged $99 for the same bag. I had nothing else with me. None of the Frontier kiosks worked. The website did not work. There were a lot of upset customers. Never using them again.

### "the amount of extra fees in your ticket is ridiculous"
The app wasn’t allowing me to do a check in prior to arriving at the terminal, I had no choice but to ask for the staff's help, they charged me $75 for me and my two children. Before getting the help I showed my active duty military ID, their policy has an exemption for “Active Duty US Military with valid Common Access Card”. It doesn’t specify if dependents are not included like they do for the bags. Plus, I was able to do the check in on the way back so, I didn’t need help with boarding passes. I just needed to throw my checked bag to go on the plane, and for that, which I couldn’t do a self service because they do not have it, was charged for the service fee again. Plus, they don’t have priority boarding like most airlines, not even for people with obvious disabilities, they charge for snacks and drinks, they don’t accept cash, and the amount of extra fees in your ticket is ridiculous.

### "This airline is a trap"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline. They charge for your checked bag, your carry-on, personal item, overweight bags, and to check in. They are ridiculous prices at that. I thought Spirit Airlines were bad, no! This one is worse. Never again will I fly this airline. If you’re thinking of flying, just do it with Delta/Southwest/American. If this was the only next available flight to any of my destinations that could take me on time, I’d rather book with a different airline on a later time and date. This airline is a trap, I feel bad for the people that work there. It’s not their fault this airline is the worst. Never again will I fly with them.

### "charged me 99$ for my back pack"
Worst airline I had ever boarded. They charged me 99$ at the last minute for my back pack. Very rude service and I will try not to board this airline in future.

### "refused to give any credits back"
I had to cancel my flight and they did not answer my call I waited for 50 minutes on hold and had to hang up. I finally got through via chat 3 hours later. They refused to give any credits back. That it was after their cutoff. So they out you on hold so that you break their policy and say no. We pay the price for understaffing their company.

### "horrible experience with Frontier"
Not Verified | Had a horrible experience with Frontier. Rude workers at the gate made me pay an extra 99.00 for a carry on because they said since I pushed my personal item into the bin that it didn’t count even though it fit! I’ve flown Frontier for years and will never fly with them again. I called there customer service and said there’s nothing we can do sorry about your luck. My personal fit in there stupid bin and they had no reason making me pay $100 extra. My recommendation is fly any other carrier. These people suck.

### "The pinnacle of nickel and dime airlines"
The pinnacle of nickel and dime airlines. My first and last time I will fly with Frontier. Staff are incredibly rude. They charge you to breathe air. I will gladly pay up for better service.

### "Frontier likes to rob your wallet"
Frontier charged me $100 for a personal item that barely wouldn't fit inside their "bag size checking box". OK, I broke the rules by bringing a bag my partner had forgotten and wasn't originally intending on bringing. She assured me the bag fits under the seat (which it does) and has flown on Frontier plenty of times with no issues. Frontier proceeded to try and sell their credit card to a bunch of trapped hopeless passengers at the end of the flight. Not once. This is coming from quite introvert. Frontier likes to rob your wallet and kick you when your down. At least they do it with a smile on their face. Because that makes it all better.

### "$200 is missing out of my budget now"
Not Verified | Has anyone ever gone on a flight via Frontier Airlines with only a personal item and without getting it addressed got charged $198.00 for additional carry-on fee for both ways on a round-trips first flight? I’ve been flying the same exact flight every single month for 5 months with the same exact small back-pack. It has never been an issue before and for some reason this time they extra charged me. Which would be fine if the staff by the gate addressing it or at least we measure it. I walked through the gate as usual, no one said anything. (By the way it perfectly fits their personal item size chart). I didn’t even know I got charged until I randomly checked my bank account after landing. I called Customer Service, and got connected after a long wait with a supervisor who barely spoke any English, it was echoed like he was speaking from an empty concert hall and told me 15x this cannot be refunded because there is no comment by the charge. Comment what the airline worker was responsible to put there. I asked how can you charge me 2x if you don’t even know if I will have any baggage on the way back? After that he hung up on me. Is that normal? Is that how an airline treats their passengers? What can I do? Unfortunately, that $200 is missing out of my budget now. This was Orlando to Chicago and Chicago to Orlando round trip. It happened in Orlando on the first flight.

### "find the service and lack of compassion appalling"
Not Verified |  My daughter flew to Tampa Bay on 10/04 and and unexpected death in the family happened on 10/07, I proceeded to call the airline to reschedule the flight, how insensitive the booking agent was - not very kind, basically said they will move up the flight but will cost over $200 to switch. I just find the service and lack of compassion appalling, I have never experienced anything like this, would definitely recommend not using this airline for any needs.

### "This is the worst customer service I have received in years"
Their customer service was terrible. The canceled the flight I had booked for months after midnight when I would be leaving my house the next day. I followed the cancelation instructions for the entire flight since they had no good options (fly out at midnight and arrive early morning and miss entire day of trip). I received an email that my cancelation was being processed and to wait for a verification email which never came. I then spend over an hour on the phone during my vacation to re-do the cancelation which the representative could not understand and I kept having to explain that they canceled the flight. She then assured me it was done - but it wasn't. They were charging me for all the cancelation fees. I then spent another hour and a half on chat. I kept receiving answers that were scripted that did not solve my problem. I was repeatedly told to wait "two minutes" which was 8 minutes and then over 12. When I finally asked to speak to a supervisor I was never allowed to. I filed their complaint form and again received lots of links to their "policy" and answers to questions I wasn't asking. No one would address the poor customer service which was what my complaint was. They do not care, were unapologetic and dismissive. This is the worst customer service I have received in years - and no one cares!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Worst airline service ever. My wife’s mom had a stroke and she had to fly home early. On hold on the phone for 2 hours trying to speak with a person. Online experience was horrible. She had to buy another ticket. We were sharing a bag and it was in her name. She flew home without our bag and we tried to change name on bag to me. Would not allow so I had to pay another $79 fee to bring my bag home. Lesson learned. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. Yesterday October 7, 2021, I was traveling with my mom to San Francisco at 10:30 in the morning from Las Vegas. This people delayed our flight at first saying their were having repairs issues. They kept us there, no just me but every body including people in wheelchairs and little kids waiting for 5 hours until around 3:30 pm, they announced that the flight was not going to happen and that It was cancelled. People working there at the counter were rude and arrogant. They do not have any notion as to what customer service means. They did not care about the people who were waiting there and did not even offer a cup of water or anything. They took no responsibility what so ever instead they responded by being super rude and vicious. In the end, they send everyone to ticketing where we all need to take a train. When we got there I was with my elderly mother on a wheelchair, and this supervisor I spoke with in a rude manner asked me and my mom to stand with the rest of people a the end of the line with this long line with my mother who is 90 years old. After waiting there on the line for 1 more hour they informed me what they did not provide any hotels or food vouchers to people at all. I lost my hotel reservation in San Francisco because this airline did not take any responsibility for the service they provide. Other airlines when this happen would make available another plain to prevent situations like this. But Frontier is the worse airline I have ever experienced. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "difficult to get in touch with"
Not Verified |  This airline is extremely difficult to get in touch with. I booked a flight from Orlando to Atlanta a week and a half before October 1st. Unfortunately, there was a hurricane. I called the Frontier over and over again. No one answered. I was in the phone for an hour before anyone bothered to answer. I spoke to a supervisor and he said that I could not receive a credit or a refund because that is not their policy. He also said, you should have cancel my flight ahead of time. I let him know that he provided terrible customer service and that policy is garbage. Don't fly Frontier. Next time I have to fly, will choose Delta.

### "refused to issue a credit"
Not Verified |  Frontier clearly does not care about the Floridians impacted by Hurricane Ian. I was deployed for storm restoration and Frontier refused to issue a credit or move my date to a later time. The only resolution was to pay $99.00 each way. Which was the cost of the ticket. I am truly disgusted and will use my platform to warn other to not use Frontier.

### "changed my flight so many times"
They changed my flight so many times. They had me and my husband stuck in Denver for 2days. I have kids I made arrangements for someone to watch them til Sunday not til Tuesday. The airplane it self was nice but how they handled business is way unacceptable. They wasn’t even accommodating us in anyway. The customer service agents seem like they wasn’t even educated on the airline or even sure what to do. They never told us why they canceled the flight. For now on we going to stuck with southwest. It was our first and last time with frontier. Thanks for nothing.

### "customer service is horrible"
This is the most unprofessional experience I have ever had with an airline. The customer service is horrible. The flight delay (2hrs) caused me to miss a very important meeting and there were no accommodations from the airline. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was flat out told no! The carry on baggage coat $160 round trip!! Lesson learned not to ever fly this airline again.

### "Never use this airline"
This airline is terrible! Not worth the “savings”. My son boarded a flight in Buffalo and was told that his bag was fine for under the seat. In Denver they told him it was too big. When he tried to pay they told him he would miss his flight and to throw away his clothes! He did! I called multiple times where I was hung up on! Never use this airline! Delta, United, southwest, and JetBlue have been amazing!

### "never fly Frontier Airlines again"
We showed up to the airport and as we were checking in, our flight was canceled. We went to customer service and they said we would receive a full refund and to look for an email within the hour. We never received any email. We were forced to purchase a new flight with American Airlines that cost $360 per ticket one way. When we got to San Diego, we tried to confirm the refund as we never received anything from them. They said the flight wasn’t canceled and that we never showed up. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again! They stole from hundreds of people.

### "extremely disrespectful and rude"
This was the worst airline I have ever flown with. Everyone was extremely disrespectful and rude. As we were going through bag check i was not allowed to carry my wallet outside of my carry on and they tried to make me pay $100 for my wallet. i then put my carry on into the box, they told me that i had to pay $100 because the strap of my backpack was hanging out.

### "I was denied the refund"
I was effected by hurricane Ian we had some damage but was without power and internet also with damage to cell towers the phone service was spotty. I requested a refund do to the fact that the effects of a natural disaster made it impossible for us to travel and also neatly impossible to reach the company. I was denied the refund it was only $148. So many companies and organizations have stepped up to help people effected by the hurricane it is so sad that a company like frontier could care less about its customers. This was a natural disaster it was not the fault of it’s customers.

### "Ends up costing more than other airlines"
18 hour layover added after the fact, 1 hour "maintenance delay", 4 hour delay, 11 minute delay added after. It would be a $200 Charge to remove the layover they added after we already payed. The Layover was specifically in Las Vegas, which makes me question if they have some sort of deal with the gambling here for people on lay overs. Ends up costing more than other airlines because of their fees and sketchy tactics.

### "Worst Customer Service"
Not Verified |  Paid $911.00 round trip for both of us. First, they told no seats for us, Finally they managed 2 Emergency Exit seats after a long conversation, Second, Return flight, online check in no seats unless you pay extra. at the check in line no assistance unless you pay $25 for each. 4 different staffs crusting each other to resolve online check in issue with my phone, Finally they found the glitch. while they are having conversation in Spanish about my issue I was threatened not to board the plane because why I told them to speak in English to understand each other. Worst Customer Service I ever had in my life.

### "never travel again on this airline"
This is the worst airline I've ever flown. I had to pay $158 for two small bags. this is a real robbery. I'm sorry I'll never travel again on this airline.

### "made to pay for our carry on bag"
I’ve been flying for over 8 years and I’ve never once had this experience with Frontier. Me and my family are skaters so our carry on is our skates because we will not check them in because of past experiences and lost items. This flight was the very first time we’ve ever been made to pay for our carry on bag. Very very disappointed. It is not our fault that they over book the flights and it is not right for them. Had to pay $200 for 2 bags when we could’ve flown a different airline with nicer qualities. It’s crazy how we flew to Denver with no issues and our bags were fine. There’s even open spaces still for carry ons and they made us pay. I will never fly this airline ever again

### "I am very saddened by this experience and how I was treated"
Not Verified |  My connecting flights were canceled due to the hurricane, I called and the day of, and I spoke to a representative, and I was told that their system had not been updated and would be within one hour. I called back they refused to give me a refund I have had the worst customer service experience ever I called United Airlines, which was my connecting flight, and they immediately refunded me with no hesitation. I have heard that Frontier has very poor business, relation and customer relation good points, I am very saddened by this experience and how I was treated as a customer due to a hurricane that was out of my control.

### "attitude towards the customers is very rude"
Not Verified | Cancelled our family last night from DFW to Denver even after paying 100$ for carry on bag at the gate due to overbooking. Frontier staff and Customer service said they can't refund my trip money including 100$ bag fee. Never fly with them. Very unprofessional staff. The attitude towards the customers is very rude. The bag we bought perfectly fits in the measurement box for the free baggage. They said it should fit loosely. Such a joke! One of the Frontier staff even agreed it fits and was trying to convince other staff members but they weren't convinced and asked to pay $100.

### "worst crew and worst service"
Not Verified |  By far the worst trip I've ever taken. It was my first time flying frontier, but also my last. The staff is extremely rude. At the gate, I was asked to put my personal item in the measuring bin. It fit easily, however, the lady eyes my wallet in my hand (which slings around my shoulder) and says "this has to fit in the bin too because it's a personal item". That makes absolutely no sense and I wasn't able to fit the wallet in the bin as well - she created such a ruckus and made me rearrange my entire backpack for a wallet. This weight thing is ridiculous first of all, and having absolutely no leniency for something as small as a wallet is just absurd. It felt like they're out to make your trip as stressful as it can be. Furthermore, they gave my friend a really hard time about her baby's car seat. She paid for an extra seat for her 6-month-old, and had called and confirmed that she could put the car seat on the seat. However, they refused to let her bring it in at the gate, and made her pay an extra $70 for "extra luggage". This is the worst flight, worst crew and worst service I've ever seen. Not worth the "cheap tickets" because they charge insane amounts at the gate for stupid reasons.

### "I can't foresee flying Frontier again"
We travel with Frontier between DEN and PHX and DEN and MSN often. As carriers go, Frontier has consistently delivered a decent experience and has been more or less what you would expect from a discount airline. My now seven year old daughter loves flying Frontier because of the animals on the tail and wings. She really treasures the animal cards the flight attendants give her. Since we fly Frontier often, we make sure to only bring items that fit in the sizer and have been bringing the same bags for years. My daughter's little suitcase she brings just fits in the bin. Today, Weds, Oct 5th. as we happily boarded our 10am flight from DEN to MSN, we endured the usual bag size check. When I attempted to move the wheels of the bag so the bag could slide into the sizer, I was told that if I had to do anything to make the bag fit in the bin that we would have to stop boarding and pay a $99 carry on fee to bring the bag with us. I told the gate attendant (who I later learned was the manager) that I did not have $100 to spend and that we needed to get to WI so my daughter could see her grandparents. My daughter, upon hearing this exchange, burst out crying. The manager offered no kind words and sent me to the back of another line. We waited for a short time, my daughter sobbing as I tried to comfort her. When we got up to the front, the gate agent informed us we needed to pay $99 to board the flight with my daughter's bag. I let her know that the bag did fit and that it was the same bag we always brought when we flew Frontier. She offered no empathy and when asked to get the manager simply pointed at the gate agent that had sent us to her in the first place. When I insisted I talk to him she ignored me, told me to move, and began serving other customers to one side of my daughter and I when I refused and requested to speak to her manager again. After this, my daughter and I, both crying and feeling humiliated, stood to the side as several of our fellow passengers offered to pay the $99 so we could board the plane. I moved my daughter's belongings from her suitcase to a souvenir bag we bought at the nearest store and tried to comfort her while telling her we needed to throw away her suitcase (blue with rainbows, bought when she was three and one of her favorite things) so we could board the plane. Just as I was about to leave the suitcase to board the plane, crying in earnest, completely embarrassed, with my daughter sobbing, the gate agent called us back over and let us know that her manager had elected to pay for our carry on himself. I apologized for being short with her earlier and she swiped a card (presumably the manager's) and payed for my daughter's suitcase as a carry on. The manager scanned our boarding passes, saying nothing about what had happened, and we boarded the plane. After this experience, I can't foresee flying Frontier again. Yeah, it turned out okay in the end, but the best thing about it was the care my fellow passengers showed to a mama and her crying child. I'd prefer my money go to pretty much any other airline or mode of transport. It's also really disappointing that Frontier puts its front line employees in the position they do. I don't want to support that either. Next time you want to pay to endure humiliation, sit in a tiny seat, pay a premium for luggage and be spoken to in a condescending manner by gate staff, fly Frontier!

### "they take advantage of people"
They changed my flight, which extended my trip 2 extra days forcing me to spend 12 hours in Vegas airport, and 9 hours in Denver airport. Once I finally was able to board my last flight (out of 4) they didn’t have enough people on the flight and started charging for carry on bags. Luckily, I flew with them before and haven’t been charged for my small backpack my last 3 flights so I didn’t have to pay. They made me pay $100 to take a small backpack on that for the last 4 flights I had I was able to put it under the seat. This airline is disgusting. They know nothing about good customer service, they take advantage of people.

### "most unprofessional and rude"
Not Verified |  I had one of the worst experiences riding with Frontier Airlines the morning of September 30th, leaving from gate D1A. My flight originally was supposed to board around 7:12am and didn’t board until a little after 12 pm, so it was over a four hour wait to begin with. However the rude experience happened as the other customers and myself began to board. The supervisor in charge asked passengers to check the size of their bag, I had no problem checking my bag as my bag was under the requirement size. Went Back to the supervisor who was busy checking ppl in and told her it fit, she then rudely told me to go back and call her to check which I did. However I now had to wait as others were ahead of me. Before I was finished checking once again she began telling me that I took too long and she’s closing the door. I began asking her why she was closing the door on me after a four hour wait and after waiting online to check my bag size. I began to cry letting her know I’m traveling to a funeral. She leaves towards the plane shuts the door. Comes back and tells me to come. As we are walking to the plane she says I was going to let you fly but just had to make you sweat. She was the most unprofessional and rude person I have ever encountered traveling. I will try my best to never take frontier after that experience.

### "Frontier refuses to honor the chat"
I booked a flight home to see my family for the first time in years. I'd made it through the entire pandemic unscathed - naturally, the day of my flight I started to feel pretty sick. Out of an abundance of caution, I took an at home COVID test and popped for positive; my flight was only a few hours later, so I quickly got in touch w/ Frontier to see what they recommended. The person with whom I chatted told me that I needed an 'official' positive test from a clinic/doctors office - at home test would not be submitted. He also specified that it needed to be within 4 days prior to the flight. Obviously, as there was hours remaining, I continued to press in the chat that I had no problem getting the test, but that it would clearly not be from 4 days before. Me - "If I am able to schedule for today, is that sufficient? Frontier - "If you're unable to make your flight today, you can still submit medical documentation. Me - "I will definitely not be on the flight today, for the safety of the crew and other passengers. What is the correct course of action from your end - should I simply not show up? Or is there something that must be done from your end? Frontier - "The option here is to cancel the flight and you can submit a positive result of covid from testing facility, doctor's office, or clinic. The first available test was the following morning - as requested, I went, test, showed positive, and submitted. Frontier refuses to honor the chat. They also are totally unwilling to entertain the idea that it was not possible to set up a same-day, in-clinic COVID test at 3PM. Their email back. Dear xxxxx, Thank you for taking the time to write to us. I am sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the resolution that was offered. It is never our intention to be insensitive to our customer’s opinions regarding their experience with Frontier Airlines. The airline has guidelines and policies in place to help ensure that all passengers are handled in a consistent manner for most situations that are encountered. While reviewing the message you forwarded, it shows that the chat agent already informed you that all documentation provided will be subject for approval. Jude also stated that we are requiring a testing documentation from a medical provider within 4 days prior to travel. And that at-home test will not accepted. However, the testing documentation you provided was outside the 4 days prior to travel that we require as per policy. We must respectfully inform you that we are unable to grant an exception to policy. We appreciate the feedback you have provided. Thanks, Reservations Specialist Frontier Airlines" Will never fly with these people again.

### "flight got delayed twice to finally get canceled"
Not Verified |  My family and I was supposed to leave on 10/04/22 at 8.50pm, flight got delayed twice to finally get canceled, airline did nothing to help us out, we waited at the airport until next morning at 5.45 am to flight to Orlando, to again be stuck there the flight has been delayed three times and still waiting. The airline’s staff are rude, we are tired, sleepy and hungry, now they’re saying maybe in an hour, in the meantime we had reservations for a hotel and a car that I already paid for, and nobody is willing to pay our loss.

### "boarding staff were the worst you can get"
Not Verified | Washington to San Francisco via Denver. Worst travel experience ever. The airlines intentionally let you any personal items that fit underneath the seat but will force you pay 100$ per item on your connecting flight. It’s all a big scam. The boarding staff were the worst you can get.

### "flight attendants great, but airline is horrible"
Not Verified | The flight attendants did a great job, but this airline is horrible. I’ve given this airline 3x chances every time flight had been delayed 2+ hours idk why?? And on top of that we had to remain waiting when we have finally arrived to the destination because the gate is unavailable? Somebody really needs to buy this airline out and improve it.

### "The staff are rude"
San Antonio to Chicago. This was the most horrible airline I have ever had to endure. The staff are rude they try to police you in regards to your personal items they’re inconsistent and they charge for everything, they even try to charge you for an empty seat. Whatever you do, do not fly with this airline you’ll be sorry.

### "This whole airline is a inconsistent sloppy scam"
First time flying Frontier and will absolutely be my last time, went through security once and everything was fine then had two delays and had to get a new flight because I’d miss my connection and there were no workers at the main assist area. Went through security again and they want to take toiletries that are sealed, like I didn’t just go through security 1 hour ago. Didn’t update me on the delay until about 30 minutes prior, charged me almost 70$ for a carry on. This whole airline is a inconsistent sloppy scam. Will never fly again, avoid at all costs.

### "offered bottled water for $4"
On our initial approach to Denver we had to divert to Durango for fuel. Sat in Durango for close to 2 hours then once we were finally back in the air Frontier offered bottled water for $4. All the greed will come back and shut this brand down one day.

### "Flight attendant quickly stated those seats cost more money"
Plane completed boarding. The exit row was vacant. I asked if I could move to one of the vacant seats in the exit row. Flight attendant quickly stated those seats cost more money. I said I thought you usually allowed people to move to the vacant seats to help in the case of an emergency. Flight attendant said, I do but I’m choosing who will move there. She left the seats open.

### "Thank you Frontier for ruining our Anniversary vacation!"
Not Verified |  We went out to dinner in Philly Friday night for our Anniversary. Then we stayed the night at a hotel by the airport. Our flight on Frontier was at 7.15am. We’re waiting for the shuttle to the airport and my wife shows me an email from Frontier saying the flight was cancelled. So we went ahead to the airport thinking they could get us on a later flight. They told us the next flight to Punta Cana was next Saturday! What? And they couldn’t help us connect to on another airline. Totally unhelpful and acted like they literally couldn’t care less about us. So we went back to the hotel and thankfully they let us back in our room since it was still only 6am. We started making phone calls to the airline and the travel agent. Frontier again had nothing. Travel agent said they could get us on a Flight on Tuesday. That would basically cut our vacation in half. So we decided to just cancel everything and reschedule. Thank you Frontier for ruining our Anniversary vacation! You have lost a customer for life and I will tell everyone I know about my experience. I seriously hope you go out of business.

### "Worst service ever"
Worst service ever. 6am flight cancelled at 3am. Was told by customer service I needed to go to the airport to be compensated. Uber to airport to be told flight was cancelled due to weather (it’s 71 in Seattle) and therefore not frontiers fault. When asked again supervisor arrives and says it was actually due to their pilot. Only flight can get me on is the following evening which puts me through Cincinnati arriving home Tuesday. Motel voucher and single airport food voucher. Refused to do anything since that was not a viable solution. Refunded purchase price tickets and that was all. Absolutely horrible service that cost us so much more money (flights out today are $600 per person) Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Horrible company. Stay clear

### "40 minutes late getting on board"
Not Verified | Orlando to Indianapolis. This is my first time flying with the company and it will absolutely be my last time. I paid $62 for a carry on bag. The airline stated they didn’t show it had been paid for even though I got an email verifying the purchase. I still had to pay an additional $62 for 1 carry on. In addition the plan arrived on time. However, due the staff congregating and socializing we were 40 minutes late getting on board. You get what you pay for never again

### "Try to avoid this airline"
Not Verified | San Antonio to Las Vegas. Try to avoid this airline at all cost. They appear inexpensive, but they have hidden fees. The cost will be more than flying with a more expensive airline. They charge for bags each way, and you cannot print a boarding pass at the airport without paying a fee of $25.00. You are also paying for seating both ways separately. Like I said hidden fees! They are not cheap, they are more and they don’t even offer you a free snack or drink. There is no Wi-Fi to use on the flight and the seats don’t recline.

### "not be flying with them again"
So glad Frontier Airlines wanted to make sure every single passenger's bags fit the dimensions before boarding. Nothing like delaying a flight for that. If they are that concerned maybe they need a process for while the plane is unloading or force the check in to be in person to do that so the flight wouldn't be late. Staff is very rude off and on the plane. I will not be flying with them again!

### "said I had to pay for the personal bag"
I travelled from Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas on 9/22/2022 with one small personal bag. I was not charged by the airline on my initial trip, because it was one personal bag. On my return to Raleigh Durham on 9/25/2022 the attendant said I had to pay for the personal bag. I alerted her that I had travelled with the same bag and was not charged on the initial trip. She was rude, belligerent, threatening me in the presence of other passengers that I would not board the flight. Insisting I had to pay $99 for a small bag. I was embarrassed and told her multiple times that she did not have to be rude and could handle this in a civil manner. She continued to be rude and belligerent. Worst experience. Moreover the flight is uncomfortable, the attendants are rude, the plane was dirty with several alcohol bottles under my seat. I made the attendants aware of the alcohol bottles, and they said "We don't know anything about that we came on the flight at the same time you did. Worst experience. I will never fly frontier and I advise you not to.

### "not recommend Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified | My daughter and I each purchased 5 tickets each to Orlando and 5 return tickets back to Detroit Michigan. We scheduled our return flight for 9 am in August but about a month before we were scheduled to leave we both got an email that the 9am flight was cancelled and only a 6am flight was available on that day which was our return date. We tried to get our money returned so we could get another flight with another airline but Frontier would not return our cash, they only wanted to provide a credit for future flights. This was awful we were traveling with 7 children and 4 were under the age of four. We fought for the return of out money but Frontier refused. Having no other monies for another flight we were forced to take this 6am flight. We and many other travels were held up at TSA and at least 30 of us missed this flight and were stranded in Florida. the next flight out from Frontier wasn't until the next day at 9pm. Frontier didn't offer a free night stay anywhere (as stated in Consumer Affairs) the only thing the offered to us were 60% of the cost of our flight for a future flight period. We ended up driving back to Detroit and spending 600.00 for that experience. I would not recommend Frontier Airlines to my enemy!

### "the worst airline ever"
By far the worst airline ever. They lost my luggage for a total of 5 days and I had to come out of pocket to but clothes, deodorant, toothpaste, etc and was told that I would be reimbursed up to $100 per day and I have yet to receive my reimbursement 6 months later. Every time I call, they tell me it has been escalated and someone will contact me by email. I literally call them 2-3 times per month and I have not gotten any where. Why pay for luggage if I’ll have to purchase everything again ?

### "no satisfaction from a very rude rep"
Not Verified | The worst airline ever. They lost my luggage from Charlotte to Denver and for 5 hours straight I got no satisfaction from Frontier. I called many, many phone numbers, did online Chats, spent an hour at the Frontier airport desk and got no satisfaction from a very rude rep. I still do not know where my luggage is and I am here for my son's wedding. Thank you Frontier! Will never fly with them again.

### "I am basically out $2500"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my upcoming flight for a vacation. rescheduled me to leave at 2:45 pm to Las Vegas where my scheduled connecting flight was now at 8:45 am, on same day. Told customer service if a I could time travel, I would not an airplane ticket. Once they saw their error, they weren't sure how to fix it so gave me a refund. Now I had to book a new flight with short notice and spend an extra $1000. If this wasn't bad enough, last year they cancelled my return flight from Mexico 1 week before was supposed to fly. Just cancelled it, refunded me and offered no other options for flights. That time it cost me $1500 to get new ticket. I am basically out $2500 with this airlines. Don't ever fly with them if you have plans that can't be changed at last minute. I would give them negative stars if I could.

### "worst flight and customer service I have had"
This is the single worst flight and customer service experience I have ever had. It took me longer to get from San Francisco to Atlanta than it did for me to get from New Zealand to San Francisco. We showed up 3.5 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart, only to be told that the flight had been delayed. It was then further delayed. Our 11pm flight was delayed to 3am. So we went to sleep in the airport. When we showed up to check in before our flight, we were told that TSA had just closed and so although our flight was there waiting for us, we (along with about 15 others) were stranded on the wrong side of the airport and couldn't get through. We were then moved to a 6am flight, which had a couple of hours layover in Denver CO, even though we had originally booked a direct flight. Once we got on the plane in Denver, there were mechanical issues and we had to wait on the runway for an extra hour. All they offered us this entire time was a glass of water on that flight. After the flight they sent us a $50 voucher each expiring in December, which is useless to me as I don't live in the USA. When I asked if they could give us food vouchers at the airport, they said no I would need to email customer service, and when I emailed customer service they said no those at the airport will need to sort that out for you - I don't know who is lying but something doesn't line up. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "will never fly with you again"
My flight was 2 hours delayed because they “accidentally” put gas in the plane twice and overfilled it. I’ve flown at least 200 times (many times with a frontier, and I have never heard of such a preventable issue in my life) If I could give negative stars, I would. I woke up at 4am to board at 7am to wait for 2 hours without any compensation or reassurance. I used to count on you, but will never fly with you again, I would literally pay double to have a good experience and on time flight instead of what I experienced.

### "charged me $89 for my small backpack"
I am not one to complain or write reviews, but this one needs it. Frontier is known to have cheaper flights, but then charge you for every add on. I knew this booking my flight and was fine with it. I was traveling by myself and knew I wouldn't need any add-ons. Bringing a small backpack, that was less than 18"x14"x8", no problem. My wife flew the exact same flight the previous weekend, same backpack, no issues. When I went to board the flight in Harrisburg back home to Denver, they charged me $89 at the gate for my small backpack. I even emailed the airlines with dimensions and pictures of the backpack after the flight and they wanted nothing to do with it. Do not advertise you can bring on a small hand bag with specified dimensions, if you, the airline, aren't going to comply with the rules. Way to go nickeling and diming anyone who flies by you. So, my now affordable flight, became the same cost as any other airline that offers a free check in. Not worth the hassle of trying to guess if you're going to get up-charged depending on the staff working that day. For goodness sakes, just say, pay for any luggage, that way I could have paid ahead and known it wasn't any savings from Delta, United, American, Southwest or any of the other reputable airlines. Way to go, making a dime off of your customers, Frontier.

### "luggage has been missing August 28"
Not Verified |  Our luggage has been missing August 28. When we were in Dallas our flight was delayed due to weather, but then it was canceled we spent two hours on the runaway after they decided that they were going to cancel the flight. We literally saw them taking all the bags off the plane in Dallas. When we got off the plane there was nowhere to get our bags because it was really late in the evening. We filed a claim and staff said she guaranteed she would find our bag. She had us fill out a claim form and guarantee that she was route for us but never did. The next day I filed a claim online. We did not ask for reimbursement of our hotel nor our clothes that we had to buy. We did not get to leave until two days later because of weather. During this time we filed another claim with a manager at the airport who once again said that not finding baggage is not in there vocabulary and it was never filed. We decided to put our computer in my medication bags because Frontier charges so much for checking bags or carry-ons and we figured it was a straight through flight. He was to say that didn’t work out. We filed several other claims online filled out everything that was lost. No one responded to us or reached out to us until about two weeks ago. A manager from the San Diego airport which was our final destination Called is said that they had one of our bags. At this point it was a month approximately since we didn’t have our bags. They would not deliver it to me at my house I had to go pick it up because he wanted me to make sure to look in it to see what was missing. The manager at frontier baggage and San Diego told me well maybe your medication is in the other bag remember you flipped out and you said more things were gone. I said yes I understand but I know for a fact that my medications were in this bag. She kept on telling me they probably weren’t there in the other bag that they still can’t find. They couldn’t track our bags at all. I was told that I need to call Dallas frontier baggage and try to find my baggage myself while they try to do it as well. I do not feel like that is my responsibility this is absolutely ridiculous the time that We’ve been having to wait. Nobody has reached out to us to ask if we would like to be compensated for our baggage. We do you want to be compensated but nobody’s offered even if we were still compensated we need that computer because it has all of our information for our business. Staff at frontier baggage and San Diego told me the day I picked up my luggage that she would be getting in contact with me she never did so I called back another person and they said that they still haven’t found my bag.

### "It is not worth it for the price"
Not Verified |  Lost over 50 bags of luggage. I have flown with them 3 times now and not once have they left on time. Each time we board almost an hour late, the last flight we sat in the plane for an hour and 25 mins while they tried to find the missing luggage. It is not worth it for the price. Just pay the extra 100 for a different airline that actually treats you well and can get you placed on time.

### "has the worst customer service"
Denver to Atlanta. This company has the worst customer service in the airline business. I will not ever fly with this group of unprofessional individuals again. The worst of worst!

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience with this airlines. Hidden fees, 2 hours over the phone with no resolution. I will never fly this airline again. I also would not recommend this to family or friends.

### "They always find a way to get you!"
I used to think it was worth it for the budget prices, until they made the tray tables smaller than an iPad and up charged us $248 for personal items we had measured in advance. Not worth it. You won’t end up saving $ in the long run. They always find a way to get you! Goodbye Frontier. I’ll be on another airline next time.

### "never fly with Frontier Airlines again"
I was on my way back from Phoenix to Chicago. Other than my flight from Chicago to PHX, which was with American Airlines, I was able to get my ticket at the machines, but in Phoenix, the Airline Frontier did not offer this function, nor was it possible to check in online in advance. I had to wait in a long line, and we all did not see any progress for over 45 minutes. We saw the reason for that was the lady at the kiosk happily involved in a loud conversation with two women about private contents. When it was finally my turn, she told me that it was too late for me, she was not able to print out my ticket. She forwarded me to her supervisor, who understood the situation and she did everything in her power to get me on the flight. She made it happen to print out the ticket after trying it with different devices - then she ran to the gate to wait for me and instructed me to be fast! I ran and, in the crowd, I saw her waiving, and she guided me quickly to the gate. I only had to pass the ticket through the control but then I was told “We are overbooked”. And I missed the flight so to speak twice. The supervisor felt so sorry (she was lovely by the way) and she tried to find another flight with another airline, as Frontier would only offer a flight 2 days later. I flew that day over Kansas City with SW Airlines and it had been a long, long inconvenient day for me. Frontier made it super complicated to get in touch with them afterward, but I found a way after intense researches. Emails went back and forth and they kept on telling me that my documents were not complete or they said it has to be a pdf and nor a jpg, once it was a pdf, they said it has to be bundled, trying to play with customers patience. I just had the feeling they are not even really reading my case. I gave everything what they wanted, but the final answer was just, that they do not refund me, not for the ticket I bought at Frontier, nor for the ticket I was forced to buy at SW Airlines. I would give Miss E, the supervisor in Phoenix 5 stars, but she is clearly working in the wrong company. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again, and I think this is a bigger loss for Frontier, than refunding me the $500, which they owe me.

### "the worst experience traveling"
Not Verified |  This was the worst experience traveling. The flight was delayed from Montego Bay to Orlando and the customer service at MBJ was poor. When arrived in Orlando had to stay on board for about hour after plane landed with no explanation, hence connecting flight was missed. My 2 yr old and 11 yr old grandkids were tired and hungry and were not accommodated for. We had to stay hungry the night from 9 pm until the next day. We had to sleep on the dirty airport floor with all kinds of diseases going around. Customer service was the worst. Lady argued with me. 1st time traveling and not even a small chips or anything to sip. Next flight wasn’t available until the following night 8 pm so we were there 24hours. No shower, no food and no bed. My 2 yr old and 11 yr old were crying. Nobody apologized. At 8pm the flight was delayed again until 9 pm. I was very stressed, even my blood pressure went up. When we checked in we had to pay for the 3 checked bags and 1 carry on which were already paid for in the beginning. When my daughter called the airline they promised I would be refunded within 7 to 15 business days. After 15 days when I called they said they’re sorry but it was cancelled so the bags were paid for twice. I have travelled with 4 other airlines and never had the experience. This was the first and definitely last with Frontier.

### "Poor customer service"
Frontier lied to me and refused to refund me for a less than $100 ticket. All of my friends flew Spirit while I flew Frontier. They had no issues but here I am disgruntled. Upon reaching the gate and waiting to board, shortly before boarding, the reservation agent made an announcement that the flight was full so she had 12 free tickets for the first 12 customers to get in line who were willing to sit in the emergency row. I was one of the 12 and she printed me (and the other 11) a new boarding pass which I used for the flight. Despite calling, chatting, using the feedback form, and filing a formal complaint, Frontier has refused to refund me for the flight I paid for as if anyone would scam a $78 flight when my return trip cost double and I provided both boarding passes. Do not trust anything that they say. Poor customer service and deceit. It is the principal of the matter. I am a public school educator. I have no reason to scam an airline for a $78 flight when I have proof of my claim. I have lost all faith in their integrity.

### "I’d recommend them if you are trying to save money"
We flew Frontier to from SNA to CLE to visit Ohio for my cousins wedding. I was with my Dad. I am a college student with a tight schedule. We connected in Las Vegas, and waited 4 hours for a connection. (We would have flown Spirit to CLE via LAS) but by the time I knew my school schedule Spirit’s price has drastically increased, so we settled with Frontier for a better price). We knew that going in so that was an inconvenience for us, but that was the airlines schedule, so they are not at fault here. They were nice and the flights were smooth. We did not purchase a seat for the flight from SNA TO LAS leg and they put us in row 8D and 8E. Contrary to what others say, they put us is in row 8 and kept us together. We got to our destination safety, so it was a good experience. I’d recommend them if you are trying to save money and know what you are getting into in advance. The only thing with Frontier is if you try to call them, they’ll ask questions and lead to the conclusion of visiting their website, then they hang up. No one ever answered. If you do manage to talk, the hold music is extremely annoying. Other than that, flight was nice, clean plane, and that’s that! Both flights were on time, with the second leg arriving pretty early! We lucked out with me being a student in college on a tight schedule and flying an ULCC!

### "Worst airline ever!"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! Our trip was canceled with absolutely no notice. They even charged us an additional $276 when we checked in the day before our flight for carry-on bags and seat selections, which is ridiculous by itself. We show up to the airport only to be casually told our flight doesn't exist anymore. Over $1200 spent on tickets only to be told they can only refund our money in a week or two. We booked this trip a year ago and lost all of our hotel reservation money..etc because they ever bothered to tell us they canceled our flight. They truly did not care and did absolutely nothing to help us get a flight to our destination. If you want to go somewhere, choose a different airline than Frontier.

### "could not bring a small carry on"
Not Verified | Orlando to La Guardia. The worst airline, could not bring a small carry on without purchasing it. My personal purse is the only thing I could bring. I already purchased the ticket and now have to pay for a carry on! Highway robbery!

### "Never will I ever book with Frontier again"
Not Verified | An “act of god” preventing 5 of us from flying Atlanta to Antigua. This flight was booked in July for August. This was going to be our first flight of many with frontier to Antigua for business. My mother died. I was one of her caretakers. We could not leave with her being hospitalized. She died the day we were suppose to travel. They offered us a full credit which must be booked in 90 days. Frontier is now not flying from Atlanta to Antigua the rest of this year or next year. They refuse to extend this credit offer. It is completely unacceptable to not extend or offer us a full refund. I provided doctor letter then death certificate and still denying everything we ask. Customer service will never transfer us to a manager and continue to tell us to email which we are doing and get the same answer every time. Never will I ever book with Frontier again. This deserves exposure.

### "absolutely the worst experience"
Orlando to New York. On 9/22/2022 my friends and I were getting ready to head to the airport. Due to weather conditions our flight was canceled. We decided to call Frontier to reschedule our flight for January, they insisted on charging us $100 fee per person. My friends and I lasted over 2 hours waiting to speak to someone and received almost zero assistance. We thought the process would have been easier since we purchased insurance for our flights. Due to the cancellation and the horrible service provided by Frontier, I spent my birthday being on the phone with customer care trying to find a resolution and at the very least, empathy. The customer service representative never provided their name and would repeatedly hang the phone the moment we tried to explain why we wanted to cancel/reschedule. This was absolutely the worst experience I’ve had with an airline and I certainly would not recommend anyone book with a flight with Frontier. Save your time and money.

### "Worse Customer Service"
Flight was delayed 3.5 hours taking off from TPA. Gate agent made announcement that Planning Group for Frontier had made arrangements for all connection flights to be made. Once arrived in Denver, missed connection flight to MSO. Frontier customer service said we would be put on next flight out, which was 3 days later. No effort was made to get us on another airline, no effort was made for food, hotel. Customer service just stated "couldn't help us with that". Had to purchase another ticket on another airline. Frontier said they would refund us $200/ticket (2 tickets were purchased), yet we only received $178 refund. Customer service thru their website said they couldn't do anything about that, we would have to work it out with Customer Service in Denver, yet they could not give us a phone number to talk to them. Our flight was at 7:30 am from TPA, once we were all loaded up they discovered a maintenance issue. They deplaned us, and moved us to another gate. After a short wait another plane pulled up, but no passengers got off of plane. Passengers joked "They pulled it out of Maintenance". We boarded the new plane, and before take off pilot made an announcement "Plane was in for Maintenance, and the Maintenance had not been done". We deplaned again. After Maintenance was complete, we boarded again. We understand Maintenance issues happen, but to not help their passengers that are affected by their delays is not acceptable. Worse Customer Service I have ever worked with! !

### "a $79 bag check fee"
Lines were long, bag limit size has decreased, and customer service is rude. Recommend flying anything other than this airline. The low flight costs, are countered with a $79 bag check fee. Can’t say enough negative things about this airline and regret every stepping aboard one of their planes.

### "they do not honor their policy"
Not Verified |  I purchased a cancellation protection on this flight and the airline is not honoring it. I had to cancel during COVID; The cancelation policy said it had to be used within one year. While trying to book with my credit they are saying it has already been used, which is completely false. I do not recommend using this airline because they do not honor their policy.

### "Customer service was deplorable"
Outbound flight was fine. Hard seats and all, but we arrived early. Return flight delayed several times, ended up 5.5 hours total. Customer service was deplorable! Wouldn't honor the meal voucher policy on their website. Some of the regular staff tried to be decent, but they were powerless to help. Supervisor, when she finally showed up, was incredibly rude! Said the policy online was incorrect. Terminal full of upset passengers!

### "We waited 8 hours"
They delayed our flight for 48minutes after 48 minutes it was pushed back another hour and so on. We waited 8 hours. For them to tell us it was canceled and our flight wouldn’t fly until the next day. The worse part is that the workers were extremely rude and unhelpful. They denied switching us to a different flight or a different airline. They also couldn’t accommodate us to stay by a near hotel. They did not care or offer solutions. We lost one night at our hotel which was payed for thanks to them. They also charge you 57 for a checked bag and 65 for a carry. I will never fly with them again.

### "still a budget carrier after all"
Had to contact customer service beforehand with a question regarding my flight. Even with my specific question and having to use their chat option, as it was after hours for their call center, my question was answered in a satisfactory and efficient manner. Checking in my luggage at ATL was painless and efficient, and the counter attendant was very helpful and courteous. The gate agent, also friendly and courteous, though the boarding process was unnecessarily, slightly confusing. The flight crew and even the pilots, friendly and upbeat. The plane itself, very clean and modern, couldn't have been any more than 3-4 years old. The seat, being within the first 3-4 rows, was remarkably spacious; more spacious than comparable comfort/premium economy sort of seats on Delta, United or American. Departed from Atlanta and arrived into San Antonio both early. I've used numerous budget airline carriers in the US over the years. Some suck (looking at you, Allegiant, Spirit and Southwest!) Others - namely Frontier - have the same business model but have provided me with a better overall experience. In fact, Frontier (at least recently) somewhat reminds me of what Southwest used to be back in the 1990s-2000s. Just don't expect WiFi or free food and drinks; this is still a budget carrier after all.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
I was flying out of Oklahoma City and tried to step out of line to pay online for a baggage fee $65 no big deal, when a supervisor stopped me and stated that “carry on would be a courtesy.” I could have paid right there. She explained for the duration on my flight because it is after all one ticket with a layover. The next airport when I was boarding in Denver the lady at the counter was so rude and stated “No girl we ain’t doing all that here! This ain’t them.” Well to the contrary, it is. It’s all one ticket and one airline, Frontier. They charged me double what I would have paid online, what I originally tried to do. This airline changes peoples location (of flight at the airport) deliberately to make a quick buck. Better listen up because the location changes constantly. I will never fly Frontier again, I should have flown with a decent airline like Delta, I paid the same price. Never again. They treat their customers like trash.

### "makes me never want to fly again"
This airline is unreliable to put it lightly. Every time I have flown with them I have had to spend the entire day at the airport because of them having delays and/or canceling my flight without communicating it. If you like spending 300+ dollars to be messed with, not knowing when you’re going to get home, and being stuck at the airport then these are your guys. Go for it. Frontier airlines makes me never want to fly again.

### "just wanted to warn you"
Too bad I can’t give zero stars to this company. I have purchased my one way ticket from this Airline, and canceled it like 30 minutes after. I did it through Travelocity because it was the platform I had used. It was a round trip ticket using two different airlines. I didn’t have any problems getting my money back from Delta, they refund my credit card right away; but Frontier didn’t because they have changed their cancellation policy back in June 2022, and in order to have the 24 hour free cancellation policy, we need to buy the tickets more than 7 days prior to the scheduled flight, So, just wanted to warn you about this company!

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever! I had a flight from Seattle to Denver with Alaska airlines and a return ticket from Denver to Seattle booked with Frontier. I missed my Flight to Denver due to the unforeseen lines at SeaTac to get through security (I waited over 2 hours ) and still wasn’t near the front of the line. I contacted Alaska and they tried to get me on another flight. Unfortunately everything was booked. Alaska gave me a credit to fly again within a year because this was out if my control. Frontier would do nothing for me. I tried canceling my return flight because I wasn’t working in Denver, explained the situation, wasn’t even asking for a refund just credit to fly at a later date. Absolutely no help. I lost all my money because they wouldn’t make any exception. Will never book with them again. And recommend no one else does either.

### "Charged $25 pp for boarding passes"
Not Verified |  Charged $25 pp for printed boarding passes. APP issues caused us not to be able to check in. Arrived to ticket counter @7:30 AM, already approximately 100 people in line due to problems with the APP, no one working behind the counter, causing further anxiety for all passengers

### "by far worst experience"
We got to airport 4 hours early They only had one person checking in international & domestic so by the time we made it up to the line and got thru TSA (clear) we had missed our flight so we had to go back down to ticket area get new ones and go back they tsa once again to sit 8 hours for flight with a lay over in Orlando to get to Cancun. Ask what gate should we be at was told watch the screen did that and it said 14 went to 14 they said no 20 we ran to 20 they said we missed the plan and next flight is Monday so we ask for tickets go back home which they only had tickets to leave out for late night, my anxiety had done kicked in had been an airport over 14 hours no shower I mentally could take sitting there another 9 hours so my husband went and got ticket from Delta who had a flight leaving out much sooner. I asked about a credit was giving a 1800# called was told take back to airport explaining to them the airport gave me the number to call. This was by far worst experience I have had with an airline and will never recommend are fly frontier again they just took my money to give me the run around. They need to shut this airline down people work hard for there money and look forward to vacation to just give it away

### "worst airline I have ever dealt with"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. I booked a flight for a family member. The cost for any type of luggage was ridiculous. The flight seemed cheaper than most so I paid for the ticket and figured my family member could just pack light and that would be ok. The day of the flight which was 3 weeks after I purchased the ticket, I call to check in and they want almost 100% more of what I paid for the ticket to get boarding passes. They said the rate increased on their end so they had to charge me more. I have flown with most of the airlines out there and I have never had this happen. Frontier are crooks and customer service was a nightmare and kept hanging up on me when I asked for a supervisor. I ended up sending my family member with a different airline company and was out my original ticket price.

### "the worst trip ever"
Not Verified |  This is the worst trip ever. First of all I need to pay 50-70% more for my bags then in any other company. I paid almost 500$ for our checked bags and carry on and they wanna charge me 50$ more for 0.5 pound extra. I don’t have any option and I give to them my card (Visa). I had enough money on my card but they have some problems and it was declined 3 times. I did not have any other card and they did not accept cash! Guy on check in window call some other guy to help and only thing he said “ We are sorry but we can’t accept your bag.” The worst company ever, unprofessional, rude and stupid employees.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I paid for check in luggage 41-50lbs rt, I got to Midway terminal and got charged an additional $50 for luggage that were at the weight limit. Coming from Arizona to Chicago I were almost charged again until I showed the lady my screenshot. From there I informed her about the overcharged going to Arizona. The lady apologized for the discrepancy and informed me to reach out to customer service for a refund of the $50. However, customer service and their corporate informed me that they weren't able to do so due to the agent at the airport didn't document it in their notes that would've been their proof, smh. It's unfair that I have to take a financial loss due to their mistake. Why should I have to pay for their mishap? This is definitely my 1 and done with this airline. I refuse to support a business who doesn't own up to their own faults. The only star they get are for the polite agents who tried their best to help me. Overall, this airline is for people who's ok with losing unnecessary money thinking they're getting a deal. Will never fly with them again.

### "Worst customer service ever"
So the leg of our flight was to go home to San Diego. We had a straight through flight. Due to severe weather our flight was canceled after sitting on the runway for two hours. Not Frontiers fault for the weather but it is their fault they lost our luggage. It’s September 13, 2022 today. We have filed six claims, five of them were online I’ve sent a letter to them for contact on the clean page to this day we had absolutely no contact with frontier employees. No one contacted us after our claim was put in. We filed a claim in Dallas With a representative gave her all our receipts for the clothes we had to buy he said they would reimbursed us well that girl never filed the claim. Today I went in and updated my claim we’ve added every single item that was in our suitcase. We had a lot of important things in there. Due to their baggage is that cost so much to carry on and check we decided since it was a straight through flight we were just put my medication‘s and computer in our suitcase so we didn’t have to pay another hundred dollars. Well our flight was canceled as I said and we saw our bags being taken off the plane. Our baggage was nowhere to be found. Everybody that helped us never got back in contact us with like they said. No one responded to my message I sent them regarding my claim online asking them what’s going on it’s been quite a long time for the bags to be missing. I will never fly frontier again ever. Today we got a call from San Diego Airport they found one of our bags. They have no clue where the other one is didn’t even know it was on the claim when it clearly states on my online claim that there’s two with two bag numbers, Their flights are cheap but then to check a bag it’s like $50 and if you go over 1 pound they charge you 70 US have to pay for your carry-on. Worst customer service ever

### "you will be disappointed"
The frontier agent at DTW was charging passengers $79-$99 charges at the gate for their personal items. Even if your personal item met the measurements on the website and was not overpacked, you were charged. My personal item was the same on the way out of Atlanta and was absolutely deemed a personal item - no problem. It was packed exactly the same and this agent in Detroit had a bad day and took it out on several of us. What are we to do, argue with her when she's on a power trip because she knows she can kick us off the flight? Called Frontier for a refund. None of the employees there have a supervisor and they do not claim their airport agents. It's an absolute sham. Despicable airline. You get nothing in flight no wifi, snacks, drinks, movies, nothing. You get miserable rude employees and a run down plane. Do not fly this airline, you will be disappointed.

### "$90 to bring my under the seat bag"
I have been flying with Frontier for over 7 years. I have been using my under the seat bag for years. I have always checked the measurements which your website states and it has always fitted under your seats. Frontier you need to get your measurements corrected on your site, because I had to pay $90 to bring my under the seat bag. I didn't even say anything, because they pulled over 20 people to pay for their bags which I know their bags fitted under the seat. What a scam.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  I’ve never experienced to be treated in such unprofessional manner starting from first to last minute of this trip. Had to be stopped at the checking station for my wallet to be considered as an extra item to all of forms of payments to be down in order to pay $99 extra to front desk. Asked to speak with someone no one was available and or cared enough to solve the situation. I was yelled at from checking agents in disrespectful ways. Horrible experience.

### "you get cheap service"
You fly cheap you get cheap service. Even though it’s not so cheap to be cramped in a little space and expensive prices on everything from bags to a refreshment. Crying babies hot plan pilot didn’t give update or greet the plane. Plan late no notice sent until after we didn’t board on time. You complain they don’t care. No air on the plane very stuffy. But they praise their credit card.

### "too expensive for the quality"
This is my first experience flying my Frontier Airlines. Let’s start with the cost, too expensive for the quality. Hidden fees from beginning to end. The gate employees are unprofessional. They eat, laugh out load, are rude, stare and are short with customers. The flight itself was delayed an hour because both pilots were late. The plane was clean but uncomfortable. The seats don’t recline and if someone uses the tray table behind you, you will feel and hear it. On the way home our flight was again delayed. I assumed the first delay was a coincidence, I was wrong. I spoke with a woman who flew Frontier a few times and she said her flights were also delayed. I will pay the same price for better quality elsewhere. Not to mention, no Wi-Fi or complementary drinks or snack during the flight supposedly to cut down flight cost.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Cancelled our flight and gave us 2 options. Rebook for a flight 2 days later or have the initial flights refunded. We were not local to the Cleveland area and had no where to stay for 2 nights but a hotel. No compensation was offered and when we asked the manager if he expected us to sleep at the airport for 48 hours and he said yes. Made a complaint online with customer service and was told they wouldn’t honor any accommodations and it was up to us to pay for anything other than the flight. Paid 2x as much to fly from a different airline at an airport 1.5 hours away and had to rent a car and pay for the hotel ourselves. Will never fly with them again.

### "never ever fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Had a wedding on Iowa/Illinois border. Drove 3.5 hours in the morning to make 9am flight. Go to check in, flight is cancelled. We received a notification telling us to check into our flight. No email or notification about cancellation of flight. Only available option was to have a 8 hour layover in Denver. Get to Denver, and we receive a notification that there is another delay. The board is still showing on time, as well as their online services. I have to tell the customer service rep about the delay because he didn’t believe me. I asked about if/when the flight is cancelled, will they help with putting me and my 8 month pregnant wife in a hotel, he said that he needs to follow protocol. I didn’t even realize that Frontier has Protocol with how unorganized and complete lack of urgency for their paying customers. Will never ever fly this airline again no matter what.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Worst experience. Website is not intuitive. Too many steps to check in. Charge you for everything including customer service help. We found a couple of helpful staff members but we also found a few that have no business being in customer service. They were not helpful and rude. Employees were difficult to find or nonexistent. At MSP, our bags did not show up and there were zero Frontier employees there because there were no out going flights. We landed at 2 pm on a Sunday. Unacceptable. We weren’t the only ones, there was about 6 of us that had misplaced bags. We called customer service and told to fill out a form online and “someone “ will contact you in 24-48 hours. Frontier lost my parents bags a few years ago. My dad’s new $500 prescription glasses were in the bag. Frontier gave them $250. That’s it. My mom had just bought new clothes and expensive makeup for the trip. Frontier did not care. This is two strikes and I’m not giving this airline an attempt at 3. My husband and I will never fly this airline again and we travel often.

### "never take Frontier airlines again"
I have been at the airport for over 24 hours because Frontier Airlines don’t have their system together. The first flight from San Juan took 8 hours when it should be 3 and a half hours. Now I’m waiting for the aircraft to cool down at Orlando airport for the past 40min not knowing if I’m to fly home anytime soon. I will never take Frontier airlines again.

### "they would not issue a refund"
Not Verified |  On 7-16-22, I made reservation for trip with my daughters to Atlantis. Before I made the reservations, I contact passport service and asked if I would get back my daughter’s passport in time to make the trip (October). I was told it shouldn’t be a problem, so with this information I made the reservations via Expedia. On September 8th I called passport services again and ask for the status of the passports. I was informed they would take longer than anticipated and would not have them in time for the trip. With this new information I contacted Expedia to cancel the trip. They did an excellent job in getting a refund from the hotel. When they (Expedia) contact Frontier Airlines, they were told that I needed to contact them (Frontier) directly. I called Frontier on 9-10-22 and was told they would not issue a refund and if Expedia wanted to issue a refund they could. At this point my tickets/travel were not confirmed and according to various resources I should have received a refund. When I explained to the agent at Frontier, he “didn’t care” and was not going to issue a refund. When asked to speak to a supervisor he refused. I find this type of behavior outrageous, insensitive and extremely unprofessional. It’s obvious that Frontier only cares about its bottom line and not “customer services.

### "I am still so upset from this experience"
Awful! I am still so upset from this experience. I arrived at the airport with 40 minutes before my flight (I have TSA precheck so I wasn’t worried). I get to the gate and their computer is down meaning they can’t check in bags. Lady at the counter takes 15 minute minutes to say ‘you could go through security but they will charge $99 for the bag’ then I mention that it’s already paid for but because I had a backpack I’d still need to. I try buying it online cheaper and it goes through. Get to the flight and they are not letting anyone in. I explain I was delayed because the lady at check in was going in circles and I already paid for my bags. Missed the flight and now they say call customer service. I rebook with another airline cause at this point the next flight is not for 24 hours. Call customer service and stay on hold for 30 minutes, explain my issue then phone goes silent. Call back, they hang up. I used to fly them all the time in early 2010s and it was my favorite. Now this is tied with Spirit Airlines.

### "baggage fees are more than excessive"
Not Verified |  First time flying frontier, we fly 24-30 times a year with my son who races competitive bmx all over the world. We needed a last min flight and thought we would try them. First off super nice people but the baggage fees are more than excessive, 279 for a bike bag and standard luggage! They wanted to charge another 50 for a helmet only to sit on city bus quality of seats that don’t recline, also they are so cheap that they weren’t running the air in Arizona in early sept so it was 90 plus in the plane and smells like exhaust fumes. With all the excessive fees I could have flown AA or delta with free bags and actually get a drink on the plane. Never again will I fly these people!

### "customer service is of no help"
Not Verified |  This is the second time flying with Frontier, first time my sons flight was delayed and missed connecting flight, was told nothing they could do and I had to drive all the way to Las Vegas to pick him up. This time flight was delayed and sitting at Las Vegas airport waiting customer service is of no help and don’t accommodate their mistakes.

### "Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced"
Not Verified | Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Flights were delayed multiple times. Leading to a missed connection. I was left stranded in another state. I spoke to multiple people over a course of 3 hours. They said they couldn’t do anything to get me to my destination. My trip was fully insured. Most of the issue came from multiple changes in flights and gates. Customer service is rude and will point you in to circles. I had to purchase a new ticket through a different airline to get me to my final destination which cost me hundreds. What is the point of insuring your flight if they do nothing to help you if an issue like this arises.

### "empty apologies and non customer service help"
I called 5 days before my return flight home to cancel, while in Utah I got injured and can’t leave until I’m healed. I was informed that it would be $100 and some change to cancel my flight and they would keep my flight money I already paid and I would have to pay the difference, however they would waive the rest of the fee once I submitted paperwork showing I was injured and not able to leave until healed. I told the gentlemen that I’m glad this is recorded cause I don’t want my flight canceled, keep my flight money, and I will never use them again. With the way the economy is and wanting to charge more money for situations out of your control is ridiculous, now not only am I not going home I’m sitting with no money that could help me until I got paid, Frontier don’t care and they show it with their empty apologies and non customer service help. I have been in customer service my entire life and this would of not been acceptable at any of my jobs, I will never use Frontier again or recommend them to anyone!

### "Problematic behavior of the baggage check-in crew"
Not Verified |  Problematic behavior of the baggage check-in crew in Las Vegas. We have 3 bags, as we want to check-in all 3 bags (34lb, 49lb and 41lb) at once, but the crew checked in 34lb bag and demanding for extra money for remaining bags. As we asked back 34lb bag to shift a bit of stuff there to balance the weights. Crew were not accepting. We literally got hurt by their worst behavior. We don’t want to travel in Frontier Airlines anymore.

### "Bag policy is a complete rip off"
Would give 0 stars if I could. Bag policy is a complete rip off and they employ rude employees. In the future I will spend the extra money to fly a different airline, and I recommend you do, too.

### "should’ve given me a full credit"
I was scheduled to leave Friday 9/2 via delta from Atlanta to Denver and fly back to Atlanta from Denver on Monday 9/5 via Frontier. I planned to meet my friend in Denver to hike in Rocky Mtn national Forrest. That Monday morning on August 29 I woke up sick. I knew I was flying and was worried about it being Covid so I took a home test that was positive. On top of everything else, my friend broke her foot the day before. There was no way this trip was happening. I immediately called to cancel my Frontier flight. I was offered 1/2 credit. Of my $256 ticket. I could have the other half if I could prove I had covid and home test were not valid. So I scheduled a test and the only appointment I could get was Saturday 9/3. Of course my test came back negative so I’m out $126. My 1/2 credit is only good for 90 days. Delta gave me full credit. Good for a year, no questions asked. Which seems more reasonable from a customer service point of view. I know I did not purchase flight insurance and so I appreciated the credit Delta gave me. I feel like Frontier should’ve given me a full credit with a longer time to use it as well. My friend is a traveling healthcare worker and I’m not sure where she is settling next. I may never get to use these credits. I booked it through Expedia. The last time I flew I purchased flight insurance and never needed it. So I didn’t do it this time. I know this was my mistake and I will never purchase tickets again without flight insurance. Booking sites have less neon signs about flight insurance. It’s usually a box you check. I canceled my Frontier flight 7 days before departure. Had I purchased their works package (and known to) I could’ve received a full refund. I’ve read they are expanding and if that’s true they really should modify there half credit policy to stay competitive with other airlines. It blew my mind that Delta asked no questions and gave me a full credit, while I felt like Frontier was judging me for what I felt was an emergency or simply trying to do the responsible thing and not get on a plane if I have Covid or any contagious illness. This post asked me for a boarding ticket to prove the validity of my post but I never got one being that I canceled it but I did provide my confirmation number. So hopefully they will post this and help me educate others out there who do not fly often and do not know these things.

### "No customer service"
Worst airline in existence. No customer service, no concern for their mistake. NO communication and customer service manager said “this problem is not the first nor last time this will happen”. They did not want to right their wrong at the airport or on the phone. They could care less.

### "have to pay $75 for carryon bag"
Stay away from frontier airline, they are just rippers, You check 40lb bag for $62 and you still have to pay $75 for carryon bag. Their flight looks cheap but when it’s time for you to check in your bags you will pay doubled for everything. Their employees are rude too.

### "25$ for printing a boarding pass"
The guy at the counter (SFO, early morning) was extremely unhelpful and charged me 25$ for printing a boarding pass which I couldn’t do myself at the kiosk because their system wasn’t working. The kiosk was literally within 5 feet of him and he didn’t offer to see what’s wrong although I was the only person in line! Preposterous.

### "check in staff were rude, plane was uncomfortable"
Absolute worst airline I have ever flown and I will never fly them ever again. Flight price was $193 for 2 travelers one way, which was a good price, but then you have to buy your seat, you have to pay to check a bag, and you have to pay more for a carry-on bag. We are now close to $400 for our flight. Then we notice that my wife’s name is not spelled correctly, so we change the name and then get charged the next day on our credit card an additional $212 to change her name. The original flight was only $193, but we are charged $212 to change her name. Apparently $75 to make the change and then an additional $137 increase on the flight price. Called Frontier to complain and I was told that name change charges are non refundable even though we think the mistake was on their end. As for the rest of the flight, check in staff were rude, plane was uncomfortable. The whole experience was the worst I have ever had on any flight and I will never fly Frontier Airlines ever again.

### "cheaper to buy a seat for my luggage"
Not Verified |  I have not gone yet but just found out it's going to cost me $20 more to fly 3 bags from Cincinnati to Tampa than it's going to cost to fly 3 people. So basically it would be cheaper to buy a seat for my luggage than to have it stowed. Went to cancel the flight because of this and found out that would actually cost me more than it would be to keep the flight at this point. Can someone make all this make sense? ?

### "I paid over $200 for 2 checked bags"
Please stay away from Frontier airlines. There tickets are affordable, however, if your baggage exceeds even 1 pound over their 40 pound limit, they will charge you an arm and leg. I paid over $200 for 2 checked bags because they were 9 pounds over.

### "Delta is always the best way to go"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Frontier again. Bought tickets via Expedia. Was unable to travel due to Covid and they refused to accommodate a change, flight credit or refund. I was told the cancellation cost was $99 and the taxes was another $52 and they could give me a $2.50 credit. The ticket did not cost $152 so not sure where that number came from. The person I spoke to could not explain what the taxes were being charged for and was not well aware of Covid protocol as she said if I would still want to travel, she can update my information. This was my first try trying them and will never do so again. Delta is always the best way to go.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  I signed up for a discount program with Frontier last year for my son who was going to college. I didn't realize I was agreeing to let them deduct $59.99 from my account every year. When I contacted them, they said it was non-refundable. My son is no longer able to go to college, so I do not need that program. Frontier was happy to cancel my membership but keep my money. I will never fly Frontier again. Terrible customer service at a time when they are making record profits!

### "Bad first experience"
Not Verified | New Orleans to Raleigh. Bad first experience flying with Frontier. Really cheap flights but they make you pay for your carry on bags. Front desk attendants that does check in to aboard was very rude and disrespectful. We was talked to with no respect and kept being asked back to the front to verify that we paid for bags. They almost made us miss the flight on purpose. I will never book with this airline again.

### "customer service doesn't exist"
Not Verified |  They canceled our flight when we were inside the airplane, they removed us from the airplane and we lost our Hotel reservation money, suitcase money and the return flight tickets with another airline. The customer service doesn't exist in this company, nobody can do nothing and you can't claim nothing to nobody. It is the worst airline I have ever taken, I don't how it is still working.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  My flight was scheduled to depart at 8:40 today. There were about four times today that I had to change gates because of the insolence of this airline’s employees. After the third time that I changed, I asked another employee from the same company for help, but he told me that my flight had taken off, so in a panic I thought my only option was to listen to him and change my flight. As soon as I did that I decided to walk back to the spot I was at because I noticed on the board that my flight was still there, so I went to see if I could get my original spot back on that flight. The woman who said she was the supervisor to was so disgustingly rude, was constantly rolling her eyes at me, loud, obnoxious and unprofessional when all I did was inquire if it could be fixed. I wish I got her name so I could separately report her. Overall if I could give this airline a 0/10 I would. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "our flight on November 15 was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Suddenly our flight on November 15 was cancelled. No explanation. Requested a refund. I guess they figured they can’t make any money on this flight. Checked web sight the only flight is November 17 but at a later time.

### "Horrible customer service"
We arrived at airport at 5pm. They kept delaying the flight but would not cancel. They strung us along until 8:30 am the next morning. They provided zero compensation. The staff was rude and unwilling to help. Horrible airline. Horrible customer service.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever, first time and last time flying with this airlines. I ended up paying $229 on bags on a $95 flight. When checking in, I was told my bag was overweight at 48lbs made me empty stuff out of my bag. With limited space from my personal bag, I was only able to bring it down to 43lb, had to pay $129 to check my 43lb bag. Now I have more in my hand to carry (which was not the plan), that’s why I had decided to check a bag in, only to be told now at boarding that I had to pay an additional $100 since I have 2 personal bag. I had two hand bag and had to pay an additional $100 to get onboard after I was made to empty my checked bag. Every major airlines chargers $35 for bag check up to 50lbs, yet I had to pay $129 and an additional $100 for my personal bag. This is straight up robbery. Lesson learned never again. Worst airline ever.

### "trip was canceled with no reason why"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight a month ago to ensure I secured lower cost for my trip in November. I just got an email saying my trip was canceled with no reason why. I refuse to book any future flights with this airline. Never in my years of travel have I ever had this happen.

### "never experienced such horrible service"
Not Verified |  I've been flying for 30 years and I have never experienced such horrible service as yours. Our family flew from Hartford, CT to Atlanta GA 3 weeks ago for a much anticipated vacation. We arrived at the airport in CT 2.5h before the flight. We went to check bags (which we paid for in advance) and there was nobody at the desk. We waited an hour and the line started getting long. People in line started getting impatient. 30 minutes before the scheduled flight one of your employees showed up, checked in one person, then took the microphone and announced that she needs to go back to the gate because there is a plane coming. She then instructed us to wait until she came back and that the flight will be delayed. So we waited. Me, my husband, our 3 very small and very hungry children and about a hundred other passengers waited in line for over 2 hours to get our bags checked. Needless to say, the flight was already delayed. We finally took off and arrived in Georgia with over an hour delay. Then, we sat on the plane for an additional hour because the captain did not receive information on which gate to go to. It was already 2am and passengers on board were NOT happy, making calls to their family members who came to pick them up at midnight. The captain apologized to us a couple times saying that the airline is not straightforward with him on what's happening. We were finally let off at 2AM. Fast forward 2 weeks, it was time to fly back home. Our flight was scheduled for 7:43AM. Knowing that Atlanta airport is huge, we arrived 2h40 minutes before take off. We went to Frontier service desk exactly 2 hours before take off. This time, there were employees there but the line was massively long because there were 3 domestic Frontier flights leaving at the same time. We went to the self service baggage tag printing machines, printed our tags and stood in the line just to drop bags off. The line was moving very slowly because it turned out that 2 out of 4 employees checking people in were only checking in international flights. So once again we stood in line forever. By the time we got to the front of the line, it was 7AM. As a reminder, the flight was leaving at 7:43. The employee took our IDs, then told us that someone else would take care of us and put us in another line. Turned out that it was too late to check bags (by 2 minutes apparently) so we were going to be rebooked. We missed the flight ONLY because the inability of Frontier Airlines to provide enough staff to check passengers in in a timely manner. Just as a side note, we were already checked in, paid for bags AND printed tags. We arrived at the airport more than 2 hours before scheduled flight and we did everything we could ahead of time. The only responsibility of Frontier Airlines staff was to physically take our bags and put them on the belt. Going back to our airport experience, we were put in line to "rebook". Stood in this line for over an hour together with numerous passengers who also missed their flights because of the lack of competency of Frontier Airlines' employees. They wouldn't refund us, wouldn't let us talk to the supervisor and offered us NO solutions. We ended up eating the cost, renting a car and driving for 18 hours.. Don't fly Frontier. Just don't.

### "definitely made it the worst experience"
Not Verified |  As a first timer on an plane this airline most definitely made it the worst experience. First leaving from my destination I was charged $99 for a bag that weighed 19lbs! The bag was the size of an 4 month old toddler. The one lady asked “I guess it was her supervisor” are we charging him? I turned around and the supervisor was rubbing her thumb against her fingers as if saying “yes get the money”. Anyway this is my first flight so I’m thinking whatever I’m going to check something off of my bucket list. Gets on the flight someone is in my assigned seat. After negotiating for a little under 5 minutes I was able to retrieve my seat. Trip was not that bad for my first time although seats were hard and passengers were elbow to elbow (literally). I enjoyed the experience.

### "he said no reimbursement would occur"
This is the first and last time I will use Frontier Airlines. I've been in a car accident recently and am temporarily unable to get around on my own. To help make things easier, I checked a bag instead of trying to wheelchair and crutch around with a heavy carry on. My flight was early morning (6AM departure) so I called frontier the night before for assistance and was assured multiple times I would have help at the airport in Denver to have access to a wheelchair and someone to help me get around. When I arrived that morning, I had no assistance from walking into the airport to getting to the gate from Frontier. Additionally, I had to find my own wheelchair as no one was at the station to help me and had to rely on other frontier customers to help move my baggage through the checkline while attempting to find this wheelchair (all the ones sitting out were locked and no one there to get them out for me). Frontier had no one available or planned ahead to help me push my baggage, to push my wheelchair to get me around, or to move me through TSA and to get to my gate, which Denver requires a train to get to gates and is a longer route than other airports. I was told I had to wait for help which they didn’t have anyone at the time and watch my timeline go down when it was 4:50AM at this point with a 5:20AM board time. I asked for help from the luggage line associate, the baggage check associate, and from random workers throughout the airport- everyone looked at me in a wheelchair struggling to get around and said "Sorry, I can't help you". I even overheard someone working with luggage complain about being asked to help me when they had luggage to get on planes at the check baggage area. To avoid being late, I started the path and elevator ride down to TSA on my own after informing the Frontier baggage associate I would like someone to catch up with me. She looked at me and said nothing and went back to her job. Once down the elevator, I was clearly lost and distraught as a TSA officer asked if I needed help when I got off the elevator and was looking around. It was emotionally distressful to have multiple people both with frontier and at the airport look at me and offer no help or tell me they couldn’t help when asked. I called Frontier to pursue a reimbursement of my return flight due to the experience and they offered me a $20 credit - it was offensive to offer practically nothing for someone who needed help and was assured they would have it. After declining, the offered $50 and I declined again wanting a manager. After discussing my experience with a manager, he said no reimbursement would occur due to the fact that I took the flight still. So the options were to cancel my flight, most likely pay for that cancellation, and reschedule all to have my experience be reimburseable to Frontier. This airline doesn't put their customers first and it was a sad, emotional experience needing help and having my worst fear of not getting assistance occur. I would like my experience to be heard by anyone needing assistance on an early morning or late night flight- don't assume because they tell you help will be there that someone will aid you. If you are disabled, injured, and need assistance, use another airline.

### "will never get my business again"
Not Verified |  Uncomfortable seats, lost my bag. Frontier rep at Portland was unpleasant to deal with. It's 3 weeks later and I still don't have my bag. I can't understand customer service rep on phone because of accent. Frontier will never get my business again.

### "I paid for a full seat and didn't get one"
I purchased an upgraded window seat #2A. On arrival the people assigned to 2B / 2C were sitting in 2A & 2C. These persons were of a very large size by width and essentially eliminated the middle seat with their size making it impossible for me to take my window seat. Ultimately I ended up being offered the aisle seat #2C but because of the size of these people i was only able to use 2/3 of the seat and the arm rest to separate the seats was well behind the person next to me. I spent the entire flight folded over on myself with this persons entire arm resting on my arm and chest. At times i could feel the perspiration building up between our skins. Not only did i not get the upgraded seat i paid for, I did not even get a full seat. The flight crew did nothing to acknowledge the situation nor did they speak with the two passages to see if they had family members on the flight that would be willing to take the unaccommodating seat I was forced to use. The flight crew merely handed out seat belt extenders to the two passengers while I stood there. It turns out there was family members in the 3 seats across the aisle. One of them should have been asked to take the 2/3 seat I was forced to try and use. I try to fly Frontier when I can and have always been very patient with the flight crews out of sympathy for their situation dealing with a sea of humanity. On exiting the aircraft I did as I always do, Thanked the crew. This was their opportunity to at least thank me for my patience. I got nothing. Not even the recognition of the "thank you". Regardless, I paid for a full seat and didn't get one - I paid for an upgraded "more space" seat #2A and got less than I would have in row #31. Was I supposed to walk off the plane and hope to get a flight home somehow from some airline? This was their reply: We respect that you are requesting a refund. However, we cannot honor that request as this should have been referred to a Supervisor that was present and able to witness that you did not fit in the seat. In fairness to all customers, the fee for seat selection is non-refundable, the flight was completed the seat you were assigned had the same value as the initial seat purchased, a service was provided, due to our policies we are unable to issue a refund for a seat. An exception will not be granted for this situation. We will not be communicating further on this topic. Thank you for considering Frontier Airlines for your travel needs. Sincerely, Customer Relations Specialist

### "Won’t fly with Frontier again"
Not Verified |  So not only they switched the gates on us but it was over a hr late . So I had paid for a shuttle when I got back and lost out on going home because we missed the shuttle. Then our flight didn’t leave till way later because “computer problems “ and some dude had to be taken off the plane. The whole thing made me and my gf uncomfortable. The flight was choppy and cramped plus you pay 60$ to check in your carry on if not online you pay at the gate 100$ there. Won’t fly with Frontier again.

### "they changed few times till now"
Not Verified |  I am still at the airport, our flight was 10.05 August 21, and they changed few times till now they said it’s for 4.30 and we ask for cancel the flight so we can go out. They said no, we ask where to get food and drink every where is closed she said they open at 4 am ! Instead they send 2 police officer.

### "they nickel and dime you to death"
Not Verified |  The cost of the flight was reasonable since we only had 1 personal bag each. But they nickel and dime you to death with all the extra fees. The seats are very uncomfortable and not very much leg room. You have to pay for water and a snack. We have always at least gotten a drink. I won't say I wouldn't fly them again but I will try not to if possible.

### "poor management and ownership"
My wife and I just had a baby on August 10th and I got appendicitis procedure done on August 15th so I booked a flight for my mom and brother to come visit and help out. Their Flight got canceled on 19th. A rep named Harvey assisted me that day. He mentioned there is another flight on the 21th told him that’s to long of a wait but he said no other flight so I wasted to be put on the 21st flight then I asked to be transferred to manager. He told me there is a 2-3 hour wait told him I don’t mind then 10 min later he came back and said he can’t complete the transfer and that he is going to cancel the rebooked ticket since I requested for a manager. He said the only way I can rebook the ticket is by canceling my request for manager so I was forced to cancel my request. Wasn’t compensated for our inconvenience. Got put on another flight for 21st of August and today the flight is delayed and I’m concerned that they are going to miss their connection in Denver. This stems from poor management and ownership. I called in to get help got hung up on so at this point don’t know what to do.

### "pay more and use a better airline"
Not Verified |  No notification at all that the flight had been cancelled, we get to the airport then find out Frontier is not in the main Austin terminal, it is on terminal B which is like 10 minutes from the Austin Airport and it is really a second class terminal. We get there and everybody is saying the flight got cancelled, we got to the line, knowing the flight had been canceled and when our turn comes, we are just offered a full refund or a flight the next day close to midnight, so for a 4 day vacation we would have lost already a quarter of our vacation, $200 for the show we had bought and one night of hotel. Later we were told by someone else that they could put us in a flight from DFW 4 hours away, so we tried that option but they said "but your return flight is still to Austin and we are not going to change that one", that just made us decide to cancel it and we ended up losing $700 for our AIRBNB and the show. We learned our lesson the hard way. My recommendation, pay more and use a better airline.

### "They are a joke of an airline"
Not Verified |  I have never been treated with such hostility and pompous attitude in an airport or on a plane. The Frontier employees act like they have so much power over you and treat you like vermin. Our personal size luggage, which we fly with every time we fly anywhere, we were told we had to pay for on our way home and we flew frontier (the same airline) to our original destination and there was no problem then. They we so rude that I was just about in tears and I have 5 kids that I am trying to care for as well. Also when your on the plane unless you are buying something they won’t give you the time of day and treat you as a annoyance. I will never fly frontier again. They are a joke of an airline.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Worst flight ever. Baggage weight limit is 40lbs so I paid extra to increase limit by 10lbs. At check in bag weigh 44lb. Clerk acted like I committed crime and had to pay extra which I had already paid. At boarding the flight desk person told coworker if carryon bags looked big, send the people to her to pay extra. When customers stated that he was allowed one carryon bag she said if he wanted to board plane he would pay the extra fee. Made women with small dog carrier pay extra also. Then got on the plane I have sat on stadium seats with more padding than this airplane. My butt was numb before we left the terminal. To get a bottle of water was extra. All told my inexpensive flight cost an extra $755 in add on. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "Worst airline I’ve ever been on"
Worst airline I’ve ever been on. Told us to get off the plane because if a storm and said we would be back on made us wait for a manger for over a hour just for them to tell us to come the next day at 5 am for our flight the. Pushed our flight back to 9:45am without saying anything to anyone then pushed it back again to 10:15, and they did not offer not water or food. We all sat here for 6 hours while there flight attendants showed up at 9:45 am.

### "never recommend this airline"
The worst flight I have ever experienced and will never recommend this airline. All the customers services and how they treat their customers could be better.

### "I will never recommend Frontier Airlines"
I have logged over 1 million miles on Delta Airlines and American Airlines and have found both to be well operated and professional overall. I will never recommend Frontier Airlines however due to their repeated flight cancellations without notice, and their inability to depart or land on time. Furthermore their credit policy is so bad I am not going to waste words to describe it. A quick look at any of the online airline reviews reveals that Frontier ranks at the bottom among all airlines, and for good reason.

### "Cancelation fees exceeded the price"
Not Verified |  Booked flight three weeks or so in advance, had to cancel one week before departure due to Canadas Covid policy. Cancelation fees exceeded the price of the Tickets. What a joke. If you pay these people, you will lose whatever you give them if you wish to make a change to your plans. We were not canceling last minute. They are selling our seats twice guaranteed.

### "They can keep the voucher"
My flight departed Denver on Sunday night 5 hours late and landed in Washington, D.C. on Monday morning at 3:00 a.m. They don’t even have any charging ports or electrical outlets to charge your laptop or phone. They promote the seats as being light and ergonomic, but what they don’t tell you is how uncomfortable the seat is with limited padding. Frontier may as well just provide you with a 5 gallon plastic bucket to sit on. It couldn’t be any more uncomfortable. The positive part of the flight was that I did receive a free cup of water. Everything else you pay for. You can’t pay for WiFi, because they don’t have it. And then to add insult to injury when we landed in DC a announcement was made on the plane that our luggage would arrive on carousel 4A. While everyone waited patiently at Carousel 4A a airport employee came over and notified us that our luggage came up on Carousel 2A. Carousel 2A was on the other side of a wall and could not be seen from Carousel 4A. Now Frontier Airlines has offered me a $50.00 voucher to be used on my next Frontier flight, but it is only good for 90 days. They can keep the voucher, because there won’t be another Frontier Airlines flight in my future.

### "What a terrible experience it was"
My wife and 5 kids were flying Frontier Airlines from Oakland, CA to DCA through Denver. The flight from Oakland to Denver was okay but the trouble started in Denver: Cancellation after cancellation. My family stayed around two days in Denver. What a terrible experience it was. We will never, ever fly with Frontier again!

### "poor customer service"
Boarded last night only to unboard because somebody messed the schedule up so it was only 1 pilot. So we delayed from last night and supposed to reboard today, at 9am needless to say it’s after 9 and we still are in Vegas. We had to sleep on the floor all night. Not only were we forced to stay on this airline because we was told after the pilot delayed that our checked bags were no longer a priority, yes our bags were on the plane so we had no choice but to sit and wait. I wouldn’t recommend to ever fly this airline, poor customer service.

### "Really bad experience"
Not Verified |  Delay for 4 hours my first flight from DCA to DEN and then 5 hours delay from DEN to SFO and then finally cancelled with no refund, has missed all my plans. Really bad experience with this airline. I won’t recommend this airlines.

### "Awful experience"
Awful experience. Our flight had 3 hours of delayed. Airport was extremely cold, my daughter was tired and sleepy and was crying a lot. We were supposed to depart at 11:00 am from Orlando, airline pushed it back to 2:00 am. I asked the reason, no body answered. The only answer was, hope that your flight doesn’t get canceled. Very unorganized. I don’t recommend at all. I had horrible experience with 2 kids at the airport. By the way, I forgot to mention that on our way coming from Philadelphia to Orlando, the airplane AC was not working for the first 1 hour. My husband couldn’t breathe. It was extremely hot.

### "Frontier has gone completely downhill"
My review would be zero stars, but it is impossible to leave a zero star review. Frontier has gone completely downhill. On Saturday, August 6, I was scheduled to leave Atlanta at 9:42pm. We ultimately left after 3am on Sunday, August 7. The entire experience was horrible. From the delays that were never explained to the lack of care for the customers. There were many families and children on this flight. Frontier made NO effort to provide water or snacks or items like blankets to make people more comfortable. We didn’t feel like it was prudent to head to the McDonald’s and wait in the 40-minute line because the gate personnel told us to stay close. I will say that the Frontier staff was friendly, but they were not helpful, nor did they show much empathy or compassion. One flight attendant told me “I’m in the same boat as you, I’d like to get airborne”. In fact, she was not “in the same boat”. We were paying customers and she was an employee earning a paycheck. I felt like her comment was a slap in the face. The delays we experienced were not due to weather or any uncontrollable circumstances. For example, why did we sit on the airplane for more than an hour with a combination of no pilots, no air conditioning and a very off-putting smell coming from the HVAC system once it was turned on? Why did we board our final plane so far in advance of our actual departure (about an hour)? We sat in uncomfortable airplane seats for more than double the flight time between Atlanta and Denver. Once we landed in Denver, why did no one call ahead to the concourse to ensure we could deplane with no more delays? Throughout my adult life, I have flown more than 1 million miles. I have experienced delays. I have experienced good customer service. I have NEVER experienced anything as bad as what took place on August 6. Upon walking through the airport in Denver I received a $50 credit email from Frontier. Again, this felt like a slap in the face. We were delayed for more than 5 hours. I’m sure people missed connections and family events and moments in their lives that could not be recovered. $50 is a complete joke. At the very least, Frontier Airlines owes each passenger on that flight no less than the full cost of their round-trip fare. If the passengers were only travelling one direction, you should compensate them with a fully paid round-trip credit. I am hoping this message finds someone that cares about Frontier's customers. I am hoping that the mistakes made on August 6 become learning events for Frontier Airlines and that no one has to experience the very poor service we endured. The photo below was taken 14 minutes prior to our initial departure time.

### "disappointed with my sons carry on charges"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed with my sons carry on charges, its the same bag he has always used as personal item but this time around magically did not fit under the sit when my son sat down it actually fit. I'm disgusted that $89 was charge when there was no need. I feel talking advantage of and conveniently there is no prop there on site to see if it fits horrible experience my 18 year old had to endure and I'm sure the lady thought it would be an easy target. Not looking to fly through you guys ever again, i’ve use you for the last 7 years and this last year has been awful.

### "same price as any other airlines"
Frontier airlines advertises itself as a low cost airline but after all the fees, choosing a seat, carry on bag fee, check in fee, it comes to the same price as any other airlines. Flight from Dallas to Ontario and Ontario to Dallas was delayed. Got a delay notice 5 minutes before dropping off bag. They don’t send any updates after the the initial delay Notice and they Don’t let you check in till 2 hours before the flight was delayed. They spam you with emails to pay for checkin fees etc and a 20 minutes sales pitch to sign up for their credit card before landing was just too much.

### "they hit you with buying seats"
Frontier airlines is a horrible airline, stay away. Booked a low cost flight to Ft. Lauderdale but then they hit you with buying seats unless you don't want to sit with your family, then baggage fees, even carry on.If you want to call them and ask frontier personnel to manage details of you flight that is extra. If you cancel flight its $99 per person per direction. Stay away from frontier.

### "refund me the original price of the ticket"
Worst experience with any airline I’ve ever had. Frontier cancelled my flight from Pittsburgh to Denver as I was traveling to the airport. Due to my job I had to immediately book a new flight with another airline because frontier didn’t have another flight available same day. I then got an email saying that I was eligible for a reimbursement up to $300 if I chose to go with another airline. Frontier failed to abide by their option provided to me and told me that all they could do is refund me the original price of the ticket purchased with Frontier. How are you going to offer a reimbursement to customers to go to another airline and then not abide by it?

### "The worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure when we were in the taxi on our way to the airport. And all we got was an offer to wait 24 hours till the next flight which duration is  20 hours! And of course we requested a refund and got empty apologies. It is insane. It was my first experience with the Frontier, I lost money for booking hotels, car, museums and this is the first time airline just do nothing for the client. The worst experience ever.

### "I will never fly frontier again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly frontier again! My flight was canceled short notice and the employees were rude and literally said “rebook or refund.” It’s Friday and they said the next flight would be Monday. ALSO, it takes 3-5 business days for a refund. So if I didn’t have any emergency money I would’ve stayed in this airport for 4 days and 3 nights!! Luckily I found another airline but I still had to pay even more so that I can make it home. This was very inconvenient & all the staff is rude! I will make sure I never recommend this airline to anyone. This is the 2nd time the flight was canceled. There needs to be more responsibility and accountability. You never know what someone is going through. Terrible service, terrible airline.

### "made it their effort to make me comfortable"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying and I kept getting motion sickness. The flight attendants made it their effort to make me comfortable. The only down side was one person kept singing in my ear and loudly when no one wanted to hear her and the women in the window seat kept playing her videos loudly on the plane and everyone kept looking at my aisle. The plane was also late a little bit to philly and over 2 hours late to Palm Beach international..

### "the worst airline experience"
By far the worst airline experience I have ever had. Every single flight (4 total) on my round trip was delayed. Extremely long layovers on both trips, just to end with a 4 hour delay on my final flight. They didn’t delay the flight until 10pm, and said I would have to wait until 2am before my flight would take off so it was too late to book with any other airports. And this was after I had been waiting over 8 hours for my connecting flight. Had to pay another day for parking and lost my hotel for my destination. The only compensation they offered was either a meal voucher (for restaurants that were all closed) or refund. I opted for the refund and the people at the counter refused to give me my bag. They told me it was already in route to my destination. I had to book a flight with a different airline for the following day which meant I was out an extra $400 for new flight and hotel. Then when I arrived at Salt Lake City the next day to claim my bag, no one was anywhere to be found at the ticket counter or baggage claim. The airport said the frontier doesn’t have employees available until 2 hours before the next flight. They didn’t have another flight for 6 hours. I can literally see my bag through the door an no one on the phone would help me. They kept trying to get me to file a lost bag claim online, I said it’s not lost! I can literally see it. I still have a 3 hour drive to get to after this. Did I mention I paid to check and carry on my bags. It’s 9am and they’re the only airline without any employees available

### "Sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours"
Sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours for no reason. By law because of this delay over 2 hours, Frontier Airlines is supposed to compensate me 4 times the amount of my ticket, but they keep saying it not their fault.

### "Will never be flying with Frontier again"
My plane landed in Vegas after a 5 hour flight and the pilot wouldn’t let us off the plane due to heat lightning in the area for over an hour. Sitting on a hot plane forever with little to no updates of how long we would be there with no wifi was a terrible way to start our trip. The seats also feel like you’re sitting on metal. Extremely uncomfortable. Will never be flying with Frontier again.

### "Don’t you do this before we depart"
Not Verified |  First our flight was delayed by 18 minutes. No big deal. After boarding they said we would push back in 9 minutes once maintenance check was verified. Been sitting on the plane for 45 min waiting on new routes and fuel. Don’t you do this before we depart! First time flying frontier and this is my welcome.

### "last time I will be flying with them"
I have been flying for over 30 years and never have I experienced anything like what I did today. Frontier is so hungry for money that they are charging an additional item even if your second item is a food bag or a pillow and it doesn’t fit in your personal item. The gentlemen that was checking people in was rude and inconsiderate. He was barking at people like they were children and was making people pay for things like the food bag they were carrying on if It didn’t fit in their personal item. I was traveling with a pet which means I had paid over 230 for a one way from Miami to San Juan at 6am on August 10th on Flight 118. He did not know the rules and proceeded to yell at me about having to pay for the carry on because the pet meant that I couldn’t place the personal item under the seat - which is why you pay for the pet. This person I’m sure is rewarded for his behavior because I can bet no flights get more money at the gate at 89 per carry on item that they now have to pay to eat on the plane. This is the last time I will be flying with them.

### "Overall not a good experience"
I used Frontier Airlines only because it was cheaper and had the dates that worked best for our quick flight to see a friend. Cheaper does not mean better. The seats are super uncomfortable, there are fees for anything and everything extra, no WI-FI, have to pay $3.50 for a bottle of water on flight if you need, super bumpy flights, obnoxious flight attendants, super slow to board and and depart from the plane, etc. If you do fly with them, don’t fall for the you have to pay extra for your seat thing, (you don’t), use the “personal item” only option if you’re not going for a long period of time, (the size limit is big enough to fit a few days of clothes in it), pack snacks and a drink (they’re going to charge you a lot for anything you need during flight), and prepare yourself for a very uncomfortable seat. Overall not a good experience and will stick to our usual Southwest Airlines from now on.

### "airline is by far the worst"
Not Verified |  If I could give this airline less than a zero I would. I paid for my luggage, an upgraded seat, and a carry-on bag $350. The staff of this company doesn't communicate. I got to my gate and was told I had to pay an additional $90 just for my purse. To make it even worse the "staff' allowed stand-by customers to board before wheelchairs and other passengers. No matter what you pay you are not given anything complimentary. This company needs front desk agents that are professional adults. I and 6 others on the same flight asked why we have to pay extra, the response was they put this into effect a couple of weeks ago. I asked so when customers going to be notified. They said they don't know. When we all asked for a supervisor they said no supervisor was working. The only response they did give was we don't know what to tell you and this is the price and if people don't pay it they can't board the flight. Even though we had already paid. Then a young lady walked around taking pictures of people's boarding passes. Not from a work device, but her cell phone. The flight gets delayed by almost 4hrs. With no announcements made they told us to all de-plane and wait to see if they can let us back on board due to the rain. Once we finally get back on they even have the nerve to charge for travel-size snacks and drinks from $5.25-$14.50. They had no wifi. They wouldn't even give people water. Kids were walking up and down on the flight, screaming, and, crying. They even forced a woman that is not mobile out of her wheelchair. The young kid that was at the front desk is going to say well if she can't get up and get into our chair she can't board the flight. The same staff was sitting around on cell phones when we all had to de-plane, yet again being of no assistance. A few of us asked for wifi, they said they don't have any. There was no flight entertainment for the kids that yelling, screaming, and crying the entire flight. This airline is by far the worst. If anyone can get a refund and book with another airline run and do it.

### "it was horrible"
Not Verified |  First time flying and it was horrible, they don’t have Wi-Fi, you have to pay for all luggage and carry on bags. Staff was not friendly and or accommodating,

### "they refunded my ticket"
Not Verified |  Frontier was amazing. I am going to choose them first after they refunded my ticket when my flight insurance refused. No other airline would do that and they were kind and made it easy.

### "completely the worst"
Horribly expensive and you have to pay for every single thing. I accidentally cancelled my trip rather than made changes and it costed me 99% of what I paid for the ticket. They couldn’t retrieve any part of my booking whatsoever at 99%. So overall, completely the worst.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever, me and my family were on our way home from Vegas to Atlanta, when my 81 year old stepdad had to turn in the rental car we used to get to the airport. As suspected in the city of Las Vegas, there was hefty traffic. He had to take a taxi to back to the airport. Me and my family got on the plane, but my stepdad was 2 minutes late. After they closed the gate. You people are heartless and discourteous. Took your sweet time persuading us to get off the plane but couldn’t take 2 seconds to let my old man on.

### "I will never travel with them again"
Not Verified | New York to Denver via Atlanta. This was the worst experience I have ever had when traveling. My day was going great until I arrived at the Frontier gate. I was greeted by a woman who yelled in my face to get away from her. With my credit card out to willingly pay for an upgrade, I said nothing and retracted. The flight was supposed to be boarding 20 minutes later. We got onto the airplane we sat for an hour before they had us de-board the plane due to our flight not being given priority at Atlanta airport. My flight from Atlanta to Denver was supposed to leave 2 hours after we are. We sat in the terminal everyone on hold with Frontiers customer service. After 1 hour 45 minutes on the phone telling the customer service person that there is a flight that left the next morning I found myself by Googling and that it would not be necessary for me to spend the next 3 days in Atlanta, she corrected my next flight. 12 hours after flying to Atlanta and sleeping in the airport, I went to the attendant at my gate, to be screamed at about how she doesn’t have time for me (once again, credit card in hand, trying to pay for an upgrade) and to go sit down. The flight attendants were very nice. The pilots tried to help those of us who had connecting flights, but the overall experience and amount of time myself and many others had to spend waiting on frontier to get their stuff together was mind blowing. I will never travel with them again.

### "Long story short. They can never be wrong"
Not Verified |  Long story short. They can never be wrong. Even when they are, they will not make it right. If their associates make you miss your flight they will not give you a refund or a voucher. What I mean by that is this, I arrive at the airport 2 hrs and 5 min before my flight. Their associates make me stand in the wrong line for 90 minutes then me moved me to another line (still the wrong line). I didn't get to the counter until 20 minutes before my flight. I was sent to rebooking and I was given a flight I couldn't use. I took the flight because their associates told me I had to or I had no chance of refund or a voucher. Of course, now their using that against me saying oh you booked another flight there's nothing we can do! I'm emailing this person from Frontier telling him all of this and not only will he not admit any wrong doing he's pointing fingers at me, like arriving 2 hours and 5 minutes before a flight is the wrong thing to do! Frontier! You have a checklist you ask passengers to abide by? What if, hear me out, someone abides by that checklist, then your employees mishandled them and causes them to miss the flight. Totally the passengers fault right? Because they only hire pristine professionals that can do no wrong so obviously the passengers are the problem yeah?

### "this is the worst I've flown"
Lots of hidden fees, made us pay for baby bag and 2 kid bags which are supposed to be free. Ground staff unfriendly and rude, out of all airlines this is the worst I've flown.

### "credit was actually only good for 90 days"
They cancelled our flight entirely and said they had no more flights to our location. They offered to fly us to the nearest city instead, but offered no accommodations for getting to our actual destination. They said they could just cancel our trip and get a refund, but we already took off work it was for my sister's engagement that we did not want to miss. Employee claimed to give us $50 credit for each passenger in our party. On the written statement, it says good for 365 days. The credit was actually only good for 90 days. I never received a digital or printed confirmation of this interaction. When I reached out they admitted to their mistake but said there was nothing could be done about extending the credit despite my evidence of the employee handwriting and my email that indicated no follow up. There seems to be no one actually in charge and the company as a whole very clearly lacks accountability. We lost hundreds of dollars due to travel changes and got nothing in return.

### "I miss my flight"
I went 1 Hour and 30 minutes before my flight and I can’t even print my boarding pass and there wasn’t nobody there at the counter for assistant. I miss my flight and I try to speak with the frontier staff and they tell me there have to be in the gates checking the people to aboard to the aircraft and I wait 1hour and 30 minutes waiting for them and don’t do nothing about it. I miss my flight, my time and also the staff trying to tell me to show me the cams to “proved that I was in the wrong but when I told them to show the “prove” the I was in the wrong they didn’t do nothing about it just to make me leave. I can’t even do my check in because nobody and no staff to help me. I only have a backpack I didn’t have to go to the bagging area just print my boarding pass and manager making me excuses telling me shes doing me a favor to stay there to “help me” and charge to rebook my flight. Putting the blame on me and tell me to be there 2-3 hours more when in other airlines company’s for a backpack I can do my self check in minutes and go to the gates or even if I can’t do it is staff there yo help me with the boarding ticket process. Horrible service and they still keep my money.

### "the agents were incredibly rude to me"
Today the kiosk malfunctioned for my bag and instead of offering assistance or a short cut in line since it was an early flight - I was forced to wait in a long line that resulted in me missing my flight. I was given a new flight with of course a 100 dollar charge and a forced charge for a seat of 26 dollars. I now have to travel all day and will be missing a day of my vacation. To top it off the agents were incredibly rude to me bc my luck it was the agent that refused assistance and made me wait in line that checked my bag in for the new flight. When I overheard the couple in front of me also had the baggage kiosk malfunction- I realized it was wrong of them to charge me for their faulty equipment. Lucky for the couple in front of me there wasn’t a long line then and they were still able to get on their flight. I called customer service to get a refund and it was refused. I like this flight it’s cheap way home but my treatment today makes me just want to pay the extra money and fly United. I literally told the front agent I wished to stop our conversation but instead he decided to berate me further. They have new times at their front desk but in April it wasn’t open until 3:45 so I didn’t give myself the usual cushion bc the front desk wasn’t open to check my bag last time. All in all I can’t believe my poor treatment and their faulty equipment. Hopefully the plane works today!

### "charge way too much for 1 carry on"
This airline is terrible. Everything from their website to their customer service. Website is the worst ever. It is slow and not user friendly. They charge way too much for 1 carry on. My carry on weight 12 pounds and they didn’t even weigh it. They charge me $89. Then you pick you seat they show you that if you pick the front seat and pay more you get more leg room. Not true I pay an extra $61. I got the same leg room as everyone else. That’s an extra $150. for a ticket that costs me $79. I will never fly this airline again. You will be disappointed.

### "their customer service is terrible"
San Diego to Tampa Bay. I knew Frontier had a bad reputation for price gouge on bags, terrible customer service and unreliability and it seems they didn't disappoint. I paid an extra $250 for my girlfriend an I to have checked bags, carry on and "premium" seats. The Seats: The seats they claim give you an extra 8 inches are worthless. They are about the same as the rest of crammed seats on the plane and if you sit in the very front row you'll discover you have less legroom and personal storage then anyone on the plane. Checked Bags: Frontier does price gauge like crazy for those checked bags. As mentioned I paid for a bundle do that included my checked bags. Which came about to around $250 for 2 people. Well what they don't tell you is if your bag is over the 40lbs limit you have to pay an extra $50. For a single pound! But that's not even the worst part. We had a layover in Vegas and they misplaced our luggage. When talked too baggage services an they, "This happens all the time". So we filed a claim and they guaranteed us our bags would be back next day. The following day, they contacted us and told us that they received our bags and said we needed to be there before 11 o'clock to pick them up. And I arrive at 10:15 to pick up the bags and the ones in the baggage claim area. So we go to the check-in ticket stand to ask for assistance. The single employee Who is visible that works for frontier says "well you guys are just gonna have to wait til 11". At this point I almost lost it, because I was understanding of the system with it not being the employees fault. But clearly they don't care. I can visually see my bags in the baggage claim area and they're telling me I have to wait longer after they messed up. So my friend and I waited an extra 45 minutes to collect the bags that they misplaced. And of course they didn't shop back up to the baggage claim area on time. So I walked back to the checked bag area where there are literally eight employees standing around. When I asked them if they can assist me getting my bags two of them gave me dirty looks. And said you have to wait for the lady to go to the baggage claim area to do it because They were too busy. I'm so happy we paid the extra $300 for them to manage our bags. By the way you'll also see just help busy they were when I asked him to help me in the pictures that I post.. Clearly they were having an emergency that they couldn't help one customer. Do not fly this airline, their customer service is terrible, they will lose your bags, and they overprice on basic services

### "Wonderful customer service"
Trenton to Tampa. The customer service was remarkable! My man and I are flying to Miami from New Jersey for his birthday and decided to land in Tampa. We had no idea it was a 5 hour drive. However, I was able to modify my return flight with NO issues what so ever. The staff were extremely helpful. I asked her 100 questions and she remained patient, calm and found us a different flight! Wonderful customer service!

### "the most miserable experience"
I fly all the time and in spite of the bad things I heard about Frontier I decided to give them a try. Firstly the check bag policy is ridiculous. I had to check my daughter who is 10 small bag she totes her toys in for $69 going and $79 coming back not including my other 8 bags (family vacation). The return flight was supposed to depart at 9:44am it was delayed 5 hours without any warning. It is the most miserable experience I have ever had with an airline. We are a family of 9 travelers with 1 in a wheelchair. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. It may be cheaper but you truly get what you pay for. Instead of relaxing until check out at our resort, we get to sleep and be cold and uncomfortable at the airport.

### "Customer service is awful"
Not Verified |  Frontier - Customer service is awful. Unhelpful. To speak to a customer rep we need to pay. Advertised for a cheap price. Price of ticket is 225 plus seats is 70 plus. Baggage - minimum - one carry on and one check in - approx. 100. So minimum they cost $400 per ticket from SFO to Las Vegas and back. Customer service is awful. Onboard service is awful. Seats are very congested. Never fly with them again. Racket offer a package of $400 which includes 1 checked baggage, pre boarding, 1 carry on bag, cancellation possible, change possible, better seats - do we need to spend $600 plus to travel from Las Vegas to SFO just 400 miles (to and from). Avoid.

### "It’s just not worth it to start or end vacation this way"
I will never fly Frontier again. What’s sad is that this is one of the most eco friendly airlines but I cannot support their business and will be vocal to all my friends about my experiences on this airlines. Our A/C was broken, the flight time was changed 3 times, we were loaded on the plane only to sit there without AC mid summer for two hours. While waiting, the flight attendant mentioned the 3rd engine was broken (don’t say this even if it doesn’t effect flight - it just sounds bad), and that they didn’t have enough fuel to get us to our destination. It took one hour to get fuel. The employees were rude with no prompt for such reactive responses. And although the baseline ticket prices were cheap, in the end it’s never worth it. Not only will you get experiences like this but for every bag it’s $40-$80 unless you bring a backpack on, $30 to buy your seat, and $20 if you want to board early. I hope Frontier or access to eco friendly airlines change one day, but until it does, don’t fly Frontier. Especially if you’re on vacation. It’s just not worth it to start or end vacation this way. It costs the same to have a significantly better and more peaceful experience with another airline.

### "Possibly the worst company"
Not Verified | Cleveland to Las Vegas. Possibly the worst company you could fly with. My flight from Vegas was canceled with a friend - they refunded him the return flight, I had to put $900 out for two one-way tickets home and $300 for a 2 day stay since the next flight was not till the redeye 30 hours later, and miss wages for having to take a day off work. All to be told I am entitled to absolutely nothing from their company, If you would Like to have an enjoyable flight in a reliable airlines I suggest you pick any others they in front here airlines

### "extremely disrespectful"
Not Verified |  My mother's booked a flight well in advance but her departure flight would be cancelled and was unable to utilize her returning flight. The cancelled flight was immediately issued her a refund but the returning flight refused to do so. The staff has been outsourced who are extremely disrespectful and have very nasty attitudes. They completely lack any customer service or kindness.

### "extremely rude and they did not help"
Not Verified |  My son lost his wallet on the flight from Dallas to Denver and the gate agents would not let him go back on the plane and look for the wallet, they told him the cleaning people already went on the plane and now other passengers were already on there. They were no help at all. Then he went to customer service for Frontier Airlines and they were extremely rude and they did not help. My kids are flying alone and not one single Frontier airline employee would help them.

### "don't pay for your seat"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight & paid for an aisle seat but when I was boarding my boarding pass on my phone didn't work cause they changed my seat without asking me. The boarding agent told me that I had to call reservations when I asked for an refund. When I called I was told that they couldn't give me a refund because they didn't note my reservation for a refund. We already was late boarding but if I would have known that I would have held up my flight to get them to note my reservation so I could get my money back from this airline. Unless this is all you can afford or are in a jam and need to get somewhere. But if you are in a jam and have to use this airline I recommend that you don't pay for your seat cause they may change it without asking you and then the boarding agent will lie to you so this  airline can keep your money.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
I will never fly Frontier again! What a hot mess. It was a direct flight from Orlando to Syracuse they never put No one on the flights luggage on the right plane on Sunday. I get to Syracuse they tell me it'll be in on the next flight Tuesday after 1130 you can just come here to pick it up or put in a claim. Well the "claim" was to have it delivered. So I chose the option of coming directly to airport to get it. Figured it was the safer option. No one at the counter, the delta guy knocked on the door the Frontier agent came out, knows nothing and says the next flight is at 3pm but not from Orlando! So no one knows anything. Also side of there was no 1130 flight today! Call to make a claim now which I guess I should have done to begin with.

### "Frontier had no care or concern"
Horrible, horrible service. 2.5 hour delay without any explanation. Missed my connecting flight at a replacement cost of $1000. Frontier had no care or concern. Customer service is from outside the US...good luck there!

### "why customer have to suffer"
Don’t choose Frontier. I booked the ticket in May for sept family trip and received an email in July that the flight got cancel. I got ticket refunds but not membership fee $79.99. As Frontier claimed that it is non refundable. I look up the flight availability in same week. They completely change their New York Stewart to Tampa route from four times a week to two times a week, plus not even on the same day. I just can’t substitute for a different frontier flight. I can’t even use the membership!! I get the membership specific for this trip. If this is weather conditions or I have to change the reservation, I understand it is non refundable. Frontier Airlines is the one that can’t keep up their service, why customer have to suffer from their scheduled change.

### "So upsetting and disappointing"
Not Verified |  Had a flight going to NC but my flight home was canceled. No other options to fly out unless I wanted to pay 400$ more. I get it was a cheap flight but you’d think hotel option, maybe offer another flight but no. Basically on my own. I will never fly with this airline ever again. I spent the whole day on the phone trying to find a way home. So upsetting and disappointing. Then I was told I’d get my refund in 7 business days. I guess we shall see. I really don’t it. Thanks for nothing Frontier.

### "will never ever fly Frontier"
Atlanta to San Diego. Took my first trip with my 5 month old and Frontier airlines canceled my flight twenty minutes prior to boarding. I had to start the process over again and fly with another airline. Frontier stated “in order to be consistent” we can only offer $500 per passenger in refund even though I had to spend $638 per passenger for same day ticket. I submitted a complaint and they wont refund me money for what was their fault and I’m out over $500! A 5 hour trip turned into 16 hours with a brand new baby and I will never ever fly Frontier again.

### "Very unprofessional behaviour"
They put the cheap price on website just to sell and you get a surprise at the airport where they charge you again gor the carry on as well. They announced there is a gate change and never told flight is delayed. Lady attendant was very rude and threatening to call security. Guess what again they changed the gate to old one again. Very unprofessional behaviour and ridiculous and threatening attitude towards customers.

### "only be receiving $120 back"
Not Verified |  Trying to cancel a flight on Frontier for me and my sister - Cost $650 upon trying to cancel the flight we learn that will only be receiving $120 back. I was told that the cancellation fee will be total in the following format. $100+ per each way of the flight I have no problem paying cancellation fee but a cancellation fee on both end of the flight. The rep was trying to tell me that's the way it is. We are trying to cancel the flight 2-week before the flight so am such they will resale the ticket if don't have take a flight.

### "I haven't got the credit"
We have a flight from Punta Cana to CLT with connection in PHI but unfortunately the TSA lines were very long so we could not make the flight on time. Frontier could not put us to the next flight but instead made us purchase new tickets, get a hotel and transportation. No accommodation was provided. We ended up paying $640 in new tickets, Hotel $150 and UBER to Trenton NJ for the next flight to Charlotte. When I called customer service they offered an airline credit for $627 but this is the time I haven't got the credit, I called today and they said we were only get $127 for the portion we did not used (a joke).

### "poor customer service"
My flight was scheduled to depart at 14:43 from STT to Orlando then to my final destination Atlanta. Instead we departed around 19:30 to San Juan prior to Orlando which was not part of our original route. Finally we arrived in Orlando at 23:30 but had to remain in the plane until 00:20 because Frontier Airline was in the middle of a shift change. I missed my connecting flight and was informed by Frontier Airline that I can be reschedule from Saturday 16/7/2022 to Monday 18/7/2022 at 22:17 hrs with out any food or accommodation. Upon inquiry I was informed that it is not Frontier Airline responsibility to provide food or accommodation despite they took us to a destination that was not part of our original route. Today is 19/7/2022 and I have not be contacted by the Airline. I was informed that I am responsible for finding funds to book a flight from another airline if I desire to arrive at my destination prior to the 48 hrs departure offered. Very limited and poor customer service has been offer and I will not recommend Frontier Airline to anyone.

### "Worst flight experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst flight experience ever. We booked a same day flight to leave DFW at 6 pm - delay after delay after delay. We didn't end up leaving until after midnight. We were delayed at the gate where the agents yelled at us all like children as opposed to calmly communicating to the group of exhausted and confused individuals. We learned that we had purchased tickets to a flight that had no crew and no plane reserved for it. HOW how how do you book people on a flight that you dont even have a plane for. The flight was terrible and uncomfortable, the seats are just a slight step up from a high school football bleacher. Yes, we had drinks and a snack mix but the whole situation was just ridiculous. We were offered a voucher of $50 each that had to be used by the same person within 90 days - completely unacceptable. We were delayed for over 6 hours, and what is my 11 year old going to do with a $50 voucher, not to mention, none of us have any intention of flying Frontier again. I have been in contact via email of late trying to get them to take the vouchers back and simply give me that $150 back on my cc - I'm not expecting anything great considering the responses I've gotten from their customer service team thusly ... but I'm not giving up.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I had the worst flying experience with Frontier. Not only was my flight delayed by 2hours, they let us sit on the plane for almost 2 hours and I missed my connection flight and missed part of my vacation. I had to put out additional money for hotel, clothes, my luggage made the connection flight but I didn't. Frontier Airlines didn't care one bit about this situation they created by the 2 hour delayed. The flight  attendant on board assured us that our connection flight 66 would wait for us since it was also a Frontier flight. But it didn't, it left on time as we were trying to find out where it was by gate number. They don't care about what this has cost people in time and money. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "I will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  I hate Frontier airlines so much. They cancelled my flight from Costa Rica to New York mere hours before the actual flight, told me I'd get refunded my flight plus $600 towards a replacement flight. I spent 3 months emailing their horrible department trying to get my measly $600 (my flight home ended up costing me over $1600), only to have a supervisor tell me that I wasn't eligible for it. I will never fly them again. I wasted hours submitting documents multiple times rather than someone telling me that I wasn't going to receive the money they promised me.

### "I will never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  They charge you for everything that should be included and the only complimentary drink is water after they empty your pockets at the terminal. The flight delays ended in a cancelation the last minute and they offer you the most outrageous impossible booking in their next flight so they do not have to refund you for their cancellation. No hotel stay so you have to sleep on the floor at the gate. The crew blame everything and everyone else for their incompetence. You cannot get a straight answer from anyone. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "We will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my flight and pushed it up a day. Thus, costing me a days pay and an extra night at hotel. On another flight, my dad had an accident so me mom couldn’t use her ticket. When I went to reschedule her flight 3.5 months later (my dad was just well enough), they said her no used ticket expired. When did tickets expire. Not to mention she had a Dr’s note saying she couldn’t leave my dad alone. They were rude and horrible on the phone. We will never fly Frontier again!

### "hesitate to rip you off"
Chicago to Las Vegas. This airline will not hesitate to rip you off. A $650 ticket for two friends to come to Vegas from Chicago incurred an over $400 cancel fee because they had a health emergency. Airline was inflexible with this, even to just let us re-book for a different date. I offered them to do the right thing or steal $400 and incur the loss of a customer that flies 8x a year and get 1-star reviews as many places as I could post it. They chose the $400. This airline has terrible customer service and hopefully capitalism will run its course and shut down this awful company. Plus their seats are uncomfortable. Will never use these guys again. Shame on them.

### "nickel and dime you for everything"
They literally nickel and dime you for everything! You have to pay for your seats (after purchasing the ticket), the carry on bag, checked bag, and snacks. Our flight was delayed and after finally arriving, we had to sit on the plane for over an hour. We were told one place to retrieve our luggage whish was actually, the wrong place. When we did arrive at the correct area, the carousel stopped working. For over another hour and a half we waited. Not one person came out to fix it from Frontier. We didn't get to check into out room until 3:30 am. i tried to file a complaint with Frontier and after waiting on hold for a good 45 minutes was told it needed to be done online. A month later someone finally responded with, "I'm sorry your bags got delayed. I'm sorry you had to wait on the plane for an hour after it landed. I'm sorry your bags got stuck for almost 2 hours delaying your room check in. I then filed a complaint with the BBB and it took them another month to respond. What they offered, and apology of, "I'm sorry your bags got stuck and it took us so long to fix it. Here is a $50 travel voucher to use by October 4th 2022. Furthermore, what is $50? They charge more than that for the carryon bag. I would never fly with these crooks again.

### "I will never fly with this airline again"
Horrible experience. The company is money hungry with hidden fees. I paid for two carryons accidentally but I only had one. I asked for a refund. The front desk attendant gave me a number to call and told me I can receive a refund. I called the frontier office and I was told there were no notes left on my account to receive a refund. I left a complaint and they told me they don’t give refunds for a carryon I did not have! Not only does this airline not work on one accord, they can’t fix a simple problem. If I wanted to scam Why would I only tell them about ONE carryon. I will never fly with this airline again. The lack of customer service is disappointing. After paying $477 they can’t refund me $67? It’s not worth it. Plus no snacks. Just fly with airlines that value customers over money. I attached a photo that shows what they state is non refundable and a carryon is not something they noted to be non refundable.

### "you made time to make a kid happy"
Not Verified |  The pilots of 2386 who saw a 6 year old who was curious about the plane. They showed him the cockpit and engaged him in conversation. He will never forget his first flight. This is how dreams are formed. To those pilots, thank you. I know you were busy getting ready to do your job, but you made time to make a kid happy.

### "Staff in Orlando airport was very rude"
Staff in Orlando airport was very rude. We are in our 80s and we paid for seats with leg space which we need for health reasons. They gave us the worse seats on the plane instead of what we paid for. The flight was very difficult for us. They said we will be refunded for the seats fee but that didn't happen, we had to challenge the payment with the credit card company.

### "Will not fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Checked in 3.5 hours early. Took an extra 30 minutes or so to take off from scheduled time. No Wi-Fi on plane even though it’s advertised everywhere. After we land we wait at baggage claim for 2 hours. The trolley belt kept breaking and taking 20-30 minutes to start again. After 2 hours we went to the baggage service desk and we were told our bag didn’t make it on that flight in time, despite having checked it in 3.5 hours prior to our flight. They say the next flight in will have our bag 9am the next morning. On our way home they call and say they found out. Horrific and embarrassing company. Will not fly Frontier again.

### "refused to waive its own change fees"
Not Verified |  My son and I were visiting Yellowstone National Park and were supposed to fly home from Denver, CO to Phoenix, AZ. However, due to the historic flooding and mandatory emergency evacuation of Yellowstone through the west exit, and snow storm preventing travel along the two northern routes to Colorado, we were unable to make it back to Denver, and had to switch our return flight to be from Salt Lake City, Utah. Frontier refused to waive its own change fees, so exploited and profited from a natural disaster and mandatory evacuation.

### "absolutely atrocious"
Denver to New Orleans. This was absolutely atrocious and I would rather drive 18.5 hours than fly with Frontier again. Flight canceled, fine, that happens, first we were told for weather then it turned into a broken wing, then offered a refund or a new flight 3 days later, no comp for hotel stay. Flight with another airline to get home in time for work was only half my refund. Staff said "your options are refund or fly out Monday, all other requests will be denied

### "No more Frontier bookings"
Not Verified | Milwaukee to Phoenix. My flight from Phoenix to Milwaukee on American was canceled. I was suppose to fly Frontier from Milwaukee to Phoenix 6 days later. When I called Frontier to ask for a refund, I was told that it wasn't their fault that my flight was canceled, so I would not be entitled to a refund. Noted, I gave them a 6 day notice, plenty of time to fill up my seat. They didn't even offer me a a partial refund. No more Frontier Airline bookings from me.

### "The day of they canceled my flight"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying with Frontier, so I didn’t know what to expect. The day of they canceled my flight sending an email around 6 in the morning (my flight left around 10). They offered compensation for a new flight but didn’t even pay for the full amount, forcing me to pay more just to get another flight after they canceled on me. I bought insurance and they seemed to be no help either in helping, what’s the point in even paying?

### "I would never go back to this airline"
Not Verified |  I would never go back to this airline, it is very unorganized, they changed our flights 4 times and then still delayed the flight 2 times. We bought direct flights and they changed them to ones with stops, the seats are as hard as a rock and they have no entertainment. I wouldn’t ever recommend Frontier Airlines.

### "a mistake I will never repeat"
Not Verified |  Website says check in "at least 2 hrs" before your flight. Apparently, after waiting on line to check in for an hour after our original flight got bumped 4 hours out, we were told we couldn't check in until 2 hrs before the flight. This was post nowhere online or near check in. After stating that to the check in attendants, they said "we don't manage the website/info" then called for the next in line. So after hanging in the airport for hours for a flight they bumped out 4 hours, I got to get on line for another hour to check in again in which they decided to take a break and not decide to do any work until 20 mins in. I know I'm not the only ones there since all the other customers were expressing the same opinions. We will never use Frontier or Spirit airlines again. This is a mistake I will never repeat.

### "treated as if I did not pay for my ticket"
I checked in via the mobile app 2 hours before the fight. I got the airport 1 hour before the flight, there was only 1 working kiosk to check in baggage. After waiting 15 mins for my turn the kiosk stated it too late to check in by 1 min and to see an agent at the counter. Wait in another long line for 15 mins just so a rude agent can tell me that I’m 30mins late and I have to pay $99 to rebook. When I ask when is the next flight I’m told they couldn’t give me that information at the moment and I must stand to the side while the check in others. I asked for a manager, I was told it could take 4 hours for a manager. I missed the flight and had to book with another carrier. Worst checkin experience ever. I was treated as if I did not pay for my ticket.

### "Never again will I buy from Frontier!"
Return flight set for 5/30 was missed due to Cancun Frontier staff rearranging people in different lines causing confusion. We all were there 3 hrs ahead but by time some of us made it to the counter our gate was closed and they wouldn't let us board. They didn't accommodate with vouchers for taxis or rooms and pretty much forced you to buy a new tix home. 6 of us missed our flights. I called CS twice saying they made us miss it and they didn't apologize or try to make up for it. I paid an extra $266 to take a damn layover in PHL to get to Atlanta from Cancun. A 2.5 hr flight took 8 hrs! Never again will I buy from Frontier!

### "the worst airline I have flown on"
Not Verified |  If I could rate this airline 0 I would in a heartbeat. There is no strong ethics on this airline. All they want to do is take your money and drop your bags off at your destination. Uncomfortable seats with an uncomfortably fully blasted air conditioning unit set very low to get you shivering. My family and I had our plane booked ready to go for 3:30 PM June 19th, 2022. We were “delayed” many times for countless reasons. Having the people guess what is going on. Are we really getting home tonight?” “Should I book another flight?” This is not something one wants to do on vacation. But that’s okay, Frontier Airlines will make you know they don’t care what you do. They might compensate you a $15 gift card instead of a slap in the face. But, whatever you prefer. I have a train to get tomorrow morning at 6:00 AM leaving out of Baltimore. Frontier Airlines does not seem to think others have anything else going on besides their airlines flights i’m assuming. Who lets a group of people waiting to board an airplane wait 5-8 hours with no real compensation? No empathy throughout the workers on the boarding line. Just deal with it and move on type of attitude. Never again will I fly with Frontier Airlines. Hands down, the worst airline I have flown on.

### "Seats feel like you are sitting on bricks"
Not Verified |  Original departure time delayed by 2.5 hours with zero notice of delay emailed or texted to me. Had to wait for flight attendant to arrive. Then had to wait for “SO” to arrive after all passengers had been seated. Sat and waited on the plane at the gate. No USB chargers on plane. Trays about the size of 2 decks of playing cards -worthless. Nickel & dime you on luggage and carry on items. Seats feel like you are sitting on bricks. Air conditioning on too high, no blankets available. You end up spending about the same as other carriers when you add up all of the charges. Used to be a decent airline. Not so much anymore.

### "Horrible end to a beautiful vacation!"
Just had my first and last experience with Frontier. It was awful! Landed around 4.40 but couldn’t get off the plane until after 6.30, then we’re told all our luggage was put on a flight to Florida and to talk with the representative at baggage claim. When we got to baggage claim we were told no one from Frontier was there to assist us and to call and file a claim. Called to file and claim and was told to go online and file. So have just finally gotten my claim filed yet still have no idea when I’ll receive all my belongings. Horrible end to a beautiful vacation!

### "refund is still unresolved"
Denver to Nashville. This is the 3rd time in 60 days they have cancelled this flight. This time it was me and 7 passengers. They cancelled the flight about 4 hours before it was to depart. I was forced to spend 3 times as much to divert to another airport to get where I needed to go and incur many other expenses. They sent me $50 vouchers per person and apparently thought that was the end of it. That didn't even meet the original ticket price and they didn't refund my original purchase on my credit card. My least favorite part of Frontier is calling their customer service as it is impossible to understand them without having them repeat themselves many times, I was also disconnected from them twice and kept on hold as long as 30 minutes per call. My problem of a refund is still unresolved and that seems to be very typical of Frontier. I am a member of their 100k club (elite in the Frontier world) so I can only imagine everyone else gets the same treatment or worse.

### "Customer service is horrible"
Frontier is by far the worst airline. Customer service is horrible, Attendants are either poorly trained or completely incompetent to do their jobs. The organization all around is lacking and the communication is horrible. I bought the Works and did not get any perks. This airline is a joke and will not be around in the next 5 years unless it makes some drastic changes.

### "no one knows where my luggage is"
Not Verified |  I boarded my flight in Vegas at 11:45pm 05/30/22 after paying $70.00 to ensure my bag landed in Atlanta when I arrived. I had a four hour layover in Chicago (Midway airport) and then I landed in Atlanta airport at 1:00pm on 05/31/22 only to find out that my bag was not at the carousel. I proceeded to Frontier baggage desk to speak with a representative who assured me that all bags had been pulled and she did not see a black bag with gold trim. She had me complete a paper claim form for Frontier, and when I completed I asked for a claim number. She responded by saying that she has to wait four hours before she can file an official claim. (I later found out that was a lie, because it says on the document that I filled out to file claim within 60 minutes). I spoke with Chicago Frontier the next day (06/01) who exclaimed that they had possession of my bag, and it would be on a flight to Atlanta that afternoon at 8pm. By 8pm I hadn't heard from anyone at the Atlanta airport and the phones were not being answered. So I went to the airport (wasting gas) to check to see if my bag was in their office from the flight, and to my surprise it was not. I called Chicago back only to find out that the lady who promised me a refund and said she'd get my bag on flight was from 1st shift and 2nd shift did not follow instructions. The lady in Chicago assured us (me and ATL Frontier rep) that she was taking the bag to the next flight now. Unfortunately the next flight that would reach Atlanta would fly to Vegas first and then Atlanta by 5am. I did not hear anything from Atlanta the next day, so instead of wasting gas and paying for parking, I called them back. No bag! Fast forward: Here we are 17 days later from my landing in Atlanta and no one knows where my luggage is, nor does anyone have the decency and professionalism enough to even pick up the phone and update me on attempts to locate my bag with all of my belongings in it.

### "Frontier Airlines has demonstrated that they do not value their customers"
Not Verified |  Our flight was scheduled for 5:30am departure, we arrived and the line for check in was ridiculously long, we made it through and then the TSA line was 4 times as long. Got thru the TSA finally and arrived at the gate at 5.00 am, and we were not allowed to board. Our bags were sent on that flight and we were unable to rebook another flight until tomorrow morning at the same time. There was a dozen people who were not allowed to board 1/2 an hour prior to departure, and the flight was listed as delayed! One couple that was turned away were going to Tampa to board a cruise ship. Their luggage was on the same flight that that ours was. From the 2.00 am start to finish, Frontier Airlines has demonstrated that they do not value their customers nor their customer’s time! I have never seen such an inept group of rude, and uninformed airline staff in my life! Every question we asked was met with I don’t know, one whole vacation day wasted! We will never fly Frontier Airlines again!

### "told that my flight was cancelled"
For my return trip home on May 22, 2022 on Flight 1063, which was scheduled to depart from CVG @ 0745, I arrived to the airport early. Unfortunately, Frontier Airlines was the only station that was not staffed early. When I finally was able to reach a Frontier Airlines customer service representative, I was told that my flight was cancelled "due to maintenance. I was handed a piece of paper explaining my options - but Frontier Airlines provided no options. I was forced to scramble to arrange another flight with another airline. As a result, I was required to pay $1,000.00 to Delta Airlines to acquire a last minute flight. Frontier Airlines offer no prior notification of my cancellation, and as a result I missed a day of work. I am a RN and I work in an emergency department.

### "might be the worst airline business"
Not Verified |  Oversold the flight which caused an hour delay and another delay on the tarmac then more delays at the destination airport. All because they oversold the flight. Thus might be the worst airline business in the country. If you live to sit on the tarmac book with this joke of an airline.

### "Extremely poor service in every way"
Flight was canceled after spending 2 hours on the tarmac. Was told that they couldn’t get us home until Saturday or Sunday and it was only Wednesday. Told they have no ability to book us on another airline and also told we would have to travel to Miami for the next flight. There was no apology and no offer to accommodate us in any way but to refund our ticket cost. We were stranded over 2000 miles from home and had to pay $500 to another airline , $200 for a hotel room and $50 for an Uber from Ft Lauderdale to Miami for a flight the next day. Extremely poor service in every way.

### "stranded my wife and I"
Not Verified |  This airline stranded my wife and I a thousand miles and refused to help us with lodging or food vouchers or any assistance other than to rebook our flight for multiple days away. We had no choice other than to accept their offer of a later flight at another date and time to another destination which is four hours away and will have to gain transportation to pick up our parked vehicle at the other airport. They did offer to refund in 7-10 days but they took my money instantly. Where would we stay and eat? Travelocity which is owned by Expedia is just as poor. Failed to offer any assistance. As a result they will not be getting anymore of my annual business, nor my friends or family and they will never gain a positive review from this customer.

### "No recourse for customers"
Ontario to Denver. Last minute flight change and 12 hours, from 5 pm to 5 am. No option to cancel flight/change schedule online, forced to spend an hour on hold. Customer service rep tried to charge $35 for phone support. No recourse for customers. Airline changed passenger name on ticket to a misspelled version, previous confirmation email had correct spelling, thus proving it was the fault of the airline. Customer service tried to charge $75 "name change fee" to rectify this. Generally, you get what you pay for with super cheap tickets - but in this case didn't even get that.

### "never fly Frontier, they make Spirit look like a luxury line"
So this flight was overbooked. They asked for volunteers to take a later flight, my husband and I volunteered but weren’t picked. In the meantime they gave our seats that I paid extra for away and split us up for our flight, the flight was over an hour late leaving while they were shuffling people around. When we landed we had no gate and were stuck on the plane for another hour. The flight attendants were rude and offered nobody any kind of complimentary refreshment considering the overall awfulness of the flight. Do yourself a favor and never fly Frontier, they make Spirit look like a luxury line.

### "Always pleasant to travel"
Denver to Sioux Falls. Always pleasant to travel on Frontier. Polite staff on time easy to board. Great value too! I bring my own water and healthy snacks so I don't mind that they charge for their snacks.

### "no credit is offered"
I had to cancel my flight. Not only was the cancellation fee the same amount as my purchase price, but no credit is offered toward a future flight. I didn't expect a refund, the fare was nonrefundable but every other airline I have ever used gives a credit or partial credit towards a future flight. There was zero benefit to cancelling. I should have just no showed so they couldn't resell the tickets.

### "We will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  After a lengthy delay our flight was finally cancelled. No flights available the next day back to Trenton where our car was, so we opted for the choice of booking another airline and flying into EWR. We then had to rent a car to get back to TTN and there was an additional day of parking lot we had to pay for. We were told we would receive a refund in 4-6 weeks, why it takes that long when they can certainly charge our credit card so quickly is beyond me. We finally received a refund but it took 11 weeks. We will never fly this airline again. The seats do not recline, service onboard terrible and the boarding area much like a bus depot. You get what you pay for.

### "3 months later still fighting for a refund"
Not Verified |  I arrived for my flight 3 hours early. Their self check in did not print my luggage pass so I had to stand in line. There was 1 person working and the line was at least 80-90 people long when I got in line. Finally half way through the line and over a hour later another person came to help. I finally got my luggage check in and made it to the security line. Well after standing in the luggage line over a hour and TSA line, I missed my flight. I wasn’t the only person, over 80 people missed their flight because of the luggage line. Most were told when they tried to check their luggage that they couldn’t check their bags because it was too late. So we all sat in line to speak to a manager for over 2 hours. I was told I would be refunded for my flight because I had to pay over $600 for another flight to get home. 3 months later still fighting for a refund. The customer service has been disgusting to say the least. Do not fly with them you will be highly disappointed

### "absolute worst airline"
Not Verified | Atlanta to Denver. This is the absolute worst airline EVER! Their customer service is non-existent! Purchased their "flight flexibility" only to still be charged fees out the wazoo, even though I did as instructed and made my changes 24 hours before departure. Apparently the new flight I selected was full, but it didn't inform me of that when I selected it as my new flight! They refused to simply give me a different flight of equal or lesser value. Spent $178 and ended up with a $20 some credit! I told them to keep their $20 and kiss this customer goodbye! They could care less, of course, but I just had to vent!

### "This is unacceptable"
A passenger assaulted me on flight 1103 on 05/20/2022 from Orlando to Las Vegas during the deplaning process. I notified the flight attendant, she told me to tell the gate agent. I notified the gate agent, they did nothing. They said there will be an internal investigation, but did not provide me with case number or follow up phone number, nothing. I pointed out the passenger to both of these people as he deplaned, neither Frontier team member attempted to stop the passenger to investigate. I was told to call the Vegas office I wanted them to call the airport police, but Frontier did nothing. The other passenger disappeared. It blew me away that not one team member knew how to navigate this situation and just kicked the can down the road. I also went to the frontier luggage clerk and she replied to my issue by saying “carousel 23”. After I explained the situation again, she said ‘I’m just the luggage clerk’. I fly dozens of trips per year on other airlines I am confident they would have helped me differently. This is unacceptable. It’s amazing that after approaching three different Frontier team members, not one intervened, took hold of this situation, and/or addressed it. I have messaged Frontier on their Facebook page, and answered an email review. i have been ignored.

### "customer service is horrible and frustrating"
Not Verified |  I booked 2 tickets in January for travel in July. Frontier changed my flights 3 times. The third time was on May 27th in the evening. I was unable to change the flights on line and spent 1 hour and 53 minutes on hold before I was able to speak with a customer service representative. I was finally told my tickets would have to be canceled as Frontier had no other options for me. Their customer service is horrible and frustrating. I ended up rebooking with United Airlines at an additional cost of $1,100.00. I can assure you that I will never choose Frontier Airlines again.

### "Customer service is atrocious"
Not Verified | Literally no worse airline out there. They bait you with a cheap ticket but then the baggage costs add up quickly. You have to pay for a drink/snack on the plane. Seats are awful and uncomfortable. They do not recline. Customer service is atrocious. We missed our flight due to multiple flights leaving around the same time and there were no workers available to handle the load.

### "disappointed all passengers"
Dallas to Miami. Frontier Airlines has disappointed all its passengers today. My flight has been delayed for more than 2 hours and we did not get any compensation. Additionally, instead of providing compensation, the staff with its horrible service troubled me as I was only carrying one personal item and since they wanted money, they were forcing me to pay the price of a carry-on. The staff bothered and irritated me by continuously saying that the dimensions of the personal item were not correct. I will never travel with Frontier again. I would recommend every passenger to go with Spirit, American, Southwest.

### "Worst experience I’ve ever had"
Worst experience I’ve ever had on an airline. First, the correct destination was not displayed at the gate and no one had the courtesy to change the destination to the correct one and staff were hiding behind the counter away from passengers not wanting to answer questions. Second, the flight was delayed from 7pm-9.20 pm then from 9.20pm-12.47 am until it was ultimately canceled with no details as to why it was canceled. The only directions we were given was go to the ticket counter to get a refund and try to find your bags at the carousel. No one knew where to go, no staff knew which carousel the checked bags would be at and no cash refunds were given after standing in line for 1 1/2 hours. No staff at the ticket counters knew how to help, pretty much just said I’m sorry I don’t know what to do for you. No hotels were covered and the best they could say was "the next flight out is on the 30th of May...4 days from now". If you want a smooth flight with competent staff do not fly Frontier Airlines.

### "2 months later did not get reimbursed"
They lie and cheat and leave you stranded. We waited in a lay over for 5 hours to find out last minute at 10 pm our flight was cancelled. We were given a letter and told to find another airline to fly and we would get reimbursed. 2 months later did not get reimbursed for alternate flights needed to get to destination a day later. Contacted every avenue of customer service provided all needed documents. They all lie and say it will be taken care of but it's not.

### "people were confused and frustrated"
This airline is garbage. The staff greeting us at the gate were difficult to understand and extremely unpleasant to all those boarding. Due to maintenance issues, our flight was delayed for an hour. The communication was incredibly difficult from the staff and many people were confused and frustrated. Not only that, but this flight was severely bumpy— I’m not normally afraid of flying, I fly all the time— but this airline had me scared for my life the majority of the flight. I recommend not ever flying with this airline. Not only was the service horrendous, the flying concerning, the seating uncomfortable and stuffy, the pilot wouldn’t stop promoting their credit card promotion over the speakers. Incredibly annoying and certainly not comforting. And once we landed, we didn’t arrive at our gate for over 30 minutes. A lot of things need to change before I say a good thing about frontier airlines.

### "I learned my lesson, never again"
Departing Islip to Orlando 3.5 hour delay, returning from MCO to ISP my boarding pass seat said 0 why? Because they overbooked the flight not by by 1 or 2 people more like 10 people! So they are now asking people who would like to “volunteer” their seats?! My husband had to go to work the next day and I’m begging to get on the plane. Someone else wrote you get what you pay for and with this airline its true. Not worth the aggravation of saving a few dollars when my anxiety level went through the roof. Bottom line saving a few dollars simply is not worth your peace of mind. I learned my lesson, never again.

### "Frontier has not had the decency to respond to me"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Frontier again. First, they canceled my flight without notifying me. The cancellation was not even on their app. I rescheduled for the next day. That flight was so late, I barely made it to my connecting flight. Information given by flight attendants was wrong. My baggage didn’t make the connecting flight. I called Frontier four times trying to get information about my baggage. The first two calls provided no help at all. The third call was disconnected by Frontier. On the fourth call, I finally got to speak to a human. She kept telling me, “You need to understand…” No. Frontier needs to understand. Frontier messed up. I did not. Frontier has not had the decency to respond to me. I received an email flight verification 47.5 hours after I landed at PDX. I received an email offering free flights for mom. Book by May 8. I got it on May 11. In a survey request I responded to, I said their customer service is appalling. That isn’t true. Their customer service isn’t that good. It’s non-existent. I believe they should compensate me for the inconvenience, hassle, rudeness and stress their ineptitude caused me. Not just the $47 baggage check fee. The ball is in your court. I await your response.

### "I will never deal with this airline again"
Not Verified |  I booked four one way flights for my daughter and grandchildren yesterday online with Frontier Airlines. After booking the flights, yesterday afternoon, I find cheaper flights on Delta Airlines. I called Frontier to let them know I wanted to cancel because I found a cheaper flight. I was informed that there would be a $75 cancellation fee per ticket (almost more than the flights). I had booked four tickets. I informed the gentleman on the phone that I was not informed of a cancellation fee when I booked the flights and would be calling my credit card company. He hung up the phone on me. I called back and was transferred to someone (without being informed the call was being transferred to someone else). This person told me the same thing. I informed her that I checked the website and it said that I could cancel within 24 hours without a fee. She hung up on me as well. I called back and someone picked the phone up without saying anything hung up (they must have caller ID) so I called from my house phone. This agent seemed nice, but said he couldn’t find my reservation with the confirmation number. I ended up going to their website and cancelling the flight (no cancellation fee). I will never deal with this airline again and if you know what is right, you won’t either!

### "trust me their add on prices quickly make you double take"
Flying with Frontier was definitely an experience. I had booked an economy flight off Hopper for $126 originally out of OKC, 1 day prior to my trip, the flight is cancelled. I search again and a flight at the same time as the one I had before was posted for significantly increased fare, like $310. So I decided to drive down to DFW for cheaper tickets. And then I realized how they rope you in. The base fare of a ticket is really cheap and catches your eye. Reality soon kicks in as you have to pay for carry-ons back and forth instead of a one time purchase. I understand checked baggage but why the back and forth price. When it’s all said and done, your payment will be at least 3-4 times what you thought you were going to pay for a flight that honestly isn’t that good. In flight, refreshments require payment. They push their credit card extremely hard as well. The plane seats were pretty uncomfortable. Flying back to Dallas from Vegas, our flight got delayed 3 hours. They do keep you updated at least. The app is honestly a star, which was surprising. All in all, would I fly Frontier again? A big no! The predatory pricing for a flight that really kinda sucks is not my thing. You are better paying for a slightly more expensive ticket from Delta and having a good experience. Yes the prices look great at first, but trust me their add on prices quickly make you double take.

### "I will never book this flight again"
I Can’t even start to say how devastating and depressing everything about this flight is. I had a flight for 5:13am that was delayed until 11pm, & now it’s 1:52am. I’m standing here extremely exhausted waiting for my bags to come out. Just been told it will be an hour wait because they only have one person working. I have missed all of the important events with my family today, I was deprived from so many things. I will never book this flight again.

### "the absolute worst company to fly with"
Not Verified |  This is the absolute worst company to fly with. Half of my flight were exhausted passengers whose flight got delayed for hours before finally getting cancelled the night before around 1am. We were supposed to take off at 10am and at 4pm they finally cancelled it after we on boarded and off boarded twice without a single apology. There was a family behind me with two babies and the father calmly asked one of the crew members if he could get any food for his toddler since the extreme delay led to them running out. The crew member was loudly berating this man for being selfish and impatient and we were shocked. It has been over two weeks and I’m still waiting for my refund from them. I called customer service and the person on the other end was so clueless and dismissive that after 30 minutes, he still couldn’t tell me anything about my case. the last thing he said before I hung up in frustration was “you should just wait four more weeks and then call us back.” It is worth it to spend a little more for a reputable airline like Delta. I have flown with them and even in todays climate they pay off.

### "ground and cabin staff pleasant"
My first time with Frontier, and a reluctant choice because of previous adverse reviews and the limited seat pitch of 29 ins. If I had opted to pay for seat selection, the round trip fare would have been as high as the legacy airline offerings, so I left matters to chance. Middle seat outbound was no joy, aisle seat returning. Flights were on time and I found ground and cabin staff pleasant and seemingly well motivated. The seat contours helped with legroom, but they are hard to endure over +2 hours flying time. The experience was akin to a long ride on a city transit bus. A lot of us oldies were groaning when the time came to deplane.

### "isn't focused on the customer"
Back in March of this year they changed their bag weight "policy" of allowing a 40 pound checked bag, when they used to permit 50. It clearly says 50 pounds on their boarding pass. And after calling and complaining, and trying to get the $50 back for the 6 pounds we were over, yes 6 pounds, they refused to give us the $50 back. They kept mentioning "policy, policy, policy. And don't get me started on all the other nonsense we had to deal with with the flight. A mechanical issue, which delayed us 2 HOURS, and then they proceeded to board us even though they had yet to sort out the mechanical issue. So we sat on the airplane for another 2 hours before this was sorted out. Why would an airline board passengers if the mechanical issue had yet to be sorted out? It's too bad! Frontier used to be a great airline back in the day. Now it's an airline that obviously isn't focused on the customer. Never again, Frontier! Never again! And for those that fly Frontier, beware! By the time they charge you for every  little thing, you would still be further ahead flying with an airline that charges more (and provides better service).

### "never forget this horrible experience"
We lost $1000 because of a last minute terminal change, staff’s unwillingness to help, and suspicious behavior related to overbooking flights. We arrived at the airport 2hrs earlier around 4pm (the flight was leaving around 6). We sat at gate E10 which was packed and waited. One flight before us, going to Charlotte, North Carolina was running late due to a missing airplane captain. We still sat at gate E10. The screen still read, Savannah, Georgia. It was almost time for our flight to leave. Then the Frontier employee made an offhand remark, saying “Oh, if you’re going to Savannah, Georgia, you need to board at gate E7.” We immediately crossed right over to the waiting area in gate 7 that was empty. I noticed that there was no plane parked at the gate. The screen read “Miami on time” with no sign of Savannah, Georgia. We received a text from my daughter’s boyfriend who was tracking our flight online saying that the plane left at Gate E7 10 mins earlier, and sent a screenshot. We had not seen anyone board the plane the entire time we sat at gate E7. There was another man who had the same problem, and was yelling at the employee, “But they only announced it once! They announced it after the plane left. The Frontier employee just told him that it was repeated multiple times that the gate changed and it was his fault he missed his flight. We walked up to the Frontier employee and told her we too only heard the warning once to which she replied, “There’s no way you missed boarding for your flight if you were sitting at the right gate. You must’ve not been sitting at the right spot. I told you all multiple times. You just missed your flight. All I can tell you is to book another flight. There are no more going to Savannah.” She turned her back on us and proceeded to look at her phone. Her coworker told us, “You can rebook at the ticket booth”. We walked to the ticket booth seeking for better help and received none. We were told that “There are no more flights to Savannah. It is your fault you missed the flight.” We’ve never lost this much money before. We will never forget this horrible experience we encountered with Frontier Airlines

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Do not fly, I have been here at the airport since 4.30am, flight got delayed until 11, now here it is almost 1pm and still here. Worst customer service, the agents behind the desk don’t know anything so I don’t know why they are working.

### "Terrible airline!"
Terrible airline! Delayed for over 7 hours with no respect of time to recourse. Boarded the plane and waited another 1.5 before we left from the gate! Terrible, terrible, terrible.

### "They refuse to give me my money back"
System was down. Sat in line for 3.5 hours. I get that happens. Opened an incident report because we paid extra to pick seats for 14 tickets. They refuse to give me my money back. Even after supplying them with everything they asked for. I would give a zero if it let me!

### "I refuse to fly Frontier ever again!"
This airline is just terrible in quality and service. They are on their last leg and will take your money only to provide you with the worst flight. If you call for customer service you only get individuals with a language barrier spewing policy from a piece of paper. I lost my child on the day I was supposed to depart but had to cancel to go to the hospital. This airlines refuses to refund me any of the 500 cash that I paid and only will give me 90 days to use 200 of it as a credit. Even after explaining my situation of bereavement they refuse to refund me anything after making me provide proof of his death certificate. I refuse to fly Frontier ever again!

### "If you like being late Frontier is the airline for you,"
If you like being late to your destination Frontier is the airline for you, they boarded half of the people on the jet then kicked everyone off, delayed a bunch and wouldn’t communicate the problems. Only some of the staff are nice, cough cough the flight attendants kudos to them, the rest are flat out disrespectful to guests. If I could give it a 0 I would.

### "final straw with Frontier"
Not Verified | Austin to Denver. I booked 2 tickets well in advance just to have them cancelled after I had arrived at the airport (2-hour drive), with no explanation or attempt to rebook for the same day. I ended up spending 5X the amount to fly that day with another airline because I could not wait for the next day to potentially be cancelled as well. I am now hoping to get my money refunded, mind you, it doesn't even touch the cost of same-day airfare with another carrier that had I booked with them originally instead would have been much less expensive. I do not care how "cheap" these flights appear, I will never book with Frontier or any of their merged airlines again! FYI, I frequently book for 6-10 passengers at a time. This is the final straw with Frontier.

### "Absolutely worst experience ever!"
Absolutely worst experience ever! Tell us we’ll be an hour early only to be delayed for 2 hours before even taking off. Don’t offer us any water, snacks, or beverages. You absolutely suck Frontier. First time flying Frontier and never again. Just like Spirit Airlines.

### "We will never fly you again!"
Got to the airport with a family of 5, one being 18 month old 2 hours ahead. So 4 am in line to drop our bags since we had already checked in, 1-1/4 hours just for the bag drop, one person working! With the fees we paid on top of the flight cost $588 for baggage and $288 for our seats. You think they could hire more staff. Then approached to security line and another long wait! Tore the diaper bag apart. Then had to test the liquid (milk) more time. Boarded 10 minutes to spare. We were just notified we had to wait for 20 more passengers from another connecting flight, ) 40 minutes we waited in the cramped seat to take off. We finally take off and service comes around, wait what happened to free soda or coffee! Now $3.25 for a drink. Well Frontier you can keep you fees, low staffing, small seats. We will never fly you again!

### "you won’t regret avoiding Frontier"
The St Louis to Cancun route is never on time. I’ve flown it many times (unfortunately) and hate it. I understand the additional fees and discount tickets; this isn’t about those things. This is about the reliability of the airline. Plus, the plane is cramped, crew is unfriendly, and generally the experience is awful. Fly literally anything else, you won’t regret avoiding Frontier.

### "I’ll never fly with them again after this"
Worst airline experience ever, I got to the airport almost an hour and half early. Had to wait in line for about 45 minutes and when I finally got up to the front with 32 minutes until my flight the attendant told me I missed it. I told her no I didn’t I was still on time. She said no it needs to be 45 minutes before hand which I have never ever heard of. To reiterate I waiting and was late because of their poor staffing, then paid them for it and had to wait fifteen hours until my next flight. Frontier is an unbelievably poor airline and I’ll never fly with them again after this.

### "my worst experience ever"
This was my worst experience ever I have had flying with an airline. It all started in DFW, everything was so confusing as the crowd did not know where to get in line. Finally after 45 minutes standing the rude attendant tells us and other that we have to get out of the line and wait till two hours prior to departure to check our bags in. We waited and checked back in and was told our baggage fee is $69. we mentioned that we normally don’t pay as my husband is retiring military, but again was told they don’t honor that. When waiting on the plane the screens keep on showing a different State instead of ATL so we asked and was told that it’s the right gate. We were delayed by over an hour, however nothing showed the delay. There was no communication by the attendants. Just horrible! The flight attendants were in the back of the plane talking loud and having fun, I guess it didn’t bother them there were people on board. This airline is out of control, the workers need to be trained by professionally trained personnel from other airlines on protocols. Never again will I consider Frontier now will I receive to anyone.

### "use another airline"
I purchased a flight for $124, it cost me half of that ($60) to bring one suitcase. When I arrived for check-in my baggage was deemed “overweight”, and I was charged and additional $100 in order for my baggage to be boarded on the aircraft, which brought my total to almost $300 to fly. The aircraft was unpleasantly over packed. Not to mention that the seats are as hard as bricks! Nothing is complimentary, and everything is astronomically priced. After our 3 hour commute to Denver, we were forced to wait on the runway for an additional hour before we could off load the aircraft. We finally got off of the aircraft and made our way to baggage claim, only to find out that my and several passengers baggage were not loaded onto the aircraft. My wife and I called the Green and white airline provider, and were rudely informed that I was the reason that the baggage did not get boarded on the aircraft. I guess this was their attempt at shifting the blame to the customer. I’m in Denver on business without any of my belongings, which means I’m essentially here spending money unnecessarily, because I literally can’t work. I’ve tried calling the number that was given to me 3 times since I left the airport, and 3 times no answer. Save yourself the headache and use another airline, you won’t come out cheaper flying Frontier.

### "I will never use them again"
Not Verified |  Get to DFW 4.5 hours early for our flight. Will be going to the Capitol One lounge. Go to check bag and find out you can only check a bag 2 hours prior to flight, can’t take big bag through security where the lounge is located, so forced to sit outside security and wait 2.5 hours just to check the bag so we can go through security. This was the last straw after many issues prior with Frontier. They lost 2 customers today, I will never use them again.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  I don't have anything bad to say about my experience with Frontier. I thought their staff were friendly, plane was clean and they did a great job. Even when our flight got diverted, the Captain kept us in the know and the flight attendants were professional and courteous. Since I had heard so much about Frontier, I was hesitant to book with them but I was pleasantly surprised.

### "they do nothing for customer service2
Not Verified |  This airline double charge me for a ticket. I saw it on my bank account statement, they double charge me on the very same day that the 1st ticket was booked. I called to ask about this, they blamed it on the booking company and the booking company said that it was definitely Frontier Airlines that charged the duplicate ticket and according to my bank statement it's coming directly from their denver headquarters so they definitely did it. They argued with me for an hour on the phone refusing to do anything about their mistake, blaming me for it and making me pay for the errors. I would advise all people to never trust most of the booking companies out there and most importantly don't deal with Frontier, they do nothing for customer service.

### "would not reimburse the cancelled flight"
We got to the airport waited in line for 3 hours made it to our gate to find out your pilot didnt show up and our flight was cancelled. We then waited in line for 6 hours waiting to speak with frontier customer service where frontier employees were yelling and screaming. We were told in the video frontier would not be helping anyone in line and we are wasting our time waiting. We finally got to the front of line and were advised frontier had no available flights for an additional five days which would have cost us to lose our jobs. We were told we would be reimbursed for our cancelled flight, hotel stays if needed, as well as a flight through another airline. We tried renting a car to drive home but all rental cars for multiple airports were sold out due to cancelled flights. We called dozens of hotels that were all completely booked again due to cancelled flights. We went to every airline trying to find flights and finally found one through united three days later and then booked a hotel. We would have never incurred any of these purchases if it wasnt for frontiers cancelled flight. We filed out reimbursement per our instructions from frontier to find out they would not reimburse the cancelled flight. They would only refund our flight from United airlines for $300 even though it cost us well over that per passenger. And they would not refund our hotel as the airline did not provide us an authorization letter which we would have asked for if we knew it was a thing we needed. No frontier employee ever advised we would need such a document. I spent well over a combined 20+ hours on hold with multiple customer service representatives and managers who not only gave attitude to our situation but also hung up on me several time despite us trying to be extremely calm. We got absolutely no where with frontier and even with their lousy partial refund we are still out over $1500 between uber rides as all rentals cars were sold out, hotel, food, water, etc. Do not ever recommend and will never fly frontier again.

### "Worst flight experience to date"
Worst flight experience to date. The return flight home was cancelled and moved 36 hours to the right. Both flights of the rescheduled date were delayed increasing the layover time to almost 9 hours. Terminal desk was not staffed until long after the adjusted boarding time making it impossible to clarify reasoning with someone in person. 4Associated customer service desk was also not staffed with the Denver airport.

### "rather walk than to pay to fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  My flight was scheduled to leave at 5:05 on the first of 2022. I arrived at the airport and cleared TAS at 3:30. While waiting at gate E6 I noticed that the boarding time had changed to 8:09!? No gate agent! Then 9:09 still no gate agent! Then 10:35 it’s after 6pm at this point and not one representative from the airline came to explain anything. At 7:30 I started calling the customer service number only to be on the line for over an hour. I walked the airport looking for any Frontier gate agent. When I found one she assured me our flight would be arriving at 10:00pm and leaving at 10:35pm. Satisfied with that information I walked back to my gate only to see that time of arrival was now 6:00am on May 2nd. That wasn’t a confirmed flight it was tentative! Through customer service I was booked for a scheduled 3:30 pm flight on the 2nd but not given hotel accommodations I live in SC! I waiting hours to speak with a supervisor who refused to come talk to me at the ticket counter as customer service cannot issues hotel vouchers! I had to pay out of pocket, I hope I’m actually able to board this flight today and get home! I would rather walk than to pay to fly Frontier again!

### "worst experience ever with an airline"
This is the worst experience ever with an airline. My ticket was purchased by my colleague for me for a business trip. My 1st leg of the return flight was on Frontier, which is horrible, to Orlando. My connecting flight was on Jet Blue from Orlando to my final destination. Well my bag never made it to JetBlue even after I had explained at check-in my connecting flight was on Jet Blue. They assured me me it would get there. That did not happen. The bag was left in Orlando because they stated thats as far as it was tagged to go. When I contacted them to find my bag, which is still in Orlando 5 days later, they were blaming me for not doing things correctly. I did what I was supposed to checking my bag and being charged $70. The folks I spoke with wanted me to pick it up in Orlando when I live in another state saying it was on me that it didn't make to my final destination. Horrible experience and I will never fly your airline again but I will let everyone know how you treat customers! I am going to complain to a higher up.

### "I was told there is no assistance"
Traveler beware: Frontier Airlines canceled my flight on one of the busiest travel days of the year and left me to find a replacement flight on my own. The real kicker I had to pay out of pocket, wait to reimburse by check and hope that the menial credit they provided would cover the replacement flight. Surprise, surprise, it didn't. I was told I would also be receiving a travel voucher that would be good for a year, I received a $100 voucher that I found out 3 months too late that it's only good for 90 days. Apparently, there was a bit of miscommunication you have to book the flight within 90 days but you can travel all year. I call Frontier for assistance and I was told there is no assistance.

### "I urge you to stay far away"
Just save yourself the unnecessary heartache and don’t do it. Don’t think it, don’t look for flights, don’t hit the purchase button. I arrived to the ticket counter to check in for my flight. Waited for 30 mins for someone to arrive. I arrived over 2 hours early for my flight and was told there was a 30 min delay and my luggage could miss the transfer flight. The rep offered immediately to cancel my flight and refund me - over a 30 min delay? I should have known then to take it and go to another airline while I still had time to make it to my destination for a my sisters baby shower. I didn’t. 4 hours later, long past take off, we are informed light bulbs are working and maintenance is working on the plane. Then subsequently the flight was cancelled. The offer to rebook for 3 days later to my destination by a nonchalant agent was the cherry on top. I missed my sister’s baby shower, her first kid because of this airline’s incompetence. I urge you to stay far away.

### "I have absolutely nothing negative to say"
This was my second trip on Frontier 17 days apart from my first one and I have absolutely nothing negative to say. We left Cancun on time with 40 passengers onboard and we arrived in Philadelphia 45 minutes ahead of schedule, obviously we had to wait in the air until it was our turn to land but even with all that wait circling around we still landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. I don’t understand what all the negative comments are about from passengers that don’t travel much. They are an ultra low cost airline so go with no expectations and you will not be disappointed. I will fly them again for sure. Good job Frontier!

### "Do not book Frontier"
Not Verified |  Do not book Frontier. Their whole predatory system is built to pull you in for a low airfare purchase, then, they'll switch you to some ungodly red eye, or cancel bookings so that you'll have to pony $$ to fly the next available flight. Their '$0 penalty' for changed flights is bogus. They stick you in a workstream loop, so that you have to accept the changed flight. There is no automated 'refund' email. Then, you call customer service, and no one answers - ever. You have to finally go to their website, cancel your flight (that was changed by them), and then you eat a $95 (or more!) cancellation fee. The workstream loop on their 'refund' page is probably the most sophisticated, and tech savvy evil that I have ever witnessed. It's like being in a nightmarish scene from Dante's Inferno. Again. Do not even think about flying Frontier. Ever. Predatory practices in their UI and their 'automated' refund loop page, and in their overall business model. Makes one sick to the stomach. Also, they aren't BBB accredited, just don't do it, folks.

### "this airline will be disgusting and frustrating"
This airline is beyond deeply disgusting. The seats in front of you are always filthy and the foldable table only will fit a phone and maybe a little cup (also smothered with filth). My friend next to me tried to read the safety information pamphlet and it had vomit on it, and it smelled exactly like so. The seats are so small. The air coming out of the top adjustable mini vents smells like they haven’t changed their filter in years. Their bathroom is 3x disgusting. No toilet papers, paper towels, and it smells horrible. Your journey in this airline will be disgusting and frustrating. You will be better off staying at home or get on another plane with at least cleaned seats and area after deplaning and free beverages. Do. Not. Support. This. Airline.

### "You get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Late arrivals, late boarding, zero comfort. It was like sitting in a child's high chair for 4 hours. The plane shook excessively and it was dirty. Given, the ticket was extremely inexpensive compared to other airlines, but it brings to mind the saying, "You get what you pay for. I will never fly with this airline again and suggest that no one else patronize this business.

### "choose any other airline"
Well let's start off with the attitude from the lady checking boarding passes. I have just arrived from a flight coming from Las Vegas to RDU. We had a layover in Philadelphia. The lady was rude, terrible customer service and then I asked to speak with her manager and I'll be damned if she didn't think she was talking to her 2 yr old daughter. Because Vegas Frontier didn't charge me for carry-ons they made a point to embarrass me along with taking any self dignity I had. I paid $79 ×2 just so I could make my flight. Honestly it it the most low budget airline I have ever flown with. So moral of this story is..choose any other airline.

### "wouldn’t even give me a refund"
I bought my mom a ticket to fly out of XNA today to go back home to Denver and we got there and no one was at the ticket counter to check in and there wasn’t any kiosks to check in, so she waited around and finally talk to a different flight, to ask where the frontier employees were and they didn’t really know. They told my mom that they were probably at the gate, and weren’t coming back until after the flight left so we got on the phone to talk to customer service to get a refund. They wouldn’t even give me a refund. On top of that I drove two hours to even take her to the airport, so I searched for another ticket for tomorrow and the prices doubled so we decided we will never use this company again and. We will pay extra to fly with a different company for now on.

### "website is beyond abysmal"
Not Verified | Trenton to Fort Lauderdale. The website is beyond abysmal. I tried 4 times today and 2 times yesterday to book the same flight. Never could get the thing to work. Called and got an agent who wanted to charge MORE than the amount on the screen. Never will I fly this company again.

### "I will never book with them again"
Frontier Airlines is so grossly mismanaged and has such flagrant disregard for consumers that it is astonishing to me that they are still permitted to operate. The airline stranded hundreds or passengers at Orlando Airport this morning including myself and my 14 year old  daughter. We all arrived at 4:45AM on time 2 hours before a 6:50 departure having already checked in online and pre-purchased bag check. But there were insufficient staff to handle the bag drop and the line to drop checked bags stretched around the  corner of the terminal for more than 3 hours. As a result, hundreds of people missed their flights and were forced to wait 3 hours TO rebook. After waiting for 3 hours on the rebooking line we were told that we would not be able to get another flight until Tuesday to Syracuse  (3 hours drive from our original destination) so we took a refund and booked another, far more expensive flight tomorrow with a different airline. Frontier Airlines did this to hundreds of people this morning in Orlando. I will never book with them again even if it costs me double. They are an absurd and grossly mismanaged company.

### "I truly felt robbed"
Not Verified |  First, I truly felt robbed after they charge you to even have a carry-on, let alone the charges for your checked luggage. Then their checked luggage has a really low weight limit compared to other airlines. They offer no complimentary beverages, which is whatever, but after you pay for everything else it just feels wrong. Then, they forgot to check our stroller at the gate and left it in the gate of the airport we were leaving. There's no wifi, so if you need that, you don't even have the option here. The flight attendants were rude, and to top it off, the seat my husband was sitting in was covered in gum, ruining his shoes, backpack, and shirt.

### "disrespectful and uncaring attitude"
Not Verified |  This is actually the first time I have ever complained about any company on a website, but I have to say that today we experienced the most unjust, disrespectful and uncaring attitude I have ever experienced with any industry. We bought round trip tickets from Albany to Orlando. The part of the trip in question is the return flight leaving at 2:40 pm today from Orlando to Albany. We had additionally bought the “bundle” package for $550 guaranteeing our seats. We waited at the check in line around 60 min. We received our boarding passes, which did not have a seat assignment, but were told we would receive these at the gate. We then went through security, which took another 60 min or so. We arrived at the gate only to be told that the plane was overbooked and was sold out. We had paid the additional $550 (bundle) to guarantee a seat. The lady at the gate said there was nothing she could do. We then asked for a supervisor who arrived at the gate. She explained there was nothing she could do. My wife was very upset, but not abusive, and was trying to understand how this could happen when we had paid for the seats. The supervisor was very rude to her. My wife would be speaking to her and she would “fake” picking up the phone to avoid her mid sentence. It was very obvious. We asked if our luggage was on the way to Albany and she laughed and said it was and she seemed to enjoy the fact that it was. It seemed to me that she was taking pleasure in that fact because we raised some objections to her. Additionally, we were told we would have to re-book the flight and that we would once again have to wait in line at checking and go through security again. She wandered off with no resolution to our problem. Unfortunately, as we tried to explain to the supervisor and gate agent, I have a medical condition and my meds for it were in those bags on the plane. I have to now rent a car, book a hotel, rent another car (I had to fly everyone to a city 2 hours away), buy clothing and essentials and seek medical care. Somehow this really amused the supervisor because my wife was firm with her at the gate. She really took pleasure in our suffering as retaliation. I really believe that to be the case. I have never been treated so poorly. Never. I would love the opportunity to ask that supervisor what exactly is amusing about any of this? If anyone has suggestions on how to escalate this complaint I would love to hear them. My hope is that this experience is not representative of how Frontier customers are treated. There is no excuse for it.

### "This was the worst flight experience ever in my life"
Not Verified |  This was the worst flight experience ever in my life. To start off, they directed over 500 people all on different flights to three counters to weigh the bags and check in. Then because the line was so slow, almost everyone in the line lost their flight and had to go to the re booking area, where the next flights would be on Monday or Wednesday, which doesn’t work. Then, after it all, they told us that our flight was doomed to never happen because the plane itself was going under standard operation, meaning that the plane itself was faulty and couldn’t even take off. They told us this after waiting in line for 4 hours in the heat.

### "I feel a bit like I've been robbed"
Frontier Fails At Customer Service. My wife and I recently traveled from Orlando to Memphis via Frontier. The website navigation and the purchasing of tickets was straightforward but misleading (they advertise one price but then nickel and dime you to death, but who doesn't these days?). In the ticket purchase process we had additional fees for luggage (who travels without luggage?). We purchased two bags to be checked. Frontier used to have a 50 lb. limit to their luggage. We discovered differently. You will read more about this in a moment. This was our fault - we didn't read the website carefully enough. Ok. I own what is mine to own. When the time came to pack for our trip we managed to get everything in one bag. We arrived at the airport and was shuffled from line to line. We got to the kiosk to drop our bag and was informed that it weighed 49 lb. I thought, "okay? I was then informed that it would be a $50 overweight fee. Understand, we've traveled other airlines before where we were a little over before where we used only one of two bags. In the unfailing logic of customer service these airlines would waive fee due to the unfailing math of "2 bags paid for" - "1 used bag" = "1 bag not used. Any was subsumed in what was paid for. I currently sit on hold to talk with yet a third "supervisor" who cannot make $50 decisions for the company. Here is my math - check me: We paid for two bags or 80 lb. of stowage. We used 49 lb of stowage. We were charged an extra $50 for 9 lb. of stowage over forty (even though we paid for 80 lb). In my mind, we did not use 31 lb of stowage for which we paid. Then we were charged an extra $50 for not putting that extra 9 lb that we did use in a separate bag. In the end, with the penalty, I paid for 120 lb of stowage (as best we are able to calculate) I called customer service and after my third supervisor has now hung up on me after I was told "we do not refund over charges on bags. If I had only purchased one bag, I would not be here writing. I would be in my office licking my wounds feeling really stupid for doing what I did. It would be a $50 lesson - lesson learned. As it is, I feel a bit like I've been robbed. This does feel very dishonest to me. They may as well robbed me at gun point. That is hyperbolic for sure - they didn't use a gun but rather the threat of not being able to fly. They used their power and position to take $50 from me and then refused to work with me on a resolution by hanging up on me. Buyer Beware! Frontier does not use customer service logic. They apparently use a customer consumption logic. With Frontier you are not a person - you are redefined as a walking dollar bill to be manipulated and leveraged. I've kissed my $50 goodbye. Think carefully before you fly this carrier. Hold your wallet tightly. Avoid them wherever possible.

### "the worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  I had the worst experience ever! They first changed our flight which was no issue then they delayed our flight and texted me that the flight was delayed but when i called the reservation line to confirm they told me the flight was not delayed but in fact it was! Then they cancelled the flight 45 min before we were to take off and offered us only a $600 per person voucher to get home. Mind you this was spring break for the kids and we had three people traveling and no flight was under $5000. They offered no help with any hotels and no assistance with the flight what so ever. I was traveling with a child and they had no regard for the safety and well being of my child or family. I advise anyone traveling to never use Frontier.

### "Never fly Frontier2
Not Verified |  On the way to Florida, they not only delayed it by 1.5 hours, but made us wait 2 hours afterward since there wasn’t an available gate. It gets worse. On the way back (today), they overbooked and wouldn’t let us board. Frustrating enough as it is, they’re trying to tell us that they will not cover the price of a new flight (which is literally a day later, possibly longer). I am so upset and tired, I can barely function. I overheard from another family (that they also screwed over with overbooking) that they would not give back their luggage with medication in it. Never fly Frontier.

### "they cancelled my flights"
This is the second time I was screwed by Frontier. Should have learned my lesson the first time. I booked with them because they were the only airline with a direct flight from Vegas to Puerto Vallarta. But on both occasions, they cancelled my flights, both legs of the round trip, with less than 1 week notice. They offered no alternative booking, so I had to scramble for tickets with another airline at the last minute and ended up paying much more than I would have if I had booked a different airline months ago. So, bottom line, you don't save money by booking with this airline. You end up spending more in addition to the added hassles. I also had travel insurance, but it did not cover the added cost of changing airlines. It would only have covered it if I was at the airport on day of travel and got cancelled.

### "trying to get a complete refund for my flight"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight 5 months prior. When I called to try and make a change to my flight a customer service rep was extremely unhelpful and very rude when I explained that their policy which is not listed anywhere on their site to change the name on the ticket. They wanted to charge me the same amount a new ticket cost. How does that even make sense, that’s the stupidest policy I ever heard of. Maybe 15-30$ sure but 75$ just to change a name and then I asked to speak with someone higher up, he put me on hold and then hung up on me. Extremely rude so I am now trying to get a complete refund for my flight.

### "do not recommend using Frontier Airlines"
I booked a flight from Fargo, ND to Denver, CO on April 11, 2022 and then I booked another ticket on April 16, 2022 going to the same location on the same flight. I waited over 2 hours to talk to a supervisor to get my full refund back as I didn't cancel my flights. Frontier did but they are saying I did it off the website. Why would I book a flight the same day for a different person and cancel my own flight that day I purchased a ticket for my partner? That makes zero sense to me and I know it would to others as well. I have waited for hours on hold and then I get hung up on so I try it again and the same thing happens. I get one representative that says we will put you on a call list and then the person calls me on Easter and they won't call back again. So here I am for the 3rd time trying to talk to a supervisor about my situation and they are not helpful at all. I do not recommend using Frontier Airlines to others due to not having the courtesy to call back and help their customer out. I hope Frontier Airline reads this so they can fix their respect and help their customers not take their money.

### "All the communications were poorly issued and unclear"
Terrible airline. Flight from PBI to PHL on Good Friday, we get delayed by an hour, finally board the flight, miss our departure window, they reschedule the flight to Saturday, departing 6am. All the communications were poorly issued and unclear. Nobody knew whether we need new tickets, are we getting an email confirmation, anything. They issued a $50 credit redeemable only on Frontier, barely pays for the gas to get to and from the airport for the day let alone my entire day wasted at the airport. I arrive at 4.30am, there's 300-person line to get new tickets because the old tickets are invalid and online self-service isn't working. The flight's delayed by another hour because it took well over an hour for the two desk attendants to get through the 300-person queue and then delayed again because Frontier didn't have the right equipment to get the plane off the ground. I'm flying back to PHL on Easter Sunday, flight's at 12.30pm, boarding is delayed by 45 minutes because the previous flight landed 45 minutes late. We finally board, the departure is delayed by another 45 minutes because the plane needs to undergo maintenance. All the flights were remarkably bumpy, harsh landings, uncomfortable seats. You might get to your destination, but there's no telling when or in what shape.

### "Worst travel experience"
Orlando to Montego Bay. Worst travel experience of my life! I flew from Washington to Orlando from where me and my brother (Active Duty) would take a non-stop Frontier flight to Montego Bay in order to attend my grandmother's funeral. After standing in the check-in line for over 2hrs, and requesting multiple times that they expedite the passengers on our flight because we have been in line for so long and our flight departure was approaching. We were met with nothing but rude and disrespectful behavior. After about 2.5 hrs of standing in line, all the passengers from my flight were removed and we had us join another line in order to reschedule our flights. We stood in this line for over "6 hrs" before we were able to speak to someone. We were then presented with the option to fly the next day or the day after that. Given that we needed to be there ASAP we took the next day's flight (layover). We were denied accommodations and had to spend the night in the airport. The next day after starting the Check-in and waiting at the gate. While at the gate there were multiple inquiries about whether or not the flight was delayed and we were continuously told it was on time until it was passed the departure time. The flight was delayed to the point where we would no longer make it to the connecting flight (the flight was later delayed an additional 4 more times). I expressed my concerns and was told multiple times that there was nothing they can do. A flight attendant recommended I find a supervisor but non of the employees knew where to find a Frontier supervisor. I had to check each gate individually I found the supervisor. The supervisor was extremely rude and walked away when I attempted to talk to her. After a few minutes, she told me to wait and she would soon assist me. I stood there for 40 mins and still wasn't assisted, but she then proceeded to help someone before me, after which I approached her again and was taken to her boss and she left immediately. Her boss just walked away and said to call customer service. In the end, I canceled my flight, but our baggage was sent on a flight that I requested it not be on hours prior.

### "worst airline I've had to work with"
This is the worst airline I've had to work with. Please all avoid this at all costs. Their cancellation policy was the same amount as the flight cost, all when the website was faulty. I tried to change my flight, but in 1 button it got cancelled. Their customer service is sub-par English speaking, and we're aggressively quick to blame me for cancelling. Their bad website cancelled the flight themselves. Never flying again, all should avoid

### "It is not worth the hassle"
Not Verified |  If you are considering booking Frontier, don't to it. It is not worth the hassle. Spend the extra money and book with another respectable airline. We had a great vacation which was completely overshadowed by the incompetencies of this airline. To start things off, we arrive 2.5 hours before our flight from PHL to PUJ. We walk inside and the line to check bags is hundreds of people long. Every other airline had a handful of people in line, frontiers line was about 200 feet long, and then wrapped back again. It was blocking the entrances to all the other airlines and right in front of the entrance doors, so it was essentially a free for all. No employees trying to help manage the line or explain where the line began. We waited approximately an hour and 45 minutes to drop our bags. Everyone in line was late and they were calling specific flights out trying to usher those passengers to the front to check bags. Dozens of people around us missed their flights. The whole thing was an absolute madhouse. By some miracle, we walked up to board our plane right at 7:00am when the doors were supposed to close. Take off was delayed by about a half hour, but luckily we reached our destination close to the planned arrival time. Now for the way home. Where to begin. Well we flew from Punta Cana to PHL, but we had a layover in Orlando. For some reason, the second leg of our trip home was already marked delayed about a month in advance. They pushed it back about an hour. Our experience in Punta Cana was great. More than enough staff. Bag drop was quick and the flight was delayed about 15 minutes but no big deal. Then we arrived in Orlando. Landed and sat in the plane for about 30 minutes with no announcement or anything from Frontier staff. Eventually we got off the plane and wait at baggage claim (we had to claim baggage and take it to the next flight which was odd, but I guess thats how they do it). Apparently thunder storms hit right after we got off the plane, it wasn't even raining when we landed. We wait 3 hours for our bags. We were stuck in this baggage claim area and really couldn't proceed unless we wanted to leave our bags behind. There was no seats or anything. It was miserable. I know the thunderstorms added to this, but I couldn't help but feel Frontier was probably understaffed as well. Even when they announced the runway was marked clear, we waited another 40 minutes for bags. It was so late when we finally got our bags, we couldn't even get any food at the airport because everything was closed. We were hungry and tired and miserable at this point. Next leg of our flight proceeds to get delayed, then delayed again, then again. Initial time was 11:15, it was then pushed back to 12:15 months prior to the flight. Then 12:50am. Then 1:10am. Then 1:33am. then 2:50am. Then 3:50am. Our departure gate also switched multiple times during all this, and there was terrible communication about the whole thing. It was a complete shitshow We finally boarded the plane at 4:00am in the morning. Once everyone boards, they announce that they need to change a tire. We then waited until 4:50am until we eventually take off. By some miracle, the plane lands and we get off and get our bags. Frontier Sucks! We had some bad luck with weather but I can't help but notice it seems they are both terribly understaffed and unorganized as well. Never again. I don't care if they are giving the tickets away.

### "upsetting that they take advantage of people"
Worst airline ever. Do to an emergency we had to cancel our flights. We paid 578 dollars. We canceled 3 months in advance. They are charging us 184.00 for a cancelation fee and giving us 394 dollars for airline credit which expires in 90 days. We obviously can't go or we wouldn't have canceled. Now we are out 578.00. So upsetting that they take advantage of people like that. Life happens and hopefully you all will learn a valuable lesson through our experience.

### "you will pay more and suffer more"
This was the 1st time I flew with Frontier and this will be my last guaranteed. They gave us boarding passes (4 passengers, my wife, myself, daughter-12yrs, son-2yrs) all 4 seats together in one row (36 C, D, E, F) and we were waiting at the gate then they called us to tell that our seats are rearranged now and all scattered in 4 different rows. We just couldn't believe, how was that possible! We have our boarding passes, 10 minutes to boarding and now they are saying we have different seats.! Our 12 yr old daughter and 2 yr old son will be seating in different rows! I initially thought it was a joke but then I realized they actually sold our seats to others. What a cruel dishonest corporation! I must add another point, their luggage weight restriction is 40 LBs whereas most of the other airlines is 50 LBs. They don't offer any snack or beverages on the flight. Upon arrival to Philadelphia airport, their door was not opening Don't be tempted by their initial cheap fare offer, ultimately you will pay more and suffer more.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
I got to MCO at 3:30am for a 6am flight. The drop bag line and the line for the counter were wrapped around the building. I didn’t get up to the counter until 5:15, when I was supposed to be boarding. They sent me to another line to reschedule for another flight, which I stood line for another hour and half. Finally at 7 am when I finally got to speak with an agent, she tells me there’s nothing she can do and gave me a piece of paper with the corporate number to request a refund. While I stood in another line, with another airline, I called corporate, only for them to tell me that they couldn’t help me and the agent had to request a refund. Just for me to get a flight out the same day, within a reasonable time might I add, I had to fly another airline and paid an additional $300. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "the worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown. Over priced baggage fees. Delayed flights. Just horrible. Flying out of Las Vegas we had 3 gate changes which made it very difficult for my disabled husband! Checking in for our flight was a total nightmare. I will never fly with Frontier again!

### "I'll book again with them"
Not Verified |  I felt I should write a review mainly because I booked Frontier and had never flown with them nor had I really heard any feedback about them. As my flight approached I saw an ad come up on Facebook for them and I looked at some of the comments and saw a lot of negative reviews. Needless to say I got nervous. We left Boston headed direct to Cancun on April 2 and our flight was delayed half hour, which is quite normal. The pilots were at the gate for a half hour before they boarded and I was talking to them. They were great guys laughing and joking. Our flight attendants we're great as well. On our return flight April 14 it was a great flight as well. Again we were delayed a few minutes but made up that time in the air and actually landed about 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival. Attendants we're great again. One of them the same from our flight there. I just felt I should give some people some hope since all of these reviews are pretty scary. I'm not doubting that they are true, just wanted to give some people hope, since usually people only take the time for negative reviews. We booked the flights and opted for the prepaid package that allows you a checked bag, carry on and pick your seats. Still cheaper than the other airlines. I'll book again with them.

### "So many things wrong with this company"
This may be the worst airline in the world! I am trying to be objective in this review, but honestly have nothing good to say. Their communication is terrible and they treat passengers like animals. Their staff tries to be pleasant but under prepared to represent the ignorance. It’s a joke and they are like a broken suggestion box! So many things wrong with this company. Delayed then cancelled. Loaded on a hot plane to wait for 90 minutes to then get de-planed. Rescheduled to then get delayed and now waiting again for over 45 minutes. Now the “huffer” cart broke and they don’t have another one.. They are now trying to borrow one. Seriously ridiculous! Comical.

### "Never again with these idiots"
Not Verified |  First they waited until twenty minutes before our flight to take our plane and change it to Indianapolis. They then changed out gate and we found out we were delayed 90 minutes. Once that time arrived they now said the plane had mechanical issues and they needed another 45 minutes. One hour later and they finally changed the terminal and plane and said we would be leaving on one hour. Once we were at the new gate, they said it was again delayed 2.5 more hours. So now our 4:30pm flight was five hours delayed because they gave our original plane away. So now I get to drive home through the mountains in the middle of the night and get home at 5am instead of 11pm. Thanks so much Frontier, even the restaurants in Spokane will be closed by the time I get there and start to drive. Never again with these idiots. On April 11 our flight was delayed 3 hours and now this.

### "terrible experience with Frontier"
Not Verified |  My family also had a terrible experience with Frontier. The agents told us that we would be reimbursed for everything but of course we haven’t been. What I don’t understand is how do they get away with it? Can’t something be done? They have ruined so many families vacations and special events! People buy their tickets in good faith and do not receive what they were promised. Frontier deserves 0 stars.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Worst flight I have ever had. I have flown several other airlines and never had to pay for carry on bag. Most airlines are giving free check baggage. Seats are small uncomfortable and no leg room. Everything has a price attached to it, so as far as this being cheaper, forget it. The best part is when you book a straight flight and the day before you leave you check your flight and find out they have changed your flight back and now you have to get up at 3am and then have a 5 hour layover. I will never fly Frontier again. Big waste of money and your time

### "so unreliable"
Not Verified | Little Rock to Orlando. I booked a flight with Frontier because they were the only airline offering direct flights from AR to FL. A month before our flight, I get a notification that our flight had changed. I figured they moved it earlier and later, no big deal. I log in, and they have redirected us 1000 miles away to Denver, Colorado. What was supposed to be less than a two-hour flight is now over 24 hours with an overnight layover in Denver that we were apparently supposed to pay for the hotel for. I was honestly aghast that this was considered an acceptable flight change. I'll just pay more and fly with Delta from now on. How do they even get people to fly with them when it's so unreliable?

### "they did not pay me the refund"
Frontier Airlines is a thief. I booked a flight with Frontier Airlines. After several hours delay, they canceled the flight and promised to give the reimbursement to us. After 4 months, they did not pay me the refund. Even after multiple attempts to contact them, more than 20 times.

### "my family will never fly with them again"
Our flight was scheduled to leave on Thursday, 03/17 at 5:57PM from LGA, however the Flight was first delayed and then cancelled by Frontier. The only option offered was to leave from Long Island in the next day (Friday, 03/18). This caused my family to have to travel for over 1 hour from LaGuardia to ISP airport and stay one night at a nearby hotel. After speaking with Frontier Customer Relations, they directed us to request a reimbursement for the Lyft transportation as well as the one-night hotel stay that was forced upon us with no other alternative. The agent stated that no email or letter would be given as Frontier needed to know exactly the amount of the expenses before issuing a refund (or voucher for hotel and taxi/uber/lyft). I specifically asked him how would I prove this to receive the reimbursement and he gave me the step by step in their website. Well, here is the same reply received in 4 emails repeating the request for an "Authorization letter" that was never given to me, after I explained myself 4 times: "We are unable to proceed with the reimbursement process unless there is documentation that you can provide, we apologize but we are unable to honor a phone conversation. The Frontier authorization letter is being provided at the airport by our airport representatives or if not, then who ever you spoke with should have a document in our system for us to proceed with the reimbursement process. This company is a disgrace and I can 100% say my family will never fly with them again! The "cheap" airfare results in definitely being more "green" out of our pockets.

### "Very disappointed with customer service"
Very disappointed with customer service, and the airline in general. I was on my way to Orlando, Fl to meet up with my family for my daughter’s birthday. Frontier cancelled my flight twice on short notice and they were very unprofessional in assisting me to resolve the issue. They don’t offer to refund your money, rather of to credit it towards another flight. Well, seeing as how I refuse to schedule another flight with them, they can consider the $400 they took from me as a gift. Perhaps they can make good use of it and send their staff to a training course on customer service.

### "refund was over $100 short of what I was owed"
I am an active military and was trying to fly home for Christmas. Frontier delayed my flight twice before canceling it. When I tried to get a refund for the money that I had spent on airline tickets I had to buy to get me home when Frontier canceled my flight, they made me go through this long process via email. Then when I got my refund two months later, it was over $100 short of what I was owed. I have since been working with them through many emails trying to receive the correct amount for my reimbursement and have not gotten it yet. It is now 4 months since my flight with Frontier.

### "worth the money on flights over 3 hours"
First time flying Frontier. In this post Covid world by now we all know flying is not and will not be the same. Bottom line, Frontier took me from Philadelphia to Cancun safely and on time. During the safety briefing the crew made it fun, the mask announcement was super funny and everyone got the point we had to leave it on covering our nose and mouth. The crew on this flight was great even tho we left Philadelphia at 6:40AM and usually crew is grumpy in the early morning, this crew was not. The plane was only 4 years old and well kept. If you can upgrade to the extra legroom seats, they also recline. It’s worth the money on flights over 3 hours. I’m not sure what all the negative fuss is about, my first time on Frontier won’t be my last. I don’t expect much from an ultra low cost carrier so for someone that came with no expectations I was super pleased.

### "I would never fly again with Frontier"
I had a trip to Punta Cana for my birthday with my husband, we got the the airport super early because it was our first time traveling with this airline and we weren’t familiar with them, when we were in the line to check in they apparently call everyone that was flying to Dominican Republic because they were not taking anyone else, the line had a lot of people, we didn’t hear it because they didn’t said it loud enough, obviously they don’t care if the customers miss the flight. When it was our turn they said we couldn’t get on the plane because they couldn’t get any more luggage on that flight and we were still 45 min early which didn’t make any sense and the staff instead of helping us were very rude and not helpful at all so we missed our flight at 7.30 am, we had to get the next connected flight at 10.30am to Orlando and then wait there for 4 hours and then go to Punta Cana, when we got to the plane they didn’t have in the menu any snacks for sale, just orange juice and tequila. We got to Punta Cana at 5pm so I lost the whole day. Something happened when we returned, the flight was delayed, we had to wait in the airport for hours, on top of that they wanted to charge me for my luggage because it had more than 40 pounds which wasn’t true. We got home super late and I was super disappointed. I travel really often and never in my life had any bad experience with any other airline, but this one. I would never fly again with Frontier and I’ll make sure none of my friends or family members do, so they don’t have to experience what I did.

### "These guys are so unreliable"
Not Verified |  Flight got canceled day we are supposed to fly out. I was notified only 5 hours before my flight which left me scrambling for tickets to fly out as we were going to our second destination for our vacation. They gave the option for $300 reimbursement per traveler which I chose. I had also purchased the bundle option couple days before our flight which we chose much after we booked our flight. I tried to get a refund for that service which I paid for on top of my flight and said they consider it the same as my flight so they won't refund me. To me I paid for an extra service that I did not get and now I am out a total of $300 because of the late notice the cheapest flight I could find was $300 each. These guys are so unreliable and borderline criminal to me.

### "Customer service was awful!"
This was the worst experience I have ever had with a flight. The flight to Orlando was delayed by 6 hours and we were not notified of the delay until the EXACT time we were supposed to be boarding the plane. On the way back to Charlotte from Orlando, we got there 2 hours early and had to wait in a long line to check our bags. When we got to the desk to check our bags we were told that it was too late to check our bags and that we needed to reschedule our flight. We then had to wait in another hour long line to try to reschedule, and they had no flights that would accommodate us. Customer service was awful! I tried calling the airline before we got to the customer service desk since the line was an hour long, and the lady I spoke with on the phone was very rude and thought I was lying to her about what time we got to the airport and blamed us for missing the flight. The flight that we were supposed to be on ended up getting delayed by an hour, so we could have definitely got on the flight if they would have just checked our bags. Never flying with Frontier again.

### "would never recommend this flight"
Not Verified |  Terrible. I had to catch a flight at 6:15 am and we didn’t even board until 8:20 and then sat on the plane for another hour! This airline wasted at least four hours of my day. The staff did not care whatsoever. They sat around for the longest. And no one seemed to know what was going on. Awful. You really get what you pay for with this airline. I would never recommend this flight. It might be cheap, there’s a reason for that. Save yourself the time and headache of this terrible airline.

### "Stay away from this airline!"
Not Verified |  If I could give a 0 I would. We were in Fl due to leave out of Orlando for home in Islip NY. 10pm flight out arriving 12:05am. My son was going to pick us up. Sunday afternoon I got a text saying the flight is delayed until 12:05am. That means that we won't be arriving home until 2:30am-ish, assuming they can find the pilot (he has been 'lost' on previous reviews) and/or they don't decide to delay or cancel the flight. Called Frontier about this, waited on hold an hour and basically was told they are sorry, but nothing they can do. My husband has an important 9am meeting, can't change flights, although until this plane gets up in the air, we aren't sure it won't be delayed or canceled. I asked for my money back so I can try to book on another airline but was told the tickets are non refundable. When I brought up that they are the ones who changed the flight times, apparently it doesn't matter, you are at their mercy. Stay away from this airline! We will never fly with them again and after my family witnessed this, they won't either.

### "I do not recommend"
Not worth the money you "save". You are nickeled and dimed charges for carry-ons, checked bags and seat selection (if you decide to chose) they over sell flights and then expect you to change your flight, change flight times, multiple gate changes for the same flight. We were seated on a plane and had to deplane, tram to a different terminal and then learned the flight was now 2 hrs delayed. I do not recommend. Spend the money for a more reputable airline.

### "horrific experience"
Not Verified | Orlando to New York. Where do I begin. I booked a flight they canceled without giving no notice. So I arrived to the airport for no reason. I had to purchase new flights with another airline because of the inconvenience. Then my date to travel back. First they were delayed supposedly by 1 hr then it became 2hrs then 3 hrs. They don't care it wasn't even bad weather they were just off schedule. But the worst were the flight attendants. They talk to you like they are paying you to fly with them. They are NOT kid friendly at all. So parents please don't fly with them. And they are not cheap it is gimmick. They charge for carry on or anything at that. No entertainment nothing free. Horrific experience I tell you pay the extra $100 fly Delta or Jetblue. These people suck. They gave $50 for the horrific experience to purchase with them again. I promise I'll be alright they can keep it.

### "Poor quality and poor unreliable service"
My flight was continually delayed without providing any information or options. This had me landing at my destination at midnight with a 2 he drive home from the airport. No cancellation options were provided. Seats do not recline. This airlines which makes, the now, midnight flight even more painful. It really just seems like a cheap airlines with an expensive ticket. I fly international and south American airline companies do a better job than Frontier. Poor quality and poor unreliable service for an expensive ticket. If you can get $40 ticket it might be worth it. Maybe. I would rate this a zero but that is not an option.

### "worst airline I've flown"
Cincinnati to Orlando. By far the worst airline I've ever flown with! If I could give a zero, I would. Despite getting to our airport 3 hours early, it took over an hour to get up to the ticket counter, then we stood there for over 25 minutes because no one could find the credit we had from a cancelled trip during Covid. We waited and waited. After spending another 45 minutes waiting to get through security, running through the entire airport to the very last gate, the doors were already closed to the plane that was sitting right there. The gate agent was then rude (told us we should've gotten there earlier AND clearly wanted us to not be upset about missing our flight) but "managed" to fit us in on a flight the next morning. She wouldn't check any other companies for a flight sooner and gave us an 8 hour layover 5 hours from our final destination. After losing our rental car for the trip but still being charged over $400 for it, missing an entire 24 hours of our quick getaway but still paying for our room at the resort that night, they then lost my luggage on the next flight. I had no beach clothing except my bathing suit (thankfully), no flip flops, no toiletries, nothing! They finally called that they had it and I could drive over an hour to come get it with only 30 hours left of my vacation! Thankfully the baggage claim people at Orlando are reasonable and compassionate, so they just sent it back home for us to get when we got back. The ONLY positive interactions with the company were the baggage claim and flight attendants. We will NEVER fly Frontier again, despite still having some money left in our credit! Terrible!

### "Never again in my life"
Baltimore to Seattle. Hell No. Never again flying this. I tried to hold myself back from submitting a terrible review, but I must for future victims of this “Frontier” airlines. More like Backtier. So, this is my first time flying with these bastards and my last. I thought I found a last minute deal on a flight back home, but golly was I wrong. Flight was ok. Very uncomfortable, but what do you expect from a $200 flight from Baltimore to Seattle, all the way across the country. The only free amenity offered aboard was a cup of cloudy, warm water. Want a pack of M&M’s? Sure! $6.” When I landed was when Hell began. They had none of my bags. So I visited customer service at SEATAC, which had a horrendously long line, with only one flustered employee. Waited for an hour, was told my bag will be on the next flight. Ok, then. Called customer service then was instructed to fill out a claim. I did. Nothing. Called at least 30 times before my mother told me I was being too nice and demanded to speak to a supervisor. Right after talking to the supervisor, bags were on the next flight. This is 4 days later, and I am in the military. I told them I had essentials in there to try to hurry them, but it seems that they take their sweet old time delivering my baggage. Never again in my life, thank you. Goodbye.

### "Do not Fly Frontier Ever"
Sacramento to Dallas via Las Vegas. Do not Fly Frontier Ever! Father flew from Sacramento to Dallas but unfortunately, mid-flight, he received a call that the meeting he was supposed to have was cancelled. Even with travel insurance and being told that he could get a refund for his return trip (couldn't get on Frontier that same day to return home) and to call within 24 hours to have a refund. Upon calling well within the 24 hours was then informed that they would charge him a $79.00 cancellation fee but refund $83 and some change in credit towards his next flight. They would not be paying/refunding any part of the baggage fee that was paid for his return trip. This on top of being on hold for over 2.5 hours and being transferred from one person to the next, being hung up on twice and only after I demanded to speak with a supervisor was anything said/done to get to where we were told they could do nothing to refund his paid for the return ticket. What a Rip Off!! !

### "it is absolutely appalling how they treat their customers"
I booked a flight home to go to a friend’s wedding several weeks in advance with Frontier. I woke up early, got to the airport, paid for parking, took the shuttle to DIA, checked my email and noticed there was an email from Frontier Airlines saying they had cancelled the flight completely at 3.20 am that morning. There was no explanation given but a $50 voucher given for the “inconvenience”. This didn’t even cover the cost of the flight that had been cancelled. I immediately went to the ticket counter to try to get something squared away and the Frontier representative just confirmed the flight had been cancelled and handed me a printed version of the email I received about the $50 voucher. I had to literally beg her to try to get me on another flight. She finally found a flight for 7 hours later that day to a different destination leaving the 2 hour drive back to my original destination up to me. Needless to say, I missed my friend’s wedding. I then spent the entire day at DIA, only to be treated so poorly by the ticket agent and the manager who came out just to raise her voice at me at my concerns with my carry on bag. I’m not sure where they get the audacity to treat their paying customers like the dirt beneath their feet but for all the times I (and others) have traveled with and supported Frontier during COVID-19, it is absolutely appalling how they treat their customers. Will never travel with again or recommend to anyone.

### "extremely dissatisfied"
Denver to Miami. I have been a loyal customer for years and also have a Discount Den Membership. After this experience with Frontier, I am extremely dissatisfied, appalled, and offended at the “customer service” I personally experienced at the ticket counter. There was an hour and 19-minute delay in our flight, they overbooked the flight, and once I reached the ticket counter, there was an issue with my personal item, and the ticket counter representative explicitly said “I don’t care if you miss your flight, you’re not getting on the plane [until this personal item is addressed]” without even looking me in the eye. She kept interrupting me as I was anxiously trying to explain my predicament and just kept saying “I don’t care if you miss your flight”. After lamenting to another unsatisfied and frustrated customer in line, I finally was able to get on the plane right before they closed the doors. Suffice to say, I will no longer be flying with Frontier, I will be discontinuing my Discount Den Membership, and I will be recommending other airlines that will actually treat me like a human being. I even tried receiving a refund and the customer service representative was no help at all. For all the times I and others have traveled with and supported Frontier during COVID-19, it is absolutely appalling how they treat their customers.

### "luggage ended up on a different airline"
On February 27th, 2022 my wife and I departed from Terminal 3 in Phoenix to Las Vegas to enjoy a vacation/business trip. We checked in at the counter to drop off our luggage and get our boarding passes. The clerk asked for our identifications, asked me to place my luggage on the scale and after a minute she gave us our boarding tickets. However, she missed tagging our luggage and forgot to give us a receipt for it, but we didn’t notice this since we are not accustomed to flying. We arrived to Las Vegas and our luggage was missing. I went to the “office” in front of carousel 22 and file a claim report with Frontier's personnel. They mention they were going to call Phoenix to have it transferred and I should expect it on the next flight at 4 pm. Someone will drop it off at your hotel. I thought, “Wow, after all, they do care and have great service”. I was wrong! Wasted a full vacation day, I did all the work to track the luggage by calling the airport directly (Hey, don't waste your time using Frontier's luggage department), Frontier's personnel didn't do anything. They make you feel like they are taking ownership of the problem, trust me, they don't. My luggage ended up on a different airline. Had no clothes for our event that night or for our conferences the next morning. Our luggage got to us the next day, They told us to buy clothing for our events, they would reimburse our purchases. After submitting all the paperwork, receipts, and extra documentation, no one has called us or acknowledged our claim. The only reimbursement they made was the luggage fee you pay before boarding. We lost a day of vacation time, gain some stressful hours and frustration throughout the process. You decide if you fly with them. What do you think I will do?

### "Spirit should refund the people who lost money"
Spirit canceled my flight after 8 hours of waiting at the airport. They said it was because of the weather and the next gate over was flying to Orlando also and they boarded and left. (So they lied) After waiting 5 hours more my flight was cancelled. There were no other flights available at their airline and others until Saturday evening. The wedding that I spent a lot of money on was on Friday the next day. Frontier would not reimburse me for a flight that I could not use due to the cancellation of their sister company Spirit. They said they would only give me a credit and charge me a $79. Fee for the cancellation. I do not want to ever fly with either one of these airlines ever again. Frontier got me for over $700. during Covid because we were unable to fly. I believe Spirit should refund the people who lost money from their flights because they cancelled not us. They first said it was the weather which we know was a lie. Then it was the pilot. (We watched him board) They won’t refund because they say it was not their doing. Well it sure in hell was not my doing.

### "Please do not trust this company"
Not Verified |  Frontier cancelled our flight 3 hours before departure, we were already on our way to the airport. No explanation, just text message, Flight is cancelled. We had to rebook another airline, rent a car, drive 5 hours to our original destination. They haven't returned my messages, haven't received a refund and I purchased the highest coverage, seat assignment, baggage, insurance and refundability. Please do not trust this company. Don't use them. They will let you down. What a terrible company in times like this to do this to people.

### "waiting over an hour and a half for paperwork"
Not Verified |  Currently typing this as our plane has been waiting over an hour and a half for paperwork. People have stated to flight attendants that they will be missing their connecting flights if we do not leave soon (response to them was don’t schedule flights so closely). This is an hour and a half late on the airlines time. I know Spirit will be merging with Frontier due to shortage/several errors on your own part and definitely can see why. I suggest Spirit not merge for all of these reasons. Better to to just sell out any remaining aircraft and fire those who don’t do their work on time. Also, the entrance gate to our flight was having issues opening upon entrance. I was asked by a family if they could take my seat so to not disperse their toddlers, I talked to the mother and said that was fine with me, as my husband stated he was up a further row with an empty seat and I wanted to sit with him. I was quickly snapped at by a flight attendant stating its a full flight so you cannot move. No one showed and I moved anyway. So, no need for the attitude. Now they are stating that a pilot left and that they are waiting on another one to come fly. So who knows how long that is going to take! This is all on my flight to go home. On my flight here, it was canceled just four hours prior to departure and I quickly had to purchase a ticket from Spirit airlines so that I could make it to here on time. Haven’t be reimbursed for that flight, but I intend to get paid in full, or my husband, an attorney, will be sending them a letter.

### "refuse to get us on the next flight"
Not Verified |  My family and I are now stuck in Las Vegas until next week because they cancelled our flight due to weather but refuse to get us on the next flight because the prices have gone up and they refuse to pay the difference and we don't have the extra money to spit out 200 dollars.

### "Paid them to have a wonderful week at home!"
Paid them 440.61 to have a wonderful week at home! They cancelled my flight and I’ve received an email that only 360.61 would be refunded to me so I guess the rest is a tip for them. This place is ridiculous, I’m pretty sure they’re just scamming people because what exactly did you do that would justify you keeping any of my money! I never even went to the airport. Still waiting on my 360.61.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  This airline is the worst thing that has ever happened to human kind. Our flight got canceled, then delayed twice the next day. Our flight took off at 1 am when it was supposed to take off at 9 pm. On top of that, we paid extra for our bag because we knew it was overweight, and it was not there when we landed so we had to file a claim. You would think one part of this trip would have gone okay but literally nothing goes okay with this airline. Avoid at all costs.

### "charged for a flight that was cancelled"
Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport to discover our flight was cancelled after we checked in. No biggie, we proceeded to the ticket counter. Staff at DIA ticket counter was beyond rude and wouldn't even talk to us. We were handed a piece of paper and told to step aside. We remained at the ticket counter while opting for Frontier's recommended option #2, Reimbursement for Travel on another Airline (we actually tried to rebook with Frontier but they wouldn't let us). Upon re-booking our party of 4 through their recommended rebook.tripeasy.com platform, only 3 confirmations were charged leaving my 12 year old son without a ticket. Again, they refused to even talk to us let alone do anything to try to help us. We rushed over to the United counter where they successfully transferred the name on the ticket and rebooked my husband on a separate flight. We were now on two separate flights to San Jose, Ca. not our original destination of Sacramento which as you can imagine, provides a host of other challenges upon landing. Utilizing Frontier and their recommended rebook service, all of us were booked as adults while their birthdates indicate two passengers are minors. I have called to inquire about the refund and attempt to transfer the credits to an adult name (perhaps the person who booked and paid for the flights) and after being told the representative could not see the refund details, I was put on hold for an hour before the system hung up on me. Minors cannot book or pay for flights, nor do I have any refund information still. I have still been charged for a flight that was cancelled.

### "absolutely horrified"
Not Verified | Providence to Cancun. We were left stranded in Mexico on April 2 along with probably close to 200 people when we arrived at the airport the plane was there the flight crew was there and our luggage was on the plane at first they delayed the flight by two hours then we saw the flight crew just calmly leave the airport all of a sudden they announce to us that our flight was canceled and they told us they be another flight in a couple days and they said if we didn’t have any check-in luggage they could put us on the JetBlue flight to Boston next door. So we all asked can we have our luggage back from off that flight and they said no. So some people got on the JetBlue flight, when we asked what we were supposed to do they told us that there be a flight on Wednesday this was Sunday and they told us that we could wait in the airport until then. My husband is a disabled war veteran you want us to sleep on the floor till Wednesday with no luggage in another country we don’t even speak the language. I am absolutely horrified so I paid $1000 to get us home on another airline. Now I have a message to pick up my luggage at the airport and I need to gas and pay parking to pick up my luggage.

### "no desire to fly Frontier again"
Not Verified | Tampa to Cincinnati. My flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues, that I found out about after arriving at the airport. I had taken a cruise on Carnival that was great so I got to the airport about four hours early. The flight was already cancelled, but no ticket agents available since they don't come out to help until two hours before departure. There was a large group of us just sitting in line for two hours waiting. Once the ticket agents came out they didn't have any other flights I could get on for four days. The ticket agent explained that Frontier would assist in covering some of the cost and there would be three options available. 1. Get a hotel to wait until flight available, 2. Book with another airline 3. Get a rental call. All the details would be in the email that I would be receiving shortly according to them. Since other flights were substantially more expensive I decided to drive home (1000 miles). I obtained the cheapest rental I could and headed home. I never received an email, so I called customer service. I spent almost 2 1/2 hours with customer service being told they could not help me because I didn't have an actual letter from the ticket agent stating they would cover my car rental cost. It cost me almost $500 to drive home with rental fee, gas and Wendy's. I would have been happy to get back half, but Frontier was not willing to do anything. They acted like they were doing me a favor by giving me back my flight expense on a flight they cancelled. If your flight is ever cancelled do not leave the ticket counter without a written agreement from the airline with the options they will cover. There were four people in our party that has no desire to ever fly Frontier again all over a couple of hundred dollars.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified | Atlanta to Orlando. Frontier Airlines is by far the worst airline to ever fly with. My family and I booked trips to Orlando with them at the beginning of March for a trip in April. My flight was at 6:00 am on a Friday. Frontier sent me a text message at 12:30 am stating my flight was canceled. I called the airlines and was on hold for 45mins. The rep told me she did not know why the flight was cancelled and could reschedule the flight for the next day. I needed to be in Orlando that do for a very important business meeting. I then drove to my airport in Atlanta to speak with the frontier agents, and no one was in sight. Another family was there crying because they was also on this flight. Also, let's mention I was flying with an 8-month-old. The only flights that was available with a different airline were flights with 2-3 layovers which were not going to be possible with an infant. My family and I then had to spend thousands of dollars to fly with Delta to get us to Orlando before 2 pm. The other half of our family was rescheduled by frontier and cancelled twice this same weekend. This was beyond ridiculous. We were hung up on by a numerous amount of agents that were also very rude to us when not even attempting to help much.

### "everything about this airline is subpar"
You get what you pay for, everything about this airline is subpar. Pilots were the only saving grace in the whole experience for a safe takeoff and landing and expeditious in taxiing. Bag drop at the airport needs a major upgrade, takes way too long. Flight was delayed with no update from the gate attendants, at the very least keep us updated with what is going on. Baggage claim at Baltimore was again poorly organized and took triple the time it takes major airliners. The overall “cheaper” pricing doesn’t get you bags if you’re a civilian, only worth flying Frontier if you’re military. Pay the extra $50 to fly with United, American, or Delta. Pass on Frontier.

### "It was a disaster"
Today was supposed to be my (and my three kids) first flight with Frontier Airlines. It was a disaster. The aircraft had some mechanical problems. Those things happen. The communication from the staff was nearly non-existent. They showed up at the counter to announce delays (from 4:00 to 4:45 to 5:15 to 5:45 to 6:45 to 7:30 to canceled), stayed for a few minutes and then left. The passengers were generally unaware of what was happening. Naturally a long line formed in front of the counter because folks were changing - or attempting to change – their flight arrangements. No other customer service agents came to relieve the line. An email ended up being sent. The next available flight was not for four more days! Four options were given: 1) Up to $400 credit/traveler for travel with another airline. It’s Spring Break on 12 hours’ notice. $400 does not cover that. Not even close. 2) Full credit for my ticket plus $100. Essentially, the $100 voucher pays to ensure that the passenger does business with Frontier again. With flights as expensive as they are now, $100 is not much. The full refund (see option #4 below) is much more attractive but it’s cash in hand I have no chance of losing to circumstance. 3) Up to $400 total (not per traveler) for alternative transportation. In my case, this would have been a car rental. Between car rental and gas this also does not come close to covering my trip. It is also useless. 4) A full refund which is unfortunately the best and only option. After spending the day at the airport and disappointing drive home I had to look my kids in the eye and tell them that their trip to see their grandparents was canceled. I have never experienced a worse traveling experience than I experienced today and one of the most disappointing experiences in my life. Problems happen. Mistakes happen; we all make them. The true test of character as a person or a business is shown in response to those problems. Frontier’s response to these problems was downright atrocious and that is more telling than anything. I would encourage them to review their policies and ensure that they can meet their customers’ needs in the event where they have issues. I would also encourage them to provide their staff with basic customer service training.

### "This has been among the worst experiences I’ve had with an airline"
We traveled to Puerto Rico and it was a disaster. Going from Boston to Puerto Rico, the flight was changed from 11.25 am to 10.41 am and we were never notified. Fortunately, we were there early. So, we made it. But the return trip was a disaster. The flight was programmed for 3.44 pm and it was changed to 7.30 am. Again, we were not notified. So, we missed the fight and got stuck. We called customer service and the number was always busy. Submitted a complaint online and no one called back. We had to go in person to demand a refund since they didn’t have another flight until four days later. Still waiting on the refund. This has been among the worst experiences I’ve had with an airline and it was my first Frontier Airlines flight.

### "Frontier has lost us as a customer"
Not Verified |  I am still waiting for my husband to arrive in Buffalo from FLL. His plane was scheduled to leave FLL at 7 am, it is now 1 pm and he has not boarded the plane yet. In February we flew to Cancun from Cleveland on Frontier. We waited an extra 2 hours to depart that time, missed our shuttle in Cancun and waited more time for that to return for us. The Frontier staff "forgot" to bring the immigration forms, so we waited extra time after landing to get those. The flight back was also delayed 2 hours and instead of getting in to Cleveland at 7, we arrived at 9.30. A debacle at the airport in immigration took even longer. While that was not Frontier's fault, it still got us to our car to head home (2.5 hours away) so we made it home by 1 am. Not fun! Frontier has lost us as a customer. I can put up with the fees for everything, since they do offer non stop flights at reasonable rates. I pack light and buy my own snacks after TSA inspection. But, if every time I have to add several hours to my "flight experience", forget it.

### "heard nothing but bad things about Frontier"
Not Verified |  Late departure on the 31 March. Boarded on time on 3 April in Ft Myers only to have the crew announce they cannot locate the Captain. A few minutes later they announce they found the Captain but that he is in Miami. Later they announce the pilot is trying to get a cab from Miami to Ft Myers which could take at least three hours so they finally let us off the plane. Now waiting to see if we depart in another 3-4 hours. I heard nothing but bad things about Frontier but since it was a direct flight thought I would give it a try. The staff at the gate and flight attendants have been very kind and apologetic. It appears they are used to this

### "Its a never ending circus of mistakes"
My girlfriend has been flying the direct route from Buffalo to Ft Myers and back due to its "fast" non-stop route. Forget fast! The 3 hour flight has always turned into a 5 hour minimum debacle at best! Leave late, gate not ready upon landing, wait on the tarmac an hour for the plane in front to load and push back. Its a never ending circus of mistakes, from the flight crew, the ground crew, to the gate agents! Todays flight sealed the deal that I will pay for all her future tickets on another airline so she does not have to ever endure the pain of Frontier airlines ever again! Flight 910 from RSW to BUF seemed like there was a possibility that all looked normal. I said "not possible"! Boarding was delayed due to waiting for flight crew. That was quickly resolved after 15 minutes when the crew decided they should show to the gate. Why should employees be on time? OK, just 15 minutes. Boarding begins and all are onboard. Then the announcement. We do not have a captain! Guess where he is? Miami! All passengers are deplaned and told that the pilot has been put into a limo and is being driven from Miami. Should be here in 3 hours so go play with yourselves in our swanky waiting area with nothing to do. If this flight does go, we will celebrate that it was the last flight she and my sanity have to have with Frontier airlines.

### "Frontier Airlines is an absolute joke"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is an absolute joke. My wife has been on a layover for multiple days. Her flight was supposed to land at BWI on Thursday at 630. It is now Sunday at 1224 and they just canceled her flight for the 3rd time. She has been on a plane 3 different times only to be taken off and basically told nothing! We have had to book 2 different hotel rooms at our own expense and looks like we are getting a 3rd. They also charged her for a carry on bag again after we paid for it and they cancelled the flight. She is going to DC because her father passed away and the unnecessary stress this airline has caused us both has only made everything worse. Couldn't be worse. Everyone who works around the airport in any capacity has said to her, "Oh, you must be with Frontier. It is literally the joke of the airport.

### "Don’t use, they are worthless"
There were storms in Florida that delayed the flight, but after the airline got clearance the Captain was debating to fly or not. He took an extra 2 hours before deciding to go. Now I’m in Orlando. My hotel is 26 miles away and since the Captain took his merry ole time, we landed after 11pm and the car rental place closed at 11. Thanks for nothing. To hell with frontier. Don’t use, they are worthless.

### "Do not fly Frontier"
Grand Rapids to Fort Myers. Do not fly Frontier if you want to arrive on time or arrive at all. They cancel more flights than any other airline and will keep you waiting at the airport all day without proper notification. Flight was supposed to leave 11:17 got delayed four times then canceled due to weather? Weather was fine at our airport and destination and in between all morning till 3pm when they decided to cancel due to weather. What a joke run airline. Will not fly ever again.

### "won't fly with Frontier"
Jacksonville to Philadelphia. I wish I had read reviews first. Free carry-ons only count as purse or laptop bag, backpacks are an extra fee, and because I had a backpack and a suitcase, that meant I had to check my suitcase and pay for both my backpack carry-on and my checked suitcase. $70 extra dollars. Also, it was a 2 hour flight and they didn't give any refreshments or food. So they charge you more and you get less. I could've flown a better airline for the upcharge I had with Frontier and had accomodations. The staff was friendly enough, but that didn't make up for everything else. I won't fly with Frontier EVER again, especially after reading all of these horror stories from people who had even worse experiences.

### "will never choose again"
Orlando to Baltimore. This airline let us wait 9 hours then cancelled without any proper explanation. We have been asked to change ticket to April 2 - Saturday 2 pm but this flight also cancelled by 1 pm just before departure time. We tried to change ticket but there was no ticket for next 2 days. We have been traveling with 3 children and it was the worst travel experience in our lifetime. It was our first time for Frontier and will never ever choose this airline again.

### "Worst travel experience"
Not Verified |  
Worst travel experience I have ever had. Check in staff was incredibly rude and bag can only be 40 pounds now. Flight was already running 20 minutes late then we were told the flight was overbooked by 6 people and that we were not boarding the plane until 6 people gave up their tickets (the next flight they offered was 2 days later for those people). Once we boarded we sat for 45 minutes waiting for luggage to be loaded. Even the pilot had to call and ask what the delay was! At around midnight the morning we were to depart back home we received an email stating our flight was canceled and given no reason for this cancelation. Had to use their site to rebook and we're told we'd be reimbursed in 14 business days for the new tickets we had to purchase. The earliest flight we could book was 2 and a half days later! And we checked 5 airports! It has now been 15 business days and no reimbursement check. When calling to ask where the check was, the woman on the phone was unbelievably rude and when we asked to speak to a manager she hung up on us! After calling back we were told the checks could take another 4 to 6 weeks.

### "never fly this incompetent airline again"
I vowed never to fly frontier again about 10 years ago. A family emergency left me no option. Flight scheduled for departure 4/2/22 at 10:25 am. Delayed 1.5 hours. Plane is at gate, but no first officer is available. 1.5 hours to get the flight going, and they can't get a full crew! Flight is now delayed another 1.5 hours likely just in time for a storm that will ground planes. I will never fly this incompetent airline again.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
They had zero respect for my belongings I watched how they boarded the luggage and it was horrible they were thrown they fell off of the conveyor belt from the plane all the way to the ground they drag them they didn’t even use the handles so with that being said when I landed home my suitcase came back with literally the wheel hanging off it was literally hanging on by a thread and my stroller that had not a scratch on it came back with every single piece of plastic on it damaged. I have flown with other airlines and they put the strollers in the cabin on the plane once everybody is boarded, not frontier who puts i under the plane. I made a claim, they did replace the bag, but they said the stroller was normal wear and tear. I did not except that answer because it wasn’t normal wear and tear, a scratch here fine, but the entire stroller scratched and things wrapped and missing pieces no that’s not normal. I’ve escalated it up to a supervisor and the supervisor concluded that it was normal wear and tear. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "Stay away. Far away"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever been on. They charge an unreasonable fee for every carry on and checked bag. The checked bag has to be under 40 lbs. The plane smelt. The flight crew were non existent. The seats are hard and do not recline. There are no TVs, outlets, or USB ports on the plane. They provide no snacks or drinks. Not even water. I will gladly pay double the amount to fly Jetblue or Delta. This airline is good for a flight that lasts less than 1 hour where you don’t need any bags. My back was killing me after being stuck in that terrible seat for 3 hours. Stay away. Far away.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Avoid at all costs. What you save on a ticket you will spend on luggage fees. Flight departed an hour and a half late because one of the flight attendants was late. Refreshment cart was crashed into my girlfriends elbow and all she got was a “your arm shouldn’t be out there”. Avoid like the plague.

### "unorganized, disrespectful, inconsiderate"
The worst airline ever. So unorganized, disrespectful, inconsiderate. Because of the stupid reasons of delay, it needed 16 hours to get from Philly to Miami instead of 3 hours! And they did not care at all! Unbelievable. I will never ever fly with this airline again.

### "Frontier has zero regard for their passengers"
Frontier has to be the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. One of my previous flights kept us locked down in the plane for almost 2 hours after we landed. Today, they cancel my only flight home to see my ill grandfather in the hospital and so I can get back to work on Saturday after a 4 week hiatus. They offered me a $50 voucher and a flight 24 hours later like I don’t have anywhere to be and $50 fixes it all. I paid for a decent seat and all the extras and they pull this stunt. Frontier has completely zero regard for their passengers and this will be the last time I ever use them to fly. My car rental now needs to be extended. My home transportation needs to be rescheduled. I now have to screw my place of employment and get coverage for another work shift and tarnish my attendance and reputation because frontier sells tickets to flights that they can’t make happen as a multi million dollar company. Pathetic and unprofessional.

### "I won’t be flying them again"
Terrible. Supposed to board at 9:30 and take off at 10:15. The previous plane was late so we boarded at 11. Once on plane, we sat on the Tarmac for an additional 30 minutes. Very little professionalism through the whole process and staff was unwilling to answer questions about the delays. Multiple times they told people to stop coming to the podium to ask about the delay. This is not the first time this has happened with Frontier, and as if it matters in the grand scheme but I won’t be flying them again. If they were to fairly reimburse for every bad customer experience, they’d go bankrupt.

### "skip it for anything other than a quick non stop flight"
Not Verified |  Absolute worst airline! Overbooked my Vegas flight so issued us flight vouchers and we drove home. When I rebooked using the vouchers to go to Alaska - which ended up costing over the voucher amount and more expensive than Delta -with horrible flight times and long layovers. Then Frontier merged with Spirit and cancelled their route to Anchorage completely! So I had to rebook with Delta which is what I should have done in the first place. I asked for the dollar value of the vouchers rather than another voucher and they said no. I guess Denver is my only option for a non stop since you cannot go anywhere without going to Denver first and strolling their airport for 6-12 hours. Lame airline-skip it for anything other than a quick non stop flight (if you can find one)!

### "the worst airline I have ever tried to fly with"
Not Verified |  This has to be the worst airline I have ever tried to fly with. Had a 10am flight from Boston to San Juan, get delayed til 11.30am. Ask one of the flight attendants at the gate if we would be leaving soon. She confirmed “yes” the plane is already at the gate we will be boarding at 11am. 10 minutes later they cancel the flight completely and tell us there are no more flights for the day. They didn’t give a reason. You will end up paying more in the long run and they are the rudest people on the planet.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown. Frontier Airlines charged $150 for my surfboard on a short-haul route. Handled the sports luggage improperly during loading, severely damaged it and then refused to pay compensation. Although the prices are cheap, everyone can only advise against this airline. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "Respect should be given by the staff"
Worst airline I’ve ever been in. I am a regular travel and shopping around for last minute tickets Frontier was cheap. Tried it and will NEVER BOOK a flight with this carrier again regardless of the price. Landed on time and made us stay in the plane for over 45 minutes. Making rude reminders about masks? We are adults. An elderly person trying to use the bathroom and the flight attendant being rude by speaking through the speaker saying: “what part of staying in your seats you don’t understand? !” Wow. Again we are customers, passengers and adults. Respect should be given by the staff.

### "Absolute worst airline ever"
Absolute worst airline ever. Every leg of our flight going and coming had major issues. Pilot no show. Crew no show. Flat tire. Missing plane. Lying customer service that denied our 4 hour delay due to loading and entire flight on a plane with a flat tire, unloading, finding a new plane, start process over. Customer service refused any help with all the major expenses caused by this by saying delay was due to weather - the perfect 70 degree Orlando weather. I cannot say enough how horrible this airline is. They care zero about the customer or the customer experience. Fly any other airline or drive.

### "how cutting corners Frontier has become"
I am beyond in disbelief of how cutting corners Frontier has become, it is even worse than spirit, which I didn’t think was possible. The 4 employees at the gate were rude the lady checking the carry-one was yelling at the top of her lungs being extremely condescending, she said like I already said multiple times for people that don’t listen you don’t get a free carry-on - one personal item and it has to fit. She said I’ll be checking all of them. Pulled many people to the side again rudely and dismissive whenever it was my turn she didn’t even let me ask her about my bag. I told her she was being rude and then she answered I guess you don’t fly that offer. I asked her for her name and she said I don’t need to give it to you. So unprofessional.

### "worst airline I have ever had to deal with"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I have ever had to deal with. After we booked our flight they changed the first flight so we had to rearrange our work event to accommodate and then they changed our flight home from a direct flight to a flight that left at 1 AM and arrived in Denver at 4AM with a connecting flight to Seattle. We are trying to cancel our return flight booking. What a mess.

### "They will never get any of my money again!"
Not Verified |  This is the most horrible experience I have ever had flying. On top of no explanation why we were left in Phoenix, AZ of course later, it was blamed on "wind. The majority of staff treated everyone very poorly. We lost a lot of money for rental car, hotel reservations and a show we had planned from 5 people in Las Vegas. The staff did not care, at all. I asked for my luggage, they never gave it to me and we were literally at the airport for 13 hours! They will never get any of my money again! Lesson learned.

### "negligence and poor customer service"
Not Verified |  They turned our vacation into an absolute nightmare. First Canceled our flight 1.5 hour before departure after standing 2 hours in their wait line. Leaving me, my boyfriend, 11 month old and 3 year old with no hotel and no transportation (car seats were rented and already turned in). They didn't have another flight until the next day, which was then delayed by 2 hours. I heard my name being called throughout the airport overhead several times and asked frontier employees if they could help me they shushed me and offered zero assistance. Come to find out after waiting 2 hours to retrieve my luggage, my luggage was still in Orlando because they didn't properly secure our flight tag. Luggage contained all me and childrens medication that are needed to take every day. They say we don't have another flight to Columbus until Wednesday. Called Frontier multiple times- they said they won't offer me a refund because we already took the flight. I was offered a 50$ flight voucher. Absolute negligence and poor customer service. Not to mention the flight attendant was rude and aggressive towards people on the plane with children.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
I will never fly Frontier again. My trip home from Cancun to Minneapolis was cancelled, along with the flights going to Baltimore, Boston, Denver, Orlando, and LA. They made us stand in line for over 5 hours before giving us any answers, and that was to not provide us with the direct flight we paid for, but rather to put us on a 1-stop trip. What should have been a 4 hour flight turned into 6.5 hours of fly time, with a 7 hour layover in Denver. I can say with 100% confidence that the $100 flight voucher they gave me will either get flushed down the toilet, or hung as a reminder to just spend the extra money on a decent airline. Not to mention that it costs $75 for a checked bag, and $75 for a carry on. You might as well go Delta, at the very least for the peace of mind that you know the flight actually exists. On our flight to Denver from Cancun, we learned that there were 6 extra Frontier Pilots on our flight, whom were capable of flying but did not have a plane to fly. This means that Frontier was not over booking planes, they were not underbooking planes, no- they were booking trips with planes that did not exist. I will never fly with frontier again, I would rather walk.

### "never again fly with Frontier"
This airline is a complete joke. It took forever to get through security, all the while the flight has been delayed unbeknownst to all travelers. We were supposed to take off at 245pm, land in Syracuse at 6pm. They delayed the flight three times, and then cancelled it at 715pm. Our whole day was spent in an airport, my boyfriend was supposed to be back to work tonight, and I tomorrow  morning. They tried giving us refund in "frontier travel vouchers". That doesn't pay for days I don't have to take off from work. That doesn't pay for my boyfriend potentially losing his job because he was supposed to be back tonight. We will never again fly with Frontier. First and last time booking with them. If I could give them a negative number, I would.

### "No words to describe this absolute chaos"
Not Verified |  Got to airport at 3 pm on March 26 for 9 pm flight ( mind you that’s what they recommend get to TSA as early as you can ) . Yet We Couldn’t check bags in till 6 pm . At 6 pm the line to check in was enormous as only 2 people were working! Luckily we were first and got our bags checked & proceeded to long TSA lines. All in all 7:30 we got thru TSA . Went to gate and there is standing room only in entire frontier wing of about 8 gates. People were stranded from multiple airlines from days before. Luckily we have priority pass lounge access. We went to an overflowing lounge and waited till 8:30. Then 8:45 proceeded to gate, 9:00 pm came and went and Not one announcement about what is happening. Then 10 pm, 10:30 they started boarding, boarding took an hour for some reason. 11:30 pm we taxied out and were told the plane is having “mechanical issues” and needs to return to gate. Waited 45 min to be towed back to gate at which point we are told we can exit plane if we want. No explanation as to what is going on and if flight was being cancelled. We left the plane and considered taking another flight with another airline but they would not remove our luggage from the broken plane. At 12:45 we were told plane needed a jump start by an anonymous worker who said that she personally never flies these planes. All the people who heard this decided not to return to the original broken plane. She offered us a flight at 5 am. We got new tickets and proceeded to another gate. We couldn’t get any sleep as the fixed chair armrests do not allow lying down. Just a filthy floor! Mind you most bathrooms get closed and no water or food is available at this time anywhere. Come 4:30 am I realize our gate destination was changed. We hectically run to an open counter and we were told our new gate which is across the wing and is supposedly already boarding. We run like maniacs no bathroom no water to get on our new flight. Finally we left and passed out sleeping on the plane. When we arrive no one is around to tell us where our baggage is as it left on previous plane. Waited hours to get help. Come 9 am March 27 we get an email from frontier that our flight from previous day is experiencing delays and will be taking off shortly. No words to describe this absolute chaos!

### "Worst experience with an airline"
Worst experience with an airline to date! We fly regularly and due to departure times, needed to fly Frontier. This was our first and absolutely our last time ever flying Frontier. We arrived at the airport at 4:15am, over 2 hours prior to our flight from Orlando to Charlotte, and were “greeted” with a line that was so long it wrapped around the corner, in everyone’s way. NO other airline had this issue at their check-in stations. We stood in line for over an hour which led to us having to literally sprint to the gate. When we finally made it to check our bag, the unfriendly frontier employee informed us that our bag was over 50 pounds, which was insane since it only weighed 27 pounds on the flight there and no additional items were added to our bag. $100 is what it cost (in addition to the already $40 I paid when I checked in online for our bag). Absolutely ridiculous that somehow our bag doubled in weight and the $40 couldn’t be put towards the new fee. I’ve never been on an airline that was so unhelpful, unfriendly, and unorganized!! If this has taught me anything it is to spend the little bit of extra money to fly Delta or American because you pay for what you get with Frontier .. or in our case, didn’t get. Save yourself the headache, don’t fly Frontier! !

### "I do not recommend whatsoever"
Not Verified |  I have never written a review in my life, but felt a need to do so. I’d say I’m a pretty frequent flyer, typically fly JetBlue, American Airlines, delta, and have also flown spirit airlines. I’ve never encountered the service I received with this airline. We flew out of Boston on March 18th, all was well only complain with that was that they told us when we got on the plane that there was absolutely no beverages, not even water or ice or any snacks because the plane hadn’t been restocked. Other than that all was fine. We got here at 7pm on March 26th to be ready for boarding at 8:15pm for our 9pm flight. No worries everything was good to go up until we noticed that it was 8:45pm and we haven’t boarded or got any updates. 9pm came around, same thing. Everyone working for frontier was clueless. 945 comes around, we board. Sat there on the plane before even moving until 1030. Started moving, preparing for takeoff only to stop again for another 45 minutes in silence with nobody saying what’s going on other than “thank you for your patience.” We were then told at about 11:15pm that we were heading back to the gate to start deplaning, and eventually got off at about 11:25pm. Currently sitting in the airport with no updates on whether we’ll be getting home tonight or if we should leave the airport. Anytime we ask, it’s just ‘I’m unsure’. Nobody has a clue, not one to complain but this airline sucks and I do not recommend whatsoever.

### "sitting here without any information"
A 9 pm departure and we were delayed 1 hour for no reason. Two of us tried to get an answer and got silent treatment. Then we boarded, for another hour - a suspiciously long time . Then we taxied 500 feet away and were told the plane was broken and we needed to return to the gate for indefinite amount of time! Now we are sitting here trapped in this metal can without any information as to what is happening and the only thing the crew tells us is to keep our masks on and our seat belt tightly fastened.

### "Staff were beyond rude"
Not Verified |  Will do everything possible to never fly on this airline again. Staff were beyond rude to almost mean for no reason. Horrible customer support. Slow, incompetent, and overall clueless. Delay after delay with no explanation. Nobody offering to help and an overall very rude group of staff we encountered. There were so many ways the situations could have been improved but they did nothing but make it worse.

### "separated from their bags for days"
Frontier Airlines is the perfect airline for those who want to be separated from their bags for days after arriving to their destination. It's also perfect for those who want their arrival time to become their departure time returning home. What if you desire playing a little football finding your departure gate, Frontier is perfect, too. Well, at least, you can have a good workout going from gate to gate for departure. An airline that will not even give you a drink or some peanuts for free after a three hours delay? Frontier is the perfect one for that too. When you arrive at your home airport, do you want to wait a long time for the aircraft door to open or to get your bags? Fly Frontier

### "Never again"
Not Verified |  Never again. This nightmare started Wednesday, after 5 hours waiting our flight was cancelled, then we waited 90 minutes to get our bags. We rebooked for Friday, boarding was delayed 2 hours, mech issues resulted in another hour on the plane waiting, capped off with a 30 minute wait on the tarmac for a gate to open up. People are nice...the infrastructure is not. Never again.

### "nobody was concerned with all the disruptions"
We were booked on the flight, arrived at the airport about 2 hours before the flight. We were checked in and had to wait in an endless line to drop a bag. By the time we got there the agent told us we cannot board as we do not have enough time (20 min). She turned us away and said we needed to rebook. The line for that was even longer and slower. After standing there with almost no movement for an hour, and concerned that we will lose all options to fly back same day I booked a one way ticket on another airline for myself and my 3 kids for 2000$. Agents were checked out, nobody was concerned with all the disruptions to the hundreds of travelers. The worst experience I have ever had at an airport.

### "try to avoid giving out refunds"
Not Verified |  Our flight got canceled after being delayed multiple times due to "weather". I checked the weather and there wasn't any rain from my where I was departing or arriving. I tried calling while in the line to rebook and got put on hold multiple times inexplicably. After getting to the front of the line the only flight they had was for two days later and they didn't even offer to put us in a hotel. The only benefit to this airline is their prices. They implement very scummy business practices to try to avoid giving out refunds.

### "$130 to check the bags"
Flew Delta on the way to Las Vegas carry on was free checked bag $30. Flew Frontier back $130 to check the bags, carry on is not free. Will never fly frontier again. This is ridiculous

### "Frontier and delays. Name a more iconic duo"
Frontier and delays. Name a more iconic duo. The first time I flew Frontier a couple of years ago, there was a sudden 2.5 hour delay which they claim is due to climate reasons. Okay fair enough I excused it. Now the second time I decided to fly Frontier, there is another 2 hour delay. This has never happened to me on any other airline. No other airline has experienced as many delays as Frontier and I've only flown with them twice.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
They delayed 7 times before finally cancelling flight 3+ hours after scheduled departure with no explanation and little help. The flight was fully booked with no available flights the rest of the day at that airport. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "They cancelled our flight a couple of hours before boarding"
Not Verified |  I do not recommend Frontier Airlines. They cancelled our flight a couple of hours before boarding. They had no explanation as to why either. When we attempted to rebook with another airline using their booking system the booking system confirmed 3 out of the 4 tickets only. There was no customer service number to call to try to confirm my minor child's seat in the new flight. So we had to spend over an hour at the Southwest ticket counter to try to get my young child the same flight as us. We then had to take a later flight and pay for the new airline tickets out of pocket. We are hoping they will reimburse us for it, but I have no faith in that company.

### "Never on time"
Hands down the worst airline you can take. Never on time, rude staff. Do not fly Frontier if you can. If you can afford any other airline at all, take that. Frontier isn’t as cheap as it seems with all the fees and baggage prices. Take any other airline and if you’ve flown frontier before write a review so they lose business. I have been sitting on the plane for 2 hours now without taking off. Never fly frontier.

### "lack of kindness towards the customers was shameful"
Not Verified |  Sunday morning we arrived at the airport at 3:30 am to board our flight to Orlando Florida. We went through 1.5 hour wait to get through TSA and then sit at gait A10 waiting to board our flight at 6:15 am . 6:15 am came and went as we waited on a “ technical “ glitch until 4pm with very little updates from the horrible Frontier staff! At 4pm ( approx. 10 hours later) the  staff shares with us that the airlines oversold our seats and the seats are no longer available. At that point we had the option to get a refund and not take the babes to Florida, or come back( tomorrow ) today at 3am again, go through TSA and be on the plane at 5:15am. We opted to come back today at 3am in order to get our flight at 6am. We got the kids up at 1:45 AM got them in the car headed to Cleveland airport. As we were taking the exit to enter the airport, we get a text that our flight was delayed until 1:30 pm. So now we are at the airport and have to turn around because we were not going to sit at the airport with a 7yr old and 11 months for 10 plus hours. We decide to go get a hotel so we can all get some sleep. Then back to the airport at 8:30 am /through TSA, to have our flight delayed until 4pm today, so try as we may, not to make the kids wait, we sat at the airport from 8 am - 4pm waiting ( 8 hours) to board the plane bound for Orlando, only to be told to deboard the plan as they can’t get us to our destination because the pilot can’t fly more than 12 hours a day. Then why allow 120 people board a plane? Several families had been waiting 12 - 36 hours just to be told sorry, nothing we can do! The lack of kindness towards the customers was shameful!

### "disrespectful airline"
New York to Orlando. A disaster is a compliment to this disorganized, not accountable and disrespectful airline. The communication is unreliable and the poor people working at the airport are not trained and/or accountable to answer any questions or support/help a ticket holder. I can go and on to explain in detail but it’s not worth it.

### "get you in the end with other costs"
Not Verified |  They may advertise low fares but they'll get you in the end with other costs including, and I kid you not, the cost of a soda, close to $3.50 a can. We booked through Expedia a while back only to have them cancel our direct flight from RDU to Cancun less than a week before the trip. We couldn't cancel our trip because were within the window to cancel reservations at the resort. We would have lost our money. But we were able to re-book our flights for 3 times what we originally paid and this time they added a stop through ATL, and they cancelled that flight the night before we left. We had to look for another flight for at least 2 hours and then had to fly from RDU to Kennedy then to Cancun. We ended up losing a full day. By the way, the flight from RDU to ATL and then Cancun still flew and was on time. We got text notifications. Then on the flight home we found out Frontier didn't offer e-check-in. So when we walked into Cancun Airport, we along with at least 1000 other fliers got to stand in a line for 2 hours and 15 minutes just to check-in and get a boarding pass. We also had to get a negative COVID test before leaving which we did. Frontier never even asked for it. When we left the line, it was even longer than when we arrived. Then our Flight was an hour late landing and when we onboarded, we sat on that plane for over an hour before we even left the Jetway. The flight attendants were rude and that's putting it mildly. I have a list I keep of things I'll never do again. I added flying with Frontier to that list.

### "very disappointed with Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified |  We are very disappointed with Frontier Airlines. When we arrived to check in our bags the wait was an hour and half wait. Once we got to the counter she said we cant check you in because 40 min wont be long enough to get through tsa. We arrives two hours early and she blames us for not having time. Its not our fault they took so long to check everyone in. Half of the plane missed their flight that day. It was upsetting they wouldn't find us a flight for the same day. They said they wont reimburse for another hotel and car rental. We had to wait till the next morning to fly out. On top of all of this the flight coming to Orlando was an hour late and an hour to take off. The baggage took an hour to receive. We will never take Frontier again.

### "I can not believe Frontier is still in business"
Absolutely horrible, I can not believe Frontier is still in business. I will do everything I can to leave a bad review everywhere so nobody wastes their time or money on Frontier and ends up having to pay more with their own money for extra unexpected expenditures like transportation, food, hotel, flights. We waited in line for 4.5hrs, we were not able to check in and get our boarding passes online, waited in line for 4.5 hrs, delayed flight 3 times and canceled flight unexpectedly which left us stranded in Orlando needing to pay for our own transportation, food, hotel and next flights. And now we don’t have a flight home and we’re having to use other airlines. Nobody spoke English, they changed our gate 3 times, we waited in the baggage check in for 4.5 hours and then once they stopped changing the gate on us we waited at the last gate for 1 hour. Our flight was canceled unexpectedly and we needed to pay for food, transportation, hotel, and next flights on our own without any worry from Frontier about reimbursement. The floors were covered in dirt, the plane was filthy and had garbage left over from previous flight. Nobody was helpful and they told us they’re going on break and didn’t help at all. The flight was dirty, there was no entertainment, no wifi capabilities, the stewards wanted nothing to do with us, were crabby and wearing un-professional clothes, they charge you for any drinks or snacks that you want, nothing is free. The baggage carousel took an hour and a half to get our luggage, that’s 1hr and 30min waiting for our bags to arrive. Then when we wanted to talk to a representative to see why they canceled our flight and left us stranded in Orlando without food, transportation, lodging and flights, they said they are going on break and didn’t talk to us.

### "my flight is always canceled at the very last minute"
Not Verified |  Each time I try to fly with Frontier they cancel my flight and always give me a voucher instead of giving me my money back. This is the third time this has happened. They are super unprofessional. I have never actually been on a Frontier flight because my flight is always canceled at the very last minute.

### "We will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  When we boarded El Paso airport we were asked to do bag check in online. My daughter and I couldn’t figure it out and the employees would not assist us so we ended up paying so much more to check in bags. The most unfriendly employees ever. The flight back wasn’t any better very expensive bag check in, worst customer service I have ever experienced. First and last time. We will never fly Frontier again! Southwest it is!

### "The worst customer service I have ever possibly experienced"
Not Verified |  I was in disbelief when the announcement came across as departure from Orlando to Buffalo is delayed for the 3rd time. This was our 26th Wedding anniversary, went downhill from there. Also attendant speaking over the intercom said we are delayed again. I proceeded to ask her along with several fellow passengers can't believe this. She shrugged her shoulders to say too bad. The worst customer service I have ever possibly experienced. I have been in the service industry for over 34yrs. I would and never would treat any person like this, especially with grave concerns about being stranded. She continued to tell use all the pilots have gone home after 3 delays. We have flown 2 times with Frontier and been delayed 6 times. Good bye Frontier, we will never fly with you ever again.

### "customer service was horrible"
Not Verified |  They canceled the flight a couple of minutes before we were supposed to board so I had to scramble to get a last minute plane ticket. I was at the airport at 6.30 am and didn't get home until 2am because of Frontiers mismanagement. When trying to get the refund for the new expensive ticket I had to go with a different airline, customer service was horrible. They didn't let me speak, but kept speaking over me trying to get me to book a flight somewhere a month away and she ended hanging up on me when I asked her why she wants me to fly somewhere so badly instead of doing her job and helping me with my question. I will never set foot on a Frontier flight and since a lot of people were upset with this airline, I don't expect their business to be great after this.

### "They were ungraciously treated
My family were on a flight from Cleveland to Tampa on Friday 3/18 at 9:40PM. As seems to be the policy of Frontier Airlines, once my family got checked in and through security, Frontier sends a text message that the flight was delayed "due to a late arriving aircraft". Well it seems that "late arriving" is the only schedule this company goes by. My family was given a voucher for airport food, but it was useless because by that time at night everything was closed. The delay went from 2 hours to 6 hours and the airline left everyone stranded in a closed airport. My family decided to go back to a relatives and get some rest before the flight, only to find the airport security closed. When we called Cleveland Hopkins, we were told that Frontier did not notify them that the flight would be delayed and therefore there was no one to let my family (and several others) back into the boarding area - so they missed their flight after being at the airport for several hours and going back and forth twice. They were ungraciously treated when they were rebooked, and didn't offer even a free soda on the flight when my family complained. Then to add to the disaster, once again 30 minutes before their flight was to take off on the next night, Frontier once again sends a text that the flight was delayed. So once again my family spent another 5-6 hours at the airport waiting on Frontier. When they finally arrived in Tampa (their luggage had been flown in on the previous flight) they were met with a very rude customer service person. My family hadn't slept in nearly two days and been jerked around with absolutely no apology.

### "Never flying this airline again"
Possibly the worst flight experience i have ever had. flew from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale, ended up being delayed a totally of 6 hrs. resulted in spending a total of 10hrs in the airport. Now, I'm currently waiting for my flight from fort Lauderdale back to Philadelphia. Was supposed to take off at 7:09 and were delayed almost 2 hrs now, absolutely crazy. Their staff is unprofessional and have no answers for anyone. it’s crazy they won’t even refund some sort of money for our flight difficulties. Never flying this airline again.

### "a terrible disgrace"
Not Verified |  My flight from Chicago to Phoenix and Phoenix to Chicago was delayed 5 hours each. They didn't even offer water or anything. I called to tell them how I felt about this terrible flight and they cared so much they literally offered me 25$ that was a terrible disgrace.

### "without any care for customers"
Frontier and every other airline are all out to profit without any care for customers. All they do is overbook these flights to make money knowing that there will be delays and cancellations. They know they’re short staffed but continue to be overbook flights because of their greed and lack of empathy. I feel helpless.

### "Where’s the service I am paying for"
Not Verified |  “The Greenest Airline in America”! At what cost? The consumer, that's what! We are charged for everything and the airline has no organization at their ticket counters or their gates. But they can claim to be the “Greenest”. If you are going to charge for everything don’t you think you would at least have good service? I mean there’s all types of service charges included. Where’s the service I am paying for. Both flights were delayed which isn’t the issue, that happens. The flight to Mexico’s ticketing and boarding was a mess. We spent more time waiting in line to check in and board because the staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing. Once the plane was boarded that flight was ok. Now the return flight was where my desire to write this review stemmed from. First off we were sent text messages stating the flight was delayed by “0” minutes, then a Gate change, then an undetermined amount of delay, meanwhile the board at the airport said the flight was early and continued to throughout. Tickets all stated gate 60 but the staff had no answers for what was happening with the flight or what gate it would be out of. Even after they were asked by multiple customers at different times, they had nothing to say not even a sorry or we are working on getting the information for you. Once the plane finally arrived and the gate was determined the boarding process started and that went fairly well. Once all the passengers were boarded and the doors were closed the Captain said we were just getting a little fuel. The fuel truck came and went (15 mins max) and yet we still sat at the gate for an hour. No explanation, not even a word from the crew or the captain. Another hour added to an already late flight, on a full aircraft, with very little room because they have added more rows of seats to make less flights to be “Green”. They want “Green” but can’t take care of their patrons in a way that makes them feel like giving up some of the comforts to pay a little less for a flight is worth it. Sure the flight might be less but figure in the cost of delays and all the add-ons the airline gets you for and you’re crammed into a small uncomfortable seat is it all worth it? Did we make it to our destinations safely? Yes. Was it a pleasant experience? Absolutely not! The fact the once the flight got underway none of the crew or the captain apologized for the delay or gave any kind of explanation for as to why we sat at the gate on a boarded plane for an hour is proof that the airline really doesn’t care about its patrons. It’s about how much money they can get out of them to use our airline and we can call it “ Green” because we lowered our weight limits for luggage and we will use less fuel. How are we using less fuel sitting at a gate for a hour with everything still running? How are we creating less carbon emissions but letting the engines idle for an hour on the tarmac?

### "Customer agents cant even give the right information"
My flight from Sioux Falls to Orlando on Friday March 11 was canceled 3 hours before the flight without any explanation. There were no flights on Saturday or Sunday from Sioux Falls to Orlando. I was told by three different customer service agents to buy tickets with different airlines and would get reimbursed. But I got an email saying I would not get reimbursed. I am never going to fly again. Customer agents cant even give the right information to their customers. I am never going to trust them.

### "Do not waste your time"
Newark to Cancun. I booked a round-trip flight through Frontier Airlines website on September 30, 2021 for (5) passengers traveling Newark Airport (EWR) to Cancun, Mexico (CUN) for a total Airfare $1,496.60 Baggage fees $620.00 Taxes and Carrier-Imposed Fees $927.75 Grand Total $3,044.35 In addition, I purchased travel insurance through TravelGuard and charged by AIG/TravelGuard $169.70. I canceled the flight on December 17, 2021 due to illness and was issued a travel credit by Frontier Airlines in the amount of $2554.34 set to expire on March 19, 2022. No flights are available from Newark EWR to any destination national or international. No direct flights are available within a 100-mile radius of NYC to any destination other than Orlando, FL. Three-months of searching with no direct-round-trip flight options that meet or exceed the original booking. Travel Guard denied my claim and Frontier Airlines does not have a solution other to hold my $2554.34 hostage. They will not extend the credit deadline nor will they reimburse me for the unusable credit. This issue was escalated to the Customer Relations department with no resolution available. Do not waste your time or money on either Frontier Airlines or AIG/TravelGuard they are in the business of stealing peoples money.

### "They charge for everything"
They charge for everything and aren’t any cheaper than Southwest. If you are in rows 2 & 3 they don’t let you put your bags above your seat because they reserve for the 1st row so you have to put them above row 3. However, after boarding starts they allow people to take the space above 2&3 that are sitting farther back. It’s absolutely ridiculous.

### "Next time we’ll just take a connecting flight instead"
Not Verified |  Very rough. First our flight was delayed and the poor flight attendants weren’t even made aware before passengers. Then they told us our flight was at a new gate and that gate told us our flight was not there and sent us back. We have a full flight and our giant group had to go move back and forth between the gates. They told us to line up to board and then didn’t board for an hour. Next time we’ll just take a connecting flight instead. Also I think they delayed the flight again and didn’t tell us because it took us a suspiciously long time to board.

### "not notified of the change until boarding"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Had a 6 a.m. flight that we had to wake up at 1:00 to catch a 3:00 am bus and we checked in at the airport and got through security check to find out that our flight was canceled. We travelled with kids and everyone was exhausted from a trip. We were not notified of the change until our boarding time. And no one was willing to tell us the reason of our cancellation.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified | Milwaukee to Las Vegas. Worst airline ever. They canceled both our flight back from our destination and to our destination. The flight back was canceled weeks in advance which ok whatever, we decided to go with Southwest our way back because the only option they Frontier gave us was a different day at a different airport with no transportation back to our cars. Today, we were supposed to fly out and got an email a few hours before while we were already on our way - it’s a 2 hour drive - and was told sorry they plane is canceled, no reasons why. I have no trust in this airline and looking at the other reviews, it almost seems like a good thing they were canceled. Never again! Don’t get your hopes up with this company.

### "most unorganized flight I’ve ever had"
This is the most unorganized flight I’ve ever had. I’ve had Spirit flights go more smooth than my frontier one. My first flight was cancelled so I had to leave a day late and change airports to be able to make it back to work in time. My new flight left today and now they keep getting delayed and today they pushed it back an hour just to cancel the delay so I had to rush here when I live 2 hours away. I make it to my gate in time and then 10 minutes before boarding they delay it 3 more hours and change the gate. If they set a time and have a full plane then they should be able to organize their trips enough to know what the hell is going on and follow a schedule.

### "would not recommend Frontier Airline"
Not Verified |  When Frontier flight #1363 from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta landed on March 12th, 2022 and reached the jet bridge a flight attendant called into the intercom: “Everyone run as fast as you can to the front of the plane.” I thought she was joking but then the pilot came on the intercom and yelled “Leave all your belongings behind and run to the front of the plane. Now! Go! Go!” Panic ensued. I was in row 27A at the back of the plane. There were six people per row in front of me with nearly the entire plane still aboard who could not possibly fit into the aisle and run at once without trampling one another. Passengers started yelling, “Run, Run!” No one from Frontier explained what the danger was or tried to calm us. When I finally arrived to the jet bridge, crying and with my heart beating out of my chest, I overheard a flight attendant say that the plane’s weight was unbalanced and that the airplane may tip over. After flying extensively for the last 40 years, I would not recommend Frontier Airlines to my family, friends or business associates.

### "Frontier totally ignored its customers"
This is by far the worst domestic airline I have ever flown. Let's start with the fact that we landed at 10.30 pm. They finally unloaded our bags at 12.15 pm. No announcements by the airline, no information, no nothing. Flights that came in after ours on other airlines got their bags promptly. Frontier totally ignored its customers. Then there's the nickel-and-diming for everything. You want coffee. There's a charge. You want a snack. Charge. Anything and everything was an additional charge. About the only things they don't charge for, yet, are air and the bathroom although you might bring quarters just in case. Now the latest scam. Every other airline a suitcase can weigh up to 50 lbs. Not Frontier. Their newest rule is 40 lbs maximum or you are surcharged for an overweight bag. As to the seats, this is a cattle car, no room at all, no padding in seats, etc. Not comfortable. I will say that the check in procedure was efficient, and the people were nice. Unfortunately, this airline has a proclivity to annoy its passengers, and that carried over to the interactions between flight attendants and passengers. All in all: Avoid this airline if you can do so.

### "I do not recommend Frontier Airlines"
I do not recommend Frontier Airlines. The seats were terribly uncomfortable. We were delayed by about 45 minutes due to them overbooking the flight. The ride was smooth but other than that I do not recommend it.

### "Low class, low service"
Hugely disgusted and disappointed with this airline -they nickel & dime every part of the flight. Luggage charged including carryons, seats, and checkin limited to 40kgs? And then on top of it the aircraft had no tv, no usb chargers, tiny seats and the flight was not even that cheap! It’s an insult to airline travel. I miss the days of decent air travel with respectable food options and luggage being treated like humans not cattle. Would happily pay more for better service. Never again. Low class, low service!

### "No compensation was offered"
Not Verified |  Wife had booked a return flight on Saturday 3/12. The flight was canceled due to weather (understandable) but the problem arose as her the only option they offered. (3) days later Monday at 8:30 PM at night, They than delayed the flight to leave at 10:30 PM. She was sent another text stating the flight was again delayed til 12:30 AM Tuesday morning now 4 days late. Than they canceled the flight again! We are now flying JetBlue! No compensation was offered by Frontier. Frontier should be ashamed of themselves, they are a disaster. It's all about the money where they nickel & dime everyone to death. Any other reasonable airline would have offered a next day flight. even if it was on another airline.

### "disgusted by the lack of customer service"
Not Verified |  I am writing to you as we sit in a lobby of a hotel we booked at 8am this morning, waiting for our room to become available.. but I need to express my grievance with your airline. We had a 6am flight from Orlando to Boston. We arrived 2 hours ahead (as your site advises) to find the line to check in a mile long. We wanted to check in online but you had zero option to do this with military bags. We were advised by your employee to get into the checked bag line to avoid the $68 checked bag fee. We waited in line an hour and a half only to be told we missed our check in by 5 minutes. And there was nothing you would do for us and directed us to the missed flight line. We stood in this line another 20-30 minutes and made it to the front where another one of your employees told the 100 or so people in this line to "form another line over there. We watched as everyone behind us was now in front of us. Where we waited another hour. We watched as this line became longer and longer with people in our exact situation. We had over a third of our flight to Boston miss their flights alone. The people in the "missed flights" line was just Frontier customers and this extended all the way down the entire airport. There was well over 500 people in this line by the time we got to the teller. More as we leave the airport. When we finally get to speak to the teller, our only option is waiting until Wednesday to fly out with frontier OR get a refund and try to rebook today. We originally paid 660 dollars for our flight round trip and was given an $88 refund. . No other compensation in any other form. With no other flights leaving today that we could get on. The earliest and least expensive option for us was tomorrow at 8am. Now this is what we are financially out because of this ... 600 for 2 new ONE WAY flights for tomorrow. 200 for a hotel for tonight. 100 to board my dog an additional night. 50 for our car to continue to sit at Logan airport. Money lost with our jobs because we can't make it to work Tuesday. Then misc for food. Not to mention we are struck trying to find someone to assist with our kids for an addition 24 hours. Plus the hassle and headache. I am so utterly disgusted by the lack of customer service and disorganization to your airline. I will never, in my life, fly with Frontier Airlines again and will suggest others to avoid it as well until you make this right. And to think we are only a few people this happened to today.

### "I will never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Every thing about this experience with this airline was horrible and I will never fly with them again. So to start I show up at the airport almost 3 hours early only to almost miss my flight. Frontier booked 4 different flights out of Cancun all for the same time Dallas, Boston, Orlando, and I forget the last one. What did that do, it put about 600 people all in line at the exact same time with only 4 or 5 people checking in everyone. So even though I arrived 3 hours prior as instructed I barely made it to the flight. Then after boarding we sat on the runway for 1hr so we arrived in Orlando 1 hr late even though we boarded on time. After all of this I was just exhausted and ready to collect my bag and drive home just to find out they've lost the bag that they charged me 75.00 dollars to check with no explanation as to where my bag is and the Frontier employees said they have no way to see if it even left Cancun. Inside my bag not only did I lose all my personal belonging such as clothes and shoes but I lost souvenirs from 4 different countries that I cant just turn around and go back and get more. I tried to call Frontier as soon as I left the airport only to sit on hold for over 1 hr and no one ever answered till finally I hung up. I travel a lot and I will never use this airline again ever. There isnt one thing about them that is efficient or comfortable.

### "You can’t play with people’s money"
This was my worst traveling experience, too much happened but I will only review the overpayment. My boarding pass clearly states for a 50lb bag because it said on the pass the following: "Your bags were purchased prior to our new bag weight limits. You are entitled to a 50lbs checked-bag limit.” However they charged me for a 45lb bag in Vegas. I noticed this after I paid. When I arrived in CO I spoke to an agent who stated I would be refunded when I arrived home to DC. Spoke to a rude agent in DC who refused to refund me, she said “Well why did you give them your card? You noticed after? Well it’s too late now I can’t refund you!” And turned away! This is crazy! You can’t play with people’s money $50 is a tank of gas and I want my refund. I tried calling them over and over and each time I got someone they hung up. All that money for an un-reclinable, hard seat with no room! Then they want to cheat you too?

### "Absolutely worst experience"
Absolutely worst experience, our flight was supposed to leave at 5.51, we were delayed and did not leave until 8.54, we sat on the tarmac for 15 minutes before getting in the air, once we arrived in Memphis we sat on the runway for 20 minutes before finally taxiing to the gate. By the time all the passengers got off the plane we were over 3 hours behind which we missed our reservations that we had (mind you we pre-paid) so we lost our deposit. Thanks Frontier I will never fly with you again.

### "Most unprofessional airline"
Not Verified |  Just canceled the flight at the last minute without any alternative flights. Now I can’t get to my destination and interview thanks to Frontier. Most unprofessional airline. Never going to fly with them!

### "they did not deliver what we paid them to provide"
Not Verified |  I decided to give Frontier another chance after prior bad experiences. No doubt, Frontier is the worst and most unreliable airline on planet earth. After nickel and diming for everything (no checked bag, then let us charge you for a carry on, oh you want a seat assignment, let's charge for that too), they seem to consistently suffer "bad luck" beyond their control. They apparently couldn't predict that they would be unable to deliver a suitable airplane to our location in advance and subjected us to a series of seemingly "uncertain" announcements regarding their hope of producing and aircraft. One delay, two, delays, three delays, simply put, they did not deliver what we paid them to provide. Then we are offered a voucher that doesn't pay for the inconvenience, but can only be used to suffer their incompetence and discourtesy again at a future date. No thanks.

### "this one by far is the worst ever"
Not Verified |  I have flown nearly every major airline and this one by far is the worst ever. Even the Long Island railroad has a better on time performance. I have never seen such horrible, horrible service, they don't deserve to even be in business. Not only is it not cheap but everything is extra, bags, carry-on. There is no TVs in the seats, no drinks, no snacks. If you want to buy that 1$ bag of chips your going to spend 5$ and beer is 10$ and a small alcohol is 10. My plane was delayed an hour. It came in exactly an hour late and departed 2.5 hours later! Zero announcements. Chaos at the gate.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Orlando to Cedar Rapids. This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. They charge $50 for a carry on plus another $50 for a check bag that cannot weigh more than 40lbs. Then they cancelled our flight at the last minute and did absolutely nothing to find a way home or assist in finding a place to stay the night. Plus the reimbursement they are offering doesn't cover the hotel room or the additional cost of another flight. Absolutely terrible customer service.

### "worst flight experience I have ever had"
Honestly this is the worst flight experience I have ever had. It made me believe I was saving but they make you pay for bags over 40. Carry ons as well and it ended up being more expensive. The flights are so uncomfortable. Both mine were behind. The staff were rude to other passengers and I could literally hear them talking poorly about people on my way home. I will never fly with them again.

### "55 minutes waiting for the jet bridge"
Not Verified |  Flight from Cleveland to Orlando, everything fine until we landed, sat on plane for 55 minutes waiting for the jet bridge to arrive to unload plane. Not sure where who is responsible airline or the airport.

### "Canceled our flight with no alternative"
Not Verified |  Canceled our flight with no alternative for 2 days! Ticket prices tripled and can’t afford to get home. Now we are stuck with no money or place to stay. Very upset.

### "Will never use this airline again"
Delay after delay. Spent 45 minutes circling over the ocean and ran low of fuel. We had to be rerouted to a different airport and sit on the runway for an hour before we could get back in the air to reach our destination. What was supposed to be a two hour flight ended up being a six hour flight and the staff was not communicating how long the delays were going to take. I paid extra to have some more leg room but the seat was very uncomfortable, don’t waste your money. They also charge you extra for literally everything. Will never use this airline again.

### "Frontier is the worst"
Frontier is the worst, stay far away from this airline, they cancel our flight with no options except for to rent a car to drive from Orlando to Virginia and we are a family of 4 with 2 children. The only reason I gave them a 1/10 is because the system wouldn't allow me to rate them at a zero otherwise that's what I'd give them.

### "By far the very worst airline"
Not Verified |  By far the very worst airline. There is zero customer service. Our flight was cancelled 10 minutes prior to boarding. Our entire spring break vacation was ruined. The airline ONLY offered a refund for the amount I paid. No other form of compensation. They simply do not care about their passengers. I will not fly frontier again.

### "how outraged I am by all this mess"
Please for your own good listen to the reviews and do not fly with them, they would really ruin your vacations. Words aren't enough to describe how outraged I am by all this mess.

### "damaged my surfboard on the flight"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! I flew on Frontier Airlines with a surfboard. I paid the highest transport costs ever for the short-haul flight. The airline damaged my surfboard on the flight. They refuse to pay for the damage. The people have absolutely no knowledge about things they transport, they are customer unfriendly, they charge outrageous prices for surfboards and the luggage staff are rough on luggage.

### "missed my connecting flight"
Flight arrived 2 hours late and I missed my connecting flight. Now, I have paid for 2 flights and another that I missed as well as a night at a hotel because of them.

### " Do not fly with them"
Horrible company. I originally checked my car seat stroller at the gate. Once we arrived in Atlanta they said they were short staffed so the sent my car seat and stroller through the baggage claim which took 2 hours. My stroller got stuck in the door of the oversized baggage and I took pictures and called. The customer service supervisor said to wait until they called me back which made no sense to me. I called for a week straight and even uploaded the pictures only to get an email saying I did not report the issue within 4 hours. Waste of money. Do not fly with them.

### "I have had great experiences"
This was my 6th time flying with Frontier. I have had great experiences! Even when I had to change flight days, they were wonderful at helping me. I love Frontier Airlines and the crew!

### "Very poor customer service"
We booked round trip flights. When we left Buffalo we had bags weighing between 40 and 50lbs not over 50 which was the max weight included in the bags we had to purchase. On our return flight one week later they said when we were at the check in counter we must pay an additional 50.00 per bag as there policy changed in the week we were away and that we can not only have bags weighing 40lbs. The service rep at the counter was very rude and yelling at us and told us it was our fault we needed to check the website, it is not their job to email us any changes. Our flight was also delayed 3 hours going to Florida and 1 hour on the return. When we asked why it was delayed on the return flight the agent told us I don’t know don’t ask me again. There was no communication with the passengers. Very poor customer service. I chatted with a rep online when I got home and explained the situation and she said in writing it’s fine we do not mind if you are not satisfied just don’t fly with us again.

### "Employees were terrible and no help"
I wish I could give them a zero rating! Terrible airline. Our flight was unexpectedly canceled after over an hour delay. No explanation was given as to why it was delayed. Then they told us we had to wait in a line for a refund that didn’t move for over an hour. Employees were terrible and no help. Impossible to get anyone on the phone. Last time I’ll ever book with Frontier.

### "My husband and I had a horrible experience with Frontier"
My husband and I had a horrible experience with Frontier. I waited in a line for over an hour to have my bag checked. Then once I made it to the front of the line, they started asking passengers behind us to come check their bags before us. We missed our flight due to this. Then when I asked for assistance to book another flight home, they said they couldn’t help me because they had to help the other customers. We ended up flying with American Airlines which I highly recommend over Frontier. Oh and don’t bother sending in a complaint, because their customer service reps have no clue how to read or how assist unhappy customers. Also, don’t purchase their travel insurance. That only counts if you have Covid or die apparently.

### "he huffed and said you're too late"
Worst experience I have ever had with a airline. I showed up at Orlando Airport for our flight home, they have us clocked in for 5:48am we got sent to a machine to print out bag slips and machine told me to go to customer service desk, so I do and then get sent back to machine again machine tells me to go to the desk. I explained to woman controlling the line so she sent me to more help desk. Oh that was awful he said I can't help you, you have to get in that line I explained to him 4 times that the woman sent me to you then he huffed and said you're too late, I was in shock to late my flight is 8:18 am I was here at 5:48 am - he put his hand up and said too bad and called next in line. I had to purchase tickets from Jetblue to get my family home for another thousand dollars after I had already purchased my tickets from Frontier and they offered me nothing but a good luck.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
I can't really say enough negative things about my experience with Frontier. We purchased "The Works" package so that we had flexibility with our flights. Frontier cancelled one of the flights that we had booked, so we were forced to change our flights to a new date. Frontier then cancelled the new flights, and we requested a refund. They would not refund the $1,000+ for "The Works" package because we had "used up" the free flight change fees the first time we had to change the flights. This was in addition to them charging $1,000 extra on the new flights when we had to change them. The Works" package only eliminates the change fees but the new flights still cost way more. Absolutely horrible experience and I will never fly Frontier nor recommend anyone fly with them.

### "fee for cancelling is ridiculous!"
Not Verified |  We had a family member take a turn for the worse. We booked a set of flights in the evening to leave midday the following day to go and see the family member. When we woke up this morning, we got the news that the family member passed away in the night. We no longer needed to go and see the family member and would be getting different tickets once funeral arrangements were made. I called Frontier to see about cancelling and getting a refund for the 3 tickets I had purchased. I was informed that they would need a copy of the death certificate and the cancellation fee would be approximately half the cost of the original ticket. The remaining value could then be transferred into flight credit. It is really difficult to even know where to begin. Since when his cancellation of a service some sort of legal issue? There is no reason they need or have a right to the death certificate. The fee for cancelling is ridiculous! I hope they get good use out of the cost of 3 tickets. I will no longer be using this airline.

### "book with another airline"
Not Verified |  Boarding time 1044, departure time 1130. We weren’t allowed on the plan until 12am, no announcement of any type to let passengers know what is going on. The screen said the flight was departed & we were all definitely still waiting to board the flight. After we boarded the plan we sat for another additional 30+ minutes without again any announcement to what’s delaying the flight or even a flight attendant is sight. They left urge whole plane sitting around, confused with tempers rising. Just save yourself some peace and book with another airline.

### "worst experience ever"
I had the worst experience, my flight was at 2:35 pm and they said is delayed for 4:20 pm, then they said it got delayed for 6:30 and alter on the same thing, after 3 hours of waiting, they said that It got canceled, that we have to go to claim our luggage and get refund. So I go to get my luggage and it was never there so I speak with a Frontier agent and she said that the plane is just delayed for 10:30pm, for this cause they said it was canceled. I immediately got another flight cause I really needed to get to Orlando today, it was just a mess, the plane left at midnight I was exhausted and a bunch of people were angry on the plane, terrible service, worst experience ever.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline"
Not Verified |  This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. We get to the airport 2.5 hours before our flight. We checked in online and picked our seats so that was done ahead of time. The baggage check in at Orlando was so insane. It took us over an hour just to get that done! And the confusion on where to go was just unacceptable. When we got to the front of the line, we realized why it was taking so long. They had 2 employees at the counter! And there were many flights flying out around the time we were so there were a few hundred people in two separate lines trying to get baggage check. I saw more than one person get turned away by the time they got to the front because they were going to miss their flight. One lady told me she had been in that line for a couple of hours. It was a real shame. And then security took about 45 minutes. So between those we would have missed our flight, but then the flight was delayed for over an hour. So while that didn’t matter to us, it’s definitely not ok with a lot of the passengers. Not to mention, our flight there was also horrendous. There was a drunk man refusing to wear a mask and they attempted to reason with him for way to long. We all had to get off the plane so that the police could escort him off. Overall, that whole thing made take off about about 3 hours delayed and multiple people missed their connecting flights. I do have to say that the flight attendants seemed to be trying their best on the flights, but you can’t let every flight and the check ins be like this. It’s so unprofessional.

### "once again another empty customer service promise"
Not Verified |  Worst airline! My flights have been canceled on a couple of different occasions. Today it was delayed several times and then the pilot told the whole plane that if the mechanical issues weren't resolved then we would be provided another plane the same day. Well that didn't happen, once again another empty customer service promise.

### "It's not worth it"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline, it looks cheap but will charge you lots for seats and luggage, both check in and carry on. it will ruin your vacation too. My flight was delayed three times and then cancelled on the same day. Hundreds of dollars wasted on entertainment and show tickets for our Vegas Flight. Don't do it. It's not worth it.

### "Worst experience I have ever had with a airline"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I have ever had with a airline. I showed up at Orlando Airport for our flight home, they have us clocked in for 5:48am we got sent to a machine to print out bag slips and machine told me to go to customer service desk, so I do and then get sent back to machine again machine tells me to go to the desk. I explained to woman controlling the line so she sent me to more help desk. Oh that was awful he said I can't help you, you have to get in that line I explained to him 4 times that the woman sent me to you then he huffed and said your too late, I was in shock to late my flight is 8:18 am I was here at 5:48 am. He put his hand up and said to bad and called next in line. I had to purchase tickets from Jetblue to get my family home for another thousand dollars after I had already purchased my tickets from Frontier. I have sent in complaint and demand a refund and still nothing.

### "worst service I’ve ever experienced"
Not Verified |  The worst service I’ve ever experienced. Received a text that our flight would be delayed 7 hours, which would’ve caused us to miss our connecting flight. Customer service provided us no solutions except for a refund for the flight. Luckily our hotel was accommodating with changing dates. Had to fly with a different airline out of a different city. Will never fly with Frontier again, nor should anyone going international.

### "Just horrible all around"
Not Verified |  This has to be the worst airline ever!! Flight was scheduled for 10 pm. It was initially delayed 45 minutes, then 1 hours 30 minutes, then 2 hours 15 minutes to 12:29am! Then they sent another alert saying you will actually be leaving at 11 pm instead of 12:29am (delayed time). Only for us to get there early enough to catch the 11 pm flight, to only be delayed again until 1215am! Flights are super cheap for a reason, service definitely sucks. I would not recommend any one EVER use this so called airline, especially if you have an actual schedule you’re trying to stick to. Not to mention they completely overbooked the previous flight by 40 people! And everyone had to get moved to this trash flight that kept getting delayed. Just horrible all around.

### "could not get a refund"
Not Verified |  Very bad service for first-time flyers. Paid over $400 for a round trip could not get a refund after making the reservation less than 24 hours that I had to cancel. Did not want to add credit to my airline, did not want to give me my money back, very bad service on the phone, they rush you off the phone.

### "make Spirit look like royalty"
Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta. In my opinion and my experience Frontier Airlines are the worst! They make Spirit look like royalty. I purchased two tickets to go to Atlanta but 5 mins later I had to cancel. My cancellation fees cost more than the two tickets. How does that make or meet any kind of logic. I have never flown Frontier this would have been my first time but I’m just going to with the flow and never booking with them. At least Spirit give you a credit. Frontier Airlines shouldn’t be allowed to fly!

### "Stay away from this airline"
Stay away from this airline. Worst experience I’ve ever had. My luggage has been lost for 5 days and they keep giving me the runaround to find it. No communication and not helpful at all. This is just one of the various complaints that I have. Upon arrival we had to sit in the plane for 1 hr waiting for people to arrive at the gate. After we got out of the plane we had to wait for another hour for the luggage to start coming through the carrousel. And after all of that our luggage was missing and no one on site to help us or to inform us.

### "would not let us on the flight"
Not Verified |  We got to the airport 3 hours early. The Frontier check in line was unfathomably long and slow. Once we were checked in we were met with and even longer TSA line. One of the TSA check points broke down which compounded the issue. We were 2 min late to the doors closing. They would not let us on the flight however they did take the time to stop the plane to remove our luggage and the luggage of the several other passengers who missed the flight. We were told we had to go back to the Frontier baggage claim, collect our bag, and re book our flight at the Frontier counter outside of security. We rebooked the flight (80 dollar for rebooking) and were then told we could not check in until 3 hour prior to the flight. Never again.

### "Your customer service is atrocious!"
Not Verified |  It has been over 6 months and I still have not received my check for the loss of my bag when I didn't even leave the airport as our flight was canceled! This has been the worst travel experience I have ever had and I will make sure everyone knows how awful Frontier is to work with. Your customer service is atrocious! When the flight was canceled, we were handed a piece of paper and told the next flight wasn't until Friday and it was Wednesday! Then my luggage was lost and when I submitted the paperwork for the flight we had to book, we were not reimbursed the amount promised nor were we reimbursed for an extra night of hotel stay. I asked for an itemized list of how they depreciated my items in my bag and I was never given that either. What a truly awful experience!

### "Absolutely awful experience"
Absolutely awful experience. Booked months in advance, flight way oversold. Didn’t get a seat and the next flight is two days later. They informed me that there is nobody in the airport that can help me.

### "Absolutely terrible"
Absolutely terrible. We flew in from OKC to Las Vegas Nevada and the flight attendants were snarky. On the day of our returning flight 30 minutes before the time of boarding our flight was canceled. No one would take the time to tell us where we should go or what we should do, so we were left scrambling. When we finally did convince someone to tell us what the hell was going on we were informed that the only available flight was in three days. We did not get put in a hotel, we did not get offered another flight. When I book a flight on a specific day I expect to be home on that day. Will not be flying Frontier again.

### "this experience ruined our whole trip"
My 2 daughters and I had a direct flight booked from Cancun to Boston on 2/25. They canceled the flight due to "operational issues" but then told us it was due to weather. They said they could not book us on a flight until 3/1, four days later. The best they could do was fly us to Orlando with an eleven hour layover (which turned out to be 12 due to delays) and then the closest they could get us to Boston was Trenton, NJ. We would then have to figure out our own way home. The hotel we were staying in Mexico was booked, so we had to move to another hotel, wait 12 hrs for the next flight which got me and my kids into NJ at 1.30am, book another hotel there and then rent a car and drive six hours home. When I called and asked about any type of compensation, they said, "Sorry, fill out a form online. When I insisted on speaking with a supervisor, all he said he could do was give me a $25 voucher for a future flight. How can an airline leave people stranded like this without some sort of compensation? The flight attendants were not friendly, the people at the counters were unhelpful and I am sad to say this experience ruined our whole trip.

### "We never heard from a representative from Frontier"
Not Verified |  As someone who travels all the time I do not recommend flying with Frontier, and I couldn’t stress this more. We have had the worst travel experience of our lives with them. First our flight from San Juan Puerto Rico was delayed due to “mechanical problems” then cancelled due to weather in Boston (but other flights left San Juan to go to Boston) and then we were also told it was due to lack of staffing. When the flight was canceled, the staff from Frontier told us there were no flights out until Thursday 3/3. After hours of scrambling to find a new flight, we went up to the Frontier counter and they informed us that they added a new flight, we booked this, they refused to pay for lodging (because it was due to weather) so we had to pay for a hotel and transportation. Last night we already received messages regarding flight delays. We were waiting until 1pm to board for our flight that was supposed to be at 11am. The flight itself was fine. When we landed, they offloaded the wrong flight’s baggage onto our carousel which caused chaos due to the flight coming from Mexico and the baggage didn’t go through customs. We never heard from a representative from Frontier and all of our updates were from TSA and Customs. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage. Channel 10 News was notified and will be airing this problem on the 11 o’o’clock news.

### "Plane was 35 minutes late in taking off"
Plane was 35 minutes late in taking off. Not that big of a deal but when your flight is supposed to leave at 10.15pm and it’s 10.47pm every minute counts. Then they screw up the luggage and we have been waiting 49 minutes already and it’s still not here!

### "They don't care"
Miami to Detroit. 50/50 chance you might get kicked out of the plane even though you bought your ticket and have a seat assigned to you. There’s still a chance they will kick you out and missed your destination. They don't care even you have plans already. They will just call you by your name and tell you that, you need to be out of the plane and say lame excuses.

### "worst experiences"
Not Verified | Denver to Salt Lake City. This is the second time I have had a flight with Frontier Airlines and I have to say that it's one of the worst experiences I have had. This is not due to anything flight related or comfort but rather their people skills and manners, when I say this I speak about their flight attendants. I was boarding the fly the attendant stopped me for no reason other than to tell me "There is a metal in the mask, I think you should pinch it. If you want to get on board". This made me really annoyed because I had my mask on and covering both my mouth and nose according to the CDC guidelines and she really took the time to stop me in particular. I really wanted to give her a piece of my mind, because never, and I mean never in the Frontier guidelines it says that we have to fold the metal with it the mask. I understand that it's for the "Safety" of those around me but I been vaccinated and tested, and they still want to make the experience even worse.

### "no skills to help with problems"
Not Verified |  Hopefully you don't need to speak to someone in customer service. The people on the other end of the phone can only cite policy and have no skills to help with problems related to their company. They refused to transfer me, then hung up on me when I challenged the "resolution" given. For such a large corp you would think they would prioritize customers and costumer service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
On Feb 20, after our return flight from Miami to Dallas was canceled, we arrived at the Frontier ticket counter to rebook a flight to get home. A couple we traveled with were rebooked at the counter for the next nonstop flight. Me and my wife were next in line and the ticket agent waved his hands in the air yelling "no more rebooking! He said the people behind us in line were trying to get on their flight and we would have to wait. I pleaded with him and tried to explain that the line was full of people on the same canceled flight and if he delayed our rebook the flight would sell out. He and the other agents actively refused to help us in any way at all. They wouldn't even check their system. After he assisted the next dozen people asking to rebook from the same canceled flight, he then abandoned his station, stopped booking anyone, and just helped another agent by putting checked bags on the conveyor. So we called customer service and tried to rebook with them. After thirty minutes of receiving no help on the phone, a ticket agent supervisor arrives. The agent supervisor and phone agent were commenting on completely different flight schedules as if they couldn't see what the other was seeing! The supervisor says the non-stop flight our friends got on was already sold out. The only option left was a 6:00am flight with a 7 hour layover in Atlanta, or a flight o the 23rd two days later! They refused to investigate flights from other carriers. The next day we take our first flight to Atlanta, wait for 7 hours, and board our second flight. The flight attendant on the second flight got on the intercom after boarding to welcome everyone on board, then threatened "no-fly lists" for anyone that had a facemask on the "tip" of the nose, and required masks over the "bridge" of the nose. The flight attendant walked down the aisle and threatened three passengers with the same "no-fly list" threat. I get it, people can be difficult regarding masks, but the first contact with the passengers laden with "no-fly list" threats was unprofessional and placed undue stress on all passengers for no reason. During the safety presentation, the same flight attendant got on the intercom, stopped the presentation, and threatened to remove passengers from the plane for talking during the presentation. This attendant was on a power trip and was itching to engage in and promote conflict. . I will never use them again.

### "Worst flight of my life!"
Worst flight of my life! We had to stop in Florida to fuel, 4 hour flight ended up being over 6. The seats were super uncomfortable. Unless you are very broke don’t use Frontier.

### "if you are reading this stay away from frontier"
Not Verified |  Their customer service needs over hauling and they need better flight operations. We were delayed 2hrs for plane issues and when we get to the terminal we have to wait another 30mins because there is no terminal to pull into. It seems like it’s not a big deal but airlines like this nickel and dime you but offer no compensation for their poor service. I recommend spending extra money to fly American or Southwest. Please by all means if you are reading this stay away from frontier!

### "curious on what a few minutes means to the Pilot"
Boarded at 10:09 P.M., take off was scheduled for 10:54. First the Pilot says we are just waiting a few minutes for the flight attendants to show up. Once the flight attendants arrive, he announces there is some maintenance problems which will only take a few minutes. At 11:30 he says we are good to go. 11:40 he announces more maintenance problems. 12:15 he announces only a few more minutes. 12:42 flight attendant says we are good to go. We shall see. I’m just curious on what a few minutes means to the Pilot.

### "Avoid them like the plague"
My wife, Sister and Brother in law and I had a flight back to Syracuse NY from Orlando on a Frontier Airlines direct flight. We left and got to airport 2 hours before the flight. When we walked in the line to handover your checked in luggage was so long at 5:45 AM (This is Just for the Frontier Airlines checked baggage line) - When we got to the counter 6:10 am (we already had printed the tags and put them on the bags) the lady at the counter laughed, rolled her eyes and in a sarcastic voice and said you'll never make it. We moved onto Security and waited in one of the longest lines I have ever seen (took 30 minutes) and they were rushing folks through. Here is where it got ugly - we ran to the Gate and got there at 6:48 am - Door closed at 6:45 but they had just closed it as they had let 3 other people on including my sister and Brother in law we show up 120 seconds later (they saw us coming) we asked and pleaded explaining our situation (we were there due to our fathers death in FL). The rep then said. We can't open the door, its too late - you missed the flight we can't help you - you should have gotten here sooner. Meanwhile my sister is talking to one of the flight attendants to see if they will let us on board and I am listening to the whole thing - the attendant told her she would go check with the head lady who checked folks onto the plane - she came back and said we can get them on and just re-run the final report. The door from the walkway on the plane was still open. My sister calls back and says the flight attendant came back and said that the head lady went up to the counter and we were not there and had already booked to another flight. No one came out my wife was standing there. Now my sister is upset the folks around her have overheard the whole thing too. So we asked 1 more time- the guy at the counter says sorry your problem not mine. Offered us a flight to Syracuse the next morning? So we stand at the window and waited the plane was supposed to leave at 7 - at 7:10 it finally left. We were 3 minutes late to the Gate - not 10, 13 or 30 -3. Seriously and to be spoken to and treated they way we were was totally unacceptable and disgusting. After the plane left we went back to a different Frontier counter and that attendant was able to get us on a flight to Buffalo NY that was to leave at noon. Now the bags that were not going to make onto the plane 1 of them did and my sister grabbed it when they got there 3 days later our 2nd bag is still in Orlando we were told each day it would be on a flight and delivered to us. That's unacceptable. The Buffalo flight left 1 Hour late, we rented a car to get home and they lost 1 of our bags. Only reason I have given them any stars at all is the staff on the Buffalo Flight. Ironically they asked everyone on the plane to show kindness due to the delay and to keep our masks on. Question: where was the kindness to us in the first place. Avoid them like the plague. They are awful.

### "the date was changed after the confirmation email"
I tried to book a flight through cheap flights.com for Frontier Airlines. The dates I put in were for 2/21/22 to 2/24/22. The website compiled a list of flights and prices but they changed the dates without me noticing. I clicked on the lowest price available thinking it was for the same dates but instead it was for 2/23/22 to 2/23/22. I called within the minute of making the mistake to get a refund because I saw the date was changed after the confirmation email was sent to me. They all told me the ticket was not refundable even though it was a clear mistake and a accident. I know its only 107 dollars and I know they have a policy like but a policy like that with no flexibility or sympathy for a mistake just seems to me like a way to steal money from people who are not paying close enough attention like some kind of con artist. I seek the refund of my money no more no less. It is not a lot to them but it is a lot to me.

### "disorganized and staff were not very helpful"
Arrived to airport 2.5 hours early to have the airline take our checked bags and have us miss our flight. Next flight out wasn't for another 4 days, so we were refunded our money and stranded at the airport with no means of transportation, a place to stay, or even our clothes/chargers/etc.We were extremely disappointed in this experience and ended up spending over 7 hours at the airport from waiting in Frontier lines. Just to have to come back 24 hours hours later for a new flight that we had to pay for out of pocket that cost a lot more than our Frontier flight refund. We were not offered any sort of compensation for our new flight, traveling, hotel, food, and we had to purchase many personal items due to our bags already being in Pittsburgh. We were extremely inconvenienced at the airport and had to miss work for a few more days without any source of income. The wait to check a bag for the flight was over any hour and the TSA line was even longer. The airline was extremely disorganized and the staff were not very helpful. We recommend that you do not fly through Frontier. We will not be using this airline ever again.

### "Does this airline fly without delay"
Not Verified |  The flight from Miami to Cancun was 1 hour delayed. The flight from Cancun to Miami 2 hours delayed. Does this airline fly without delay? Never. In the airplane was freezing cold.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Not Verified | Houston to Las Vegas. Frontier Airlines is the absolute worst airline company! Their customer service department is horrible. I was escalated three times and the lady I spoke with last was by far the worst agent. She was robotic and lacked any ability to connect with people. I have no idea how she got to where she is, except to say that Frontier probably promoted her because they also do not care about their customers either. They rope you in with a "cheap" flight, but then charge you extreme amounts for luggage and seats. The ticket ends up costing the same as a reputable airline like Southwest! Southwest is the best! If something happens and you cannot make your flight, like COVID, they charge you more than your ticket even costed to change or cancel. What's the point in that? Money hungry, selfish company that has no desire to retain customers. I will never fly frontier again! #NEVERAGAIN

### "Worst flight ever"
Worst flight ever. 10 mins prior to flight they delayed it for 14 hours to next day at 1 pm. No compensation nothing. No meal voucher. Total waste of time. All the staff not at all professional.

### "never book another flight through them"
Frontier had the best rates so i booked our family's flights through them. They last minute canceled our flight resulting in a $300 loss as we had to rebook under Sun Country. They left me with no choice as the cost of lost reservations totaled over $700. They offered me a $100 voucher to compensate for the $700 they would cost me. I'll never book another flight through them.

### "the worst company I've ever made the mistake of doing business with"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline. Their customer service doesn't exist, literally no customer service options besides sending a letter to their corporate office. I paid for a flight, 2 passengers from Cancun to Boston. In order to check in for the flight they force you to pay a very aggressive fee for each seat, not sure how you can fly without a seat? To be clear, it was not an upgraded seat, just to have a seat on the plane. Those fee's were almost as much as we paid for the flight itself. Then they want to charge outrageous prices for a personal item (bag that fits under seat) and any other carry on bags. Those fees were not disclosed when we purchased the flight. Then the flight got canceled due to unknown circumstances, forcing us to stay in a foreign country overnight or pay a very high last minute price for a flight on another airline. Considering there were no overnight stay options we ended up flying home on another airline. Frontier sent us an email saying the flight fee is non-refundable. What we paid for our seats and carry on bags would be applied to an airline credit that can be used within 90 days. I would tell anyone considering using Frontier or any company associated with them to stay far away. This is the worst company I've ever made the mistake of doing business with. Shame on Expedia for being associated with them!

### "delayed 6 hrs and counting"
Flight delayed both ways and not due to weather. Sitting in orlando writing this. The flight is delayed 6 hrs and counting. The plane has been there, pilot showed up 4 hrs later and still waiting on crew.

### "We are all questioning why we fly Frontier"
My first and foremost complaint is, we fly back from my son's wedding in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic on your airline (Frontier) on Feb 5, 2022, we get to Chicago O'Hare at approx 8.20 pm. We paid to have a Charter Bus pick 25 of us up upon our return (which we paid good money for), when we first got through to go and get our luggage (on Carousel 3) we were the only ones there. We waited and waited and waited with my 3 and 4 year old grandchildren. Other family had children too. We waited so long. Kids were starving. I got to bed at 2.00 am. I have been flying with Frontier a few times, I am told it's cheaper. But, by the time I buy my seat, pay for my luggage, pay for snacks and drinks, no movie and not the most comfortable seats (no recline) I am think it's not really a bargain. We are all questioning why we fly Frontier. Will probably be switching airlines.

### "First time flying with Frontier and very disappointed"
Not Verified |  First time flying with Frontier and very disappointed. Seats are very uncomfortable. Some aircraft personnel were very rude. Had to wait for luggage for almost 2 hrs after arrival, no information on what was going on until after an hour or longer. Had to call hotel because shuttle had already shut down. Then had a 3 hr drive home afterwards. Will not use this airline again for future trips.

### "Total fraud of an airline!"
Not Verified |  Frontier changed the times of our flights several weeks after we booked them. One flight was 10 hours later than originally planned. This no longer worked for our schedule so we had to cancel. The cancellation process was not straight forward. Total fraud of an airline!

### "The customer service was sub par"
The customer service was sub par and we were delayed and given bizarre excuses right before takeoff that we had to go back to the gate to pick up more employees, that sounded reasonable, but then they added another issue that there was "too much air traffic" going into Miami so we had to go back. They were inconsistent in their excuses then all of a sudden both cleared up at the same time and we should be on track to leave at 11.15pm. This was the most bizarre flight I’ve been on and will not be using Frontier again. I do feel bad for the flight attendants because some of the people on the flight were not very nice and I know that it likely was not their fault. Either way, they all need customer service training on how to be more transparent with the customers and not give false excuses for our delay.

### "Did not offer any type of refund"
I haven't actually been able to fly yet. The airline cancelled my flight. Did not offer any type of refund or change flight to a different airline. Apparently I'm just stranded and they get to keep my money. I have to call my credit card company to report a fraudulent transaction just to get my money back. Whatever happened to good customer service?

### "not be getting a credit or refund"
Not Verified | When we arrived at the airport, my husband was having respiratory symptoms. He decided to take a Rapid COVID test at the airport before we checked in. He tested positive for COVID. We informed the check-in staff we would not be boarding the flight for that reason. They said to call customer service for a credit or refund. Well we did just that and was informed that our flight status was “no show” so we will not be getting a credit or refund. We lost $240 on this flight. I guess we were expected to board the flight and expose everyone to COVID. No problem with Marriott or Hertz to cancel reservations - only Frontier. If you think you could be COVID positive someday, find a more reasonable airline to deal with.

### "Frontier Airlines is a joke"
Frontier Airlines is a joke. I was stuck away from home for 2 days past my return date. That being said, COVID has made traveling harder with fewer options. I booked a trip to Vegas in March. The flight was through Frontier and I had reasonable flight times for my departure and return. My return flight was for around 10 am. I received a notification about two weeks ago stating significant changes were made to my flight. When I reviewed the changes, they changed my return flight to midnight. 10 hours sooner than my original flight. I made multiple attempts to change my flight home without success. Fast forward. I arranged for other travel plans to accommodate my trip. When I went to cancel my flight, I received  16.96 in credit when the cost was 160.96 to book the flight. I wouldn't have canceled my booking if they hadn't made such an absurd change to my flight. Now I eat the cost for what? As a consumer, they just confirmed I will never fly with them again.

### "they pack everyone together on a 1/2 empty plane"
COVID is a thing, yet they pack everyone together on a 1/2 empty plane. Literally walked passed 1/3 of empty seats to a cluster of maybe 10 rows with people packed in three to a row. I spied the last 10 rows were empty (I was the last person to board) and slid into the first empty row after the pack. I had a window seat originally and would have had to climb over two people to get to the seat. Much easier to just take an empty row. One question, why?

### "I have never been treated so badly when flying"
Not Verified |  The savings is not worth the inconvenience you receive from booking a flight with this airline. They switched my flight within notice. The new flight was delayed 4 times and the check in clerks targeted me when I was boarding the plane because I asked them for a refund. I have never been treated so badly when flying.

### "very displeased with this airline"
When we first got to the airport, there were lines that were so crazy long. We waited in line for 45 minutes and then they opened up another portion and people who had just got there were getting in before us, who had waited a total of over an hour just to get our bags dropped. The staff was very unfriendly about the whole thing. We got to the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed out flight because of how long we waited to drop our bags. Then when we got on the plane the staff wasn't friendly and acted like they didn't want to be there. You couldn't hear or understand anything the cabin people were saying. When we got off the plane to pick up our baggage, it took them forever to get our baggage out and then my friend's suitcases were broken and my husband's bag was torn. We are very displeased with this airline and will not be flying with them again.

### "the frustration simply outweighs the savings"
Not Verified | Friendly staff however this airline needs to catch up with the times. The online booking process is a complete joke if you're not living in USA. You simply cannot pay for your ticket online because you will receive "Error: Please Review the Billing Zip Code" and there is no place to enter a postal code for Canada. Same thing with the App. When calling in the phone attendant was nice and didn't charge the $35 call-in fee because he was aware of the problem. This should be an easy fix. Baggage fees were $37, $45 and $47 depending on the time of day and whether you are on the app or your PC. Frustrating - get your stuff together Frontier. Baggage in Orlando took 2 hours to receive. It may not be Frontier's fault but this has to be corrected. What a shame. The flight itself was fine and the staff are great people. With a couple of fixes from Frontier this carrier could be a great budget airlines but for now the frustration simply outweighs the savings.

### "These guys are the worst"
These guys are the worst. There was a 3 hour delay on the tarmac because of paperwork not being filled in correctly somehow. There was a severe snowstorm coming in so by the time we left it wasn't super safe. No water or snacks were offered in the 3 hours. When I called afterwards with feedback, the supervisor tried to blame it on weather. It's possible the pilot should have lied to us, but he literally said it's Not the weather, so right.

### "crew would not let anyone move"
There were dozens of open seats, to include all the emergency exit rows. The crew would not let anyone move to the emergency exit rows. This airline cares more about what you pay.

### "the whole flight quality was so poor"
Not Verified |  Very unprofessional checking at the airport, the representative was so rude, unreasonable and unprofessional. I never saw this kind of disrespectful behavior from airline employees. Also last time the food quality and the whole flight quality was so poor. I prefer to pay a couple of hundred dollars for and get better service, this airline charges you for your seat, bag and food so you have to pay even more than a good airline like Delta.

### "This experience was horrible"
This experience was horrible. The young lady doing the boarding was very rude, ignorant and disrespectful. Talking to the occupants in a nasty and unfriendly manner, even threatened a passenger when she was asked her name. The attending supervisor stood there watching. I was in disbelief. Something really needs to be done about this airline. This is not my first unpleasant encounter with Frontier. Flight 2289 Philly- Miami, 1/28/20022, 9.15pm flight was horrible due to the staff. Please get your employees some type of customer service classes/training.

### "it turned into almost 8 hours of traveling"
Not Verified |  What airline makes me cry? Frontier Airlines did it. Not tears of joy but tears from being livid and enraged. In October of 2021 I booked a straight flight from Sacramento to Ontario California. The flight left Sacramento at 8 in the morning and it arrived in Ontario at 9.40 in the morning. I booked a flight because my family is in California and I wanted to get back to them as quickly as I could. The day I arrived in Sacramento I saw an email saying that my flight to Ontario had been modified. Instead, of a non-stop flight to Ontario they really screwed me over badly! My new flight left Sacramento later in the day now included a 5 hour layover in Las Vegas and I would land at 9 that night. Frontier Airlines you are horrible, awful, and the worst of the worst airline! So, instead of keeping my flight an hour and 40 minutes it turned into almost 8 hours of traveling. In this day and age when companies are trying to keep customers you lost one.

### "Horrible service and a dishonest company"
Had to cancel flight for personal emergency that was not covered by flight insurance. When I went to cancel on website, said the charge to cancel would only be part of my fare and I expected a partial refund. Now they are keeping the entire fare and can not even get a straight answer from the completely unhelpful customer service agents as to why there is a discrepancy and complete lack of transparency on the website for charges to cancel flight. Horrible service and a dishonest company. Never again.

### "Sardine seating was the very worst experience"
Not Verified | Sardine seating was the very worst experience. Pay for carry-on, pay for each unit of baggage, pay for food and non-alcoholic beverages. We thought we'd try flying Frontier because of their advertised "special" deal. However, I don't think we will be flying Frontier ever again. Pilots and entire crew were very professional, delivering sympathy and very smooth flights. It's bad enough when you're sitting lock to lock sideways with three people in a very tight seating arrangement. Then to be squashed like sardines next to the fore and aft seating is unnecessarily painful. Recomended solution : Pull out about 4 rows of seats (12) on each side therefore expanding the leg room on each side. Replace the terribly uncomfortable rock hard non reclining seats with cushier, recliners. Include the coffee, water, juice, and soft drinks into the ticket pricing. Having to dig your wallet out of your back pants pocket whilst sardine seated only adds insult to injury. People will pay for personal comforts. You force your employees to have to deal with rightfully unsatisfied customers.

### "Our flight didn't even take off"
Not Verified |  Disgusting. Paid $300 and got a $100 voucher to use for flights. Our flight didn't even take off. Worst airline ever, never use this. It is a disgrace from customer service to everything. Absolutely disgusting and I want my money back, not a voucher to fly on your garbage airline.

### "beyond poor customer service"
Not Verified | This is the worst airline ever. My husband and I flew from Cancun to Denver. It was a four hour flight with no entertainment, no internet, no water (unless you want to pay extra). On top of that, I paid an extra $200 for our baggage and seats so we could sit next to each other. I have a frequent flyer account, and they didn't give us credit for the miles. When I spoke to customer service rep and then supervisor, Joanne, they said that we wouldn't receive credit as we were a "No show"! How did we get home from Mexico then? And I sat on an uncomfortable, 4 hour flight, and won't receive credit. They want us to show copies of our boarding passes which I no longer have. They were paper passes printed at the airport as you can't preprint boarding passes for international flights. This is beyond poor customer service.

### "no attendant at counter"
Checking gate D. Arrived to airport spend some time in cafe. Change a gate to E (far away). Broken train. arrived to gate 3 minutes before closed gate - nobody at desk and lot people around yelling to door (no attendant at counter). Plane still here. Plane still connected to gate. Zero effort to resolve it.

### "never recommend it to anyone"
Not Verified | Arrived at the airport and waited at the gate 3 hours prior to boarding. 10 minutes before boarding the flight was “oversold” and required three “volunteers” with flexible flight schedules to fly later. They promised a flight voucher of $1,000. My fiancé and I were asked and agreed to change our flight schedule which they first assured was only 3-4 hour delay, and the rebooking for the flight later that evening would be free of charge. After the plane took off we made our way to customer service and we’re denied the voucher promised and we’re forced to pay an additional $150+ for the reschedule of the flight which we were then told wouldn’t be for another 12 hours. We were not offered refund for the flight or given any other options. The incompetent active manager for frontier customer service gave us absolutely no help, and neither did any of the other employees which also gave us the run around for a few hours. Definitely the last time we will be flying frontier. And would never recommend it to anyone in their right state of mind.

### "What a joke of a company"
Not Verified |  They rescheduled my flights with very little notice and added a huge layover in another state. Their rates that they advertise are for their Discount Den members, which costs $60/year. When I called to cancel the membership, they refused. What a joke of a company.

### "asked us to pay $79 for a little carry on"
Not Verified | Terrible experience at the gate. I got a ticket for my wife and I. We wanted to pay for the luggage online only for 1 of us. The website did not allow us for one, but only for 1 of us. We did not need that and decided to do that at the airport in SF. We checked in one baggage and had one carry on. Everything was fine up till our connecting flight in Phoenix. When boarding, they asked us to pay $79 for a little carry on or would not let us on. She was even willing to refund our tickets to Chicago. She was rude and very unprofessional and did not really care. The main problem is, they tell you one thing when you get the ticket, another thing when checking on online and totally different reality at the airport or at the gate. There is no consistency and they are ripping off people.

### "The airline always gets delayed"
The airline always gets delayed. I have flown with the airlines within 5-6 times and 3 out of them got delayed. And 2 out of 3 delays were due to mismanagement of staff. And actually Frontier Airlines tickets are not cheap if you consider adding your bags. The ticket price only is cheap compared to other airlines when you book flight so closed to your departure date. My schedule wasn’t flexible. If it was, I rather booked American Airlines or Allegiant.

### "lack of communication is horrendous"
The pure lack of communication on the Frontier airlines is horrendous. On the day the flight was to be departed there was no communication on the frontier app, website, and Dallas fort worth airport of the so-called cancellation. My group and 100 other passengers were left at the gate waiting for a plane that never arrived. Every up-to-date departure screen marked the airplane to be on schedule. There were some guests that had purchased a ticket that day for a flight frontier later claimed was canceled the day prior. I spoke with multiple guests that urgently had to get to Denver one, in particular, that would be missing her cancer treatments the following day. There was no frontier associate available for hours to help with the ordeal. Frontier kept everyone on hold for upwards of an hour with no immediate solution to its guests left now stranded at the airport at 10:30 at night. I will never be flying this airline again, the lack of taking responsibility for their mistake and out rightly blaming the 100 plus passengers for lying that they had informed us of this cancellation and gave us a $50 voucher for the inconvenience.

### "unprofessional service and horrible experience"
Not Verified | On 1/6/2022 flight # 1427 while on-board captain announced a delay due to water fill up for lavatory .. later sorry its frozen water line & taking time.. later need to thaw the frozen water in line.. need to heat the airplane so plz deplane .. then 45 min later back on-board... later sorry due to the delay we have a part expired & needs be replaced but this part cannot be replaced now so the airplane is grounded. Please deplane and go to ticketing counter for a refund or to book on a next flight which is very limited to no choice. I was seated in 1F so, I was the 1st person out of the plane and was lucky to get booked on the next day flight, but had to wait for 1 hour for the luggage to appear on carousel # 10. I was talking to other passenger that did not rebook so had no choice but a refund. Ticking agent was trained to be straight to the Pont and pushing a refund or not too many choices on rebooking. Today is 1/7/2022 and I'm seated in 1D flight 1427 ORD to PHX and flight was taking off at 8:53 PM .. after push back from gate engine 2 was not getting started, had to get mechanics to come onboard trying to figure out the issue. Then they attempted to start the engine manually 1st time but failed then 2nd time was a success. Now a passenger wants out of the plane its 10:25,PM. I won't fly Frontier again nor will I recommend this to anyone. Yes fares maybe cheap but not worth this unprofessional service and horrible experience. Time is money, comfort is important.

### "they did not honor the fine print on their ticket/website"
Not Verified |  My family flew Frontier from Chicago to Las Vegas during the holidays. Then the wave of Omicron swept the nation and while that is totally acceptable to cancel a flight for that reason, what the airline did next was not acceptable. After notifying us of the cancelation they did not honor the fine print on their ticket/website. They did not help us to find another flight, they did not help us with refunds either. We were stranded and forced to find flights on other airlines, lodging, food and lost 2 days wages. It has been a week since and no refunds! Frontier is a billion dollar company and a few hundred dollars in a refund should not be taking this long. Please select another airline in your future - American is an excellent choice with an app that has free movies to watch during your flight plus free drinks, nuts and cookies.

### "Last time I’ll fly Frontier"
Not Verified | First time flying Frontier and it was The worst flight experience I’ve had. We were delayed 45+ minutes without any information (even the flight attendants didn’t have any information on why it was delayed). Once we boarded, I received a text that the flight was late and informed us incorrectly about how long the delay was. The staff was rude during the flight. Once we landed, we sat on the tarmac for 5 minutes. They informed us that it would be another 5 minutes until we could exit. After 10 minutes, we were told that it would only be 3 more minutes. After 15 minutes, they said nobody was available and that we would have to taxi around on the tarmac until they could find someone to help. Poor communication, poor service. Last time I’ll fly Frontier.

### "Terrible service - Late, Cancelled"
Terrible service - Late, Cancelled. Both flights were late or cancelled, they offered no compensation for either. It was a roundtrip from IAD to MCO. Customer service took 45 minutes to rebook my son and I had to look up and find the flight to put him on.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is horrible. I would never, ever encourage anyone to use Frontier Airlines. Cancelled two flights on the return trip. Finally just cancelled tickets and drove to Florida to pick up my family. Absolutely horrible.

### "do not care about their incompetence"
Orlando to New York Islip. Never fly this airline. They simply are incompetent and what’s worse, they lack empathy and do not care about their incompetence.

### "Never fly Frontier ever again"
It was horrible flight ever. The flight was delayed for more than 4 hours and they didn’t care to update us. Crew was careless. Never fly Frontier ever again.

### "went this above and beyond to treat its customers well"
My flight was delayed a few hours because of issues outside of the airlines control. The flight arrived late at night, but as soon as I arrived, they apologized and provided a small travel voucher for the inconvenience in an email, unprompted and without me submitting a complaint. One of my few experiences with a budget airline that went this above and beyond to treat its customers well. Staff were also pleasant and professional.

### "connecting flights that I will have to miss"
Frontier is a cheap airline coming that actually will turn out to be very expensive for you. I have attached my boarding pass and their delay notice for proof. Their check-in process is horrible at EWR and their staff do not show any sympathy for their over 4 hours delay. I have connecting flights that I will have to miss, they have no will or way to help me at all. in short, if you try to fly Frontier, be ready to arrive at the airport earlier than otherwise, be ready to be late for over 4 hours, be ready to miss your connecting flight and lose money from your hotel reservations and other itineraries.

### "it was an amazing experience"
I loved this airline, from start to finish it was an amazing experience. The price was unbeatable, the customer service from beginning to end was amazing. i am so very pleased and truly don’t understand the bad reviews.

### "Worst experience flying"
Worst experience flying. In a short, direct flight from Philadelphia to Atlanta, Frontier Airlines managed to misplace the entire flight's baggage. We arrived at 10:30pm, and no one from Frontier was available to answer questions. We waited as passengers from other flights came and went with their luggage and after 3 hours of waiting and with absolutely no customer service on-site, I had to leave because my ride could not wait any longer. The next day I called Frontier customer service a total of 5 times, (all customer service is overseas btw), and still no one has given me any meaningful thoughts on what could have happened or where my bag could possibly be. All they keep telling me is that they have contacted the Atlanta airport and will inform me when they hear something back. I am approaching 24hrs since landing and still I have not been contacted at all by anyone from Frontier. I have even tried calling the Frontier office at the actual airport, but no one answers and no one has responded to my messages. Customer service is nearly nonexistent with this company. The low prices are not worth the hassle of flying with this company. Please learn from my mistake. Tell family and friends to avoid this company at all costs. I flew home to spend Christmas with my loved ones, after 6 months of intense medical residency training, and now I having to deal with this frustrating situation. For perspective, this is the first time that I have ever written a review for anything and I feel a duty to warn people of the incompetence of this airline.

### "They have messed up my plans too many times"
3 hours before the fight was supposed to take off I received an email that the flight would be delayed. This meant that I would be missing my connecting flight which I booked as a single booking through their website. After much effort to figure out how to speak to a real person and being on hold for 20 minutes, they told me that they could book me on a flight two days later or offer a refund. Every other airline would recognize they were to blame and book you on another airline. This flight was to spend time with my family for Christmas and taking two days out of the week I was supposed to be there seemed ridiculous. They were unwilling to offer any compensation outside of a "voucher" which I could only get if I went to the airport and was told that it could be used to "cover meals or other things". No discount, no booking you on another airline. Something similar to this has happened to me every single time I've flown with them. On one airline they told us to use the restroom in the airport before boarding because the lavatories on the plane weren't working on a 5hr flight. Spend the extra few hundred dollars! They have messed up my plans too many times and don't take any accountability.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. My flight was suppose to leave @ 5:20pm. Every hour or so they kept delaying it later and later. At first they were saying the aircraft had to be cleaned then that excuse lead to another. Around 11pm they finally said flight is delayed until 10am the next morning. I'm currently sitting on the plane and the time now is 10:10am. Now they say we are fueling the airplane. Hopefully we leave sometime soon. The flight isn't halfway full and I asked could I move up and they said it would be a upgrade fee. Book Frontier at your on risk.

### "pay more money to fly with anyone else"
Not Verified |  Trust me it's well worth it to pay more money to fly with anyone else other than Frontier. They have screwed me over multiple times and let me pay change fees to change to a different flight that doesn't even exist and won't even refund you when it's an error on their side. They also don't update their apps on departures and any delays, so if you're at the airport and you're waiting for your flight to leave, it's actually leaving from a different gate and you get stuck and they don't do anything to accommodate you or resolve the issue. They just take your money for something you didn't even get

### "What a complete joke!"
Not Verified |  We arrived for our flight two hours early at Las Vegas airport on Dec 13th only to find out there were also 16 other flights from Frontier all leaving at 6am. The line was huge and people were very angry. There were only 4 people working to check bags but hundreds of people trying to get checked in to leave on time. By the time we got to the desk to check our baggage our flight had already boarded and we were told we had to go to "ticket sales" (which by the way had an even longer line). This not only happened to us but to several other people. The next flight available wasn't until Dec 15th so we had no choice but to book with another airline and spend even more money. When I called customer service I was told that all they could offer was credit with the airline. Are you kidding me? No refund? For poor service and overbooked flights? It gets worse...they offered credit but it can only be used within 3 months! What? I asked if they could at least do 6 months but was told 90 days is the "best they could offer". What a complete joke! That day there were probably at least 100 people who didn't make their flights and had to rebook. How could they leave all those people behind? Oh and another thing - the TSA didn't even open until 4.30am. It truly wasn't possible for people to get through those lines in a timey manner. I will never recommend this airline to anyone. In fact, I will convince everyone I know to steer clear of booking any flights through Frontier.

### "Customer service is the absolute worst"
Customer service is the absolute worst of any airline I’ve used! You will not be getting a deal once you pay for carry on luggage and check in luggage - pay the extra up front and use a standard airline - my family will never ever use again!

### "Customer service is becoming last on their list"
The morning flight was overbooked with the next available flight not leaving until 16 hours later, with an arrival a full day later. Gate staff decided TSA/security wasn’t enough, and re-searched my shoulder/computer bag at the gate (no electronics, just clothing/hygiene). Before boarding, they required an ID be shown again. All things never encountered before in 15+ years of flying. This airline used to be friendly and reasonable for a low cost flight. Customer service is becoming last on their list.

### "At all costs avoid this airline if possible"
Do not fly this airline. At all costs avoid this airline if possible. I did not think an airline could sink lower than Spirit but this one has on two separate occasions failed to meet even basic customer support. If you fly be prepared for one of the worst customer experiences of all airlines.

### "they are cheap but at a cost"
Not Verified |  The flight to San Francisco was ok but with less than half full, but the flight back to Phoenix was scheduled to take off at 4 pm Monday the 6th, the flight was first delayed to 8 pm from 4pm , then 10pm. The problem is that the airline doesn't have enough workers and passengers, they are cheap but at a cost.

### "close check in 45 minutes before departure"
Not Verified |  I will never again purchase a flight with Frontier. They close their check in desk and app 45 minutes before departure which is enough time to check in and make your flight. They are nowhere to be found and with no away to get assistance. I missed my flight and am extremely disappointed. The app doesn’t even allow you to get a boarding pass to go through security.

### "be taking my business elsewhere"
Charged almost as much as my flight to bring aboard my carry on bag! I will never fly Frontier again, I don't recommend you do either. Customer service very rude when I called to see about reimbursement for the baggage fee. Electric went out on the plane waiting for take off along with a funky stench that lingered in the air for the duration of my flight. I will forever be taking my business elsewhere. Thanks for your help Frontier!

### "one delay after another"
Not Verified |  Frontier, shame on you. Sat in the boarding area for one delay after another. Different excuses for the delay from different Frontier reps. Then the flight was cancelled. All Frontier reps made no effort to help. Totally disappointed, will never book again.

### "worse than Spirit Airlines"
Waited 45 mins to get off the plane then waited another hour to board the next one because of short staffing. This is worse than Spirit Airlines which is definitely an insult

### "forced me to pay for 1 bookbag"
The guy at the check in was extremely rude. Also, forced me to pay for 1 bookbag. The guy at the gate was arguing with several customers. All of the flights were delayed over 1 hour and a half.

### "they literally have no desire to help"
The absolute worst experience I have ever had with an airline. My name was spelled wrong on my boarding pass and TSA decided to degrade me for not knowing how to spell my name as it was off by two letters. When I reached out to Frontier to help so I could get on my flight they told me they could not help me with the name change. Which meant I had to fight with the TSA to prove I was who I obviously was by two letters. I made the gate as the flight attendant was just about the close the door and as I yelled, wait, she told me to stand back and slammed the door in mine and my husbands face. The next day, she made a rude comment to us about making it on time. There is an apparent power dynamic with Frontier and they literally have no desire to help. Every person I reached out to gave me an attitude and literally no solutions were offered. It was horrible. Will never ever fly with them again.

### "a long, cramped, uncomfortable trip"
A decade ago, Frontier Airlines was the best-kept secret in domestic travel, offering clean, roomy seats with friendly staff and service. Over the past few years, however, this company has sadly morphed into a weird clone of Spirit Air, cramming passengers into uncomfortable seats and nickel and diming for every possible option. None of the seats recline and there's no onboard WiFi or entertainment. After a long, cramped, uncomfortable trip from Dallas to Newark, I won't be flying this airline again unless I'm absolutely desperate.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. You will have to pay for every piece of luggage and gouged for it. The flight was canceled from Cancun to Dallas and the customer agents said there was never a flight. What the Heck? There were 45 confirmed passages that had to find another flight. There was no refund and the customer service line was horrible. They do not care about customers or their flights. Please do not fly this airline, you will regret it!

### "they said there was nothing they could do"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines draws you in with the illusion of cheap flights but beware if you have to make any changes or cancellations to you flight. After booking my thanksgiving flight, I found out I would get off earlier from work. The website would not allow me to change my flight, and when I called for help they charged an exorbitant fee to change it over the phone. When I went to cancel my flight they said it would be a 49$ cancelation fee, so I decided to take the loss and cancel. What they didn’t say was that it’s a $49 fee each way, so I had to pay $100 in cancelation fees for my 129$ flight. When I called to ask for help, they said there was nothing they could do and refused to help me get the flight back or refund me for the fee they didn’t tell me I would be charged, they said there was nothing they could do. Overall, this has been a terrible experience with a dishonest company and I will not use this company again and will make sure to tell everyone I know the same.

### "we are stranded at the airport searching for flights"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever used, will not use again. Plane had computer issues and couldn't be fixed, de boarded passengers told to go to ticket counter, of course very very crowded while standing in line for 2hours without any answers. A lady walks up and hands out a paper from the airline with options, not of refunding your $$ but offering you a voucher for future flights. Finally get up to counter, person says no flights to our destination until two days later so your option is to read paper and figure it out. So now we are stranded at the airport searching for flights, us and the rest of the hundreds of passengers stranded by Frontier. Hey Frontier way to treat your customers and than have the nerve to invite us back for more poor customer service shame on you.

### "Worst service I’ve ever received"
Not Verified |  My baby’s car seat was damaged by them and the customer service at the airport didn’t care. They did nothing. I wrote down my contact information for them to give to a manger and I never heard back. I contacted customer service online who has been less than helpful. They told me that they sent my in for to a manager and I’ve never heard back. This was months ago. I keep contacting and contacting and all I need is my car seat replaced!! Worst service I’ve ever received. I’m in shock and just so hurt.

### "absolutely no way I will fly Frontier again"
At this point I will never use Frontier again. My first time was absolutely horrible and their way of making it right was by sending us a $25 voucher that has to be used within 90 days. The attendants and check in staff were unprofessional in speaking with customers and on multiple occasions they rolled their eyes at the customers on both my departing and arriving flights. I let it go because I wasn’t going to make a big deal on our much awaited for trip. Well, on our flight back, there were at least 4 flights leaving to different cities that morning that so many people had to rebook because the check in and bag drop lines were taking for ever. Rebooking wasn’t possible for 2-3 days! Missed work/shorted paychecks, extended child care, additional hotel fees and so on that we had to deal with and take on. I was finally able after multiple attempts to check in on my phone while waiting in line but it didn’t matter because practically all lines were at a stand still. Those that made it through the line were stuck at TSA and still had to rebook due to missing their flight. I will be calling to dispute the $25 voucher as at this point there is absolutely no way I will fly Frontier again so the voucher does me no good.

### "Never again will I travel with Frontier"
Not Verified |  Lost flight. Never again will I travel with Frontier. Low staff. Super long wait at express bag. One employee only at the counter. Many passengers list their flights. We did everything right. We checked in day before, got our bag tag at the kiosk. Arrived at least 4 hours prior - my recommendation if you want to use frontier.

### "we lost our flight, car rental, and hotel"
I arrived at the airport at 4.50 am my flight was at 6.00am. After waiting in the main line for 10 minutes, one of the staff at check in says Miami, and makes a come this way hand gesture so my wife and I left the line we were at and went around to the line the staff that called for Miami was at. After getting to that line the staff called for the Orlando flight and took those passenger ahead, we waited in line. After finally getting to the staff, he told us the gate had closed, there was nothing he could do. Because of the misguidance, the lack of communication, and incompetence of the staff we lost our flight, car rental, and hotel. The manager we spoke to said that the staff called for Miami several times, we only heard them call for Miami only once.

### "Would never fly again"
Probably the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airplane. Flight did not leave on time, and then it took an hour and 20 mins to receive bags on an hour and 50 mins flight. Would never fly again.

### "Not helpful, not reliable, not customer centric"
Not Verified |  Flight has been delayed 5 hours. Called 800 number and lady was difficult to understand and not helpful. They gave our friends on the same flight two vouchers. We got nothing! Not helpful, not reliable, not customer centric! I will never fly this airline again. How are they still on business! ?

### "have the worst customer service"
They are thieves. I bought my ticket at 3:00 pm on 11/2/2021 and canceled the next morning at 8:00 am . When I bought my ticket it says that I have 24 hours to canceled without penalty. I canceled on their web page and they are not giving me credit or refund on my ticket. They do not say anything when you are canceling the ticket, they send an email afterward telling you that they are keeping the money. I called couple times and they refused to give me credit or refund the money. If you do not want to have a bad moment do not buy ticket with them. Also they charge too much for carry on and seat selection. They have the worst customer service.

### "staff keep talking so loud"
Our family took the night flight from DEN-TYS and its night flight we have long trip from LAS-DEN So we really need a good sleep. But 3 of the staff sitting behind us keep talking so loud. We ok if they keep their voice between them. But their voice was loud and we couldnt take a nap during flighting. This is the first time i had this bad experience. Frontier Airlines need to train their staff .

### "I have never had a company change gates so much"
Not Verified |  I took two round trip flights with them in the last two weeks. The first flight was delayed. Total delayed time of 7 hours and not because of bad weather or anything like that, we were not given an explanation and waited there until midnight for the connection flight to arrive at my final destination around 4am. It was horrible especially since my first departure flight was at 6am. As if that wasn’t already bad, during the 7 hours wait, they kept on changing our gate having us walk back and forth. I have never had a company change gates so much. Their gates are always changing, which shows a great lack of organization on their part. The following week, I took a flight with them again, they changed the gate for my connecting flight again, when I asked the lady she gives me the number of the new gate (which she made a mistake on). It was far on the opposite side. I ran to go there with my luggage for the lady at that gate to tell me that the other lady made a mistake and gave me the correct gate (which funnily enough was just 4 gates from where I initially was). There I go running again back to where I was on that opposite side. When I get there they tell me that they had already closed the door and I have to go to customer service for them to change my flight for the next one which is in the afternoon 6 hours away, making me miss my appointment that I had on my arrival at Washington DC. Now when I get to customer service, not only does the agent had a very bad attitude and were condescending, but he asked that I pay $80 for them to put me on that other flight. I called the main customer service line and they tell me that they should be able to waive the fees since it wasn’t my fault. I go back there and let them know about it but the person there insisted that I have to pay and even make it a point to let me know that it is the last spot left and instead of arguing I should make sure that I get it or I will be there in the airport until the next day. Because of the obligations that I had therefore couldn’t afford to get stuck there, I caved and paid. After giving them two chances of round trip flights, I can honestly say that I will never use this airline again.

### "low fare of flight is very misleading"
Not Verified |  The low fare of flight is very misleading at Frontier Airlines. If you choose a seat you will be charged, if you have a carry on bag you will be charged, you are shown more than once to buy insurance, forget about complimentary snacks or drink (no water) without a credit card charge. The unprofessional staff members are rude and work with bad attitudes. This is a budget airline but that doesn't mean they have the right to create a worse experience than it needs to be by not servicing a paying customer. Avoid this low class airline it is trash.

### "unfriendly, uncaring airline"
Visiting cousin in California, July 21,and taking along my new sector skateboard . Could not take on board, so paid the required 44.00 fee for sport baggage. When I arrived in LA, no skateboard, approached several Frontier employees, and they wouldn't: help me look for it or even suggest filing a claim. Exasperated 19 yr old-left airport, called airline missing baggage later- and, newbee took down info.Second call-found all info incorrect- ex. Address, Phone #. How did this happen? Went on line later to file pages of claim info. The hassle begins, 4 months of calling several times a week, emails back n forth. Pestering me on my vacation, 'ex,' we found it- will deliver to you- and it was a "surf board". Found, it shipped to your house; sorry mistake- not your skateboard'. Months of contacting them, and trying to end this nightmare of chaotic useless customer service. And, get my life back. Finally resolved, as of Mid October! Check mailed 6-8 weeks. Talk about customer inconvenience, dissatisfaction. Frontier is a no frills, unfriendly, uncaring airline. When baggage is lost- they hope you get lost in the paperwork, chaos and give up trying to find it or getting settlement (which by the way the loss has been depreciated) Not a win, win, but a lost, loss!

### "blown away worst customer service I have ever experienced"
We paid $60 to select a seat which was 3F. I showed up for my flight and with zero explanation I was moved to 21E. When I brought this to the attention of the female gate agent she was damn near hostile towards me. No refund, no apology and she recommended I fly another carrier next time. Straight up blown away worst customer service I have ever experienced. This airline shouldn’t be allowed to receive federal funds. My tax dollars subsidized this awful company. I asked if this is customer service and she said “this is service”. I will never fly this airline again.

### "eating and drinking with no mask"
They talked down to us in front of our children and stopped the plane and threatened to kick us out for eating and drinking with no mask? They stopped the plane for 15 minutes to make empty threats about masks and took off anyway.

### "never had a worse experience"
I have never had a worse experience, and I used to fly Spirit all the time so that’s saying something. I had to take this flight because it was the only one at that set time, the inflight flight attendant was very nice but when I tried to board I had paid the ridiculous carry on fee the lady at the gate would not let me board. Made me walk down the entire gate to “see the manager because she was not one” even though when I logged on you could clearly see that I had paid for carry on. She refused to help me and was so rude. Horrible way to end my vacation. My mood is awful because of it.

### "Worst airline ever"
Lost our checked bag and did not find it our entire trip. We had to buy new items for our trip and spent hours either on the phone with customer service or at the airport. No one knew what they were talking about and they refuse to refund us, even though we have told them over and over that they ruined our vacation. Worst airline ever, will never fly with them again. Would give a zero out of ten if I could.

### "I can't believe they kept that much money"
Not Verified |  My complaint is not about my flight but my booking today and having to change the return reservations. I paid $258 for a round trip from Las Vegas NV to Ontario CA, in less than 30 minutes I realized that the return date had to be changed. I had to cancel the complete trip and I was charged $150 leaving me with a flight credit and they do not refund your credit card. I'm a senior citizen and I just lost $150 and have to take the rest in a credit with the airlines. I can't believe they kept that much money, now I'm unable to take my trip to see my family because of that charge and nothing I could say or do to get a refund or total credit of my purchase. So senior citizens beware them taking $150, their cancellation fees are very high and this is a warning.

### "flight got delayed for 3 hours and the agents even didn’t tell me"
My flight from Seattle to Houston was supposed to be connected in Denver. The Seattle to Denver flight got delayed for 3 hours and the agents even didn’t tell me because all they wanted was for me to pass the gate and go to Denver and desperately look for a connecting flight! I insisted about the emails I was getting which was saying my flight has a 3 hours delay, finally they said yeah there’s a delay and we can do nothing because we have no contract with other airlines to transfer you. They charged me 470$ and only refunded me 256$ (almost half of what I paid). In result I wasn’t able to attend my job interview and I lost the job.

### "This airline is a joke"
Not Verified |  This is absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Ever, even for “Covid times.” They left me and my family stranded in Orlando 1 hr before flight was to take off by notifying me that my flight was canceled and offered zero options for 3 days for another flight home. Email days later offered $400 credit per passenger but strict stipulations on credit. This airline is a joke. Save yourself a lot of frustration and just book with Delta or United and actually get to your destination on time, or at all! You don’t realize how much going the cheap route will cost you until you’re stuck thousands of miles from home. They did not even honor the voucher. Unbelievable.

### "worst experience traveling"
Not Verified |  This is the worst experience traveling. Frontier shows you great deals; however, there isn’t a real deal. My flight was changed twice! Frontier is not a good airline at all. I traveled with my elder sister who needed a wheelchair which Never Arrived. Last time I will travel through Frontier Airlines. Very unprofessional!

### "They charge for everything"
Never pick this airline. No reclining seats. No free water to drink. Rude fight attendants. Pilot don't speak fluent English. Flight attendant don't speak fluent English. I have never seen flight attendants going to the restroom for 10 minutes each of them at least 4 times during the flight. Also the two pilots went to the restroom 3 times for 10 minutes. Very weird. They charge for everything. No leg room. Temperature was around 73 degrees. I swear everything was like i am saying. Flight was delayed and my suitcase is stained. No charger for electronic devices. No wifi. No movie. No music. Incredible.

### "I have never had such a horrible customer experience"
When you buy the ticket they ask you to arrive at least 2 hours prior to the flight. Today we arrived exactly two hours prior to our flight and we were in line for hour and a half just because they kept calling other flights. This is ridiculous I have never had such a horrible customer experience. They don’t respect the line, people who arrive at the very end have more priority than the people who have been waiting for hours. Be late and you will be more respected. Everyone in line was very upset. Definitely avoid Frontier. They have no idea about customer service.

### "don't lie to me about due to weather"
Flight was delayed This morning and and I was told due weather? I told them don't lie to me about due to weather, weather is beautiful and then they said due to air traffic control. Never heard of that and couldn't leave out till tomorrow getting home late Sunday. Every other airline was leaving out even the one going to the same destination which is Atlanta but there's wasn't canceled so what you mean do to air traffic control. They will not give a refund or any incentive so I had to pay $289 on Delta to fly back home this morning to Atlanta that Frontier had canceled for no reason.

### "We rarely fly and if we fly again it won’t be with this airline"
Booked direct flight from Denver to San Antonio. We were told departure time had changed about 15 minutes but we were unaware that entire flight changed and we were to have a 5 hour layover in Las Vegas. We had booked and paid for selected seats but did not get those on changed flight with no refund for seat change. Also the plane overheated on the Vegas tarmac and we then had to wait another 3-4 hours for another plane. Staff rude and curtly instructed everyone to sit down during the overheating ordeal, but everyone was sitting down. The passengers were all polite and patient. We rarely fly and if we fly again it won’t be with this airline. I have written to Frontier but they have not responded.

### "They did not care"
I purchased four tickets to fly from Sacramento to Las Vegas. When I came to the airport I was told that the ticket for my 79 year old mother and my minor son is not in the system. I went to the airport at 1pm and my flight was at 3.15pm. I asked can you put us on the next flight together. My mother and my minor son cannot travel by themselves. They said there is no seat available today on any flight you have wait for a later date, it is not possible to put you in a flight today. My son had school the next and I was going to work. I was talking to them for 2 hours and I missed my flight help to get my son and my elder mother a flight. I called the airline, they charged me an extra $275 for my son and my mother on top of my ticket money. $50 processing fee and they charged me $50 to put us on the next flight which was 7.30pm. When boarding the airplane was more than half empty. The pilot said anyone can sit anywhere. They lied and that there was no room. My mother got sick after standing in line and waiting for so long. I will never fly Frontier and will not be recommending it to anyone. They did not care about my mother's health even though I have explained she cannot travel by herself. When calling the airline they did not care regarding an elder's health, just lied to charge more money.

### "Recommend 100%"
Not Verified |  Friendly staff, smiling pilots, comfortable seating. Not much for food and beverage however. Buy it. Your getting discounted tickets pay for a snack if you dont bring one with you. Problem solved I did opt to buy a front seat in the aisle, for a cheap price, but with my ticket costing 39 bucks round trip. Why hell not. If u can pack a personal bag with enough stuff in the limits of what they offer, free baggage. Flew with 2 kids, personal bags only and for a week in Orlando. Less then 150 bucks for all 3 of us round trip, with seat selection there and back. Recommend 100%

### "leave you stranded"
Horrible airline the flight may leave early and leave you stranded. Manager at counter rude and stated that their flights don't leave early. Did not give refund as they stated they would. This flight left early during my connector manager didn't like that I had pictures and started saying I was causing an interruption in the airport when I asked another passenger about our flight leaving us.

### "Edreams refuse to give my refund"
So I went through Edreams and booked a flight back in December and I cancelled my flight 72 hrs prior. Here it is almost October and Edreams refuse to give my refund and I also contacted the airline Frontier on several occasions to receive my refund back. They're both giving me the run arounds about my refund.

### "Very rude service"
Very rude service. I was on the phone with a young lady last night three times because the credit code I was given didn't work, later on the 3rd call I was told in an ugly way that the credit goes only to the person I had booked with my flight under my booking as well I paid for. She didn't let me speak she didn't help me understand when the first call I made I was asked why the other person wasn't able to go so she can state that reason and that I'm able to use the credit. Only to find out on the 3rd call the credit isn't mine then repeatedly telling me that I can hang up now hello hang up over and over. I have a flight coming up I'm also a discount den member which I regret very much purchasing. The phone call actually hurt me so much that I'm trying somehow to book another flight with a different airline or even just start over somewhere else forget the hotel forget that i just wanted a bit of me time. Its already very expensive but to have to deal with customer service that way is horrible. I wish I would of read the reviews before purchasing from this airline. Less expensive then other airlines but I would wait months to save up $ to pay more to use another airline.

### "Really bad service"
Really bad service, flight got delayed a hour late and didn’t give us a notice , it also started to board and we left a hour late. Just so bad and horrible, first and last time on this airline.

### "extremely rude"
Not Verified | San Antonio to Las Vegas. Customer service was extremely rude! Wouldn’t help me when I needed help. When I tried to talk to them they continued to look forward and ignored me like I wasn’t even there.

### "I will pay the extra money for an airline who cares about their customers"
I will never again book with Frontier Airlines. The cheap price is no doubt paying for what you get. Their customer service is horrible, by not telling you about fee changes or removing baggage from the returning flight. The other issue is they all have a "not my problem" attitude and blame it on the employee I spoke to before them, saying there's nothing they can do about it. My $48 round trip flight ended up costing almost 3 times as much. Besides this, their website and app are absolute trash. It's impossible to get anything done without the website crashing and logging you out, or just not doing anything. Will never be booking with this company again, I will pay the extra money for an airline who cares about their customers.

### "The staff were friendly but clueless"
Chairs don’t recline. No beverages offered. The plane rattled the entire time and they lost our luggage. They weren’t sure where it was for awhile. Their own ground crew didn’t notify them that they missed loading our luggage on the connecting flights (same company) and threw it on another flight. The staff were friendly but clueless. Took hours to finally get our luggage.

### "Why were there so many flight attendants who did nothing"
We used Frontier to and from Florida. They do not provide any perks whatsoever for the price you pay. No one free carry on or one check baggage, no complimentary drinks or snacks. They threaten you to buy online or you’ll have to pay up to double at the counter. Check in was confusing because even though you did everything online, you are still required to go to the counter. You save them having to print a sticker for you. Not enough staff in DEN. Ridiculous about masks. They cram people into a tight cabin, and are still like “we care about health and safety” despite masks being absolutely useless. The flight attendants talked down to us and treated us like children. They then force to listen to about a 5 minute sales pitch about their stupid credit card, as if I would want that after you have provided absolutely zero service or any type of convenience. It felt like an eternity. It was torturous. So I’d avoid Frontier until they figure out how to actually provide customer service. Why were there so many flight attendants who did nothing.

### "I was forced to scramble and book a United flight"
We booked a roundtrip flight from Buffalo, NY to Myrtle Beach, SC in July 2021 via Orbitz. Confirmed via email. Received many emails from Frontier regarding this trip. Successfully took the first flight in Sept 2021 without issue and got to Myrtle Beach. The day before we were leaving I attempted to check in for the return flight and was not able to with a message advising to contact the airline. I searched online and eventually found a number to call, and after an extensive hold time I spoke to someone who advised that my flight had been canceled and I wasn't notified because they didn't have my email address. Again, I have received many emails from Frontier regarding this trip. I asked to speak to a supervisor who was extremely curt with me and advised that the flight was canceled because not enough people booked it. He advised that there was no recourse and no way for me to get home unless I wanted to go to Iceland. He advised they don't rebook with other airlines. Frontier flew me to Myrtle Beach, canceled my flight without notice, and had no option for me to get home and no remorse. I was forced to scramble and book a United flight (with a layover with a toddler) for double what the entire trip was supposed to cost me. Frontier advised they were sorry for the inconveniences and had nothing else to offer me.

### "a very disturbing situation "
Not Verified |  I encountered a very disturbing situation with Frontier Air at the Philadelphia airport on September 7, 2021. I was very surprised to encounter at least nine very rude Frontier employees. I routinely fly between Philadelphia and Charlotte and have never once felt motivated and angry enough to write a letter of complaint. I’m a grandmother just visiting the grandkids. I do it a lot. Frontier is my preferred airline because of the perfect schedule and The flight was delayed, and there was a gate change. I went to gate 9 as directed, and waited. A Frontier employee came through asking if there was anyone going to Charleston … not me, I’m going to Charlotte. So I continued waiting. After waiting over an hour, I realized something was wrong and I went looking for assistance. I approached 3 girls upstairs, I told them what happened. They told me to go look for someone in a green shirt. I walked back and forth upstairs and couldn’t find anyone. Then I called Frontier for help and I couldn’t get a human. Then I went downstairs to the ticketing area. I encountered 6 girls in green shirts. The first person I spoke with looked it up on the computer and said it was my fault, and my ticket was forfeited. The next flight out was the following morning. No courtesy, no compassion at all. At this point I’m starting to tear up.. “Mean girl” #1 said, “You need to be nicer.” I was nice. I was just crying. The next “mean girl” said, “You get back what you give.” I was crying, they knew that. Then all six of them started cackling and laughing at me. It was blatant mean behavior. They were taking great pleasure in humiliating me. Just typing these words cannot convey the sneers on their faces and the derision in their voices. I told one of the more antagonistic “mean girls” that she wasn’t the one helping me and she should go away. When she said, “Make me,” that was all I could take. I fell apart sobbing. I did say a very bad 4 letter word when I stomped off in tears. As I walked away, they continued laughing hysterically. Several of them said, “Have a nice day!” I didn’t in any way deserve the treatment I received. I then made phone calls to customer service. Joe at the 9000 number was at least kind, and Dan on my second call was kind and also helpful. He said he would send an email outlining my experience to the “higher ups.” I asked him to send me a copy of his email, which didn’t happen, but I get it. I’m more than willing to admit I may have misunderstood the instructions, or made a mistake  but when I went to find help, I was met with hostility. Six girls downstairs. They seemed to take joy in my confusion. I’m not used to being ridiculed in public and that’s exactly what happened. Once I was in tears, it went downhill from there. I told my daughter in Charlotte what happened, and she found a flight later that evening on American Airlines. Initially I was a hot mess because I got my feelings hurt. Now I’m just really angry.

### "recommend taking a different airline"
Booked flight for 12:17pm depart, at least 4 delays without even a notice. We saw the board and caught it. They even changed terminals and we had to go to the other side of the airport. After 5 1/2 hours, we are now boarding the flight at 5:45pm. We now have to pay an extra day in parking, an extra day in pet sitting fees for two dogs and I am actually visiting in Denver too which means I lost a vacation day. My friend confronted the front desk and she was very dismissive with no apology. We are now hungry and tired and out over $100 more dollars due to their incompetence. I’m sure when I call them tomorrow, there will be a heavy delay with getting someone actually on the line. I highly recommend taking a different airline. This one gets negative 10 stars.

### "will never fly this airline again"
The staff is terrible and the pilot was awful. People actually got up and left the flight due to how they were treating people. There was a repair needed to the baggage compartment area under the plane. This caused the bags all to be moved to the rear of the plan. Doing this caused a tail heavy response and peoples seats had to be moved around. I have my 7yr old son with me and we were in the 3rd row in the upgraded seats. We were forced to move back to the 20th row and told “move your seat or get off the plane, I don’t care what you do but you’re getting out of that seat” by the pilot. When asked about a refund for the upgrade cost I was told it’s not their problem and get up. I will never fly this airline again.

### "Absolute trash service"
Not Verified |  Our flight was canceled at 10pm at night after we were meant to leave at 8pm. They wouldn’t refund us our tickets, so we could take a different airline. They set us up with a hotel for the night 3 hours after our flight was canceled, so 1am is when we finally left the airport. They took the customers who were screaming, throwing a fit first. Wouldn’t go in order of those who asked for a hotel first. And wouldn’t take the guests waiting patiently. I had to pay for a 45 minute uber ride. The airline said they’d pay for the Uber. I called customer service multiple times later and they refused to pay for the Uber ride. Absolute trash service. Never will fly them again. You’ve been warned, go with a quality airline.

### "Do not do business with them"
Not Verified |  90% of their flights are delayed by an 1+. In my most recent flight the pilot took 4 hours to arrive and by the time he arrived the flight attendant personnel had decided to go home because “the pilot took so long”. The airline pushed the time four times and it was 10:30 pm and we were still at the gate waiting to board our 6:19 flight. Do not do business with them.

### "Maintenance issues and then no word"
I’m writing this review as we sit here waiting to get out of the gate. Maintenance issues and then no word. No announcement at least to tell us what is going on. Horrible airline. Never will fly again, isn’t worth the hassle.

### "12lbs over and was charged $75"
Not Verified |  My suitcase was 12lbs over and was charged $75. What a rip off. Then at the gate an elderly couple had need charged a $100, after looking at the carry-on, it would have easily fit under the sit. Do yourself a favor, do not use Frontier.

### "They have extra fees buried everywhere"
Not Verified |  After this trip I'll spend the ~$30 on a United ticket and still end up saving more than flying with Frontier. They have extra fees buried everywhere - even down to a $3 cup of water and more pitches for their sponsored credit card signups than the US has dead Kennedys, but they can't seem to have a gate ready when they land. Instead of trying to trick the passenger into thinking they worked harder to transport them faster, I'd personally prefer an accurately quoted ETA. I'd also prefer to not be stirred back awake, midway through a red-eye flight at 11pm, to the sudden activation of every light in the cabin just so I can hear a scripted pitch about how Frontier's Visa Card is so much different than literally any given Visa Card, as if it's not another piece of plastic with the same dimensions as the others. We all get it, Frontier: you're keeping your ticket prices down by charging for everything else. So why is every measurably better airline coming in cheaper after the bills have been tallied? Make it make sense!

### "refuses to make good on promises"
Not Verified |  We, 2 couples, bought tickets from Boston to Miami several months in advance. The day of the initial flight, after check in completed without problem 24 hours prior, our segment Boston- Miami was canceled without notice. At the airport there were no frontier personnel to provide assistance nor answers. We realized at that moment we had email stating the fight was canceled and were offered the option of buying tickets on any other airline and be refunded up to $400. Frontier agent on phone instructed us of doing same. Now after almost 3 months of sending proof of tickets, purchase and credit card charges Frontier refuses to make good on promises and pay for the airfare cost on another airline. All we got was a "$30" voucher to have the opportunity to be ripped off again.

### "Complete rip off"
Complete rip off. Feels more like buying a used car from a guy with gold chains. Low advertised price but their interpretation of bags and charge for carry-ons makes this one of the more expensive flights of my life. Why they feel they can charge 60 dollars for my bag to sit on my lap is beyond me. Employees are unhappy, delays inflight, no communication, just sit and wait and hope they get you home. Had a last minute trip for a funeral and booked return with Frontier despite that nagging feeling that you were about to get ripped off. I guess they do not disappoint there. I recall boarding reputable airlines and watching miserable Frontier customers with despair in their eyes due to delays. Here we now sit. Never again.

### "one minute late for check in"
Not Verified |  I got to the airport an hour before my flight with no bags to drop off. The self check-in machines were not working so i talked to the frontier service lady and she saw how I had no bags and checking in for me would only be a few seconds, but decided to put me in the very long line. When i finally get to the desk, the guy tells me I'm one minute late for check in even though it was over half an hour before my flight. This only happened a few hours ago and I still don’t know how I'm getting home.

### "don't get what you paid for"
Not Verified |  You don't get what you paid for! I have recently booked a return ticket from Chicago to Cozumel. It's a direct flight and the price was right - in fact almost twice lower than on major carriers. One week before the departure got a notice from Frontier that the return leg was canceled. They did offer to rebook it on another Frontier flight. The problem was that they fly that route only once a week on Saturdays so the next available flight was a week later. They won't book a ticket on any other airline according to their policies - had to rebook one way ticket on United myself, which had a long connection in Denver. A word of advice to other travelers: always have an escape plan! Periodically check the seat map on the flight you are interested in. If two weeks before the departure it shows less than 60% full - it is a canceled flight already even though it hasn't been announced yet. Then keep an eye on other flights you can use. Once the announcement comes out - usually by email - you have to act extremely fast to rebook another flight as you will be competing with potentially hundreds of other travelers from the canceled flight, and available inventories will shrink quickly. I saw a factor of three price hikes on the direct United flights from Cozumel to Chicago within fifteen minutes after the Frontier cancelation notice.

### "so disrespected by an airline"
Never have I been so disrespected by an airline. I booked last minute with Frontier after having a Spirit Airlines flight cancel on me. Frontiers front desk agents and phone operators have been rude and un-helpful. My flights with Frontier also became delayed and cancelled, resulting in delays at the airport running over 24 hours! I was informed that I would be receiving a refund and/or flight vouchers for the trouble I went through. However, it appears frontier will no longer honor or follow through with any reconciliation originally promised. While the expense of the flight is only a couple hundred dollars and means nothing, I would expect to be treated better after being stranded at the airport for over 24 hours. Spirit at least apologized, refunded and provided flight vouchers as an apology for their cancelled flight. Frontier was a last minute booking, I now know to never fly Frontier again.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service and one of the most uncomfortable planes! Flight was canceled - but was not told that until 8 hours of waiting at the airport being first told that we had a plane just needed to wait for staff, which then turned into we have staff just no plane, which turned into a canceled flight. I rebooked for the next day to a completely different airport because the was the next best option for our group - I had originally looked into this option for our trip because it was a much cheaper ticket price, but they charged me the same amount as my original canceled booking ($300 difference if you are wondering). I had travel expenses to and from airport again and an unexpected overnight stay in a hotel (In Vegas so not super cheap here). Airline would not help me out for the difference in flight prices, nor travel expenses, nor the hotel expense. They offered me a $100 voucher to use in the next 90 days - are you kidding me? You want me to rebook and spend more money with you? That's just not right at all.

### "this was the best experience"
Not Verified |  I have to say this was the best experience. Your flight craft has the very difficult task of dealing with masks. We flew down on American (which I will never fly again because of their staff) and back on yours. American acted like they were the lynching squad and threatened to write up you and report you to the captain, which seemed like being scolded by my old high school teachers, and I even had my mask on but it wasn't according to their standards. Frontier however, made the situation very relatable, the staff basically treated the people with respect, addressed the mandate in an adult manner and even made us laugh a little. I went above and beyond to try to make sure I didn't make their job more difficult and for the first time ever bought snacks and drinks and gave the biggest tip I could. So your crew not only has people skills but we willfully spend money on the flight because they were likeable and relatable. Please treat them well and compensate them well, people will remember this and come back just because of them.

### "the absolute worst service"
Not Verified |  This was the absolute worst service I have experienced in an airline. Not only were staff rude, the pacing that this company allows shows their lack of regard for their customers time. An example of that is the 1.5 hours it took from the time we landed to the moment baggage arrived at baggage claim. As a complaint was brought up to various employees (in a polite manner) they all argued with the customer (myself or others). Their lack of efficiency in their check in process caused one customer before me to miss their baggage check as she waited in line for 1.5 hours then missed the 45 minute bag check requirement. This airline is a disgrace and needs to invest in their customer service. I don't recommend to anyone traveling for business purposes as their lack of time management will affect your trip.

### "airline is the bottom of the barrel"
Not Verified |  My flight was canceled so close to my departure that I didn’t have time to find another flight. Like who cancels a flight just like that? Totally mess up a customers life without notice. Leaving them stranded in another country. Their rep had the audacity to offer me another flight 11 days later. And then said I’ll receive a refund 7 business days later like nothing. This airline is the bottom of the barrel in the aviation industry and I see for sure that they aren’t interested in changing even after all of the horrible reviews that are posted about them.

### "boarding process is a mess"
Not Verified |  The plane is clean and was on time or just a couple of mins behind but the boarding process is a mess and the staff is so rude, the customer service is the worse I've ever seen. I did meet some nice flight attendants but most of them were rude. They need to re-evaluate their employees quickly. Some of the seats are comfortable like the exit seats.

### "my name is not in the system"
We all understand shortages of hiring. We understand weather happens. We understand that flights aren't always going to be when we want. BUT When you offer people reimbursement on optional flights - they provide all requested information for flight AND do it in a timely manner (same night as cancellation via YOUR provided links) and this is their experience. Flight 1183 from Providence RI to Orlando FL on July 19th at 6:37PM cancelled after multiple delays given through app on phone. Delay pushes all the way from original flight times to 11 PM leaving hundreds in airport to figure out flights. Stand in line in Providence to get hotel and flight ideas from desk. We were given a hotel (thank you) and told an email will explain next steps. Get to hotel, go with option 1 because - at this point - it seems Frontier will handle this cancellation with grace. Unfortunately, this "grace" turns to absolute bafoonery shortly. After completing my request for flight, here's where you take $800 from me: - Told Confirmation will be sent after going through Option 1 flight rescheduling : No email received - Go to Southwest desk in person to confirm request of seats on that flight THROUGH FRONTIER'S OFFERED OPTION are completed - Not only is the flight full, but my name is not in the system. No standby, nothing. - At this point, I just assume the worst. So, I think "Hey, frontier gave us the option of $400 per ticket through another airline, lets go ahead and do that! Take our flights, get home. I think to IMMEDATELY call Frontier to notify them we wouldn't be taking your flight 48 hours after my original flight because you NEVER SENT confirmation and the only reason I got notified I was still on it was by getting a "ready to check in" email - more than 24 hours after I already made it home! I was on hold for over 30 mins to have a 2 mins conversation with someone who told me "not to worry, you'll be reimbursed and thank you for thinking of others with the call and letting us know the seat is open" - Fast forward to this week - I get an email saying I haven't provided the necessary information (I've sent Frontier information, my confirmation information, all southwest receipts and all contact with Frontier) - but alas, I keep the faith and submit again. Get another email today. No notes in your system of a call from me? Just "forfeited flight" and see ya later?

### "very rude and unhelpful employees"
Our flight was delayed 4 times and then canceled. When we went to reschedule, they booked our new flight for the incorrect dates- even after reviewing the correct dates with me over the phone several times. After correcting the dates we took our vacation. On our flight home they gave the seats I paid extra money for (leg room) to other passengers. My husband had to sit in the back of the plane and I was in the front. Upon arrival home, I called frontier and told them of my inconveniences. They told me for my inconvenience, they were going to send me 2 $50 vouchers within 7 to 10 days. It has been 2 weeks and I haven't received them. I called frontier this morning and the woman on the phone was speaking over me and didn't want to hear a thing I had to say. She ended up hanging up on me. I called back and explained everything to another employee. He told me even though I was promised vouchers, there was a note in the system which stated to not give me a voucher. I am beyond furious with Frontier but most of all its very rude and unhelpful employees. I am not one to write a review, as this is my first review ever, but I have to warn others about this airline and its extremely rude and unhelpful staff members. One positive thing to say about frontier is the staff on the plane was decently nice.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Horrible service. The flight itself going was fine. However airport employees were unorganized. Not ready and caused chaos due to system issues. Lines were incredibly long. No working kiosks. Just terrible organization. Will never fly with them again.

### "avoid them as much as possible"
Flight got canceled 3 times and was rescheduled for today and now they are delayed again because maintenance is required to approve for our departure so now we have to De-board the plan and wait 1 1/2 hr and not even sure if it will leave after yet. This is got be be the worst my first and last time using this airline. I would rather drive 24 hrs than to use this company. Save your time, money and headache - avoid them as much as possible.

### "flight was over 8hrs delayed"
I am currently writing this review as I wait in the airport to board my flight. My flight was originally supposed to take off at 9:50AM on Friday August 13. It is currently 4:58PM and I still need to wait until 6:11PM to board my flight since it has been  delayed for 8 hou8rs now I received 4 different messages rescheduling my flight! The first message stated my flight was delayed by 3hrs, the next message stated it was 5hrs delayed, the third message stated my flight was 7hrs late and the fourth message finally stated my flight was over 8hrs delayed. It is absolutely disappointing waiting over 8hrs for a 2hr flight! The word angry can not even describe what I feel right now.

### "spin on its baggage policies is a joke"
Perhaps this is an old saw, but Frontier’s “positive” spin on its baggage policies is a joke. The hidden costs in every aspect of making a flight a livable experience is laughable. Having paid $140.00 over air fare ticket prices to get actual baggage onto the plane, my boarding 1 priority seat was a non reclining seat in row 4! At the back of the plane, I might expect that. Frontier lets you pay for the privilege of greater discomfort! I have learned that one needs to add the cost up front so that the same seat on any other airline really costs about the same as the “discounted” Frontier price. I know that other airlines have adopted similar practices, but this is a case of “fool me once, shame on you,” and there will be no “fool me twice.

### "so completely incompetent"
Low cost air travel that comes with a cost, sometimes far overshadowing the cost of an ‘alternative’ standard airline. Here is my story: First incident on 7/25/2021: My two children were returning home to Orlando from St. Louis, MO on Sunday, 7/25/2021 on Flight # F9 1210. The flight landed close to being on time (5:56 pm). After landing, there were no Frontier personnel available to ‘receive’ the aircraft and/or operate the walkway. The aircraft sat for 1 hour at the gate without passengers being able to disembark. The passengers finally got off the plane and my kids headed towards baggage claim to collect their bag. While they were waiting at the carousel, the belt suddenly just stopped moving. An announcement was made that Frontier only had one person offloading luggage from the aircrafts, and that it was going to be awhile before luggage would be available. 3 hours and 50 minutes after they landed at MCO, my children finally got their bag before we could head home. Up to date I have not heard anything from Frontier Airlines since filing this complaint a week ago. On Thursday 7/29/2021, my wife and two daughters were to fly with Frontier to Phoenix AR for the Taekwondo World Championships that my daughter qualified for. Their flight was to make a connection in Atlanta to Phoenix. The flight out of Orlando got delayed numerous times because of “lack of maintenance personnel” and “waiting for clearance from Colorado” - wait for it, Frontier Airlines only having one person to do the maintenance check on the aircraft before take-off! The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. My wife raised her concerns about missing their connection in Atlanta, but Frontier agent told her that there were 19 people on this specific flight that needed to make that connection, and there was no way Frontier would not wait on these 19 passengers to make the connection. However, Frontier decided the connecting flight in Atlanta to Phoenix would NOT wait on the passengers on the Orlando flight. The Frontier personnel merely shrugged it off and said the best they could do was to fly my family to Las Vegas, and then to Phoenix the next morning. Arriving at 8.30 am. My daughter was competing the next morning for the World Championships at 8am, something she has been training and preparing for for 5 years! At this point she was hysterical, and could see her dreams disappear before her eyes because of the incompetence of Frontier Airlines! My wife and daughters ran through Atlanta Hartford and finally found a flight with Delta Airlines that would get them to Phoenix that evening late. They had to pay an additional $1,765.00 for 3 one way tickets to Phoenix from Atlanta. After purchasing the tickets, they had to collect their luggage (which Frontier could not find for an hour), check in again, go through security and run back to the Delta flight. Returning from Phoenix, AZ on Saturday, 7/30/2021 on Flight 1045 my family had to make yet another connection in Ohio. Their flight landed at MCO at 9:15pm. Again they had to sit in the aircraft after landing for 30 minutes because Frontier only had ONE PERSON working. After waiting for another hour for their luggage, they were told by Frontier personnel that their luggage has been lost! How can one airline be so completely incompetent, pathetic and just plain horrible? The bag got delivered to our home 4 days later.

### "Choose any other airline"
I'm surprised they don't charge you to go to the bathroom on this airline. Everything from a carry-on to a glass of water was nickeled and dimed. The seats are not comfortable and do not recline. Nor do they offer enough space to actually open a laptop. Not that you'll be doing much since there's no wifi. This is a garbage airline that charges you for everything under the sun, so it ends up being as much as a more premium airline but without any premium service, such as an extra glass of water. The flight attendants are glorified drink sellers; not helpful. Several people decided to wear chin diapers on my flight from Philadelphia to Las Vegas and the attendants did nothing except try to sell you a $3.25 cup of bad coffee. When my connecting flight from Las Vegas to San Diego was delayed over 2 hours, I was told to shove it since they can delay you up to 3 hours without having to do anything for you. And believe me, they will absolutely do nothing for you; no customer service. Wouldn't even agree to give me a drink on the airplane since they were keeping me away from home for 2 extra hours. I had a 6 hour layover as a result, and Frontier was worse than indifferent; they were borderline hostile. There is no reason this airline should be in business. They are the worst on everything; their prices are not competitive and you have to pay for all services. Choose any other airline.

### "a madhouse checking bags"
The trip out: it was a madhouse checking bags. We were early but almost missed our flight due to them pushing up many who would miss theirs. The flight was good, but then we sat waiting for our gate. When we disembarked, they did not tell us the baggage carousel & we actually got arrested at wacky DFW for going back thru their security doors! The trip back: Flight was delayed a half hour, otherwise good. But then it took over an hour for the bags to come.

### "subhuman treatment they gave her"
Frontier cancelled my wifes flight for no reason at the last second, stranding her at the airport with our newborn. They made her miss her connection home, offered no alternatives, simply shrugged and said they would refund her money for the frontier flight only. Not for the connections they made her miss, or all the expenses they burdened us with by cancelling. ​Absolutely disgusting and unforgivable behavior. No alternate flights offered home, just a callous "oh well too bad for you". Cost us hundreds in hotel expenses and new flight bookings, not to mention the extreme stress of doing all that while caring for a newborn. Still cannot believe the subhuman treatment they gave her, just awful. Will never book with this airline again

### "Frontier is bad, but not the worst I’ve seen"
Not Verified |  Frontier is bad, but not the worst I’ve seen. Long waits always with delays (which always seem to have to do with mechanical issues). Had to wait 4+ hours multiple times just to fly to wherever I need with uncomfortable seats, iffy staff (definitely not too bad but nowhere close to larger airline company staff) and losing plans every single time. I normally get priority seating with no result or anything happening. Zero entertainment on the planes, I recommend bringing a book since there isn’t any service in the sky.

### "I wouldn't recommend Frontier"
Not Verified |  Right now I wouldn't recommend Frontier to fly. I paid extra for priority boarding and it wasn't announced we noticed people in line so we got in line. Already was 1hr behind because of a delay which I understand it happens that wasn't a problem. We finally find where our luggage is and wait smooth 30 min so at this Pont we're about 40 min sense getting off the plane. My sister had to circle around 10 times before we got out. No one to report the damage to. My sister flies all the time and said within 24hrs which we did. When I was talking to customer service they contradicted themselves because they were telling me yes within 4 hrs and that was to prove it was from the airport. Next time I will make sure to do pictures of the damage at the airport. Thanks for messing up my vacation. I spent so much time on the phone with customer service. I received an email that said I would get a call in the next 4 hrs I called customer service again which was 24hrs after the email. You need to get a better system.

### "Flight was delayed over and over"
Flight was delayed over and over with no explanation. Flew them for 2 other legs this month. Every single flight was delayed. One of them was delayed an hour with no explanation. The flight attendants were just chitchatting.

### "Worst airline customer service I've encountered"
Not Verified |  Worst airline customer service I've encountered. I made my reservation via Priceline. Frontier canceled my return flight, and the best reschedule option would have cost me two more days away from home, so two hotel stays and two missed days of work, which I just couldn't do, so I asked for a refund. Instead of refunding me the full ticket cost of $190, plus the $75 they charged me to correct my name (they'd concatenated my first and middle name, so I had to correct it), they only refunded $109. Not only did I wait on hold for over an hour every time I spoke with them, but they couldn't explain why I wasn't receiving a full refund, and I had a really hard time understanding all the reps with whom I spoke because they didn't speak English very well. I'll never again fly, or attempt to fly, on Frontier Airlines.

### "This was the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This was the worst airline I have ever encountered, I did not get any notification that the flight had changed and luckily several of my friends on the same flight got a notification and were able to cancel their flights. After discovering the switch I attempted to cancel my flight for a refund and could not contact anyone and was unable to cancel my flight for a refund. I know this is a budget airline but this airline shouldn't even exist because no one should pay for a flight that is changed or never comes.

### "go with another airline"
I was drawn to Frontier because of the cheap flights (I just need to get from point A to point B), but it ended up costing me more. On the way to our honeymoon, our flight was delayed 5 hours with no explanation. That wasn't ideal, but it happens. Coming back from our honeymoon, Frontier cancelled our flight when we got to the airport with no explanation. They offered an amount for other airlines that wouldn't cover the cost of any flight, so we had to take their option of putting us on another Frontier flight the next day that (problems with that are explained below). We told the Frontier rep that Frontier needed to give us a place to spend the night since they messed us up. They gave us a piece of paper that said we would be refunded up to $150 for a hotel if we submitted the hotel reservation info on their website. The only place within that range was a cheap motel, but we went for it so we'd have a place to sleep. I had a feeling that they would find some way to avoid keeping their promise and reimbursing us. Sure enough, we submitted everything they asked for online and didn't hear from them for a month. After contacting them, they finally responded and said we wouldn't be reimbursed because we didn't have that piece of paper (just plain text on white paper) they had given us 1 month ago. The paper, the rep, and the website said absolutely nothing about needing that piece of paper. They had record of the flight being cancelled, our flight being changed to the next day, and that they had the document on their computer. Just a ridiculous way to avoid reimbursing us for the problem they put us in. For the new flight, instead of the direct flight from Denver to Philly that we paid for, sent us all the way down to Florida for a layover before flying back up to Philly, costing us an entire extra day and requiring us to pay for overpriced food at the airport (Frontier said they wouldn't help with any of this). Other people on our plane talked about missing important meetings and weddings because of Frontier's frequent cancelations. The initial price of the flight might be cheaper, but you'll probably end up paying more. If your plans are totally flexible and you're fine with sleeping in the airport, you can take the risk. But if you have anything scheduled at your destination, go with another airline.

### "I will try to avoid Frontier from now on"
Not Verified |  I got to the airport 1 hour and 45 minutes early. It was a 6.35am flight. I booked it months earlier. When I showed up I had already pre-checked in. I went to check in my luggage and the kiosk told me I had to see an agent. The line was huge and absolute chaos. There were 2 ticketing agents and 2 other agents yelling out destinations and telling people to hustle and get their luggage checked. They were rude and nasty. They insulted and belittled passengers who maybe didn't hear and told them it was their fault that they couldn't get their luggage checked and they missed their flight. They yelled out my destination and I hustled to get my bag checked in. The lady then told me at the counter I was not going to make it, by that time I had 45 minutes until my flight. I wasted 45 minutes in line! It was absolutely awful, they rebooked me on the flight for the next morning the same time they said they had nothing else. Shortly after I saw other passengers booked onto later flights to New Orleans. I was ahead in line and apparently out of luck. I wasn't rude or disrespectful. In fact I was very careful and kind understanding they were understaffed. I had already paid for my hotel for that night so I easily and fairly cheaply got another flight on United and quickly got checked in, it was pleasant and calm at United and they were so helpful. After I got to my United gate I called Frontier and they gave me a $59 credit. I argued but that was all they offered. I paid $117 for my one way flight and the baggage fee. So they screwed me at every turn. It was so awful. I will try to avoid Frontier from now on.

### "Each leg was delayed repeatedly"
Singular worst airline experience I could ever imagine (I've flown easily 500 times). Each leg was delayed repeatedly, minimal communication, totally disinterested, apathetic staff. Frontier lost my luggage and no one bothered to answer the customer service despite being on hold for 30 minutes. Also, no in-flight entertainment and no reclining seats, and they ran out of their $3.75 cans of soda almost immediately. The airline should change their tag line to: "we treat our customers like garbage" That's how I felt flying Frontier Airlines.

### "I'm very disappointed with Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified |  On July 23, 2021 I was traveling from T.F. Green (PVD) to Orlando Airport(MCO) Florida at 11.49am. When I checked in and I walked to the boarding gate I received a message the flight was delayed until 12.30pm in the afternoon, shortly after I received another one for 1.06 pm, another for 3.30 pm, then from that time until 7.30pm so I arrived to Orlando at 8.30 pm. I was so exhausted because I have neck and back problems and the seat at the airport is not comfortable. Frontier Airlines didn't give us any information or the reason why the flight was delaying so it was so frustrating. Frontier offered us $10.00 voucher for food and I couldn't get a food counter that would take the voucher. The $10.00 voucher, you buy two bottle of waters and if you lucky you can get a candy bar and water if they accept the voucher. They didn't even offer us a glass of water while traveling from PVD to Orlando. They should refund your ticket if the flight is delayed more than 3 hours but instead they gave us $70.00 towards. I paid $43.00 for my small bag which it's ridiculous and this is another reason that I don't want to fly with them. I'm very disappointed with Frontier Airlines and I don't wish to travel with them anymore.

### "there was was no social distancing and the washroom was horrible"
Not Verified |  This airline is horrible and not helpful to the passengers. On our flight there was was no social distancing and the washroom was horrible. My husband said he went to the washroom and it smelt and it was not clean. I gave my husband a Clorox wipe and hand sanitizer. Someone took our bag at the airport and when we tried to get assistance from the airline we were told to fill out a claim. I told the customer service representative that I put in a claim 30 minutes before calling. I had to pay $37 for a claim. It took an hour to speak to someone because we were bounced around to several different representatives. Luckily, the gentleman who had our bag and we had his found me on Facebook and met to get our bag back. I told the representative to give my number to the guy or give us his number. They said they couldn't do that. I'm going to dispute the charge and get my money back because they did not help us at all. This morning I received an email stating we filled the wrong claim. It stated we were supposed to claim for lost luggage which is what I did. The email stated the claim was for missing items at the airport. Well, my entire luggage was taking by accident.

### "weird and unsatisfactory situation"
Upon arrival on the plane, the first flight attendant, a male, felt compelled to tell me to make sure I covered my nose and mouth as I was already moving to do so. I am used to wearing a mask all day as I am an engagement director at an assisted living facility. There was a female flight attendant manning the overhead storage up front. We thought nothing of it until my mom was putting her backpack up there and she told her “ma’am that’s your personal item, it will need to be placed under the seat in front of you.” All while others are stuffing suitcases in the overhead bins. She didn’t seem to mind watching them do it. Gratefully, my mom who is never outspoken said “but I paid for a carry on.” The flight attendant then turned and requested that only my mother out of all the people stuffing luggage on the plane, show her boarding pass to prove she paid for carry on. Again, all while people around are stuffing multiple bags (even one lady stuffing her bag on top of my laptop bag, in the overhead bins-nothing was said. My mom obliged without even an apology from Debbie. It was embarrassing to say the least. I watched her the rest of boarding and she did not have this request of anyone else. After which the captain held us captive 30 more minutes after the flight had landed for reasons of “people being prematurely unbuckled and standing” at 11:32 with us getting off the plane at 12:02am…it was a very weird and unsatisfactory situation.

### "Seating is horrible. Very uncomfortable"
Plane delayed 2 hours on the way to Miami and canceled on the way back after a two hour delay. Delayed again the next day. Seating is horrible. Very uncomfortable. I recommend spending a few extra bucks and fly on another airline. You will end up spending it in extra food and stay or transportation due to delays and cancelations anyways. Never flying on this airline again, even with the free voucher.

### "Everything delayed at least 2.5 hours"
Terrible! Worst airline ever! Everything delayed at least 2.5 hours, and don’t even bother with their non English speaking customer service! They will offer you a $25 flight voucher that has to be used in 90 days! They can keep it! We will never fly them again!

### "cancelled due to staff shortage"
Unbelievable. After sitting in the airport 5 hours, Our flight was cancelled due to staff shortage with no other flight leaving until Teusday, no alternative offer, Frontier basically said "not our problem". Tons of people/families stranded and irate and no where to stay, Frontier not offering hotel to anyone, and basically screwed a whole flight of people and us out of our vacation. Plus they tossed everyone's bags out onto the floor in a big pile. Never experienced this before with an airline.

### "I won’t fly cheap anymore"
My flight was delayed an hour, I understand things happen. I’m most upset is that I paid for a check in bag, waited over an hour and a half for my baggage, I had to leave I was so exhausted from being delayed in the first place. Our gate at Orlando changed from 28 to 22. Customer service was horrible. I will never fly or recommend this airline ever. I flew this airline once before from Denver to NY and had no problems. What is going on? A lot of angry customers so I won’t fly cheap anymore, lesson learned, Jetblue, American Airlines or Delta all the way. Pay the extra it’s worth it.

### "Atrocious customer service"
Not Verified |  Purchased 2 seats on Frontier Airline website for me and my girlfriend for flight to New Jersey, got to the airport only to find out the flight was over booked and my seats were sold to someone else. We were placed in separate seats, which was very stressful for my girlfriend who has a phobia of flying. I requested a refund but was denied. Atrocious customer service.

### "they refuse to honor my request"
Not Verified |  If I could give no stars I would. They cancelled my return leg from MCO to MCI scheduled in the AM on June 27th, 2021. They sent a notification at 10.30 the night before. We barely got time to schedule a flight to get back in the morning. Fortunately Spirit had a flight open for 8am. I sent in the Spirit receipt for reimbursement and they refuse to honor my request. Not to mention that the first leg of their flight was 4 hours delayed.

### "ticket was cheaper than my bags"
Phoenix to Sacramento. I'd rather walk than fly Frontier Airlines ever again. If it were possible to give this airline a zero I would. My ticket to fly was cheaper than my bags. They make you pay for even a carry-on. Flight was delayed going out. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped. Zero beverage or food service. Dirty plane. The money you "save" is not worth the headache you get when you fly this airline.

### "50lbs vs 52bls was a big deal for them?"
Not Verified |  We needed to check-in 2 suitcases. We didn't have issues when we flew from ATL to SLC since we could weigh the suitcases from home. When we flew back, we used the scale at the SLC airport to weight them. Each was 50lbs before we went to the desk to check-in. They used their scales - each suitcase on different scale - one showed 50lbs and the other showed 52lbs. Other airlines would allow you 52lbs/suitcase without any issue but they still asked us to pull things out of the suitcase to make it 50lbs. I told them that I had weighed them for 50lbs before I came here and we had used the scale at the corner (the SLC scale was at the corner, very close to the Frontier Check-in). The lady still told us to pull things out and they said they only used their scale. I paid $ for the check-in suitcase and who knows their scale were correct or not? 50lbs vs 52bls was a big deal for them?

### "delayed by 4 hours then cancelled"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Frontier many months in advance. Flight time was moved a few weeks in advance. Flight time was delayed by 4 hours the day of departure, then cancelled. There is not a live person to speak to. They issued a refund, but only 1/2 showed up. Beyond frustrating! You get what you pay for” Never again! Go to one of the major airlines.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
I had booked this as a last minute flight to return to Denver from Albuquerque. First our flight was delayed an hour due to weather and I understand and recognize this is completely out of the airlines control, Denver has horrible winds and rain. Regardless of this we were informed via the pilot of our delay and never via email or text from Frontier. Then we were allowed to return to the terminal but told we would receive an update in 30 minutes. I then notified my family that I would be late and to pick me up whenever my flight landed, they were monitoring the flight status. However, Frontier never updated their website to reflect any change in departure. The desk agents continued to update us with additional 30-45 minute delays. Then we were finally informed that our flight was boarding so we filed on to the plane. Once everyone was on they informed us that we all had to get off again because no one had scanned our boarding pass. I could not believe this, how could they let us all on to the plane without thinking of scanning or making sure we were all supposed to be there. After a series of delays we left about 3 and a half hours after out scheduled time. Only then did we receive any notification about the initial hour delay. At this point everyone was tired including my family who was patiently waiting for my texts as to when we departed because the website showed our estimated landing time 2 hours prior. The pilot announced that we would be receiving compensation for this flight and I thought great because they could not get it together. Only then was I informed we would be getting a voucher which did not come to my email and I had to call in order to get. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "No amount of cost savings is worth this negligence"
Not Verified |  I can’t even begin to explain how absolutely horrifying this experience was. Will never fly this airline again and am nauseated just thinking of the massive delays, incompetent staff and incoherent boarding experience. No amount of cost savings is worth this negligence.

### "What a messed up Vacation"
Not Verified |  This is a warning. Do not fly this airline. The worst experience ever. It seems like they have zero clue on how to run an airline. First flight was delayed out of Reagan National due to what was reported as a bad tyre. It took almost 3 hours to fix the problem. After missing the correcting flight in Denver we stood in line to speak to customer service for an additional 3.5 hours. After being placed on a flight to San Francisco? That doesn't leave Co. until Tuesday noon. Damn near a whole 24 hour after getting on the first flight out of D.C. This airline is the worst. What a messed up Vacation. I will never fly this airline again.

### "Every single flight has a delay"
Not Verified |  Just pay the extra money to fly a better airline. Every single flight we’ve had with Frontier has a delay. From Charlotte to Trenton 2 hour delay .. now, I’m sitting at the Trenton Airport and we were just informed a 2 hour delay! There is another flight here for Tampa and they have a 3 hour delay, with very angry passengers- literally yelling at the counter girl. It’s a shame, just pay extra and fly with a major airline. I won’t get home now until after 2 am! Pending I don’t get another delay.

### "would never recommend this airline"
Our experience with Frontier was very poor. The first major problem was getting to the terminal where they were located. We parked at “the parking spot” and shuttles to the main terminal where we found out Frontier is located at the south terminal and there is another shuttle that has to take you there. That is the ABIA shuttle which was extremely shorthanded when we departed and arrived. Second, the plane seats were extremely uncomfortable. The seats didn’t tilt back, no headrest support, etc third, they nickel and dime you on everything after the fare price. They lure you in with cheap fares and charge you for carryons, checked backs and even seat choices. The drinks were not free either. I would never recommend this airline to anyone flying after this experience.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I didn’t think it could get worse… but it did. We originally had a 7:00pm flight to arrive in ATL at 930. It was cancelled and we were put on a 9:00pm flight. Then it was delayed not once, not twice, but three times for a 1030 departure with an arrival in ATL at 1240 am. We’ll see if we actually get out of here tonight. At 600 pm we were given some nonsense story of a flight from Myrtle Beach being delayed so ours was. And we were stuck at the worst airport I’ve ever been in - Miami International. I will never fly Frontier again. If I could give it a 0/10 I would.

### "Will not fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  The flight wasn’t bad. It was annoying as hell that the airline nickeled and fined us for everything. collecting our baggage was awful. It took 40 minutes for our luggage to get to the carousel. Will not fly Frontier again.

### "ended up waiting for almost 2 hours for luggage that never showed"
Not Verified |  My flight from Cleveland was supposed to take off at 9.03pm and land at 11.30pm in Orlando. They sent a text that afternoon saying my flight was delayed and then another that it was delayed again. Got to the Cleveland airport and it was supposed to take off at 10.:04pm. But after more delays on the ground including maintenance issues we didn't leave until after midnight and didn’t land until after 2.30am. Went to get luggage and ended up waiting for almost 2 hours for luggage that never showed. And there were two other Frontier flights waiting on their luggage too and for longer. No one could tell us a thing and other passengers were either trying to find someone for answers or trying to call and find out what was going on. One lone person at the Frontier baggage office who couldn’t tell us what was going on other then she was calling to try and find out. I had to give up at 4am since my ride needed to go home to sleep before he went back in to work. I called Frontier and all they would do was tell me to fill out a claim.

### "unacceptable to overbook flights"
Not Verified |  When Frontier over booked the return flight, as people were checking in, 30 minutes before as 30 people all in line, they announce that everyone missed the flight and that they were rebooking everybody for Tuesday. It’s Sunday morning and we all have to get home and we can’t wait until Tuesday they said there was nothing they could do for us. Really frontier… And you want any of us to fly you’re airline again? It is totally unacceptable to overbook flights and then tell people there’s nothing you can do for them. It is your responsibility to find everybody away home, on another airline, give them vouchers they can use elsewhere to get home, rent them a car. Never flying Frontier again

### "delayed for 4 hours"
Not Verified |  I thought Spirit was the worst airlines, but as of today, Frontier wins that dubious award. After being delayed for 4 hours, we had to wait an hour and a half for our bags to be delivered. Not to mention the fact that they nickel and dime you to the into degree - you want a coke? $3.25. You want a carry on? $57. Want to sit together? $20 per person. It’s insane. Flight attendants were rude.

### "is the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This was my first flight alone. And it was the absolute worst experience ever. My flight was delayed for a couple of hours. And when we boarded and landed in Denver, we weren’t allowed off for almost 2 hours! I ended up missing my next flight because of this. I waited in customer service for 5 hours straight! I was exhausted and so was everyone in line. I finally got to reschedule my flight at 5am. Once I finally got to my destination, however, my luggage did not make it. I have filed a claim and have emailed them multiple times. It has been a month and I have yet to receive my luggage. Frontier is the worst airline ever and I do not recommend it. Frontier was stressful and disorganized and chaotic.

### "Our flight was delayed both ways"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed both ways. On the way to Orlando, said was delayed due to weather, on the way back to Milwaukee no reason for any delay. Worst airline I've ever flown. Don't fly this airline with kids especially, you are going to have a bad time. They make is seem like you save money on low cost tickets, and then extremely overcharge for carry on and check bags. After all is said and done United or Delta would have been cheaper and no delay, spent well over $1,000 for the 4 of us. They also announced they had no snacks and or refreshments available on flight only alcohol because their flight crew were tired from the delay and wanted to leave.They should refund all of us on this flight, extremely disappointing. 0 stars

### "Absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. pricing for checked bags and carry one made absolutely no sense. Uur flight got into Colorado at 11:40 pm and they would not let us leave the plane until 1:10. Never again.

### "Worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever. Flight attendants were picking on every little thing. When booking nothing was ever stated that front row couldn’t keep their personal items. I would’ve planned better or pick other seats. Flight was delayed several times from 12:51 to 1:59 to 3:07 to 3:30 and didn’t take off until 4:00 with no AC. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again. Worst service I have ever received.

### "flying with a more reputable airline is worth the money"
Not Verified |  Every single flight was delayed. They put me on a flight out of Denver at 7am, even though the same flight was available at 1am as well. I paid $60 to switch flights, and unsurprisingly the new flight was delayed so much, I should have just kept my money. If you try to reach them over the phone, you will be waiting for a while. For all the "extras" you're getting charged for, flying with a more reputable airline is worth the money.

### "Shady practices"
Not Verified |  To purchase tickets, you select a flight and then a return flight. Our return flight time selected was an additional $5.36 for the round trip purchase. We received notification our flight time had changed by 6 hours, getting us home after midnight instead of the time we selected for the additional $5.36. We were given no options but a refund. I priced out other airlines and needed to know what the refund amount would be for the last half of that round trip flight. It was $5.36. Not half of the fare. The customer service number never lets you speak to a representative. Shady practices.

### "so stressful and disappointed"
Not Verified |  Frontier canceled my last flight back to Orlando 2 days ago. Tonight, after not showing up to my work, I need to travel and they had delayed the flight twice and changed gates too. Apparently, we will board. It I am so stressful and disappointed.

### "a lot of hidden charges"
It was the first & last time to use the Frontier Airlines. If you think that you got a good deal, you are not. There are a lot of hidden charges that will add to your flight.

### "rontier Airlines has been so disorganized£
Not Verified |  Worst airline in my 30 years of flying experience! Never, and I mean never again will I opt to use this airline no matter how cheap. The saying “you get what you pay for”, speaks truth for this situation. Frontier Airlines has been so disorganized, so unprofessional, they charge you for carry on bags. Our checked bag cost a total of $175 and we had already prepaid $60 online. Our flight was delayed “due to weather” when no other airline was delayed. We’ve been sitting on the taxi waiting to take off since 2.40 and it’s now nearly an hour later. We were told we’re 18th in line and now we’re 25th in line, our connection has obviously been missed in CO on our way to MT so we have no idea what to do from here. They should not be able to operate, this is not a business.

### "This airline is the worst"
This airline is the worst. The seats don't even recline, they charge you for everything. The make us pay for a carry on bag which I have never had to pay on other airlines, they charge you for the water and food. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "unable to depart due to the weather"
We were due to begin boarding at Gate 16 at 3:33pm with a departure time of 4:18pm; however, an announcement came overhead that a tire needed to be changed and they would begin the boarding process in 20-25 minutes. Time passed, then another announcement came overhead that they were waiting for "paperwork" in order to start boarding. More time passed, then yet another announcement came overhead. Our gate has now been switched and we are to proceed from Gate 16 to Gate 10 (apparently switching planes all together). We finally began the "on-boarding" process, sat in my seat and another announcement came overhead by the Captain informing everyone that we are unable to depart due to the weather near the airport causing an even more longer delay. We didn't begin departing the airport until approximately 7:00pm.

### "Never ever will book through Frontier Airlines again"
Never ever will book through Frontier Airlines again. After multiples delays, they cancelled the flight completely. Passengers are handicapped and completely left hanging. They had zero other flights to offer or no hotels, nothing. Traveling with a toddler I will never make this mistake of choosing this airline again. Never.

### "No professionalisms at all"
This was the worst airline I have ever used. It is not worth the small amount of money that you save. 1) Customer service was rudest I could imagine. 2) Everything is dirty. 3) No professionalisms at all. I would say think a lot before you decide to fly with them.

### "Not booking with Frontier ever again"
Not booking with Frontier ever again. In the past I experienced that they changed the flight and changed my from a direct flight to one with stops I got a voucher to flight with them again. In my next booking they cancel the flight 5 hrs prior the fligth and sent an email with the options saying they have 48 hrs to send you a voucher for rebook with them (of course not an option) or that you can rebook with another airline and they will mail you a check 14 days  after (if you use their third party company) or 46 weeks after if you book with the other airline directly instead with their rebooking third party company. When people flight they have plans that needs to be readjusted so not everyone has flexibility to wait 14 days or 46 weeks (ridiculous) to receive the money back. You are pushed to have additional money to pay for flights in case they mess up and obviously you will pay much more as is last minute if you are lucky to find flights. So as you need to have the money anyway to flight with someone else then save you the pain and book with another airline from the beginning, you will save time, money and much important avoid the stressful situation.

### "customer service is ridiculous"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines customer service is ridiculous. Their planes have too many mechanical problems. Thankfully United Airlines were able to get us to our destination. Never fly Frontier!

### "unprofessional, unorganized, and not worth the money"
My wife and I were flying to Las Vegas for the weekend and Frontier cancels the flight 2 minutes before we are about to board the flight. They are unprofessional, unorganized, and not worth the money. I have flown over 100 times in my life and never had a flight cancelled 2 minutes before boarding.

### "As if I'd put myself through dealing with this mess of an airline again"
Not Verified |  Family reunion/Quinceañera trip planned and tickets bought well ahead of time, flights get canceled 2 nights before the scheduled flight without explanation and the customer "service" agent says there is nothing they can do about it. If we want to take the next available flight, it wont be until the day after the party. If we want to fly with a different airline it will have to be completely out of pocket as Frontier said refunds will take 7 days, and not even the full refund. Best they would offer and only after making a fuss was $50.00 per passenger towards our next flight with Frontier. As if I'd put myself through dealing with this mess of an airline again.

### "callus, disingenuous, and uninterested"
I’ve flown frontier a total of 7 times - loyal to them while the flight cost has gone up, as I’m in a long distance relationship. My fiancé living in Charlotte, myself in Denver. I book flights for myself and 3 kids twice a month. Sometimes more. Costing thousands of dollars. I recently had an issue with a transaction, after my flight this past week. I was charged 300$ for a flight from Denver to charlotte. My bank account shows the money came out of my bank account. Frontier says it didn’t. And they won’t honor the ticket price while I was trying to sort things with my bank. They were callus, disingenuous, and uninterested in helping to resolve the issue. I won’t make the mistake of ever ever flying frontier again. This isn’t my first issue with the customer service either. After my flight this passed Monday (7/12) was delayed 2 hours and 45 minutes, customer service wouldn’t reschedule the flight. I had to sit in the airport for a half hour and watch the flight delay again before a very polite woman at the gate finally rebooked my flight for me. And you definitely get what you pay for.

### "not worth saving a couple bucks"
Not Verified |  Never fly Frontier Airlines. It is not worth saving a couple bucks. Be aware if they cancel your flight back they are not responsible for anything. They canceled my flight at 1:15 AM and they’re only response was to give me$100 vouchers. I could not book a flight with them the next day because they didn’t have any flights so I had to purchase my own ticket through another airline. They will refuse to pay for your ticket with the other airlines they refused to pay for wages lost they refused to pay for a hotel rooms or anything else.

### "Frontier is the worst airline"
On the travel day my wife and I were in the airport for check-in and Frontier didn't allow my wife to do the check-in, resulting in us being rejected from the flight. The reason was that my wife has a valid Venezuelan passport and a green card (US resident), they said that she was not allowed to get on the plane with those identification documents. That she needed a US Visa in order to fly. We talked to the manager and in an act of discrimination against my wife they decided to reject her from boarding. There was no more explanation and they were extremely rude with us saying that they couldn't escalate the issue to a higher level because that was the rule. They didn't care about the passenger just because they felt superior not even giving us the opportunity to explain something that is evident, a US RESIDENT doesn't need a US VISA. Frontier made us have the worst time, made my wife feel discriminated just because she was from a country with some regulations, and the worst part, they didn't hesitate at the time of blocking her from boarding and loosing thousands of dollars invested on our entire trip. So we had to run to the airline next door (United Airlines) in order to buy the plane tickets again. Of course United Airline staff was impressed with our story, being a fact that there is no way they can deny a passenger to board with a US Residency and a valid passport. Frontier is the worst airline. I tried to call customer service, and after 2 hours 45 minutes hold I was able to get a refund.

### "I am truly disgusted in how they handled things"
July 13, 2021 at approximately 0700 I was supposed to be on my flight (F9-2878) heading to LGA Airport. The plane ended up having a hydraulic leak which not only kept us on the plane for an hour, but also had a delay. I rebooked a last minute flight with another airline and called Frontier customer service to get a refund being that the flight was delayed 2hrs and 30 thus far, they told me I couldn't get a refund, mind you I was on hold for exactly 1hr 15. I will never fly with Frontier again, I will be emailing cooperate in regards. They are no better than Spirit, I am truly disgusted in how they handled things. I guess it's no lie when they say you get what you pay for.

### "$60 dollars for a bag that fits under the seat"
Not Verified |  The worst flight I’ve ever been on. At this rate, just walk to your destination. The flight crew is rude and no one is on the same page. I was told my pack meets the requirements to fit under the seat instead of paying $40 for a carry on. Next thing I know, I’m boarding & a woman is the telling me rudely that I need to pay $60 for bag all of a sudden. I essentially paid $60 dollars for a bag that fits under the seat and maybe fits 3 outfits. Goodbye Frontier, I would not recommend you to my worst nightmare.

### "the worst flight experience"
Frontier has been the worst flight experience I have had. They canceled our flight and gave no reason for canceling. Then they gave us a new flight from San Francisco instead of San Jose, CA, this is where our original flight was scheduled. We had to drive 3 hours to get to San Francisco! Both of our flights were delayed and we had to wait an extra 2 hours for both flights. Their prices may be cheap but not worth the hassle!

### "I'm still arguing to get a refund"
Cancelled our flight less than 12 hours from departure time. Gave us no vouchers and I'm still arguing to get a refund for the tickets purchased. Hotel stay ended, hurricane on the way, and they just cancelled us and now it’s up to us to force them to give us our money back.

### "We could not get back on our flight"
Not Verified |  Flying From Ontario, To Denver. My daughter, 18, got motion sickness on the 23rd of May. The Supervisor for the shift that day was very unprofessional, rude, non-concerning, and ruthless. We had a paramedic come to check up on her. because. My daughter was so dehydrated, she had not eaten. As the paramedics came, the supervisor who was next to the gate we were getting off at, approached us, in a nasty way. Was not too helpful to the situation, in fact she stated before knowing what was going on that, “We could not get back on our flight and she would make sure of it“ personally. The paramedic who was assisting us says, “ Oh my, I have never seen such behavior from a person who works in customer service". We were told by the lady, we could not get back to our home state, Ohio, until Tuesday, a 17 hour drive. My son's birthday was on the 24th, the next day, On Monday. We unfortunately had to miss it, because of this incident of her telling us we would have to wait 2 EXTRA days and on top of that, having to purchase a hotel! I missed a very important day due to the lack of understanding and communication between her. Motion sickness is very common when being in an airplane, due to the body reacting to varying signals of movement. I had to rent a car for $611.00, Very last minute, again, due to the non-professionalism in the Frontier Airlines, and lack of hospitality. Had to drive over 1100 miles in a vehicle with my daughter for 17 hours to Columbus, Ohio. Everything that has piled on, more and more money is because Frontier couldn’t keep the satisfaction of the customers. The hotel stay was $130.00, the gas was $250.00, food $100.00. The Tickets Cost $350, that weren't even used! I also had to wait for my luggage for 3.5 hours as no one in Frontier Airlines could locate my bags after I was told it would be 30 mins until receiving them. This experience with Frontier Airlines has been a unique one at the least, and this airline would not be suggested to any of my family or friends, or anyone.

### "I’m behind 2 hours already"
Flight was supposed to board at 9:34pm we boarded after 10pm was supposed to depart at 10:19pm we departed after 12pm. Asked for accommodations for the inconvenience was told that I missed my opportunity because I didn’t speak to the Frontier airport staff at the airport. I’m returning from a trip and have to pick up my kids from my babysitter. I’m behind 2 hours already from the delay and they expected us to stop and speak to airport staff at 2-3am.

### "disgusted by this airline"
Not Verified |  Last month I bought tickets for my wife, my daughter and myself to attend my daughter's wedding in Dallas, TX on June 12th 2021. My flight itinerary was to depart from MIA on friday June 11th at 03:36 P.M. and to arrive on DFW at 05:36 P.M. I planned ahead to give me enough time to arrive, leave my things at the hotel and properly prepare for a very special day in my life. However, upon arrival on MIA I was told that my flight was now scheduled to go to Denver, CO, that I would have to find a hotel and pay for it with my own funds and than I would fly from Denver to Dallas; no emails had been previously sent. I asked to speak with the supervisor there to be rudely treated and told that it was my only option and if I was unhappy to look for another airline company. I asked for a full refund of my payment and was told it would reflect in my account within 2-7 business days. I had to buy tickets with American Airlines at the airport and had to spend far more than I originally planned. To worsen the situation I was only refund 2/3s of my original payment and I have been calling their customer service since June 22nd and all I have had is more disappointing treatment. I am placed on holds that lasts hours to be hung up on, when someone picks up the phone I am either transfered and disconnected. I am truly disgusted by this airline.

### "Haven’t taken off yet"
Flight was supposed to take off at 9:15pm, it’s 11:43 pm and we’re still on the plane. Haven’t taken off yet. I will never book with Frontier Airlines again and I advise that anyone who even thinks about booking with this airline please do not.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service (if there is one), booking service, and time-wasting for someone to help on the phone. I booked a flight via Expedia and already paid for it. However, I wanted to add extra leg room and baggage bundle, which would cost me $252.00 for the packaged deal called the Perks. When I reviewed the plan, the charge was $252.00, but after I checked out and paid for it, it was a total of $904.72 because it included the airfare. So, I called the customer service and told them I was double-charged for the airfare, the person whom I spoke with could not understand what I was trying to tell him. So, I asked for a supervisor to straighten out this mess. I was on hold for a few hours! And no one came to pick up the phone. If you still want to fly with this airline, be aware of all the extra charges, like baggage charge BY PIECE!

### "will never fly with them again"
This is my first time with this airline so do with that information what you will. That being said, I will never fly with them again. The flight got delayed and eventually canceled which ok it happens, but they never in the entire time brought the manager out. And the process to get our bags was HELL. Basically all of us were leaving on an 8 am we didn't get our flights rescheduled or canceled until like 2pm and then our bags until 4pm (until everyone got through the line to TRY to get help). Customer service was absolutely terrible they were not addressing us at all. A couple next to me had their flight scheduled and they had a crazy ticket that the Journey would take 2 days more! I was lucky I canceled by phone immediately so I just had to wait for my bags, but even then no one told you were to wait or go, or what to do. It was a nightmare this flight was scheduled for July 02 2021. In the end I booked with a different airline when I got my bag!

### "they’re incompetent and their customer service is non-existent"
Bottom line up front, Frontier Airlines, don’t fly with them. Ever. Why you ask? Well, short answer, they’re incompetent and their customer service is non-existent. I booked a flight to Denver. Non-stop from Tampa. Flight is cheap, until you factor in having to pay for even a carry on. But okay. Flight is cancelled. Due to weather. Again, okay. After exiting the plane all the passengers are told they’ve been automatically rebooked on a flight departing the following day at 12.05 pm. Sucks, but hey, okay. Next morning, flight still not showing up on Frontier Airlines app so I can check in and print boarding pass. Call reservation number. Told that I’m booked on non-stop flight departing Tampa at 12.05. Arrive at airport, stand in long line at counter. Line doesn’t move for 30 minutes. Finally ask about line, told wrong line. Pointed out that would have been nice to know 30 minutes ago and a sign would have been nice. Response is they normally don’t have two lines. Myself and ten other people change lines. Finally get to counter. Told sorry, but the flight I thought I was booked on doesn’t exist. Woman at agent next to me upset because she is told the same thing. Agent acts like she is lying when she explains she was told she was booked on a 12.05 flight. I let them know I was told the exact same thing. Told no flights today unless I’m willing to drive to Orlando and take a flight there departing at 8.55pm. Ask is they will provide or reimburse for a shuttle to take me there. Told to contact customer service for that request. Given phone number for customer service. Call number provided and wait on hold for 40 minutes. Person who finally answers is not real customer service, eventually convince him to connect me to the real customer service. Ask for number. He won’t provide it, but he does connect me. Wait on hold another 30 minutes. Explain everything again. Transferred to another customer service rep. Finally told they can only book the alternate flight, can’t pay to shuttle me to airport. Request full refund. Never flying Frontier again.

### "never book with them again"
Not Verified |  First and last time I would book a ticket with Frontier Airlines. They canceled my flight to Tampa and email me with no reason why the cancellation of flight. I try to call customer service and was on hold for a long period of time waiting to get nothing solved. Terrible airline. I will never book with them again.

### "I wouldn’t even say you get what you pay for"
First off, we flew out of United at Newark, and the terminal was amazing. Terminal in Miami was too small for flight loads, our flight was delayed due to weather and then the crew had to be changed (FAA regulations). The gate we started at was too small, there were less than 30 seats. Our flight was moved to a different gate. I wish I took a photo because it was ridiculous. There were about 2 dozen seats but they were jammed into the tiny space, literally. I mean, the seats themselves were touching so that you were touching knees with the person across from you. The gate waiting area was really only big enough for a small commuter plane, not a big airbus. Zero charging areas, and only 1 wall outlet I could see. My son and I spent our next 3 hours on the floor. The first 4 hours we were at the bar by gate 10 which was fabulous, the food was meh, but the service was great. Let’s face it, I didn’t think I was getting a 5* meal. Sadly, not long after our gate change the bar closed. There was a clear lack of communication regarding the timing of our flight and the reason for delay. Finally boarding the plane, the crew were rushing us as they explain that we can take off faster if we are ready faster. But, they were friendly. We sat with the door open at the gate for 45 minutes while a mechanic came in and out with a clipboard to talk to the pilots a few times. After waiting in a closed terminal for 2.5 hours, the crew was nice enough to offer water for $3. The flight itself was good, no complaints there. Arrival in Newark showed the terminal at the other end of the trip was just as ratty and tiny as it was in Miami. My United flight was about $50 more per person but included snacks and drinks, movies or TV shows and more comfortable seats. Also seats, wifi and charging at the terminal and a multitude of restaurants. (Again, there was none of this at either frontier terminal on either end of our trip) Paid just under $300 for 2 tickets advertised for $50 tickets each. I wouldn’t even say you get what you pay for because the difference in price for the United flight easily offset all the additional amenities which made our travel comfortable and pleasant. Oh. And I’m still waiting on my suitcase. It’s been 2 days.

### "First and last time flying this airline"
First and last time flying this airline! We are waiting in the airport for over 8 hours In Newark for so called maintenance issues, only to be cancelled. While waiting the airline only offered a $10 food voucher after passengers complained. Once the flight was canceled they offered no other flight option other than a week later. How can you strand passengers for a week. Eventually we are given options of refund or $400 toward a ticket on another airline. I won’t even get into the 3+ hours on the phone. I ended booking out of another airport the next day with frontier only to have that flight cancel as well with the excuse of maintenance again. I end up flying out on another airline and am hoping I will get reimbursed as promised. Fast forward to my return flight home- you guessed it. First we are delayed 2.5 hours for maintenance which conveniently turned into a weather delay. The airline lacks any compassion for their passengers. I understand you can’t control weather but three flights I a row had maintenance issues. If the return flight didn’t have maintenance issues we would have left on time and not been delayed for weather.

### "I didn’t get any notification"
Not Verified |  I will never fly this airline again. I got into the airport to check in and that’s when I was notified that my flight has been canceled to Miami, I didn’t get an email, I didn’t get any notification telling me that my flight was canceled. This is one of the worst airlines of the customer services. Please avoid this airline as much as you can, on top of that all the flights were all booked because we were flying Fourth of July weekend, now unfortunately I’m going to lose a day in Miami.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Our carry on tested perfectly in the Plastic test thingy, they so called "ran out" of overhead room and made me pay $150 for a carry on. In actuality they had more than enough room over head, some where even empty. Again they made is pay $150 for nothing. Do not fly this airline.

### "this one right here beats the cake"
They call themselves running a special but then want u pay additional for an assigned seat. You get a deal but not really a deal because of all additional charges. I lost money with in June and so did about 20 other passengers on the same flight and nobody wanted to really explain themselves nor help us. Please pick any other airline but not Frontier - you will be better off riding Greyhound to get to your destination, I’ve tried several airlines in my life but this one right here beats the cake.

### "There was a lack of respect, courtesy, and customer service"
Not Verified |  Before the take-off from Phoenix the flight attendant was very rude to my husband asking him to make sure his mask was covering his nose. I do agree with her statement, but she was not polite or kind, she was loud and rude. My husband changed his mask and we had a normal flight. When we landed at LAX on my way out to the airplane, I was carrying my 1-year-old in my arms and I asked her name and she refused to say, then asked the crew lead in front of the airplane but he also refused to tell me her name. My husband was already outside of the airplane when he noticed our stroller was missing a part, he walked back to the airplane to ask a question and the crew member yelled 'get out of the plane now' passengers were shocked from his attitude and we do have witness’s information. My husband, my mother-in-law, my 1-year-old child and I felt disrespectful by the two crew members. We had a verbal threat by them saying that the captain wanted to make sure we will never fly the airline again. They screamed at us inside the airplane and walked all the way to the airport lobby where everyone was watching and recording the discussion. There was a lack of respect, courtesy, and customer service, both were impolite, and we can consider this as an assault as both verbally threatened us. This is the first and last time flying with this airline and our family have visited over 30 countries and have flew with multiple airlines but never felt disrespected from any airline besides the Frontier flight attendants. Very disappointed.

### "Employees are no help at at all"
Rescheduled my flight twice and the 3rd ticket they gave me had all the wrong information on it then I get ready to board my flight and they say the ticket they printed out was wrong. Now this is the 4th time rescheduling. Employees are no help at at all.

### "This was by far the worst"
Not Verified |  This was by far the worst. Plane was delayed on the flight there and flight back for 1.5 hours each time. On the flight back they left 20 passengers that missed their connections stranded in Las Vegas on a Saturday night with no offer of anything other than a ticket the next day. Problem was any hotel in Las Vegas was well into $300 with taxes and resort fees and a $27 dollar transportation fee to and from the hotel. Even made me pay additional bag fees at the airport. Seems like they are incessantly late on most flights. Even my trip back the next day was 40 minutes late getting in and they didn't even mention it to the passengers.

### "You should be shut down"
Not Verified |  I had a flight for June 28, it was cancelled. I was supposed to go to my grandmother funeral, customer service was poor in the airport and over the phone no resolution to my problem, no one tried to fix it or even cared. They wanted me to pay more money with another airline and they would reimburse me. Who has money to pay for another flight and wait several day to get their money back and only pay up to 400 dollars. I will never do business with this airline again and I would not refer anyone to them. You should be shut down due to your lack of capability to satisfy the customer, I am upset and hurt that I could not make it to my only grandmother funeral to pay my final respects.

### "left my friends and I with no options to get back home"
Frontier canceled my flight 4 hours before take off and left my friends and I with no options to get back home that were within the $300 reimbursement limit through the Airport we came in at. Instead we had to travel to another airport to get home and are still at a loss financially due to this limit. We had additional baggage fees and were spread out all over the plane with no option of seat selection. After calling the airline we were told there was nothing that can be done and to complete reimbursement options online because they do not handle flights over the phone.

### "by far the worst experience"
We checked in for our flight (92) from Cancun to Cleveland, which was supposed to depart Saturday at 2:58pm. Once we were done going through security we got a delayed alert on our phones, but it still said on time on the departure board. We went to the gate our flight was supposed to be at, which was being used by a different airline. I found a gate with our airline (Frontier), no one could give me any information. We kept getting notifications to our phones pushing back our flight several times. Still not a single item of information was shared by an employee. We continuously tried to ask what was going on, because at this point we had been delayed a total of 8 hours. They just flat out ignored us. Then we got notifications our flight was cancelled!!! Still they told us nothing!!! Come to find out our flight wasn’t the only one that got canceled on Frontier. This had been happening for awhile. They keep booking flights even though they don’t have enough people to staff them!!! We then had to take buses out of the airport and back through customs, to a crappy hotel where we stayed for 3 hours only to return to the airport at 3:30am for what is supposed to be our new 7:35am flight. There weren’t even employees to check us in till 5am!!! They dropped us at a closed airport to save some money on a hotel. Then as soon as we all got checked in… our flight was delayed again. For the same reason. It got delayed a second time after that. Now we are still in the airport and it has been almost 24 hours. Not once did an employee give us any information today either. I don’t even think after we checked in we saw a Frontier employee. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a company. They didn’t even offer to refund anyone’s flights either. Definitely lost my business!! !

### "the pilots did a wonderful job"
Not Verified |  I need to be fair with my review. We flew Friday 25th from Fort Myers to Denver and even though the seats are tiny and not comfortable, with no wifi or connectivity and they don’t give you even water to drink (unless you pay it) the flight left on time (8.23 pm) and the pilots did a wonderful job flying through a heavy thunderstorm and brought us back safe and sound! The landing was perfect! Frontier should be proud to have them!

### "not worth the headache"
Saving money is not worth the headache, I booked my flight for Friday to Sunday and on my way to the airport in an uber i received an email that my flight was cancelled with no reason, i was then sent another email that they rebooked my flight (again no info included) i called and was told they refunded. I then rebooked my flight and noticed that they booked my return flight for Monday instead of Sunday, now I'm being told either cancel or don't, customer service is so rude and will not help! nNow i have no choice but to book return flight with Southwest.

### "Horrible service"
Horrible service from top to bottom!! They canceled our flight on the off, and then say all they can do is refund our money! It’s ridiculous I will always bad mouth this airline.

### "Worst experience ever!"
Worst experience ever! Traveling with different airlines and never experienced such a poor management, service and time accuracy. Landed at 6:08 and stayed stuck in the plane until 8:01 pm and still had to wait another 66 minutes for the bags. The crew was begging for no one to accept the cup of water but offered it as “complementary “after almost 2 hours of being in the plane because the gates were closed staying they had very limited water.All you can hear from them was rules and reminders of devices must to be mute… really? And not to stand up. Again not worth it the one way $50 to Orlando. Southwest was $89 for one way bags included and complementary snacks waters and cleaning several times during the trip. This is our last trip with Frontier no even with voucher or free.

### "I spent the 17 hours at the airport"
Not Verified |  Flight from Philly to Raleigh with connection to Orlando was delayed for over an hour, then passengers who had the connecting flight to Orlando had to get off the plane to seek other options. I was offered a direct flight from Philadelphia to Orlando the next morning at 5.49am, which was 17 hours away. After waiting 3 hours to get my luggage back, I inquired about a room for the night, and was advised by a Customer Service rep over the phone that a Ticketing Manager would accommodate, but when I approached the Manager, I was advised that I was given false information. I spent the 17 hours at the airport. I was able to check in for my new flight at about 1 am. Frontier did nothing to help any of the customers who were stranded at the airport for extended periods of time.

### "the worst experience ever"
Most horrible experience and follow up with every customer service was awful. Do not book no matter how cheap. My children were refused flight after we purchased their tickets because of their age. Customer service called me a liar refuse to give us a refund or help us find another flight. Awful terrible. I fly very often and this was the worst experience ever! Don’t book!

### "Not a good airline"
We had 4 travelers in our group (I purchased round trip tickets) and the day before our return flight I checked all 4 passengers in. The day of the flight my son decided to spend more time with family because it's summer. I figured I would just enjoy the 4th seat because he was checked in and it was paid for. I have a 2 year old and with coved the extra space between strangers is appreciated. However, when we boarded Frontier had taken the liberty to assign that seat to someone else. This frustrates me because 1st I paid for the seat and 2nd I had checked all 4 passengers in for that flight. I have contacted Frontier for a partial refund or flight credit and they have never responded. We wont be flying or recommending Frontier Airlines to anyone. This is our 2nd time using them since 2016 when we spent all day at the airport for them to finally cancel our flight because they didn't have a pilot for it. Not a good airline, and the online reviews show that.

### "low level of customer service"
Not Verified |  Had a round trip flight booked. When Frontier cancelled my flight home, they required me to pay an additional $250 instead of matching my original ticket price. Keep in mind, Frontier was the one to cancel, not me. I am disappointed with Frontier and their low level of customer service. Talked with 3 people on the phone and couldn't get anywhere. I will not be recommending Frontier to anyone, no matter how affordable flights may be. It is absolutely not worth it.

### "How do these people sleep at night"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines is the worst airline ever, they have fraudulent business practices and refuse to make concessions for their mistakes. Flight was booked and upon checking in 24hrs before, an email was received about a 2-hour delay that was supported by their website later on that evening. About 1hr before the original flight time another email was received that flight was leaving on time, that was not enough time to get to the airport, as a result the flight was missed and they refused to refund my money. All they offer is a credit though I expressed there are no plans to travel within the next year. How do these people sleep at night knowing their customers are scammed daily?

### "Never will I choose them again"
Arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes early. Baggage check line was enormous. Waited for an hour and 45 minutes. Finally put my bag on to get weighed, they announced that everyone had to rebook their flights. There were flights to 3 different cities, all had to rebook. The next flight was the next day. Ridiculous. Their incompetence caused over 100 people to miss their flights. Never will I choose them again. I went and paid extra to fly Delta. I should’ve trusted all of the negative reviews.

### "the experience was terrible"
Not Verified |  First off the seats are like sitting on a plastic lawn chair. There’s absolutely NO leg room whatsoever. Even when you “upgrade”, it’s not an upgrade at all! The only difference is that the seat color is different. Second, the staff is rude and completely unprofessional. No consistency at all. My husband and I wore the same masks on 3 flights, our 4 flight connecting us home, they said we couldn’t wear them because it had a “vent” even though inside the mask was a filter. They told us we weren’t allowed back on the same plane we just got off of. They also try to sell you on a credit card, while in flight! They do not offer any water with Covid happening it’s understandable, but if you want to purchase a small bottle of water you can do so for $3.99! Even before getting on the flight, booking was nuts. Charged for picking a seat (more for a window seat), charged for a carry on, charged for a checked bag, they wanted to charge me for my small crossbody purse! Overall the experience was terrible.

### "What a nightmare trip"
What a nightmare trip. Absolutely no amenities - no water (without purchase), snacks, too small of pull down tables, no way to charge anything, flight back was delayed by 1 hour and 15 minutes without telling us why until the very end. Branson airport was extremely hot. The only good thing was that those of us with connecting flights could get off first. I barely made it to my connecting flight. A flight attendant made a bullying announcement saying that if we dared take down the mask below our nose, we would be arrested at landing and put on the no fly zone. Excuse me, but how are you supposed to take a drink or eat your own snack, or my grandson stay happy with some snacks? Then the connecting Denver flight ended up leaving late, but arriving on time. At the baggage claim, no suitcase! All of us from traveling from Branson didn't get our suitcases loaded on the Denver plane. There were no attendants at the SLC airport and we had to wait 1/2 hour before even getting any help. By this time it was 1.30 in the morning. My bag had my computer cord I need for work and the bag wasn't delivered until 8.30 pm the next day. I'll avoid Frontier whenever I can. Also, when I called, couldn't get hold of a real person except for the buying a ticket part.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience. You are not able to do early check in on your phone before getting to the airport therefore, you will definetly be met with a massive line. Our line to Mexico was about 1 hr but out line leaving Mexico was about 2.5 hrs. The worst thing was the line was growing so they opened a new line but let about 100 people (that were in back of us) into this new line so people who were in back of line were now ahead of us! The guy who opened the new line seemed to enjoy making everyone upset. Our flight was delayed 3xs ending up being 3 hrs and found out it was because plane had mechanical issues (system going blank and ground lights not working) then when we landed sat in plane for 45 min because they gave our hanger to another plane. The seats don't recline and no snack or drinks. Overall horrible. A would be 3. 5 hr flight with normal check in would of been half a day of travel. This ended up being a full day from 9am to 8pm. Stay clear I think they will sell out at some point. They are over booking with customer service and amenities slashed. We saw a couple crying in another lane as probably going to miss flight. This picture below is before it even got worse

### "front desk were so useless"
Not Verified | Phoenix to San Diego. Imagine flying with this airline and trying to get to your destination at a timely manner. The people at the front desk were so useless at their jobs that they ended up delaying me, costing me the chance to check into my original flight and instead I had to take up a 2nd flight [which would put be back most of the day] Don't pick this airline at all if you wanna get to your destination at all or in a timely fashion.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Frontier is cheap. No doubt about it. However that comes at a cost. First, there was a attendant on the flight that was nodding out during take off and half way through the flight, pupils like pin pricks. Second, I had to reschedule my return flight. I attempted to do this online. Three unsuccessful untempts I try the phone. After 30 min of waiting I get connected to a woman who spoke very little comprehendible English. After a frustrating 20 min on the phone trying to understand what she was saying I asked for someone whos primary language is english. She informed me she was speaking perfect english and continued on. I asked for supervisor, Supervisor called me back after 15 min and informed me of the cost of 236$ to move my flight to Thursday from Wednesday. I advised him of the before mentioned attendant being under some sort of intoxication and informed him after dealing with all of this I wish to just cancel the flight and take my money back assuring him I will never fly with them again. He told me I will be charged a cancelation fee and receive my money back in the form of frontier miles. then hung up on me. Never again, I'll pay the extra for a ticket with another line.

### "the worst airline with the worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst airline with the worst customer service. Do not book this airline thinking you are saving money. They upcharge you for everything. The planes leave early/late and the customer service if a problem happens is the absolute worst. Indian based 3rd party customer service who all have a script and says the same line. Will never book with them again.

### "I guess they're cheap for a reason"
Horrible first time experience, flight was delayed 9 hours and it took 5 just to start sending another plane. Poorly compensated us with a hotel stay and a laughable $100 voucher that has to be used in 3 months, never flying again and would recommend literally any other airline. I guess they're cheap for a reason.

### "the worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  
Worst airline ever! The luggage cost was ridiculous. Our flight was almost 5 hours and we did not even get a glass of water and they said it was because of COVID. However we flew Delta on the way to Orlando and we had full beverage service. If you did want water on Frontier you had to pay 2.99 for a bottle. Seats were the worst and the flight attendants were not pleasant at all. Clearly, they didn’t want to be flying on Frontier either. Without a doubt the worst flight experience I have ever had.

### "Customer service was pleasant but had no power"
I unfortunately had to cancel my flight plans due to an unfortunate circumstance with family. I completely understand the cancellation policy by Frontier however my concern is the extreme lack of forgiveness from Frontier's policy. I decided to try Frontier for my first time in many years and bought the Den membership for $60 along with my flights. Total was $193 and cancelling them cost $120 + the $60 membership (which I couldn't get refunded even though I never used it) leaving me with 13 dollars credit. I wasn't looking for my money back and even thought maybe just giving one of the $60 cancellations as credit to be used for future flights would be good middle ground. Customer service was pleasant but had no power when it came to keeping customer relations. Due to this I will be going out of my way to avoid using Frontier in my future plans.

### "so unorganized and we were disgusted with their staff!"
Not Verified |  Will never ever fly with them ever again! We came to Orlando airport 2.5 hours before our flight. We look and there are thousands in line for tickets. They must have had about 6-8 flights all taking off around the same time! We waited in this line for 2 hours for tickets to get up to the counter to be told that we have to rebook for the next day! Was so unorganized and we were disgusted with their staff. I missed a whole day of work and couldn't get home to see my kid! We had to spend an extra $200 to get a hotel! Plus food for a whole day and night! Plus all the other money I lost not going to work! We call Frontier, they offer a $25 gift card! That is terrible! Never ever fly them! Was the worst experience of my life and I've been through some bad things flying! This topped it!

### "they just canceled it and kept the money"
Not Verified |  I had two tickets roundtrip to fly on Frontier in April of 2020 and they gave me ninety days to use them as we could not fly during covid. After the ninety days instead of just exchanging them for miles they just canceled it and kept the money. Instead of giving me a credit with the airline they kept the money and I got no flight, but they lose a potential flyer.

### "never fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Trust me when I say never fly Frontier. Seats are horrible, no food, no video entertainment and they make money by charging you for luggage when I was told it would be free. Also had to check in my firearm through TSA took it through but it didn’t get to the office, they put my luggage with everyone else luggage which shows they don’t pay attention to safety because it should of been put in frontier head quarters safety room, also they don’t pay their customers any mind, they were focus on conversating with the employees.

### "never notified, can’t get a refund"
We had a departure time for 5:12pm, we arrived 2 hours early and was told there had been a change in our flight time, 6:10am and our plane left 13 hours ago, we were a no show. We were never notified, can’t get a refund, can’t get on another flight, they were no help. Had to get a hotel room for the night and 3 more tickets from another airline to get home. Started looking online and this happens a lot with this company.

### "will never make this mistake again"
Not Verified |  Decided to try out Frontier to save a couple bucks, will never make this mistake again. I've flown for thirty years now and I can not believe the unprofessionalism of this airline. We booked a single passenger flight months ago to fly from Sacramento, CA to Cleveland, OH. Less than twenty-four hours until lift off we learn that the first portion of this trip was delayed nine whole hours and our connecting flight could no longer be met. Been on the phone for over an hour and can't find a single representative who will work with us unless we shell out more money. A simple google search clearly shows flights still available which would bring us from point A to B tomorrow but Frontier will not let us transfer unless we pay another $100 on top of what we already gave them when we first bought the ticket. Disgusting, I've never had an airline demand more money to fix an unexpected flight change especially when the only luggage involved in a single carry-on.

### "That which is cheap, becomes expensive!"
Not Verified |  That which is cheap, becomes expensive! The lack of efficiency, poor communication and ineffective customer service, negatively affects the entire experience. Never on time flights, cherry on top.

### "tell us that the flight has already left"
Not Verified |  They’re cheap for a reason. Customer service is an absolute nightmare! We get to the airport, the kiosk tells us we have to go to the counter to print the boarding passes. We wait over 30 minutes in line- while people are already yelling at the employees behind the counter- just to get told the gate is closed (what gate closes over 2 hours early?!?!). When we ask the manager,  how can this be and why isn’t it on the itinerary, he calls over the next customer and proceeds to motion to us to shoo. Even his employees said they don’t know why he’s acting like this. He ends up printing us a boarding pass and tells us to go see if there’s any seats left. We get to security and they reassure us that the plane won’t leave without us or a rep will come over and try to rebook us, as there’s 2 more people on the same flight stuck at security. We finally get to the gate and they tell us that the flight has already left. We call customer service in hopes to get compensation, only to get told no. They can only refund the ticket. Nothing for the inconvenience or the fact that now we have to find somewhere to lodge.

### "had the most wonderful experience"
I had the most wonderful experience on Frontier Airlines flight 2823 from Colorado Springs to Phoenix. There was an African American female flight attendant who was absolutely delightful. She was extremely nice and absolutely hilarious. She deserves a reward for her excellence at her job. I’ll definitely fly Frontier again in the future.

### "Unorganized, uncommunicative and late without apology"
Not Verified |  You’re better off walking wherever you’re headed, barefoot. Unorganized, uncommunicative and late without apology. Flight to Cleveland people were waived off at the entry because it was a flight to Iceland. Gate said Cleveland, all agents were confused. 1 hour late due to who knows what. On the return flight to Tampa there was a young child in extreme duress screeching, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God for 4 minutes. This young Mother, on Mother’s Day was offered no assistance. The mechanical delay resulted in 9 additional people added to the flight. I took the opportunity to deboard and pay full fare on a real airline to get home. If I could have rated zero stars I would. Truly, this was the last, Frontier. Walk or stay home. Horrific experience!

### "these people are very money hungry"
I booked my flight on the 27th of April, and wanted to cancel my reservation because we ended up renting a car for our trip. The website didnt work at all to cancel, so I had to call. Let me just say, their "first time" policy to charge $39 per person 59-7 days, 60+ days ahead is free and you can only get it free if you purchased your tickets through their WORKS program. Long story short, these people are very money hungry and dont care at all what your situation is. Please read the reviews before you book with Frontier. The cheap ticket comes with all the hidden fee they dont tell you about if you dont read their policy.

### "They are not family friendly"
Flight attendant was rude and slapped my leg to get my attention instead of being polite. She also refused to let me help my toddler use the restroom and expected me to leave my 4-month-old baby on the seat 18 rows back so I could go into the restroom with my 3-year-old. Reaching out to their customer service was a waste of time. They are not family friendly and do not care about passengers.

### "it is absolutely not worth it"
Never in my life have I ever felt this compelled to make several reviews in different sites to speak out about my terrible service! They nickel and dime you, it is absolutely not worth it. If I can give 0 stars and never ever experience this company ever again I will. This was those terrible life lessons that taught me to pay good money upfront to avoid secret fees and hassles. Bottom line, you will end up paying far more than what you were trying to avoid paying. Also for us to be in a pandemic and shoved like sardines next to strangers with no way to really social distance was crazy. How are you going to enforce masks but not all the other rules. Also my friend flew down to meet me and used Delta and his experience was different, they actually gave people space in between strangers for safety measures, something Frontier did not care to do because they are about milking as many people as possible than people's health and safety. Their seats are super uncomfortable. Also unless your bag is a purse you're gonna pay for it. I will absolutely warn everyone and make sure everyone who will travel in the future never uses this company.

### "not be flying with Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Traveling for the first time with our newborn. Upon arrival they told us the flight was pretty empty so we were happy as we didn’t have to worry if our child was crying. While trying to board, the man checking our tickets did not see our stroller had a tag and proceeded to sigh and say “how did you not put a tag on stroller jeez”. After boarding the plane, the stewardess, proceeded to yell at me in front of other passengers, my wife and child for putting my carry on bag in the above compartment which see insisted was too big. This bag had my child medication in case of an emergency and I tried expressing this to the stewardess and she said it doesn’t matter. You can check it or I’ll throw you off this plane. Again, this is our first time flying with our newborn child during a pandemic in an semi empty plane. Our stress was at an all time high. There was also another young gentlemen who was moved to the front after this happened and allowed him to put his huge bags directly in our spots to spite us and laughed about. As a man in business, the way you talk to and treat a customer is everything, especially in front of others. Many people told me I can’t believe the way she spoke to you and your family. We will not be flying with Frontier again and are looking for a different flight for the way home. To top it all off the stewardess parents were sitting right in front of us and proceeded to move them to an empty area of the plane because she said you don’t need to be by a crying baby, this was what really broke our hearts. Flight 617 from Myrtle beach SC to Denver CO.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Will never fly Frontier again. Starting with the prepaid baggage fee of $47 for one checked bag, then the rude flight attendant who upon boarding asked that I pull up my face mask which was covering both my nose and mouth, and then asked again mid flight while I was eating a snack that I brought because of course they don't give away anything for free. The only option of any refreshments was a $3.99 water. If you would like to charge your phone or anything else do it before boarding, frontier doesn't provide that either. The seats are horribly uncomfortable, they do not recline and are nothing but hard plastic covered with vinyl. This was a full flight coming back from Cancun to Denver (4 hour flight), the front bathrooms were not working so everyone was lined up for the rear bathrooms even the captain had to make the walk to the back for the restroom. The flight attendant that was making the announcements was horrible, not only could you not understand most of what was being said,. When the captain spoke he was clear and easily understood. Every time she would speak you could hear many people saying "what language is she speaking", "is she underwater", "is she covering up the mic", "whats wrong with this woman".

### "forced to pay for it"
The worst experience ever. Had a personal item and was forced to pay for it. When I left Boston fine with my personal item. The two ladies working the boarding area was rude and mean! Didn't take the time to listen, all they wanted was $. Already paid for flight and seat, now personal item?

### "paid extra for the perks package"
Stewardess made me place my carry on farther back on the plane even though I was in row 2. Late to get moving, all flight attendants were giving different passengers different answer to questions. I paid extra for the perks package and don't understand what value I got. On the way to my destination I not get preferred boarding and on the way back I was inconvenienced about baggage I paid for.

### "Didn’t honor a refund"
Didn’t honor a refund. I wasn’t able to get my bags checked due to the extremely long lines, so I missed my flight. They didn’t have anything else going out until Thursday. Ended up paying over $500 for another ticket on American flight. Frontier will not comp any future tickets or give me a refund, horrible customer service.

### "Frontier really couldn't care less"
Not Verified |  I wrote a letter to Frontier about how their customer service manager at Denver airport lacks the personality and sympathy for people who have been traveling and waiting at airports for half a day. Also if they are going to change gates on travelers, don't depend on a muffled airport loud speaker to notify travelers of something as important as gate changes. Use the monitor at the gate to notify us of important changes. Other reviewers are correct, based on the customer service manager who handled our situation, Frontier really couldn't care less if their travelers spend the night at the airport. Which we did. Frontier's letter to us stated that they came up "a bit short" on handling our flight with them. Using the words "a bit short" after they changed gates on us without adequate notice is like saying someone on a hunger strike is "a bit hungry". That letter truly shows they have no clue on how to work with the public. Nor do they really care. Well maybe "just a bit". Now is the time to use social media to voice our dismay on this airline.

### "No refund, rude customer service"
I got sick at boarding, I couldn’t take my flight. I was given a refund for the departure flight. When I received my confirmation for the return flight I call Frontier to let them know I tested positive for covid and I didn’t even need the flight due to me never boarding my departure flight. No refund, rude customer service and I am sure they never alerted all the other passengers that they had been exposed to covid.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. I bought a ticket from Miami to Dallas, and to my surprise it changed 2 days later from a 3 hour trip to a 13 hour trip. I had to spend the night in Denver. I called customer service to let them know of this problem and the girl on the phone told me changes happen and that the only none stop flights were the day before or after my scheduled trip. At this point I can trust those flights wont change either. She became very flustered and rude and started yelling at me. So I asked to speak to her manager and said the manager couldn't do anything and that if i wanted to speak to the it was an hour wait. The most you can do at this point is make sure you pay for insurance although i doubt Frontier will accept it.

### "This has been a horrible trip"
Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown. They had 2 delayed (which was almost 2 hours) and left early and did not have courtesy to even announce it.They just said wait, which cost me a lot of money because I missed work time and had to pay for other options as we were stuck in Orlando because the next flight to STT was Friday April 9th which that would’ve been the day we return from St Thomas. (But we never made it there) The chairs are literally chairs; they do not recline at all; they charge $60 for any type of baggage; and do not even give water. None of customer service people are helpful. We have been calling around talking to manager after manager to get our luggage apparently our luggage’s made it to St Thomas but we didn’t. Now I was told by another manager from RDU that they don’t scan their bags in and it’s not showing up in their system that he’s in St Thomas. (Which the manager I spoke with in Orlando said they on the way to ST Thomas.) Moral of the story frontier might be cheap but it’s not worth all these headaches with my luggage and frontier holding there self accountable for their action when they missed up and not even trying to fix the problem. This was my first trip and last with frontier. Now we don’t live in Raleigh so when our luggage is found they will have to send it to us in Virginia. This has been a horrible trip and experience flying with frontier I would not recommend them!

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown. They were an hour late and did not have courtesy to even announce it. They just said wait, which cost me a lot of money because I missed work time and had to pay uber. The chairs are literally chairs; they do not recline at all; they charge $60 for any type of baggage; and do not even give water. None of customer service people are helpful.

### "The worst customer service I have ever experienced"
Not Verified |  The worst customer service I have ever experienced, when we booked my 14 year old sons ticket (unaccompanied) they confirmed it was good to go, waited 20 minutes in line because there were no Frontier workers to be denied because he’s under 15. You have to pay for a carry on which is insane, they basically told us they can do nothing and we’re out of luck, I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "My final cost for this 1 flight is ridiculous"
Not Verified |  I was excited to get away recently and was looking for the best prices. Well I chose Frontier because the initial rate was so good for last minute. However, I have not even got on the plane yet and have had to already add a small fortune onto the "cheapest rate" and I still have to pay for wifi on the plane! My final cost for this 1 flight is ridiculous. When I check the site to see what is included. All they say is "no we don't do that so that we can pass along the cheapest rate for you". Foolish if you ask me. Foolish of me to think I was getting a deal!

### "The employees were nowhere to be found"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible! The employees were nowhere to be found! We weren’t late they just didn’t bother to show up! Got told about other flights that didn’t exist! All of the other airlines were helpful and kept having to page Frontier employees to the check in desk. Finally, we got our flight rebooked (no employee could help us get to our original flight) not even by a Frontier employee! Ridiculous! When we called customer service and asked for the supervisor she simply said “I understand, there’s nothing I can do.” So I had to change my flight and rentals and housing and I have to stay at another hotel with the money that I do not have! Never again will I fly with Frontier and neither should any of you.

### "forced me to pay for extra bag"
I had a 23"x16x10 bag weighing 30 pounds. carry-on at the gate, Paid! The attendant said was too big and forced me to pay for extra bag. I tried arguing that was in the right sizes of my ticket but the table he used was the regular one 22"x16x10. And that downstairs it worked just fine. He got very upset and no talk was possible the value was $110 for my and my husband's bags. I thought was ok to pay and then today call and explain the incident and get a refund or credit. For my shock, nothing could be done. The lady in the phone said: No refund or credit even if I have proof my carry on was the right size. So careful guys because if they decide change the rules at the gate and make you pay more you have no rights to fight about there or at the phone later. My original tickets $85 dollars. What I paid? $370. After all they only want give me a voucher with less then half what I paid at the gate valid for 6 months.

### "voucher for future travel instead of a refund"
I booked a flight through Frontier for June 5th. The flight was cancelled as of today, April 1st, and there is not another flight available on that date between the two cities. I accept that. What I can't accept is that the ticket is non-refundable but the airline cancelled it and not me - and they are only giving me a one year voucher for future travel instead of a refund. How is that an incentive to ever book a Frontier flight again?

### "the worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  This was the worst flight experience I've ever had. Me and my 2 friends were going on a snowboard trip. We missed our first flight even though we were in line, 1 person in-between me and baggage check. And the lady took the person infront of mines bag. But told me it had hit 45ims before the flight and I couldn't check my bags. So they rebooked us (thank goodness we bought the insurance) 12 hrs later. So we chopped it up and dealt with it. Made our next flight. Got to LAX, fast forward 6 days. We get to the Frontier bag check about 55 minutes before our flight. And it was No one there. So 2nd flight missed. We pay $59 each to switch it but didn't know she switched it to another airport. Long story short we made it home 3 flights , 48 hours and $500 extra later.

### "not recommend Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified |  We had our flight all booked with Frontier Airlines in May 2020. Because of covid19 our trip was canceled by the airline. Frontier Airlines would not refund my money instead they gave me points. They also told me that there would be no restrictions on those points. Since then I have tried using those points and I tried to book a flight to Pittsburgh from Charlotte North Carolina and I could only get that date if I paid money they wouldn’t allow me to use points. I would not recommend Frontier Airlines for anything. Actually I have tried several times to book with points and no flights were available.

### "Customer service was horrible no care and no compassion"
Not Verified |  Never made it on the flight. Waited for an hour get to the counter they said they called for our flight. We did not hear, they called on one side of the room and did not bother to repeat on the other side so everyone can hear. No intercom. They said we might have a chance to go to boarding, he did not check our bags so we got to boarding they told us we had to go back to check bags. We missed the flight, they said next flight was the next day. Customer service was horrible no care and no compassion. Gave us a number to call for refund, talk to about three people two were supervisors who told me there was nothing they can do and they did not give refund nor make any accommodations nothing. Frontier Airlines customer service is horrible, the worst customer service I’ve ever had. Would not recommend this airline to no one. When things go wrong they will keep your money.

### "Frontier are experts in lousy customer service and arrogance"
Not Verified |  Never again! Frontier are experts in lousy customer service and arrogance. They did not respond to my email. Ground staff could not care less. The plane was crowded and dirty. The seat gave me a backache, it was so hard with little recline. Found a used napkin/tissue in the seat back.

### "never fly again with this airline"
Not Verified |  up 2 hours early to check in my bag as I had checked in 24 hours prior. I got to Orlando and they lost my bag. Called 3 days later spoke with a supervisor was supposed to get call next day .. nothing. 4th day was supposed to get call from next department .. nothing. Still no bag. Refuses to pay ubers to get back and forth to get new clothes. Who knows when i will be reimbursed. First vacation in 2 years ruined. All money spent on new stuff and cant take time to call. Will never fly again with this airline.

### "the worst airline I've ever used"
Not Verified |  By far the worst airline I've ever used. Had problems with our purchased baggage, wait times, employee attitude, etc.. Currently have been waiting 40mins for an employee at the baggage check in counter. Not too mention only airline that doesn't offer benefits with their services. Pilot is the only one I have no issues with whatsoever.

### "would not let us board our flight"
This airline would not let us declare a firearm at the ticket counter, would not let us board our flight and then blamed us for “being late” (we were there over two hours in advance). A customer service representative cussed at us over the phone. We were stranded in Orlando for hours, never given any compensation even after over 9 hours of speaking with employees and making phone calls. Spent over 600 dollars of our own money to fly with a different airline to get home with no way of getting compensated for this.

### "never had to pay for a Carry on"
Not Verified |  Miami to Memphis. I have never had to pay for a Carry on. Fly Frontier you will. I’ve always been offered some type of beverage or snack. Fly Frontier you pay for $2.00 for water no snack. The seats were uncomfortable, no recline. No WiFi, No way charge your devices no inflight entertainment. The attendant were using most of the over head storage to store the own luggage. The pilot doesn’t keep you informed on anything, and the hidden fees. This was definitely a never again for me!

### "definitely don’t recommend"
Not Verified |  I flew to Atlanta from Buffalo the flight was fine until we landed there was a fight at the front of the plane it got cleared up quick (but still what type of airline is this) but coming back I missed my flight. I got held up at TSA over my laptop. Then i missed the flight granted I was running late, now they offer me another flight same time 7:21am next day with a six hour layover in Orlando. So I didn’t take the flight I booked with Southwest for a flight that left Atlanta Airport @9:45 with a layover In Baltimore getting me back home to Buffalo a hour before my original flight. I called Frontier asking them maybe is it a way they can accommodate the situation being as though they wanted me to sit in a Airport for 24hrs and basically they offered all they could I choose not to take the flight. I will never fly with them again and definitely don’t recommend.

### "I would never use this flight again"
The bags cost $55 each and my carry on was $60. That is ridiculous. I would never use this flight again. I ordered my ticket through justfly.com,. I flew Rsw on American Airlines my bags was $30 each and free carry on. They had me fly back on frontier and it was disappointing and very unexpected and the girls were very rude about the situation about the bags

### "The plane was dirty and staff didn’t hand out any sanitary napkins"
12 empty seats available and they choose not to spread anyone out due to Covid. Staff are  very rude. The plane was hot and they expect everyone to sit on top of each other. Staff doesn’t accommodate anyone for anything. My friend had chewed up gum on his seat and he asked staff for something to wipe it off, they refused to give him anything! The plane was dirty and staff didn’t hand out any sanitary napkins. Plane was supposed to be locked and ready for take off at 8:10pm, instead the plane didn’t leave until 9pm. This airline is the worst that I ever experienced. I don’t even want to give them 1 star.

### "couldn’t be bothered to care"
I bought a round trip with Frontier because it was very cheap and a quick flight (under 3 hrs). My first flight (March 12) went fine, although checking in online was a pain because their website insists you purchase more things. Getting home from Denver has been a disaster because of Frontier. They canceled my flights two days in a row and charged me more money each time to get a new one. Today (Tuesday March 16) I was supposed to fly out at 6 am but got texts and emails saying the flight was delayed until 7:30, then 7:55. So I wait at the gate and miss the flight because they boarded at 6:30 and left. Their customer service reps were very rude from the start and couldn’t be bothered to care. They charged me more money for another ticket two days from now. Do not buy tickets with frontier, they will leave you stranded in another state for a week.

### "the cheap price is so not worth it!"
Not Verified |  Never ever again! First plane was broken and cost us an hour before being moved to another plane which cost us another hour. Got to Milwaukee and could not get to our gate, cost us another hour! Not a drop of water offered to anyone. Do not use this airline, the cheap price is so not worth it!

### "like I was being transported in a cattle car"
Flying Frontier Airlines was like taking a taxi ride in NYC in an old car. The 3+ hour had no Internet, no video screen entertainment, no food and no drinks (with the exception of a bottle of water that could be purchased. I felt like I was being transported in a cattle car. The stewardess/stewards walked up and down aisles making sure passengers mask were correctly on. They gave a passenger a penalty card because his mask dropped below his nose. Pricewise they are cheap, but you get what you pay for. I upgraded my seat and paid $100 more, but got the same seating and treatment as every other passenger. The only reason I would ever fly Frontier again would be out of desperation.

### "some luggage fees you have to pay"
My experience with them is that on the moment that I went to check in on the airport they charge me again for the flight (I paid twice for the same flight) even I showed them my confirmation number and them I call to their customer service department and they will tell me there are some luggage fees you have to pay ($50 dollars) even I did not had any luggage. Don't let them rob you, if you see this message go buy your tickets on another flight company.

### "This airline is absolutely horrible"
This airline is absolutely horrible. This was my first and final time I will ever travel with them. It all starts with how the flight attendant makes you feel. Their was an older lady who was our flight attendant and she was awful. Her attitude was horrible! Don’t have this job if you dislike it so much. Our flight wasn’t packed at all but yet they sat us like sardines. I will never in my life fly with them again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.

### "sit inches from each other after we board"
Not Verified |  The lady at the check in gate threatened to close the door to board the air plane if people didn't stand 6 ft apart. Only to have us sit inches from each other after we board. On the way back my son was told to turn his mask inside out because it was offensive to the flight attendant. The pilot got us there safely, the only plus to the whole flight.

### "the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced"
This was probably our seventh or eighth time working with Frontier within the last year and this last particular time was the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was on the phone for over an hour and a half just trying to get an issue resolved. I initially booked a flight on my app and when it was time to fill out the pay portion the app said it timed out and didn't go through. I then went online to book it again and the second time it went through. When I was ready to confirm the flight I checked the app and realized it double booked the flight, I called within minutes of finding out and got the run around. Because I didn't purchase "the works" bundle when booking it they wouldn't refund me the money. As if I would intentionally double book and spend double the money for the same flight. I spoke with two managers and a customer service rep. I ended the conversation with a manager, I expressed my concerns and told her how great it's been up to this point and still couldn't refund me for the same flight. I will definitely tell everyone I know not to fly with them, and definitely don't recommend the customer service they provide.

### "The most unprofessional airline I have ever flown"
One of the worst experiences of my life. Got to the airport at 9am, had a bite to eat 3 gates away from our gate. Arrived at the gate for the 10.05am flight at 9.48am. The boarding pass said doors close at 9.50am. When we arrived the plane was already shut and headed to the runway. When the Frontier employee came out of the walkway we were obviously in shock and asked for them to let us on, her response “well what time is it?” The most unprofessional airline I have ever flown. After purchasing a $400 one way flight to Las Vegas the Frontier customer service said the flight left 9 minutes early. When we asked for a refund they said “there’s nothing we can do, our airline is non refundable.” Talked with 4 different people and all they can say is the airline is non refundable. Will never fly this terrible airline again.

### "the most unreliable airline I have ever seen"
Not Verified |  The last three times I booked a flight with Frontier the flight was cancelled. Today my wife and I learned of our flight for this Thursday was canceled. How am I supposed to reschedule a flight on just three days notice? It will cost a fortune. This airline is the most unreliable airline I have ever seen in my life. Their additional charges are ridiculous. I will never fly this airline again.

### "Customer service is very poor"
Not Verified |  Customer service is very poor and there is a huge language barrier as far as understanding agents. I called to rebook a flight using my air credit. My previously booked flight was with Expedia. Expedia offers cancel for any reason for a certain time frame for a total refund. I requested this refund within the 24 hour time frame. The agent acted to be very helpful by canceling my Expedia reservation (which I could have done myself and gotten a full refund). She said she was going to just rebook the trip and start over. Well she did rebook but used my Expedia credit and it ended up costing the same amount as what I canceled! She put the remainder of leftover funds on Frontier credit. I wanted Expedia cancelled which would have been full credit card refund but instead I ended up with saving no money and she put the remainder of the balance on a Frontier credit! She totally lied to me and ripped me off. I called back to talk to a supervisor who stated he could not do anything for me. Buyer beware! In this case better to go through Expedia and cancel and rebook yourself or you will not be get any credit card credit but instead Frontier credit! What a scam!

### "Terrible customer support"
Not Verified |  Due to Covid-19, I had to cancel a flight back in April 2020. Frontier would not give me a full refund and instead offered me miles that did not expire - ok, fine. I go to book a flight and realize that if you want to use your miles, you have to pay a miles redemption fee. The fee was the same price as the flight - $75! This was never addressed or discussed when I asked about a refund. I call up customer service and explain my story and the representative transferred me to someone else because he couldn't help me. Spoke to another representative and she basically told me there is no way to waive the fee. In order for there to be a $0 fee is if you book 6 months in advance. Who, especially in these times, plans a trip 6 months in advance? What if I had a family emergency and need to travel pretty immediately? I ended up speaking to 3 different people and all 3 refused to escalate my call to management. Terrible customer support. This is just another way to weasel people out of there money with unnecessary fees. Whenever I use my miles will probably be the last time I fly Frontier.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Today I arrived to the airline 1.5hrs prior to my flight. The line to check in was so long that by the time I finally made it to check in I was told that it was too late and that I would have to catch the next flight at 6AM. We were a family of 7 and they told us we would all be flying back at 6. I noticed that not only was 3 peoples flight were not at 6 but at 2:30 and they had all 3 sitting in separate seats including a 5 yr old child! We call to change our flight and we were told we had to pay over $600 for an error the airline committed on their end. Worse airline ever! Will never fly with them again.

### "The representative was extremely rude"
Not Verified |  Frontier cancelled my flight. I had to fly out another day which caused havoc on my vacation plans. I had already purchased a rental car, booked excursions and booked 5 hotels for my 7 day vacation throughout Arizona. I had to pay fees to make changes, the excursions were $50.00 each to change the date, the rental car increased the price and 3 of the 5 hotels charged me a fee to change the dates. I contacted Frontier explaining that I should not be the one to incur the cost from something they did. The representative was extremely rude to me and said "well you can cancel but you will be charged the normal cancelation fees for doing so". I will never fly Frontier again. I have spoken to others who have had their flights changed as well. I don't see how they can just cancel a flight when people who have purchased the ticket have made arrangements that are non refundable and not offer any sort of compensation for the cost the customer has incurred.

### "we were charged for a service that wasn't provided"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst. We paid up for a front seat to accommodate our 6'3" daughter. After sitting in her assigned seat, a dad behind her asked the flight attendant to make her move, so he could sit next to his kids. Mind you, not toddlers..our daughter dutifully complied with the flight attendants instructions, even though a premium was paid for the roomier seat. Upon reaching out to Frontier customer service, only to learn it's a call center outside the U.S. After 60 minutes and asking to speak to a supervisor, I was transferred 3 times, with the same female individual claiming to be a different person each time. When I checked her on it and asked to be transferred to someone in the U.S. she hung up on me. Frontier wasn't even willing to refund the upcharge we paid for the seat. Simply, we were charged for a service that wasn't provided yet, this "dad" who used the flight attendant to get a premium seat without paying, never again. Their website claims their constantly striving to be better.

### "Never will trust this airline"
Not Verified |  Made us wait 2 hours due to a delay, then told us to exit the aircraft! Ridiculous. Then, we waited another hour just for them to tell us that they cancelled the flight. A waste of a day. Someone said they didn't even sanitize the seats before we arrived. Also, they was additional air conditioning issues and when I looked outside the window they were still tampering with the engine; something was up. Never will trust this airline. No leg room either. The didn't even have a proper line for refund; it was a giant angry mob waiting in the front. Also they collected all our boarding passes for no reason when we left just so they could call out our names to give it to us back, it was in orderly to do that.

### "no guarantees of a refund"
Not Verified |  This airline is a joke. SF just placed mandatory 10 day quarantine in place for anyone flying into SF. Booked tickets less than 24hrs ago because my mom just passed away and now we cannot fly. Frontier supervisor would not refund, stated had to file a claim and stated no guarantees of a refund. I will never recommend or use this airline again. Shame on you heartless people.

### "may not get your money back"
Not Verified |  Be aware, if you book a flight with them you may not get your money back if there is a problem. I booked a flight in spring of 2020 and because of the pandemic the flight never occurred. They kept my $850 and my family got nothing. If you want to run this risk that is up to you,. Don't make the mistake my family made and we have $850 loss to prove it.

### "does not value its customers"
Not Verified |  Paid for an exit row seat which was not available upon boarding most likely due to equipment change. Frontier said they can't refund the difference in a regular coach seat vs. an exit row seat because I had made the reservation on their website. Very poor customer service after trying to get a $23 refund with two agents in the Denver airport and calling Frontier customer service twice. Very poor airline who does not value its customers. Also won't even provide water on their flights.

### "told that it would be $98 to change my flight"
I am writing to convey my dismay over your cancellation policy. I am flying to Denver to see my son on Friday. Today he informed me that he had COVID-19. When I called the reservation representative, I was told that it would be $98 to change my flight. I therefore am assuming that it is acceptable to fly on Frontier even if I may be exposed to COVID-19. After some thought, I’ve decided to go ahead and fly on my original flight that leaves on Friday and come back on the following Thursday. I would like to thank the Frontier corporation to being so open to the idea that COVID is not as dangerous as we were lead to believe. See you Friday!

### "Frontier decided to cancel my flight and not inform me of it"
Not Verified |  I’m currently sitting in a Delta terminal waiting for my flight because Frontier decided to cancel my flight and not inform me of it. The only communication I received after purchasing my ticket and paying my baggage fee was an option to change my flight to a more distant departure and arrival city which I did not want. I show up at the airport only to find myself stuck and having to walk around looking for another way home. I ended up purchasing a ticket with Delta having to pay another $100 on top of what I paid Frontier. Frontier only offered a refund. Thanks for nothing.

### "worst company I have encountered"
I flew frontier to Los Angeles from Orlando and left $2000 worth of property at the airport by accident, I sent my aunt the next day as I was at work . I was so happy when she called me and told me Frontier had it in their possession, however they would not release it to her but took her information down and she told them I was on my way. I was horrified when I got to the airport and the manager told me they had decided to throw it away and to file a clai . I did and they denied my claim. This is the worst company I have encountered.

### "They're just as bad as Spirit"
Not Verified |  I would suggest you not book with Frontier Airlines. The customer service is horrible. I had a supervisor get on the phone and she was horrible. Everyone I spoke to was horrible. They have no empathy for what's going on in the world with a pandemic and beware of the flexible book and waving fees, its a lie! Luckily the flight was only $50 and not worth the headache of the back and forth. Do yourself a favor and book with Delta or American Airlines, just not Frontier. They're just as bad as Spirit.

### "Cheaper is not always better"
Frontier's policy on their website: When you check-in for your flight on our website or mobile app, you will be asked to accept the following health acknowledgment: •You will have your temperature screened by a touch-less thermometer prior to boarding. Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher will not be allowed to fly. •You will wear a face covering over your nose and mouth throughout your journey, including ticket counters, gate areas, and onboard our aircraft. •In the last 14 days, neither you, nor anyone in your household or that you have come in close contact with, has tested positive for, exhibited symptoms of, or been advised to quarantine for COVID-19. •You will wash your hands/sanitize before boarding the flight. I could not accept their health acknowledgment due to being exposed to Covid and having symptoms. I called Frontier on October 19, 2020 to express my concerns of which I was told to call back within 24 hours or on Thursday before flight to receive a refund or credit. I called as instructed on October 22, 2020 to cancel in order that I may receive a credit or refund. He said I would not be able to board the plane due to my situation. I called Frontier on October 22, 2020 only to be told I would be charged cancellation fees totaling some $238.00, that I did not speak to anyone on October 19, 2020, and there was nothing I could do about it. I sent phone records indicating my calls, explaining my situation, requesting a credit meaning I am still paying. I attempted multiple calls and filled out forms online. Remember, it is their policy and not mine. They told me I would need a doctor's signature on hospital or doctor's office letterhead. There is nothing in Frontier’s Quick & Easy Health Acknowledgement about a doctor, a hospital, an anything. It simply indicates I have to accept the following acknowledgment of which I could not do unless I where to lie. I was also accused of not making phone call on October 19, 2020. I sent them my phone records of which they never addressed in conversation. I was assessed a cancellation fee of $238.00 due to their policy not allowing me to board plane, will never fly Frontier; therefore, they lose future business, and I am telling my story to anyone who wants to know about Frontier customer service. By the way, do your homework, and you will quickly learn Frontier is the worst overall airline to fly. It seems they have desire to keep that reputation. I could have easily lied and continued on with my trip. I tried to do the right thing. I tried to be proactive in helping Frontier out as early as possible. Cheaper is not always better.

### "Do not use Frontier"
I 100% advise you to not use Frontier. Due to COVID, I needed to cancel a flight and they only offer an Airline Credit. I try to rebook the flight and use my credit but I have to pay a little more, okay! I end up needing cancel that flight and they ask if I want a whole airline credit or the credit from before and the refund to my CC back to my CC. SO I advise them, yes, I would like that $45 back to my Credit card. I end the phone call that I’ve been on hold for about 30 minutes and get an email saying they did an airline credit? There were no. other. options. but to use that full airline credit that THEY mistaken for the airline credit from before and the $45 from my CREDIT CARD. So I use the credit. I call to cancel the second flight I book and they can’t refund me even if it was their fault for not crediting my Credit Card? Make it make sense. I speak to the “manager” and she continues telling me it was my fault?! Their customer service sucks. You really do get what you pay for. Do not use Frontier. I still don’t get my money back.

### "Frontier would rather keep my money"
I booked a May 2020 flight on 2/25/20. Of course it had to be canceled due to Covid. No refund, only a credit and it had to be used within 90 days! Other airlines either did refunds or allowed the credit to go through the end of 2021 (e.g. American). Not Frontier! Booking a new trip in the middle of a pandemic is crazy. Despite an appeal to extend the credit, none was given. Frontier would rather keep my money than have be back as a customer. I hope this kind of treatment leads them to go out of business. I would do a rating of zero if I could.

### "cancellation fee with no refund"
Not Verified |  I actually didn't get to my flight. When I was on the website purchasing my seats and baggage, the website added another ticket to my cart. I had already purchased a ticket through Travelocity 3 weeks earlier. I tried to remove the 2nd ticket added, was unable to do so. I decided to cancel the transaction and call the airline directly. In cancelling the cart items, the transaction cancelled my original flight I had paid for 3 weeks prior. I panicked and called the airline within 3 minutes and was told there was nothing they could do for me, I wrongly cancelled the transaction and it was my fault. The costs roundtrip of the seat and baggage fees should have been $122.00, but the cart cost was $282.00. In other words, the site added the cost of a second ticket to the cart. The cost of my ticket was kept as a cancellation fee with no refund. In other words, I don't get to fly to see my grandchildren and I am out the cost of the ticket as well from a glitch on their website. This is nothing short of stealing.

### "What a terrible experience"
What a terrible experience I had this weekend with Frontier Airlines. I am well aware it is a discount airline with "discount" seats and amenities. The issue was with them canceling my return flight and then not refunding my ticket or reimbursing me for the new ticket I had to purchase to get home on time. They offered another flight the next day but didn't tell me until 41 minutes after the flight left (proven with emails). Either way, flying the next day was not an option. Even if I could fly the next day, they were not going to pay for accommodations for the extra night. Their response to all this is "We gave you a flight home. end of story. I tried explaining that I had to be home the day I was originally traveling and they basically told me that was not their problem. So No Refund on the canceled flight and No Reimbursement on the out of pocket to get home.

### "We feel it is disgraceful!"
Not Verified |  We will never fly Frontier again! We booked a flight for April 8th to visit our grandson and family in Florida. Obviously we cancelled due to covid-19. They then cancelled the flight I assume, as no one was flying at that time. We tried to book a flight to visit them for November and they told us our credit was expired. We talked to several people at the airline - the last one being a manager. I also communicated twice in an email. I was told no exceptions. We are seniors and can't really afford to repay $474 for flights (as I'm sure most people can't do). I can not believe that under the circumstances of covid they are not honoring the credit. They say they must be booked within 90 days. Who is going to book a flight to Florida in June? That is the last thing on anyone's mind. I see many other people are in the same position. We feel it is disgraceful! They are the cheapest flights but not when you are paying twice. We will probably have to drive which is 16 hours or drive half way and fly. I flew with the airline many times to go to Charlotte and Florida to see grandkids but will never fly again with that airline! By the way, every other airline is extending credit due to covid!

### "They should be ashamed of themselves"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline and customer service. I fly this airline when I need to visit family, use their credit card and belong to their Den Club. I have stopped flying because of COVID. Earlier this summer a family wedding canceled and I was given a voucher for 1.200 for flights I had to cancel due to COVID, this was after they took away nearly $500 in penalty fees during a pandemic. Today, I tried to use the voucher to fly home for a family funeral. I was told it had expired. I spent 2 hours on the phone speaking to 4 different individuals who spoke very broken English and I had great difficulty understanding them. I explained my situation and was repeatedly told, "So sorry, we are not able to help you, your voucher has expired. One woman even blamed me for forfeiting my voucher. I can't even begin to explain how incompetent each person I spoke to was...even the supposed manager. In the end, no resolution. They stole nearly 1,700 dollars from me during a pandemic! They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of people during a national crisis. I looked it up today and Frontier was given a fair share of the $25 billion in recovery money for COVID and they are stealing what amounts to two weeks + of pay from a US citizen who is trying to make ends meet. Their airplanes are uncomfortable, they offer nothing and nickle and dime you for everything from a carry on bag to a beverage. Frontier Airlines should not be patronized by the working class people of our country. They don't care and they have 0 compassion for their customers.

### "I will never fly Frontier ever again"
I bought a ticket for round trip to Omaha from Denver but selected United to go out on (awesome!) and Frontier to come back. When I went to do online check in for Frontier there were no seats for me to select unless I paid additional money. I also didn't catch that I had no carry on (United gave it free) so I had to pay another $46.00 for the bag I put under the seat. Get on the plane and we had no TV, music, or drinks (free on United). I could buy a cheap bottled water for $2.99. My trip to Omaha cost me $38.00 plus $10.10 for taxes on United, included everything - free! My trip back to Denver cost me $ 28.00 plus $10.10 for taxes (?) plus $46 for a carry on plus $29.00 for a seat (didn't want to ride on the wing) for a total of $123.10. I will never fly Frontier ever again.

### "All they care about is nickel and diming you"
Not Verified |  So incredibly frustrated with Frontier Airlines. I’m supposed to be flying with my daughter this week to visit a friend who desperately needs us. I just found out her and her family are sick, likely with COVID-19. We are having to postpone our trip. I was hoping Frontier would be understanding of this. I don’t want to fly with another airline. I simply wanted to push the flight back a week or two until it would be safe to travel again. Out of 5 different supposed supervisors/managers I talked to every single one told me there’s absolutely nothing they can or will do to waive the change fees right now. They simply wanted to cancel my flight and refund me only $100ish out of the almost $450 I paid. One manager asked how I was and I said “Not very good” and his reply was “That sounds great...so here’s the thing” Seriously. I asked if they would prefer for me to go through with the trip, potentially be exposed to COVID and travel back on the airplane, exposing an entire plane full of customers and staff. He informed me my risk of exposing everyone would be low because I’d be wearing a face mask. Every single person claims there is absolutely nothing they can do to change policy, no matter how high you go with the company. They could not care less about the health and satisfaction of their customers or their employees for that matter. All they care about is nickel and diming you, taking your money. I understand I did not purchase The Works package. I understand there are normally change/cancellation fees. What I do not understand is there not being any exception in the midst of a global pandemic. This company should be incredibly ashamed of themselves for having a total lack of compassion and empathy for humankind, their customers, and their employees. I rarely wish ill upon anyone or any company, but I truly hope with everything in me that your company completely goes under if you choose to continue on a path of having zero compassion and empathy. You can take my money this time. I’ve learned my lesson. I don’t care if you offered a lifetime of free airfare right now. I will never again make the horrible mistake of flying with or paying another penny to your sorry excuse for a business. I’ll pay whatever it takes to fly through an airline that will actually take care of and care about their customers. To the employees of this company who are stuck under shoddy management, strict scripts you must adhere to and horrible work conditions, you deserve better. I hope and pray you can find your true worth with another company.

### "This is the worst airline"
Not Verified | This is the worst airline I have ever traveled with, the customer service is essentially non-existent, during this time of the pandemic some expectation of leniency and empathetic concern for people should be at the least the bottom line . They cancelled my flight and my voucher was over 90 days so they won't budge to make it up ... we are still in the middle of this tragic pandemic so to schedule another flight is unrealistic and not fair in any sense. In these times it is important to be civil and open to change and go the extra mile, give the extra effort to help people in need.

### "They are cheap for a reason"
Not Verified |  They are cheap for a reason. You'll make up for it in add ons and horrible customer service. I was also unable to cancel my $90 flight because it fell within the 60 day non cancelation policy. Was charged $76 and given a $14 credit which I will never use from them. There are much better user friendly cheap airlines, I get it times are tough but don't charge potential customers for services not rendered when I ordered by mistake and canceled within minutes, talked to customer service who said "sorry its our policy. Well my policy is not flying with you anymore.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified | Worst airline I have ever booked with! Had to cancel a flight due to a national pandemic. They gave me a credit instead of my money back. Booked a flight again for a later date mind you flights were cheaper so I lost $400 because the credit was one time use. So the new flight I booked was canceled, I once again asked for a refund but no they have to give me a credit for the flight again. Hands down the worst customer service I have ever experienced

### "Beware of this company"
Frontier Airlines is known as a deeply discounted airline. We have flown Frontier a couple of times, and have found the customer service to be non-existent, the seats to be terribly uncomfortable, and very cramped. Our family flew across the country on an overnight flight, and the cabin crew were very loud in the back, laughing and carrying on all night. There was no consideration for the passengers. None of us (including 4 young children) were able to even doze at all, even though it was the middle of the night. At that time I swore that I would never put my family through that again. However, when the opportunity arrived to take my family across the country again, I stupidly relented when the flight prices were so cheap. I told myself I could endure because the price was low. Come COVID-19. Our plans were cancelled, the world was in a mess. We were out of jobs, and our event in Florida was cancelled. I cancelled my flight with Frontier, assured that I would get my more than $800 full credit fur use within 90 days. 90 days? Who is going to be able to travel within 90 days? Travel restrictions abound, and I am a nurse. I am unable to leave the state or I will not be able to come back to work. So where am I going to go? I didn’t know what to do. Later, I got an email that stated in the subject line (exact words) ”Now use your travel credit to book through 9/12/21.” And the first thing in the body of the email was “Schedule extension! Now book through September 12, 2021.” There was nothing in the email to differentiate when the travel actually had to be booked vs. travel. I honestly thought it was a booking extension until Sept 12, 2021. I was relieved because I thought that Frontier was finally coming to its senses and following industry standards for issuing credits good for more than 90 days. However, when I tried to use my credit today, I was denied on the basis that it had expired by nearly 3 months and I was just out of luck. I was on the phone for one hour and forty two minutes and the answer was always “policy is policy.” Frontier sent out a (deliberately?) misleading email and now is keeping my $800+. They have stolen my money. I did my due diligence to try to use this within the time frame that I thought was given to me. The fact that Frontier just does not care and has no qualms about stealing $800 from well-meaning customers, tells me that it is a company not worth dealing with ever again. Beware of this company. Their good prices are not worth the discomfort, bad service, and all- around dishonesty. Don’t be fooled as I was.

### "told my credit expired in June"
I book a flight with Frontier in January for a March before Covid hit. I was advised to cancel my trip. So i did. A few days later Frontier canceled the flight. I was told I could get a refund or "mileage" for my unsure flight. I was later told I "voluntary" canceled my flight so I was ineligible for a refund. Then was told had 60 days to reschedule my flight. The whole country is shut down at this point. Received another email stating my 60 days would be extended until September 2020. So here I am.. trying to book a flight,  was told my credit expired in June. No refund. No flight credit. No mileage credit. Was told there was nothing they could do. I spent $500 on plane tickets. Was then told I could receive a $50 credit... wow... thanks.

### "my 90 day credit expired"
I had to cancel due to Covid shutting Florida down and received a 90 day credit - not nearly long enough with Covid still being an issue. Not even a day after I cancelled my ticket, Frontier cancelled the flight altogether and issued a full refund for the other passengers. Since no travel is happening right now, my 90 day credit expired. When I inquired about extending it so I could still use them as an airline they informed me that because my cancellation was "voluntary" I am not entitled to any sort of extension. They should be extending grace and better communication during this pandemic. I will not fly with them again unless they make it right and refund me my money.

### "was put on hold multiple time"
Not Verified |  Airline has passengers pay extra for assigned seating. Then changes the seating. Called customer service and was put on hold multiple times - hung up on by two customer service personnel and a supervisor. I will pay extra and double my flight times to fly with a different airline.

### "received poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Had to cancel a flight in April due to Covid. The travel credit expired after 90 days. Frontier sent an email offer to convert the credit into miles. I then clicked the link to accept the miles. Apparently, it never was accepted on their end. So I called Frontier and they were unwilling to work with me. They refused to provide the miles promised since my travel credit expired. So basically I paid $300, couldn’t use the credit in June because of travel restrictions, then lost an opportunity for the miles, and received poor customer service. Will not use this airline again. Very upsetting for the average consumer during the pandemic.

### "I didn't get what I paid for"
Not Verified |  Scheduled a trip for April to Mexico. We booked Frontier for the flight home. COVID happened and Frontier had to cancel the flight home. They told me they could either provide me with a credit or reschedule the trip. We decided to reschedule the trip. Frontier cancelled the flight again, they rescheduled it, this time with a layover. Annoying, but whatever. Then 2 weeks before the trip, the flight gets cancelled again. I call and ask if they can put me on a new flight. They say the next flight is a day later. This doesn't work for me because I do not have a place to stay for another night. I ask if they can give me a refund. They say they can credit my account. How is account credit going to get me home? I need a refund so I can rebook my flight the day I need to come home. They say they cannot provide a refund back to my direct deposit because apparently I had paid for this trip with a voucher. This trip was rescheduled because they cancelled the initial trip - that's why it was paid for with a voucher. On top of that, they told me a refund to my direct deposit wasn't even an option in the first place and that my only options were to take a voucher or reschedule. I paid an extra $60 for Frontier's "The Works" insurance, which is supposed to refund me in case something like this were to happen. Now they're saying that doesn't apply. Now, I do not have a flight home from Mexico, I lost $600, and I don't have the money to pay for a flight home. I didn't get what I paid for, and they refuse to give me my money back. I've called several times and no one can help me. Every time I call, they hang up on me. Not only have I wasted my money, I've wasted my time.

### "a disgrace to the industry"
Not Verified |  Legitimately the worst airline in the entire world. I’ve been to 40+ countries and never have been treated this poorly by the customer service of an airline. They are attempting to keep $650 in airline credits from flights that were cancelled during Covid. I cannot wait to watch the class action lawsuits put you out of business. I will attempt to contact the airline 1 more time before pursuing them legally. Frontier, you are absolute garbage and a disgrace to the industry.

### "she wouldn’t refund my money"
Not Verified | I booked my flight for 2 passengers over a month ago to attend a concert in Las Vegas. Due to COVID-19, it was postponed until next year. I ended up moving up our travel times a week to better fit our schedule with our children. The new flights I chose were from CVG to Las Vegas 8/14/20 – 8/17/20 (I even have the screen shot I sent my companion to verify the dates before I hit Confirm Changes. Once I did that, I paid the difference for the changes. We arrived at the airport almost 2 hours before our flight around 1:44pm local time. It was when we were checking our bag that the attendant noticed our tickets were for the day before 8/16/20. He said it was ok because we were within our 24-hour window and could change the flight to the next morning (6am) at no cost. While he was trying to get the tickets to process, a message kept popping up that wouldn’t allow him to proceed. He said that was weird and brought over a lady to look. She didn’t know why it wasn’t going through either. They both told me that the airline has a 24 hour policy that there is no additional fee for a changed flight and didn’t know why that was happening and both said just to purchase 2 new tickets and call and get the refund the next day when I was home. We were getting close to the plane boarding (and still within the 24 hours) so I agreed to what they told me and paid $454.20 for the 2 tickets and $55.00 for the checked bag. I would have NEVER paid that much for a flight I had already purchased and would have shopped around even if it meant staying an extra day or two as we get free rooms at hotels. We almost missed the flight as well because the lady who sold us the tickets (same one who told us we would get a refund when we called the next day spelled my girlfriends name wrong, even though they had her driver’s license to print the ticket. We had to run back to the desk from security to have her put the correct name on the ticket. Yesterday (8/18/20) I called Frontier and spoke with a lady who was very hard to understand but the part I got out of her was she wouldn’t refund my money and I should have read the companies policies. I told her it was their companies’ employees who should know their own companies’ policies and provide the correct information to their customers. I was calm during all of this and just asked if I could speak to a supervisor. She told me it would be 3 hours after they got off a call and one would call me back. A supervisor, who was even harder to understand, said her name and other things at the beginning of the call but I couldn’t decipher what she was saying. I reiterated my conversation with the last representative, and she kept telling me the same thing and I kept telling her the same thing 2 Frontier employees told me. There were no raised voices or yelling and she hung up on me while I was talking. Under normal circumstances I could understand a policy where they wouldn’t refund tickets due to a missed flight. However when 2 Frontier employees tell me it’s their companies policy not to charge an additional fee for switching flights within a 24 hour period and I’ll get a full refund, that’s where I have an issue.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified | I missed my plane in Las Vegas on a Sunday and Frontier had no other flights to my destination until Thursday. I was forced to buy another ticket to Denver and then another ticket/flight, I chose Southwest, to St. Louis. My mother is 84 and was in the hospital the weekend before. My son chose to marry in Vegas. I am on medications I couldn’t do without and did not have enough to make it to Thursday. Frontier could not accommodate which forced me into buying another ticket which forced me into another flight. I will never fly Frontier again. And the only beverage they served was water with my bag of pretzels.

### "lack of professionalism"
The flight was empty; nothing else the back was full of row 32, all piled up in time of Covid-19 back and forward was empty; when we told him that my daughters suffer from dizziness and if it was possible to move to the chairs in front, first they did not accept and they said through the speaker that the chairs in the front are allocated for those who paid more for the service, they said it in a way cheeky Then I stopped and moved to the front chairs and immediately they called me and told me to return me to my purchased chair; until after a 1 hour delay sitting down they agreed for the people to move, it seems to me a lot of lack of professionalism to deal with the public in that way.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. Frontier turned my trip to Missoula from a 6-hr (with DEN layover) into a 16-hr overnight in the DEN airport. After waiting on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour to seek a refund, I was only issued a credit that I must use within 90-days. In the post-COVID world, this does not suffice. I will never attempt to fly Frontier again!

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Horrible customer service. Horrible business. Frontier cancelled our flight and then rescheduled us twice from a direct flight to a 6 hour layover in Denver. I have 4 children so that wasn’t going to work. Spent 3 hours on the phone attempting to request a refund since that is not the flight plan we booked and paid for, but they refused. Now we are stuck with a flight credit that has to be used within 90 days or we lose the money all together. Frontier is the most immoral and unethical business I have ever had to deal with. They are robbing from people who were forced to cancel their flights, who have lost jobs and family because of a pandemic that we have no control over. It’s not right. I was blown away by their inconsideration and lack of compassion. I will never fly this airline again, and I will discourage anyone I can from flying Frontier also.

### "I am denied a refund"
Not Verified | I booked Frontier airlines for my trip to Cancun as they had great spring break deals. Not knowing the current pandemic would cause multiple borders to close for safety the airline company canceled this flight which was totally understandable. My flight was for March 30th 2020. I spoke with a first customer representative to get a refund for it which is one of two options she gave me, the other a flight credit. On the phone she said she will get my file to the refund department and that it might take some time. Now 4 months later they have emailed me saying my flight credit expired and that I am denied a refund. This email was very confusing as I never requested a flight credit in the first place and find it very upsetting that no one tried to contact me or explain what was going on. So still I am trying to speak with their customer services to understand why I cannot get a refund. Do not book with frontier. The customer service workers told me different information and now costed me my whole flight's worth.

### "customer service is also garbage"
We should have done our research before purchasing tickets to the “worst airline in the US”. Our trip was cancelled due to the pandemic and they only have 90 days to rebook a flight. But who can do that, as we have no idea if anything would be open and when. Do we buy hotels and risk not being refunded if we have to cancel? We tried numerous times to call the airline and couldn’t get through, and today my husband got through and was told since it was past the 90 days we lost our credit. They could have easily let us book, especially because their customer service is also garbage and we couldn’t get through.

### "no refund I forfeited the money"
I booked a flight on Frontier Airlines on 2/14/2020. I had to cancel due to Covid19 on 3/24/2020. On my confirmation email, it said I had until 6/20/2020 to rebook a flight. Frontier no longer has direct flights out of Msp except to Denver. I tried calling customer service at 15 times before 6/20/2020 and every time it would say "due to high call volume....try again later. Goodbye" Today July 20,2020 I finally reached someone and I asked for a refund because they no longer have direct flights out of Msp. Customer service told me I was too late and I forfeited my money. I asked why customers Frequent flyer miles don't expire anymore because of Covid19 but I can't get my 216.80 back? He said no refund I forfeited the money when I didn't call by 6/20/20202. I tried explaining to him I called more than 15 times. He just said there was nothing he could do. I lost the money. It is unacceptable that they get to keep the money. Yet if you have frequent flyer miles they eliminated the expiration date of them.

### "never fly Frontier again"
They are refusing to credit back a COVID related cancellation even though I went through proper channels to try and cancel ahead of time. All customer service #s were busy at the time and I could not get through to even hold for someone. They didn't even credit half of my flight cost back. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "told that they denied my refund"
I had gotten a credit for my cancelled flight in March 2020 (originally booked with two people)- I was told it needed to be rebooked by June 2020 to use the credit. I rebooked a single person flight before this time. On June 12, 2020 I go to the airport early because I was unable to check in on my phone, I went to the desk and the attendant told me that since I originally booked my flight for 2 people they were unable to issue me a ticket with my credits and asked that I pay for the ticket again that day.. needing to catch my flight I did, just to be told at security that my name was on that flight twice. When I called to get a refund I was on customer service left on hold then told to file a complaint on line, couldn’t even explain what happened because they only allow 100 words for your compliant description. Then a week later I was told that they denied my refund because the credit expired on June 2020.

### "my flight was no show"
They really have the worst service ever. So I should have a trip to Miami on 3 July at 12:42. I  arrived in the airport with 50 min before, i was trying to do my chack-in by the machine and didnt work, after i went to the front desk, where staff pass my card to buy the baggage. After it, in the last second they said to me i could not going anymore. So, because was not my mistake i  asked refund about my trip, i was 20 min with the girl in the front desk to make this request, after this She said you are good to go, the whole trip will be back to your card and also your baggage. After 4 days, nothing came back, so i called to them and an agent said to me, Your money will be refund in 7-10 days. After 10 days I called and a telemarketing attendant said that it couldnt be refund because my flight was no show. Very bad service. Until now even my baggage money that is $55 was refund... And in the end i lost $225 for them, and was not my mystake.

### "never use this company again"
Not Verified | Terrible Company! I had to cancel my first flight due to Covid-19, when I tried to re-book online the travel credit did not work over the website. Therefore, I had to re-book over the phone and the agent did not make it clear that if I didn't use the entire credit on this one phone call I would completely loose the remainder of the money I had already spent!! When I called back later explaining the situation (that I was supposed to have $320 left over) they refused to refund my money, I wasn't able to use it in any way, and they wouldn't even let me speak with a supervisor or manager. The agent even hung up on me at the end of the call. On top of that, every agent on the phone has had a thick accent and has been hard to understand so that doesn't help. The way I see it, they've stolen $320 from me and they refuse to make it right, even when I was told by their representative that I would be able to use this money in the future. I will never use this company again if they even survive through this pandemic. I would be surprised.

### "you will not receive a refund"
Not Verified | Buy the insurance. If your travel plans are canceled due to a global pandemic, you will not receive a refund and you must use your travel credit within 90 days. Works out great when your original plans are postponed a year. The customer service reps are rude and will refuse to let you speak with a supervisor.

### "was denied boarding"
I am shocked with what has happened to me. My flight was schedule to depart 9:40PM with gate closing at 9:25 PM. I had done the checK- in and got to the airport at 830PM. I had scanned my ticket at the security check point, so they knew I was at the airport. What happened is that I was at the wrong terminal. I had flown frontier several times and assumed I was in the right terminal, but they had transferred to a different place. I ran as fast as I could and arrive at the gate at 9:25 and was denied boarding because they close the gate 3 min earlier -  the staff probably wanted to go home and didn't bother to wait and I had checked in. When calling the support they said they couldn't do anything because it was a 'No Show' even I telling the entire story. Never  again I will fly with this disgusting company.

### "they said I had lost my money"
Not Verified | Frontier has a policy due to COVID that you have to call back in 90 days to rebook your flight if you cancel. In those 90 days my family members got infected with COVID and I couldn't call the company to rebook my flight I had clearly other priorities in my life. The expiration date was June 20th. When I called on July 4th they said I had lost my money $1,605. How can a company be so unhearted and not understand that from March till today our lives have been flipped upside down!! Our country is still struggling with the wave of disaster of this virus yet Frontier is seating very relax just taking people's money away in a time like this. If they wanted to help they would had but they didn't. If they wanted to help they would had refunded the money from the beginning and not deal with expiration dates but they didn't. Be aware that there are companies out there doing this just like Frontier.

### "I am shocked and frustrated"
Our booked direct flight on 23 July of 5,5 hours was changed without my approval or confirmation to a non-direct flight of 14.5 hours! So because Frontier cancelled our direct flight, I wanted to cancel the flight without any cost. I tried to phone them, but it is disconnected all the time. I am from the Netherlands, Europe and I am still not allowed to enter the USA because of covid-19. So when I got a email (below) yesterday from Frontier with my name and booking number and that I could cancel my flight and I would keep the full amount of my tickets for new tickets I did. Then I got a confirmation email of the cancellation that the fee was 316 dollars and they took it from my ticket price! How is this possible. They send an email that I could cancel! I am shocked and frustrated!

### "not want to give me my money back"
Not Verified | I have had Frontier Airlines  make changes to my flight 10 times and I’m not even exaggerating. I had originally purchased 5 nonstop round trip flights max 4 hours from NY to Cancun I have kids. They have now been changed to Philadelphia airport because there is no availability in NY on my departure date. The rep even wanted me to pay 200/ticket difference. The times have changed multiple times and are now connecting from Philadelphia to Denver back to Cancun not to mention these are overnight flights. The date of my arrivals have changed completely. They do not want to give me my money back. I would run far far away from this company.

### "Would not recommend Frontier"
Was pushed into cancelling my flight during Covid 19. They wouldn’t give me a refund to my credit card even thought people from NJ weren’t allowed into Florida . In the end they did cancel my flight but still would give me a credit. Wanted me to use the credit in 90 days but Covid 19 still going on. When spoke to them on phone got disconnected several times after half hour wait then was told not able to speak to a manager. Would not recommend Frontier to anyone. Very shady airline.

### "Never more I use Frontier"
Two tickets lost in Frontier Airlines, they don't answer the phone, in one i cancelled supposedly they should deposit 30 dollars for apologizing, never money back for my son, it's ok these things doing. Buy my tickets week before day my flight is changed, but other ticket in other airline but Frontier one day before confirm my tickets try call and send email but nothing. Never more I use Frontier.

### "took advantage of so many people"
Had a trip scheduled for March which was canceled due to covid-19. Was given a credit which had to be used in 90 days. Because there were no flights and or the country still locked down my credit was expiring and was told they would extend it but I had to wait until the day it expired. That day couldn't get through phone system just shut me off and said that call volume was too high. After many failed attempts I finally got through after 5 days and was told they couldn't extend because it was expired and they would not renew. Now this is a service I paid for and did not get but they don't care. They have zero care for customers as I'm not the only one with this exact same issue. I once felt this was a good company but now their true colors shine and took advantage of so many people during this situation we are all in

### "experience has been a nightmare"
Not Verified |  I have three issues with Frontier airlines. The first is that when I was exposed to COVID a few days before a flight, they would not issue a full refund to my card despite the unique circumstances the virus has created so I was forced to lose several hundred dollars and cancel a flight. Also they gave me a partial refund and held what they did give me so I had to use it at Frontier. My second issue is their lack of customer service. When I did try to use the funds for another flight, they charged my card for the flight I booked but their website bugged out and I received no confirmation about my flight besides my card being charged. All of their phones are disable so I had no way of reaching anyone so I had to dig through their website to find a link to file a complaint. It took 2 weeks to get a response from anyone there and all they did was say the bare minimum and send me my confirmation. My final issue is now that I have the flight confirmation 2 weeks after I booked it (remember they immediately charged my card and took my money) its not what I booked. And my flight is in a week. I tried using their website to change the flights but it keeps logging me out and is making it very difficult to change anything without a hard confirmation of what I am actually changing. So now I'm stuck with the flight they decided to give me with absolutely nothing I can do about it because I can't wait 2 weeks to get an email from customer service and can't get anyone on the phone to figure it out. I cannot stand this airline and this whole experience has been a nightmare. I am going to make sure everyone I know hears about this because this is absolutely pathetic.

### "Frontier refuses to make it right"
Not Verified |  Was flying from Orlando to San Diego back in Nov 2019. Boarded the planE and sat on the runway for half an hour while maintenance came to check out an issue. Cool, they are fixing the problem. Maintenance left and we took off. Cool, they must have fixed the problem and sent us safely on our way. I'm going to sleep. Wake up 3 hours later to learn that we have been flying in circles over the gulf of Mexico this whole time because the problem wasn't fixed and we needed to burn gas to land back in Orlando. Took them 4 hours to then find us a place to stay, rebook us and provide us with a voucher. Not too cool, but they took care of us a little. The voucher provided required me to book a flight by May 2020. Then COVID hit, and I couldn't plan on traveling anywhere. Surely Frontier would understand this and extend the expiration date of my voucher. Wrong! It doesn't matter that I literally couldn't plan on booking a trip between February and July, since I didn't use that voucher by May I lost it and Frontier refuses to make it right. We have seen companies do amazing things to ease the impact of this pandemic. Frontier is not one of those companies. If Frontier is one of the airlines that makes it through this, I won't be giving them any more of my business.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever. It seems like a cheap and good deal, but you will end up paying the same (if not more for another airline). The customer service is so bad that you might as well book with someone else, or risk losing money. bought a ticket back in February of 2020. The price seemed reasonably low so I bought a ticket. I ended up spending more than I would have spent flying with another airline, after my baggage and seating. I was fine with all of this (my fault for not knowing) but, after March everything got worse. My flight was scheduled in the middle of March right after everything shut down for Covid-19. They said that we could change or cancel our flight for free. First of all, there is no way you can get a refund back onto your card (you can only be given credits to buy another flight). They only gave us 3 months to reschedule our flights, which is very hard to do not knowing when everything will open back up due to corona (Every other airline, gives you at least a year to reschedule). They only had flights scheduled for sunday and thursday. When I finally got in contact with someone, they said that they do flights day by day so more flights may or not be available. I could not fly on those days and by the time they finally would have other flights available, my credits would have expired. On top of that if a flight is more than your past flight you have to pay extra (understandable) but a flight reserved a year in advance should have been that expensive! Secondly a flight that is cheaper than your available credits can not be refunded, so you will still be losing money. I finally decide to reschedule my ticket a week before I lost my credits, and the website didn't work. The line is always busy (sometimes it just beeps and hangs up. It says customer service is open until 12am, but when I called later that day they claimed they were closed. Called the next day, after finally bypassing the robot and talking to a real employee, they hung up in my face before they the line could connect. The next day it asked me to do a survey if I was over 50, when chose the option saying I was not over 50 they hung up in my face. Called again and the same thing happened. Every time I called after that, the wait was over an hour and 30 minutes. I finally talked to someone just for them to say they could do nothing because the site was down (All that time wasted). When I finally did talk to someone who could help, they made me try to book a new flight over 3 times (on my end) before they finally told me they would do it from their end with no $25 fee. My boyfriend tried to do the same, but they keep telling him that he has no credits left. He hasn't bought any new flights and he cancelled his old flight a day after me; meaning he should've had a day longer than me to reschedule (according to their 90 day policy). This place is a scam. We've spent over twice as much money than expected. I feel they are trying to make up for the money they lost during quarantine.

### "I will never book with them again"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight along with my three children and my parents for spring break. A total of 6 tickets. I had to cancel due to the covid thing ... they gave me 90 days to book another flight, where other airlines were giving up to two years. I went to book at my deadline time and of course the flights were a lot higher then I previously purchased! So they were trying to eat up my credit and then make me pay more to book the same flights for the following year. That by itself is wrong . I went to book and saw that I had no miles .. now that is strange since I even have their credit card. I thought possibly I could book and eat up the rest with miles. I called their customer service and sat on hold for over an hour to automatically be transferred to an answering machine. I left my name and number and of course no phone call back. I tried again the next 2 days. Now here I am on the phone again for the 4th time and it has been exactly 1 hour and 12 minutes. I did get a booking agent (of course!) and come to find out I had 2 accounts? All of my miles were on the other account. Now they are saying that my credit of 6 tickets is gone .. that in my mind is stealing! I paid for those and was trying to book but can not be on the phone all day long  to talk to someone! I will never book with them again.

### "What good is a credit if I can't use it"
Not Verified |  Due to COVID-19 we cancelled our April trip to CO. I was issued a Frontier credit and given 90 days from the cancellation to us the credit. Fine we fly Frontier a few times a year to visit our daughters and family. So 2.5 months later I'm trying to book on line a flight for Sept. When I enter the information to use my credit it says it doesn't exist. Have been trying for 2 days to get to the airline customer service. The recording states if having issues with an airline credit to try again as the issue has been resolved. Not true...doesn't work. Waited on line for 2hrs and finally reached a cust serv rep. I explained the issue but she went forward with making the booking for Sept over the phone. When she quoted me the price I said I am a Discount Dent member for which she proceed to tell me I have to book on line for the discount. For which I again explained that is what I am trying to do but the website is not recognizing my credit, which I previously explained. Upon which we were discounted! I had given her my phone number at the beginning of the call to call me back if we were discounted. Surprise, no call back and I am again holding for a representative. I'm sure the customer service is overseas and works from a script. If they don't have a script for your issues they don't know what to do! What good is a credit if I can't use it!

### "neither compassion nor understanding"
I received an email from Frontier a month before my flight was supposed to take off saying that I should proactively cancel my flight to avoid any extra fees. Frontier knew that they planned on canceling flights but in order to avoid giving passengers a refund, they told us to cancel the flights ourselves. I canceled for the same reason everyone else has been, because of COVID-19. Frontier issued me a credit and said that I have until June 2020 to use. I have no intention of traveling this year and probably not next year. And it is not fair that they get to place these restrictions on customers. I've been on the phone with them for about a month trying to get either a refund or to have that credit expiration date extended to the end of 2021. But they refuse and say that they can't do anything about it. Airlines should not be allowed to get away with this. I understand the current state of the world and that everyone is hurting. But customers shouldn't be exploited and tricked as a result. Now more than ever we need compassion and understanding. Based on my conversations with Frontier, they have neither compassion nor understanding.

### "Do not recommend to anyone"
Had to cancel due to pandemic. Frontier will not give a refund and has awful customer service. Stuck with a voucher that is about to expire. If I book for next year the tickets are 400 dollars. Do not recommend to anyone.

### "I promise you it will be my last"
On 5/27, we booked our hotels and booked our flights to Vegas using our frontier credit code on the Frontier website. I printed out my itinerary and went about my business. On Monday, (five days later), I get on my frontier profile and it says there are no flights found. I called customer service and wait on the line for one hour and twenty-five minutes before I get someone. They tell me my reservation isn’t there and I have to rebook online, or they will charge me a fee! At this point I am irate! Why would my itinerary print with my flight info and it not go through? Instead of being charged for a rebooking fee, I go online and the non-stop flights in question are not even available. They were either cancelled or changed. Not just that but the only flights that are available are double what I paid! I call Frontier again and this time wait on the line for one hour and forty-six minutes. The customer service representative tells me that a lot of people who received credits haven’t had success rebooking their flights and that she would waive the rebooking fee. Then proceeds to tell me that they won’t honor my itinerary or prices from my original booking. Four round trip tickets from Nashville to Vegas had originally costs $404.80, they were now going to charge me $828.00 (flights that were non-stop). The representative then put me on hold to talk to her superior. Once I was put on hold they hung up and didn’t call back. This would be my first experience flying Frontier and after all this mess, I promise you it will be my last!

### "they won’t refund me"
After my first flight with them they robbed me by charging twice to check my baggage. When I disputed it with my credit card I lost and had to pay 180$ to check my bag which should only be like 50-60$. Then my trip to Disney world was canceled in March 2020 because of the pandemic and they won’t refund me. The seats don’t even go back and no tv on seats . If I could give 0 stars I would, I wouldn’t even give them 1 star.

### "under no circumstances recommend Frontier"
Not Verified |  I would under no circumstances recommend Frontier. They tried to change my outgoing flight that was booked a month in advance to a flight that had an overnight layover, when I called to fix the situation, I was on hold for over 30 minutes before I spoke with a woman who then informed me that the returning flight was also not available (there was no email or notification prior to this) and would have to be changed to a different day (which would conflict with my work schedule). When I started to respond to her she hung up on me. Currently on hold again for over 20 minutes so far. Wish me luck.

### "good customer response"
Newark to Ls Vegas via Ontario. Had a flight booked for June 13, Frontier changed the flight date to depart on June 12 and routing to be via MCO with a 7.5 hour layover. Contacted customer service via email and refund processed within days. Happy to receive good customer response and speed at a stressful time. Will definitely consider Frontier for my next internal trip in the US. This is part of a multi leg trip booked for June which may or may not go ahead - visiting from UK.

### "Will never travel with them again"
Not Verified |  Houston to Orlando with Frontier Airlines. Book a flight for April and was not able to make it due to the shut down. Would not refund or extend the credit past 90 days. I'm a Respiratory Therapist and there is no way I could even think about taking a trip in the next 90 days. This is poor the way this big business is treating everyone in this time of uncertainty. Will never travel with them again.

### "refused to give a refund"
Booked a flight with Frontier (first time flyer with them), the corona virus hit, so we canceled our fight, then days later they canceled the same flight. They refunded my outgoing flight, but wouldn't refund my return flight. When I requested a refund, they refused to give a refund, I talked to managers, supervisors, and they refused to give a refund and said we had to use our credit within the next 6 months! Who is going to fly during this pandemic over the next 6 months. Just ridiculous! I'll never fly frontier or recommend frontier to anyone.

### "not recommend Frontier Airlines"
Not Verified |  I was highly uncomfortable on the flight, seats were not comfortable, ride was not comfortable and to make matters worse I took my camera on the trip and had it in baggage claim when I got to Arizona and open my bag my camera from was there but not the lens I searched all through out my bag no lens to be found my $600 lens was gone. I filled a complaint through the website that had me jumping through hoops asking me questions that had nothing to do with my lens and when I called the complaint line they tell you you can talk to someone - then when you hit the option to talk to a representative they tell you that line is no longer available to go online to file a complaint. I waited days for a response and all I got was an email stating that the are working on finding my item. I do not and will not recommend Frontier Airlines.

### "will never use them again"
Not Verified | West Palm to Newark. I tried to get a refund for a trip scheduled on April 27. The customer service representative was so nasty. They only offer 90 day voucher. I will never use them again. How do we know what the next few months are going to bring? She’s said no refunds for a pandemic. Horrible airline.

### "Frontier will not give me a refund"
I bought tickets to Vegas in Feb 2020 (before everything was shut down). We all know everything is shut down at least until 30 April. My tickets were from 17-20 April. My show tickets were canceled, my hotel has been canceled, but for some reason Frontier will not give me a refund. They are only offering a credit which expires in 90 days. This is a worldwide pandemic! I have no control over what’s happening in the world so why are you keeping my money when everyone has lost jobs! I will never ever buy another flight from Frontier!

### "able to get a full refund"
Not Verified |  Miami to Denver. I woke up this morning to find out my flight for a trip in June has been changed by a day (originally Friday-Monday and now showing Thursday-Sunday). I was shocked to see an airline change a flight by a whole day and then double checked google flights to see if the original flight plan was available; and it was. So I was confused why Frontier would swap me out to a whole new schedule for no reason. I tried calling for 3 hours and finally gave up and read reviews about not receiving any refunds for flights and getting credits for 90 days. With the pandemic going on, I was shocked and scared I'd be done in too and stuck with a $300 flight I couldn't take. I finally called again this afternoon and  I ended up being able to get a full refund for the trip. I wouldn't believe every review! I don't deal with anxiety about finances well and I was totally proven wrong once I was on with a representative. I can't even get a full refund from American Airlines for my trip I cancelled with them but Frontier gave me one.

### "I will never use Frontier again"
Philadelphia to Las Vegas. I have been on the phone with Frontier probably totalling 10 hours trying to get my money returned. Everyone I have spoken to have been completely rude and unwilling to help. From the first time I have spoken with an agent to now, this Covid19 has only worsened and has my husband currently out of work. Which leaves us with little to no money scrambling. The trip was for my 30th birthday and due to an actual pandemic, this was stopped. Your organization is representing heartless tactics and feels like many people are being ripped off. I am currently on hold and wasn’t even informed I was being placed on hold. The agent clearly is frustrated and tired of having to deal with conversations like the one I had with her today. In which is understandable. I will never use Frontier again.

### "customer service is horrible"
Not Verified | Minneapolis to Denver. The airline is borderline brain dead. Their customer service is horrible. Put you on hold for an hour only to disconnect and have you call back and get in line. The switch dates and don't fulfil their commitments. I learned not to fly these guys. In my opinion, you should pay standard fair as these cheap freaks are one of the worst dogs of the airline industry.

### "never received any responses"
Not Verified | Islip to Atlanta. I have unsuccessfully attempted to receive a refund due to canceling my flight for a FL vacation due to COVID-19 outbreak. Frontier customer service would not issue any refunds. Emails were also sent and never received any responses. Filed complaint and Frontier still would not provide a refund, the only option is to book a flight within the next 90 days. Amid the current situation in the USA, potential job loss and child with lung disease I do not plan on booking flights and going on vacations anytime soon. Frontier could careless. Terribly disappointing and I will never fly with them again. I need my $$ back to pay my mortgage.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | Bismarck to Los Angeles. Absolute trash. Due to the coronavirus, I had inquired about canceling my flight for safety reasons. They stated to me that they could issue a credit to my account that but would need to book a flight within 90 days. Due to my location Frontier only services my airport Jan-May. I explained that I would not be able to use my credit within 90 days due to the airline not servicing my location. The operator on the other end stated, “not my problem you’ll just have to drive to the next closet airport that we service.” The next closet airport is 7-hours away from where I live, so I am basically out of $450 because I physically cannot book a different flight due to them not servicing my airport. Absolute worst customer service and they are taking advantage of every customer they have. I will never fly with them ever again and I hope anyone reading this chooses a different airline.

### "Will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Indianapolis. We arrived 2.5 hours prior to departure as recommended. The flight was delayed multiple times and ultimately cancelled 30 minutes prior to the original departure time. I understand this can happen with any airline, and has happened to me on other airlines as well. The difference with Frontier was the extreme lack of customer service. I was traveling with a family of 5 with young children and the staff had no regard for this or any compassion for the situation. We were not offered any sort of compensation for the inconvenience and with no assistance from the airline staff, we were able to get on a flight to Cincinnati (~2 hours from home) and rented a car to drive the remainder of the way. Frontier could not switch my luggage over to the new flight, they lost our gate checked stroller somehow, and cost us an additional $100+ with the rental car. I paid the money I "saved" with Frontier in rental fees and a new stroller. You may save some money with Frontier and it may work out from time to time, however, if anything goes wrong with the flight do not expect any assistance from the airline or the staff! Horrible experience. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "beyond disappointed"
Columbus to Orlando. I inquired about canceling my flight as the president has announced national state of emergency due to Coronavirus pandemic. I was told that no refunds will be given to anyone and only a credit will be given. I’d have 90 days to book another flight with Frontier or I’m basically out of money paid. The supervisor I talked to on the phone hung up on me and didn’t bother to call back. I am absolutely offended that Frontier does not put the interests and safety of the public ahead of its profit margin. Very poor business practices! Frontier is not part of the solution, but part of the problem. The health of its passengers is clearly not prioritized. I am beyond disappointed and will never fly with this airline again.

### "they hung up on me twice"
Not Verified |  I had a trip planned for April 6,2020 til April 10,2020 well we are in active military and my husband got a official letter stating that he is on a flight restriction till further notice, I tried to call Frontier to ask what are my options as soon as i mentioned the flight restriction to customer service they hung up on me twice. I shouldn't be punished due to an worldly epidemic i am trying to find out what is the protocol or even what to do so i am not out of all the money I spent on these tickets.

### "Frontier has taken advantage of us"
Not Verified |  My husband and I were trying to access our tickets via phone and accidentally ended up canceling out booking from Phoenix to Chicago. What we didn’t realize was this: while most corporations are providing refunds to their clients during this period of fear and uncertainty, Frontier has preyed on and taken advantage of theirs by failing to do so. Because we spent most of our money on booking a flight with Frontier in the first place, having to RE-book another will very likely be the reason we can’t feed our family this month. I am so appalled that Frontier has taken advantage of us like this and that we have lost so much money from a simple user error. I am disappointed that, after trusting this company, it turned out to be so dishonest and parasitic. I would hate for this to happen to anyone else and would strongly discourage any of our friends or family from putting themselves at risk for this same situation by booking with Frontier.

### "nothing, not even an acknowledgement"
I know this is a no-frills airline and pricing reflects that. You pay for everything, including a seat (price quoted for a round trip is without a seat, which you need to pay for and if you want to move seats later, pay more again). So, knowing all this, decided to fly again, and now with the Coronavirus hitting, I wanted to delay my flight - the website for Frontier is not user-friendly. I spent hours booking and reviewing and trying to navigate the website - so I wanted to see if they would change my flight to a later date - I went to a page that talked about cancellations, but when I hit the button to go to that page, it was an actual cancellation and no warning, bam, done, lost all but $12 and change for a future trip - rip off - will never, never fly this airline again. I emailed them with my concern, nothing, not even an acknowledgement that I was a customer, take the money and run.

### "charged $79 to cancel a trip"
Not Verified |  The president announced national state of emergency due to Coronavirus pandemic. The very same day, Frontier charged $79 to cancel a trip this month. I am deeply concerned that Frontier does not put the interests of the public ahead of its profit margin. I am very sad to say they are not in this together as are the other airlines. Very poor business practices. Not part of the solution, but part of the problem. The health of its passengers are not prioritized. Very disappointed.

### "declined to be ticketed"
Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Denver. When I arrived at 4.45am an tried to check in for my flight I was told I had to be at the airport an be checked in two hours in advance of the departure. I was in line with five other people who which all was declined to be ticketed to be able to go through TSA. The was a lady who cut in line while we waited to speak with a manager an was given her ticket and was able to board the plane.

### "$50 for bags really small"
Miami to Boston. They make you pay $50 for bags really small. I had to pay 50 for a very small bag a the woman in front of me also for a children bag! This is organized scam. I will never fly with this company again. They make you think it’s cheap but in the end you get to pay more than a regular company with, in addition, a poor service. Even if you travel with no bags do not ever take this company.

### "he was the rudest person"
Orlando to Dallas Ft Worth. Spoke to a customer service representative about a question I had regarding my flight tomorrow , he was unknowledgeable and unhelpful in the situation, to put it softly he was the rudest person I had ever spoken with on the phone when asked to speak to the supervisor because he was literally yelling at me on the phone he stated “we don’t have supervisors here”. Then when I asked if I could speak to anyone else he stated “ I don’t want to transfer you you’ll just have to call back” . By the end of the call he didn’t even answer the question I had, I always choose Frontier to fly as it has the best service and the best prices but after this phone call and literally being yelled at by someone who is supposed to represent this company I’m not sure if I’ll ever want to fly with them again.

### "just said I was too late"
Not Verified |  Raleigh to Atlanta. Horrible customer service. I arrived 30 minutes before my flight in Raleigh more than enough time to make it to my flight, there was no line in the security check in. The lady refused to print my boarding pass, she just said I was too late and nothing she can do.

### "the ticket had been flagged"
Not Verified |  We arrive for our flight from Atlanta with conformation in hand only to be told the ticket had been flagged but no one knew why. They tried to call someone for 3 hours and in order for the 3 of us (only one ticket was flagged) we had to purchase another ticket we did because we were going to a medical appointment we couldnt miss the flight. They charged 1000 for this ticket. We get to San Diego to fly back home and they sold us a one way ticket only. We had to pay another 800 to get home. They want to give us a 200 voucher as an I’m sorry. Except we haven’t been refunded the original ticket we purchased that was flagged. We paid 2600 for a 800 ticket. We have called for 4 days and when we don’t get hung up on we are told someone will call back. But they never do!

### "I really enjoyed our trip"
Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Atlanta. Like others, I was also suspicious about the quality/comfort of this airline's experience. I made my research before our flight (me, wife, and a 5-year-old) and I had mixed reviews, and there was one outstanding blog post that was very helpful (a positive one, I need to refer him, can't find now). First, you are paying cheap so be prepared and mindful about what they are agreed to. so don't act like, "oh, they stopped me to pay for my cabin-luggage!". You can't get a better experience with this price in any other airline. This flight from RDU to ATL is the best (I didn't expect them to have entertainments et al here, I didn't pay for them), felt way more comfortable than seats that can be reclined. It is only an hour+ trip though. On-time departure landed earlier than scheduled, technically strong (a bumpy journey due to weather, they aced!). I really enjoyed our trip both ways. I won't ask more! Con: I can't comment if they cancel a trip of ours for any reason and ask you to get refund and take another plan. I would seriously think about this if I am making a serious or important business trip!

### "a no re-book airline"
Not Verified | Sarasota to Philadelphia. Frontier airlines suck. Besides the disgusting nickel and dime fees on the front end when booking. Now they just stranded my family in FL at the last minute. Emailed a cancelled flight 4 hours before it was scheduled to leave. No text or phone call so my people had already headed to the airport. No plan for getting them home at all. Apparently it’s a no re-book airline so you’re on your own if they screw you. No money for a hotel. No plan. Never ever going to fly this airline again!

### "not be flying with Frontier again"
Tampa to Buffalo. Horrible. They lost our $300 car seat that was with our portable high chair in a huge bright red bag .. how do you loose that!? Not only that, they did nothing but submit a claim at the airport, and made us wait (over an hour!) just to tell us they can’t do anything. They didn’t have any car seats for us to use as we’d need to cross back to Canada, didn’t put us up in a hotel for the night. Not worth it. Called the number, all they’re doing is reimbursing us for checking our bag, and they did end up finding our stuff but is only being shipped Monday. Not worth it, will not be flying with Frontier again. Spend a bit more for a better airline.

### "my last Frontier experience"
Denver to Charleston. A full month after I bought my tickets, which I chose both for the price and because I wanted a direct flight, I was notified by email that my return flight had been changed. They now wanted me to leave a day earlier and spend the night at the Cincinnati airport. Completely unacceptable. They are in the process of issuing a refund but I had to find a return flight on another airline and pay double what I had budgeted. This was my first and will be my last Frontier experience.

### "airline canceled the flight"
Not Verified |  I am not one to leave a negative review unless it's absolutely terrible. Now, I understand that things happen. Planes, like all technology and mechanics, have issues. But my first flight with Frontier was delayed an hour and I found out from a frequent flier that Frontier is prone to delays all the time. This did not give me much confidence in my return flight home. And with good reason. After waiting in the airport for three additional hours passed my departure due to a mechanical issue, the airline canceled the flight. I believe that definitely could have been determined much sooner and the passengers could have been told earlier (heck we were even told that we would have to wait an additional hour before being able to change flights without additional charge) . We were told to return to the Frontier desk at the airport to book another flight a bit early (ok, cool) - maybe I'll get home tonight after all - only to find out that all of the flights for the following day were booked solid, leaving over a hundred to frantically find their way home. And no, Frontier was not going to add any additional flights. I understand that this could happen with any airline, but this wasn't handled appropriately and now doing my own research with this airline, I've certainly learned that Frontier is an unreliable airline and this happens frequently with their flights. I will not be booking any new flights with this airline and strongly urge others to fly with a different airline. Frontier may be affordable, but you get what you pay for.

### "They have gone downhill"
Not Verified |  Phoenix to Denver with Frontier Airlines. Absolutely terrible. Never again! Understaffed at the check in desk. They charge you for every little thing. They forgot everyones luggage that checked a bag for the flight. We had to walk outside when the plane let people off and then go to the baggage office to find out how to retrieve our luggage. They have gone downhill!

### "Fly any other airline"
Charlotte to San Francisco via Las Vegas. Airline is rude and doesn't respect customers and won't acknowledge own mistakes to avoid paying refunds. I know a lot of people write reviews about bad food or not enough leg room or complain about delays. The real issue is when a flight takes off without being announced, ahead of time, and when confronted the representative reply without a sliver of respect for us customers and the little money we pay that sustain this airline. I flew from CLT through to SFO through Vegas. The first flight was ok. The layover was an hour and that's fine. I was within 1-2 minutes walking distance from my gate and when the flight was taking a bit too long to o board I went to the gate to find 9 other people arguing with the representative at the desk. Turned out the flight left and all of us just didn't have common sense to listen to announcements according to the lady at the desk. She also said we can't get any flight the same day and no refunds. They claimed that they did multiple announcements and that we didn't care to listen. Please do yourself a favor and don't fly Frontier. Fly any other airline that values you as a human not as a few non refundable dollars.

### "Wouldn't recommend this airline"
La Guardia to Orlando. Had a horrible experience with this company, first and last time I'm traveling with frontier airline. Due to lack of professionalism we missed our flight, there was no one at the gate directing anyone to board the plain, no announcements whatsoever. The gate was being shared with two other airlines, when asked around on what to do next I was told to report to the frontier chek-in desk,having to exit all gates just to find myself to an empty table and no one to help me. When calling the company for assistance on what to do next the only option given was to pay a no show fee (although I was at the gate the whole time) and was told to pay $119 fee and the flight difference which was an absurd amount totalling up to over $1,000. I was told there was nothing else that could be done. Of all my past travels I had never been more undervalued as a customer. Wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone. No help was provided whatsoever, had to purchase tickets from a different company and spend twice on what was rightfully mine.

### "I missed my flight"
Sioux Fall to San Diego via Denver. Frontier Airlines boarding crew at Denver airport sent me to the customer service for paying checking bag fees. (Customer service area was just beside the boarding pass area) There was no communication between boarding crew and customer service desk. Because of their miscommunication mistake I missed my flight. They asked me $119 booking fee for the next flight. They told me there is no option to waive the booking fee for the next flight. These people are not for business. They just want your money, that’s it.

### "disgraceful airline"
San Diego to Phoenix. If I could give this airline a 0 I would. The worst experience from check in to flight. I get to counter and told there is a $55 dollar fee for a small carry-on. And their reasoning is that’s how they keep their prices low! (Meanwhile, I flew to San Diego on American paid the same ticket fare did not have to pay for carry-on and I was late they changed my ticket free of charge and they served beverages). Then I get in the plane ask the flight attendant to please help me just reach overhead to place bag due to my abdominal surgery he literally tells me he’s not supposed to but he will this time, but next time I need to check in this small carry on! What next time never again flying with this disgraceful airline! And they don’t offer beverages! All the attendants did the whole flight was walk up and down with bags collecting trash. I don’t get how these people stay in business.

### "12 hour day of travel and we have no luggage"
My fiance and I were traveling from Chicago  to Orlando Feb 14th returning to Feb 17th. For starters our flight out was scheduled for 11am, when we arrived to the airport from the shuttle at 8am we were told that the flight was delayed until 1:52pm. I have the app and checked in on my way to the airport in the shuttle and I was not notified of the delay, hence we spent our entire morning / afternoon in the airport. After finally getting on the plane to leave we were told there was technically difficulties with a plane which is why we had to wait for one coming from Vegas, mind you our flight was half full 10 hours before we left because I checked and magically we are in a full flight, which leads me to believe they said screw it and pushed two planes together because there was a couple of different times for departures that day all going to Orlando (obviously caring more about business than there passengers). After arriving at MCO at 5:30pm we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for a good 30 minutes before even having a gate to get unloaded at. We finally got to the baggage claim at 6:15pm (our day started at 6am) which is crazy considering this was a 2 hour direct flight; we waited and waited, about 45 minutes after watching 2 different planes shoot out half of their passengers luggage we were told Orlando was short staffed and that Chicago's plane would be about 2-3 hours before we got our luggage, talk about a what wait moment. Finally at 8pm roughly we were all told to go to a different carousel were luggage starts coming from Chicago and what would you know, our bag is gone, nowhere to be found. I panicked, we were told to try to check number 7, 8, 6, and 10's carousel, again, another wait what moment. So at this point, after a 12 hour day of travel (we had a 2 hour direct flight) we have no luggage and the representatives and workers you look to for direction are less than helpful. We are told to fill out a claim and given 1-800 numbers for references with a claim number. I was told it could possibly be on two planes tomorrow (Saturday) and then given a direct line to the frontier luggage office and was promised someone would answer and if they are busy to leave a voicemail because someone is always there. After 3 voicemails to the direct office and 3 calls to the 1-800 number I attempted the direct office for a 4th time and someone answered, 24 hours in to our bag being missing they STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS which is just wild to me. We were there for a work conference for myself and had two nice days to indulge which were spent finding Lyft's to the nearest Walgreens and walmarts to put ourselves back together which really was just a bummer and time sucker and not close to cheap. Our days consisted of walking up and calling for updates to get false promises and finding an outfit to be ready in time for thr work events, we didn't even swim. The airline refund our checked bag fee each way which I had to ask for. We also were able to bring one carry on each to get our newly bought clothes home. We were given $100 dollars a day which is a joke for two people to buy clothes, toiletries, make up, bags to put our items in to travel home from Orlando, and not to mention the Lyft's. P.S. we are going on day 5 and still have no location of our bag.

### "completely unprofessional"
Not Verified |  Miami to Newark. My family and I have exclusively flown Frontier for years and I have very seldom had a negative thing to say. However, today’s flight experience has unfortunately changed my perspective. The plane arrived slightly earlier than expected and we boarded in a timely manner. I always suggest priority boarding because the perks of getting to your seat before the crowd is worth the few extra dollars. The aircraft was clean and overall I was satisfied when boarding. However, the enjoyment of my trip was immediately disrupted by the actions taken by one crew member. While having a discussion with a fellow passenger, I was approached by the flight attendant. He informed me that the demonstration for emergency information was going on and I needed to pay attention. I was unaware that my conversation was disrupting the other passengers from the presentation so I quickly apologized and waited for instruction to be done before resuming. Things ran smoothly after that, descent was near perfect and I was content with my experience. It wasn’t until the beverage cart came around that I can say I had an issue. Although airplane beer, wine and spirits are somewhat overpriced, I tend to pay the extra money to relieve some stress from travel. When ordering my drink, the flight attendant proceeded to tell me that I could not be served and that boarding an aircraft “while intoxicated” was illegal. He seemed to have made that unwarranted decision based on the incident prior, having nothing to do with my actual blood/alcohol level. As an adult, a Frontier frequent flyer, and a paying customer, this incident should have never taken place. To assume someone is incoherent without any knowledge of the situation is absurd. After I had willingly apologized for not realizing his demonstration was taking place, I felt as though he was basically reprimanding me and to assume someone is intoxicated over them making an honest mistake is by far an overreaction and completely unprofessional. My colleagues, my family and myself will no longer be flying Frontier. We will choose a different airline that treats their patrons with respect. I’m embarrassed to know such a profitable company would hire someone who would take personal offense to a passenger not giving them their undivided attention. I fly multiple times in a month and have never experienced such a thing. I will be recommending Delta from here on out.

### "Worst flight experience ever"
New York to Atlanta. Worst flight experience ever! IMy flight got delayed 3 times which it didn't shown on their website, I had checked multiple times before having my only available ride drive me a hour and half to the city. First it was delayed from weather which they didn't announce in person either till a lot of people started asking questions and then technical difficulties,then when we finally boarded and I guess they were still having technical difficulties mind you it's like 9 pm, the flight was supposed to have left originally at 6pm they had everyone get off the plane and then canceled the flight which I definitely understand, but the reason I'm writing this is because they did not care at all if people were stuck in a unfamiliar area, I was traveling alone and my opinions were to get on the next flight with them at 6pm the next day or buy a new ticket with a different airline that they said they would reimburse in a week which I couldn't afford because all last minute flights were $300+ I barely had the money to get there in the first place for a family funeral and they wouldn't provide anyone with a New York Id with a Free hotel I just moved to Georgia so my ID is still NY So I had to go with the flight at 6pm the next day, I spent a night and half a day at the airport with a crazy creepy men harassing me while I waited at different terminal because the one I was in was not open 24/7 and there was no barley any security at this point, I feel they shouldn't have excluded people with a New York Id from getting a hotel I was so upset I was crying in public something I never do I felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable with the whole situation

### "I will not fly with them again"
Houston to Guadalajara. Frontier pretty much allows Volarís to not only oversell extra tickets to the public but also to frontier airlines as a contract with them and we were unable to fly to Mexico on Christmas day. The next flight out was eight hours later, so we spent Christmas day at the airport without a good answer as to why they can do that legally. The supervisor said that for the delay volarís would give us a reward for the problem of $1,345 dollars for the delay and overselling of tickets and nothing happened! A volarís worker called us a few days later asking our bank details but they never made the deposit and now they don't answer our questions or calls ignoring the problem by playing the blame game with Frontier. . Frontier airlines continues to hang up the call claiming to transfer us to someone that can help because they do not want to deal with the problem (have called five times and they do the same thing). Volarís does not have a phone line to call, they have email service in which they do not respond because they believe that this is frontier fault when it was their airline involved as well! It is better to pay a little more for an good American airline on which one can depend on instead of these airlines. I will not fly with them again.

### "canceled due to no pilot"
Salt Lake City to Miami via Denver. We had a group of 9 traveling to Miami to catch a cruise ship. We had a 2-hour layover in Denver 5 minutes before our flight was scheduled to board the told us the flight was canceled due to no pilot go to the service desk to reschedule. There they had no fights. Absolutely no help we got lucky and got seats on an America Airlines flight to Fort Lauderdale and had to arrange transportation to the Ship the last minute tickets on America cost us 269.08 a peace extra. Frontier will only refund our original cost and give us a 100.00 travel voucher for future travel. Like we will ever fly Frontier again they also have to be used by 4/20/2020. What a joke they also lost our luggage at the airport and we had to get it 3 hours later

### "unprofessional and thoughtless"
New Orleans to Philadelphia. Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I have travelled on in 35 plus years of business and personal travel and scores and scores of flights. The plane was delayed over 3 hours (8:20 PM flight from New Orleans to Philadelphia) for mechanical reasons. Frontier customer service told me there was nothing they could offer me to offset the cost of now having to pay for a lift or Uber to take me home (since my family would not be able to meet me at 3:30AM). I'm told they did offer food vouchers at the gate, but I was already sitting at the airport restaurant when I found out. It costs $45 for a carry on bag, which I knew, but seriously? The plane was very clean, but the seats really look like molded plastic with a cloth cover. And they pretty much feel that way. The tray table is smaller than an 8-1/2 x 11 piece of paper. No, it doesn't start small then fold out. It just is small. Flight was fine, but I really felt like I was flying in a tin can (and I have no fear of flying) so I just kept my eyes closed the whole time. When we arrived at the gate (a little ahead of time, thank you pilot), my carryon bag wasn't where I'd put it in the overhead. First I looked around and said "Oh my God, where is my bag?". Since I was sitting very close to the back I was maybe 6 people in front of the rear flight attendants, but no one responded, so I ran off and ran down the hallway shouting, "Will everyone please check their backpacks? Someone accidentally took mine". People were great, they checked and said "Nope, it's mine" as I ran past them. Defeated, exhausted, on the verge of tears I went back to the gate to check the overheads again. I couldn't get back on the plane, but one of service workers went on and checked for me. About 5 minutes later he came back with it and told me that it had been moved to the back of the plane to make more room! What? It's not unusual for a flight attendant to move a bag, but they always point to it or hold it up and make a general announcement, asking "whose bag is this? and letting the person know the bag is being moved and where. So unprofessional and thoughtless. Overall, I'd say it's the worst airline with the laziest support staff I've ever dealt with (excluding the guy who actually opened his mouth, moved his legs and used his brain to try to help me). Full disclosure, I did get an email while I was in flight apologizing for the delay and offering me a $50 credit toward a future Frontier flight. Their tagline is Low Fares Done Right. I think they should change it to these lines from an Alice Walker poem: Expect nothing. Live frugally on surprise. Bottom line: Avoid it if you can.

### "charged 139 per ticket"
Not Verified |  They advertise free change for flights. We had to change from Las Vegas to Fort Myers due to weather and storms. I called next day and changed. I was charged 139 per ticket. I was told the next day by their customer service that I volunteered to pay. What baloney! I reached someone today and said even though I made change next day I was 4 hours Short of the 24 hour window to change a flight for free. I asked for supervisor but not able to reach one. Very disappointed and will not recommend.

### "Worst airline ever"
Las Vegas to Charlotte. Worst airline ever - here I sit once again in the airport, Las Vegas this time, waiting for a delayed Frontier flight. I’m ashamed to admit I have flown this airline too many times. This time because I had a $75 voucher from a previously cancelled Frontier flight from November, that left me stranded overnight, sleeping on airport floors while trying to get home to a dying family member. I couldn’t hold back the tears for my beloved family member whose time had come and had to publicly grieve my way through the experience in the airport thanks to Frontier and their cancellations and delays, plane mechanical problems, and whatever excuses they use. Staff are never helpful - they have to deal with these issues continuously and probably hate their jobs. I can’t blame them working for such a chaotic uncaring company. As I sit here and hear all the good airlines (United, Delta, American) calling “last boarding call” and couriering away their happy customers on time, I’m once again jealous and disappointed as I wait and wait. And wait..... almost an hour delay now. No new announcements about the delay. The suspense is building. Will we actually get on a plane to our destination tonight or will it be tomorrow? Maybe Frontier cancels the flight again and I get to sleep on the airport floor tonight.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Cleveland to Sacramento via Denver. I would not recommend or use this airline ever again. The pilot didn’t show up, so my 16 y old child was told to leave aircraft after boarding and had to stay at the airport for 9 hours alone, while i looked to book her ticket home plus paid for it was told i will get up to 400$ refund plus for unused ticket. That is a lie, agents don’t know what the talking about calling you different name saying how you money was refunded back to a card that you never owned.

### "never look at a flight with Frontier again"
I booked 4 economy non-stop tickets from Denver to Orlando on April 1st - April 5th. 2 weeks after I booked the tickets I received an email stating there were changes to the itinerary. The change was the return flight from Orlando would involve a layover in Las Vegas so we would leave Orlando at 7:30pm and arrive in Denver at 4:40am! I have 2 small children and was told this was now my only option. Totally unacceptable! They did cancel the flights for a full refund but I will never look at a flight with Frontier again.

### "please find my bag, I need it"
Chicago to Miami. I went to Miami for the weekend 1/31/2020 to 2/3/2020 and the lost my bag the entire weekend they did not find. I kept on calling them. Each time i call i hear a total different story about the status of my bag, They've trying to seduce me with their $75/day refund but i don't care and only want my bag back. They had me staying in the same clothing and draws the entire weekend until i returned home this morning 2/3/2020. Miami station contact number never answers the phone when i call nor called me to give me an update. Nobody care out there and look at this as a simple job so they're not invested to attend nicely to customers. I spent my days calling them every hour to have an update and they keep on telling me different stories that don't match, i have not being able to sleep at night and anxieties are getting the best of me since then. I always fly South west, or United and Delta but this was my first time to use Frontier. Frontier please find my bag, I need it.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Portland to Las Vegas. We arrived at the airport the required 2 hours in advance. All the kiosks were locked up/not working and it said to see a ticket agent. There were at least 75-100 people in line. We waited 1 hour and 45 minutes to see a ticket agent .. there were only a couple even working the desk, and were told we were not allowed to board the flight because there was only 5 minutes left to take off. They refused to refund our money, refused to put us on a different airline, refused to rebook us on the next morning's flight unless we paid an additional $250 per ticket, for each of us, after we had already paid $285 for the flight they wouldn't let us board. On top of that, we lost approx $200 on concert tickets that we were flying to Vegas to see and we were charged for the hotel that we didn't show up for. My aunt spent 2 hours on the phone trying to get this taken care of and it was a hideous level of customer service. Will never fly Frontier again. This is clearly a pattern and practice, since there are other reviews of this same thing happening in airports all over the country.

### "So disorganised"
Philadelphia to Miami. Flight was delayed; original plane had some difficulties so there was a need to replace the plane. Still waiting to board; we are currently sitting in a cloud of misinformation. The plane should have departed 20 mins ago. So disorganised.

### "not recommend flying Frontier"
Kansas City to Orlando. My family's flight to Orlando was most unpleasant. I would not recommend flying Frontier (first time ever flying with them). The seats are uncomfortable, and baggage check is so pricey, the discounted ticket isn’t even worth not just paying more upfront and flying Southwest. You don’t even get standard complimentary beverages or snacks during the flight either, and have to order them if you want anything, no matter the length of the flight for extremely outrageous prices. We had already tacked on an extra $200 in baggage fees alone, this for bags that were carry-on sizes and were just not allowed to be considered "personal items" because they had wheels. We started out late by boarding the flight beginning 30 minutes later than scheduled, then spent another hour on the fully boarded plane sitting on the runway in Kansas City waiting to depart (for unexplained reasons). We ended up being over 2 1/2 hours later in total than what was scheduled by the time we had sat for another hour on a parked plane waiting on the runway for a terminal to become available to exit the plane in Orlando. This due to another plane having taken our plane's terminal for unloading because of our late arrival, and we could not exit until that plane and all its baggage was completely cleared and moved. We had set aside all of Sunday for traveling so that we wouldn't risk missing our first day at Disney... however, this did mean that on a Sunday night, all restaurants and delivery services were closed by the time we got our baggage claimed (which we finally did after roaming around aimlessly. Our bags had been moved to a different baggage claim terminal from what was stated when we were getting off the plane, and failed to be announced at the airport), found ground transportation, got an Uber and made it to our hotel. So we were unable to get anything to eat outside of vending machine stuff since we were without a vehicle, due to our plans to use Disney transportation throughout our stay at the park. We should have arrived in Orlando around 10:30 p.m., but did not end up getting to our hotel until after 3am. The whole thing was a terrible experience that I will never put my family or myself through ever again. The return flight back to Kansas City was with Spirit Airlines, also a first time flying with them. Their baggage fees were similar and a real slap in the face, however the flight staff was at least polite and attentive, and the seats were a lot more comfortable. We will likely fly Spirit again, but will only book it for a quick to-and-from trip so that we would only need a personal item to board with (this is the onl way anyone could possibly benefit from the money savings of booking with either of these 2 airlines). O

### "Not worth the perceived savings"
Atlanta to Denver. Not worth the perceived savings. I ended up paying way more in the end than if I would have booked with a reputable airline from the beginning. Keep in mind that Frontier is almost guaranteed to be the furthest concourse and furthest gate from the entrance so if you do risk it, give yourself way more time than with a normal airline. Also, the price is misleading as the ticket price doesn’t include a carry-on. So tag on $45 to the ticket price. Be very aware of your booking time as well. They will use the time 12:59 AM which looks like the night of the day you want to travel but it’s actually the night before the day you want to travel. Then they will not honor the honest mistake and charge a change fee of $190. Stick with the standard airlines.

### "find that the flight had departed"
San Francisco to Austin. Never fly Frontier out of San Francisco. I arrived for my flight today (Friday, January 17th) two hours early, and had issues starting with check-in. The self-check-in kiosk was old and out of date, so my credit card got stuck in the card reader, and when I finally dislodged it, the kiosk told me to "see agent. After waiting in line to check in at the terribly under-staffed counters, I went to security, only to find an excessively long TSA line. Since Frontier flies out the international terminal in SFO, you have to go through international security — in my case, this meant that I got in line at 8:20 am (an hour and 20 minutes before my flight), and was still standing in line at 9:25, when boarding closed. After finally making it through security, I ran to my gate, only to find that the flight had departed (in fact, it departed slightly early). The airport staff at the gate offered to put me on the next available flight to Austin — which happened to be on Sunday, two days from now. When I asked  for a refund or voucher for a future flight, I was given a phone number. When I called the phone number, I spoke to a very friendly but utterly clueless employee  who told me that it was beyond her power to give me a refund, and that I should talk instead to airport staff — which of course, I had already done. After going back and forth on this a few times, several things became evident that I would not get any sort of refund or compensation for the flight, despite the fact that the TSA delay was completely beyond my control, that the Frontier staff are desperately unhelpful that I should never fly Frontier out of San Francisco again.

### "staff are rude unhelpful"
I was trying to return from a cruise December 2019. It was a terrible experience. I was flying from Miami to Cincinnati. I am disabled. The Frontier employees I encountered are rude bossy and unhelpful. I flew down from cvg to Fort Lauderdale but the flights returning home had to be out of Miami. Cruises usually get in at 7 am. You get off most ships by 9am. I was transferred to Miami about 5 hours prior to flight home. I got in line at Frontier I tried to check my luggage. The rude ticket agent said you can’t check it now. We have nowhere to hold your luggage. I said I am  disabled can’t they take it a little early. The ticket agent ordered me to go sit down. There were no empty seats. I said where should I sit. She just pointed but there was no seat. I went to go find a seat. I tapped the shoulder of a frontier employee who was walking bye me. She turned around then put her hand up no no and kept walking. She did not even know what I wanted. I never found a seat. I sat in a wheelchair for a while but was dragged out of the wheelchair by employees so I ended up sitting on the floor. I had to wait till 2 hours before the flight. I ended up with pnuemonia cause I had to sit on the floor. I never found an empty seat at Miami Airport. Frontier staff are rude unhelpful they hate their jobs.

### "awful mess of customer service"
Not Verified |  Tampa to Raleigh Durham. We have had a good trip with Frontier on our way up and they have good cabin crew. Unfortunately, the way back was just an awful mess of customer service. The Raleigh-Durham staff were kind and the cabin crew were also kind. The bad part was when after we landed into Tampa. The captain jumped onto the PA and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tampa, unfortunately, the ramp is closed". The crew should've gave out beverages. We landed at 3:17pm and didn't get off until 3:30pm. We got down to the baggage and the Frontier flight from Ohio and ours were on the same belt. Then ours disappears. Soon, the Ohio flight goes off and the flight and the ramp finally reopens. Soon, the Ramp recloses. The Frontier staffer down there was on her phone.

### "extremely unhappy with this airline"
Cleveland to Las Vegas. I decided to fly Frontier for the first time on January 9, 2020. The flight was decent for the price I paid for the plane ticket. After landing, I went to retrieve my luggage from baggage claim and to my dismay my clothing had been tossed carelessly into the bottom on a large bag along with my suitcase. I was able to speak with an attendant who informed me that by bag ended up like this because "I" overpacked it. I explained to her this was not the case at all since my trip would be short not to mention I had plenty of room in my bag even after packing was complete. She offers me a cheap suitcase which was not comparable to the original case claiming that was the only available case she had to switch out the original suitcase with. I refused this option and decided to weight the options of contacting customer service or just purchasing me another suitcase while in Vegas. While attempting to repack my original suitcase the attendant returned with a different suitcase that was more comparable to the original. I decided that I would take that suitcase in order to make it to my hotel. I kept my original suitcase with hopes of returning home with it for repair due to the value of the suitcase which was apart of a set. After the trip I returned to the airport to return home where I requested that my original bag be flown home at no cost due to the inconvenience. I was introduced to a manager in which she attempted to make no accommodation besides explaining to me to cost of adding another bag. After getting absolutely no where I had to pay $55 to ship back my suitcase that was handled poorly by the Frontier staff to begin with. I do not understand why I would suffer monetary discomfort due to the inconvenience created by Frontier especially considering that I had to pay to check a bag in the first place. I am extremely unhappy with this airline and they have made a first impression to last a lifetime.

### "saddened by their treatment"
Tampa to Grand Rapids. Somehow my son who's 7 seat got moved to a different row. I pre paid for these specific seats to ensure he was in my row with my younger daughter. Ground staff at gate whom was very nice told me to ask about switching it and that it happens. The gentleman whom was in the seat very polite with me pointed this out to the Frontier airlines that somehow this happened. He was asking for a refund for his seat. Myself I said I'd like to stay out of it I'm happy to have my son sit in the different row. Well it ended with me having to move me and my two children to the back of the plane. Paid for the other seats for a reason. It was a very hectic time in the airport and I just wanted to be left alone. It unfortunately did not end there. One of the staff was looking at my phone as I was writing an email to frontier to ask for a reimbursement on my seats. They took it upon themselves to not come and talk to me as a human being. They sat back there talking poorly about me because I wrote frontier. I was appalled. One of the other employees had stated well because this gentleman paid for his seats i said well so did I. They failed to recall this gentleman was the one whom asked for a refund which I found was reasonable but took it upon themselves to find I was the problem. I told them I was fine just splitting my son up so there was not any confrontation. I was very saddened by their treatment towards me. I found it to be very unprofessional to talk poorly about me and my family because an error on the website booking. Very saddened by all of it. My flight to Tampa was excellent. It was the cabin staff and the error on the website that really has deterred myself from ever flying frontier again.

### "Frontier will drive you insane"
Not Verified |  Frontier is quite simply the worst airline when it comes to owning up to their mistakes and issuing any refunds. I had a flight booked out of Phoenix. They cancelled it due to maintenance problems at the last minute but I didn't know that until I got to the airport and stood in line. I had to take a shuttle up from Tucson to catch the Phoenix flight so had already spent money getting there. I stood in line trying to see how I could get from Phoenix to Bozeman on other flights, but they won't issue you a credit unless it's the next available flight. That flight required a 10 hour layover. We talked about my taking a flight two days out. I put my credit card on the table on that without being told all of the details. I hadn't realized she processed it immediately. Then I asked her when it left and found out that it departed at 5:50 in the morning. I said that I could never get a shuttle from Tucson at that time and to give me back my card and 'undo' the ticket. She understood. I got home and saw in my email that the new reservation went through. I called them immediately the day it had been made and was told that they would not refund my money even though I was at the counter when I asked for the reservation to be reversed. To be frank, I wasn't even sure that a new reservation had been made because we were still talking about whether that new flight would meet my needs when the reservationist must have put it through. I left the airport and got another shuttle back down to Tucson. I called Frontier 4 times. Their customer service goes through a foreign country where accents are hard to understand. I wrote them twice. Working with them is like hitting your head against a brick wall. They then told me to drive all the way from Tucson to Phoenix to speak to someone (who they couldn't say) and for whom they had no phone number. Why would anyone do that? Frontier will drive you insane when there is a problem. They don't want to give any refunds under any circumstances. They are a horrible company for customer service.

### "the worst customer service experience"
This was by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with any company airline or otherwise. I cancelled a flight in order to purchase a flight that would get me into Vegas at a specific time so I could meet a client. I paid $10 more for the new flight. The new flight with Frontier was delayed 3 hours. I missed my client and money in my pocket. Frustrated I explained this to the check in desk and asked if there was anything I could do. The agent literally ignored me, didn’t so much as look at me, and printed a boarding pass and told me to have a nice day. I explained I was already checked in and explained the situation again. She was so rude and disrespectful and asked if I wanted a full refund and I thought sure that would be nice. As she was going about doing that I could tell by her attitude and body language something wasn’t right. I asked so does that mean I won’t be on this flight? She said yes and continued to cancel my booking without telling me she was going to! I said no I still need to get on the flight I’m just asking if there is anything you can do to get me there sooner. She was sarcastic and rude and so disrespectful in her manners and responses. I was disgusted because I was simply asking very standard questions. I left and went to my gate. Waited three hours, spent $50 on a chicken sandwich and glass of wine. As we began boarding I noticed the same agent was the boarding agent. There was a commotion at the front of the line and I saw that there was a family asking her questions and she was repeating the same thing to them over and over again without looking at any of them. I knew that she was at least 10 years my junior and probably 20 years younger than the father she was treating so rudely. The family looked frustrated and insulted and finally gave up. As I boarded the plane and I kid you not she took my ticket and started yelling sarcastically over and over again for me to have a nice day. I couldn’t get a word in edgewise. All of her co-workers stopped to stare. It was humiliating. I landed in Vegas at midnight and after all that couldn’t bring myself to wait for an Uber so I sprung for a cab costing another $23. All in all I spent almost $100 for a $56 flight that cost me my time, a client, humiliation, and money in my pocket and for what? No reason at all. I understand flights get delayed but in my experience any other airline would at least offer an apology or try to help in some way shape or form. Not this one. Never again. I will never ever fly Frontier again.

### "Never will I ever fly Frontier again"
Minneapolis to Denver . Never in my life have I been more upset an an airline. I originally purchased my tickets on a whim to see my partner for a short excursion. The tickets were just over $100 so it felt like a steal. Instead, when I arrived at the the airport I discovered, much to my surprise, that the dates had been changed two some random time later in the month. To clarify: I had selected a specific dates, visually checked to make sure the dates and other info was correct then pushed the button to confirm. I did everything in my power to make sure I selected the right flight. But I guess that isn't enough for Frontier, oh no. And as much as I wanted to just walk right out the door, these were the only dates available so I had no choice but to pay nearly $400 for what was originally a $120, all while the lady behind the counter told me I needed to "smile more" because I was lucky enough to get a seat. Never will I ever fly Frontier again and if you're smart neither will you. Take Spirit Airlines, at least they don't ask you to be happy while they nickle and dime you.

### "customer service is horrible"
Denver to Dallas return. Frontier is the worst budget airline. They charge for luggage and then lose it. I had my luggage misplaced going to Dallas and then lost coming home after paying 45 dollars both ways to check it. They caused my daughter and I to miss our flight meaning missed work and school charged me for it after telling me there would be no cost and then refused to rectify their error. Three months later have been calling them non stop to locate my luggage or obtain some time of refund for the items in my luggage - the representatives aren’t properly trained or informed no one can give you the correct information and their customer service is horrible. I have been hung up on multiple times and I have been nothing but calm and reasonable with these people. And no one can actually help me or give me a straight answer. If you need to travel on a budget I recommend selecting another airline they are horrific.

### "watch the Mastercard offer"
I’ve used Frontier a couple times and felt they are very reasonable, and in some cases, down right cheap. You can’t put the seats back, but I’m actually glad since I rather the people in front of me not do it because my legs are a 36 inseam. I don’t care about perks if it means saving money. What you need to watch is the Mastercard offer that shows constantly while you are on the site and while you’re making reservations. It says it will give you 40,000 miles if you spend $500.00 with the annual fee. I needed to read the fine print because it does not include the reservation you’re making at the present time, but the next time you book. I didn’t get that until too late and I was approved. When I called to ask why they did not give me the 40,000 miles they told me the rule and immediately canceled my card and now we agreed, also in the fine print, to keep and use our information for 7 years even after we cancelled the card! The company was Barclays Bank of Delaware. They state on the offer: "after spending $500 on purchases in the first 90 days & paying the annual fee.” "Redeem for up to 2 round trip award tickets.” They do not approve you right away so I called and told them to put the payment on the card and I would cancel the amount on the card I used since Frontier would not approve us right away which is weird since our credit is perfect. That is when I found out I could not use that transaction for my 40,000 miles.

### " they lost my luggage"
Las Vegas to Houston. Not only was my flight delayed due to mechanical reasons, you also do not get complimentary drinks. Then they lost my luggage and about 20 other passengers. My first and last time flying with this airline.

### "not be flying it again"
Not Verified |  Palm Beach to Philadelphia. Delayed by weather by five hours. Staff on the ground discourteous and uncaring and no help at rebooking—no partner airlines, no flights on Sunday, no flights into NJ or NYC , very limited flight schedules. Then could not board the plane efficiently because of staffing irregularities. No amenities on plane, and poorly cushioned seats — no service, not even a drink, unless paid for—not even water. No available wi-fi This is an airline to be flown as a last resort. Would avoid unless absolutely necessary. I certainly will not be flying it again.

### "they tricked us to the hotel"
Miami to New York. Flight was supposed to depart at 6:56 pm. The plane encountered 'technical' problems during inspection. As a result, the flight was postponed for several times until finally rescheduled to 9:45 am next day. We stood in a line until 1 am to be booked to hotels to stay over night. About 15 of us were told that we were booked to the hotel "Pullman Miami Airport" and we had to get to the hotel by ourselves. When we arrived, the hotel told us that there were no room available and we were not booked at all. Ridiculous. To get rid of us, they tricked us to the hotel by setting us up! We tried to contact this airline and couldn't make the phone call through anymore. When we realized Frontier set us up, it was about 3 am. Some of us slept in the lobby and some of us booked other hotels by ourselves. I slept for less than 2 hours that night.

### "run around from the airline"
Sacramento to Las Vegas. Tuesday before Thanksgiving, my flight was canceled after they were late getting into Sacramento. The plane was boarded, then we were told to get off due to crew curfew. This is what a couple attendants said. Once we were off, they announced it was for mechanical issue. Already trapped in their lie. The run around from the airline after is what is most frustrating. The letter given to everyone, stated there would be a reimbursement up to $400 with another airline. This letter states it would be 14 days. The request was filed out on 11/27, as of today, 12/30 I do not have my reimbursement. Since then, I have had several emails to their customer service, all with more of this airlines "standard run around procedure". Do not fly on this airline if you do not have to.

### "You get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  You get what you pay for. I recently booked a refundable (paid extra) r/t to Denver from DCA (Washington) and had to make a slight change. The change saved me $47 but unbeknownst to me at the time what I should have done is cancel the flight altogether and start over. Essentially what the airline has done is trick me into going with the quicker fix which was to change the existing flight times rather than rebook entirely. My assumption was that the difference I saved (approximately $50) would go back to my credit card when in fact I was given a credit towards the next flight which has to be used within a year. I tried to appeal to them on the phone but they said the only way I could get that money back was to cancel the flight altogether which I am no longer in a position to do. In essence the airline has stolen a depreciating asset (cash) from me (via deception) that I must use on another flight or lose it altogether. I don't know about you but I call that theft and deception, and I am disgusted.

### "Terrible experience"
Buffalo to Orlando. Terrible experience. Never  will use Frontier Airline. The staff are so rude. My husband got injured on the gate, they don’t care they care only about the weight, not allowed even extra one pound. On the plane rude unprofessional people. The seats are not comfortable at all. It is Very low budget plane.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to Chicago. Terrible customer service. Frontier notified me that they had hanged my flight which will happen I understand - don't like it but understand. They sent an email to notify me with a link that basically said click here to see changes. The odd thing was I don't automatically download email images for security reasons and the label behind the view changes button actually said ACCEPT CHANGES. This concerned me but I clicked anyway. The link wouldn't work. I received repeated emails asking me to acknowledge the change. Same story. Consequently, I went to their app and logged in. It wouldn't work. Because they moved my flight I lost my seat assignment and I was traveling with my son. I had seats same row across the aisle originally that they let me assign. In my own lapse, I neglected that I would lose my seat assignment (I had actually paid for an upgraded seat) and didn't realize I needed to re-assign seats until check in. Their email reminded me to check in. A good point for Frontier that the reminder actually was sent. From the link on the email I was unable to make seat changes while checking in. SO again I went to the app where it was unclear where to make seat changes and upon clicking check in it said AN UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED So I did it again but it has already assigned a seat. I go back in to make the changes again and cannot and on each attempt I get the UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED. SO I call Frontier. Imagine the fun. Upon listening to their poorly scripted phone tree message I'm told that I may have to pay $25 for an agents assistance and that I could do it for free on their web site. Ahh the irony. So the agent in southern India finally picks up and reads the scripted lines. I explain my issues and ask my questions. She never really answered my questions and inelegantly attempted to turn her answers in to positive responses that had nothing to do with my question. She explained because my son was a minor our reservations had to be linked. This was never indicated before. So she linked them. Then she could change them. Online there were plenty of adjoining seats open (unless again its their system that's at fault) My son is currently in the back of the plane and I'm in the front; somehow I think we'll both have middle seats. I was told to change it at the gate (when the likelihood of change is low since seats will have been filled). They just don't have the infrastructure to run a modern airline. If you have low expectations and very few options, fly Frontier.

### "No customer service to speak of"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Chicago. This is positively the worst airline I've ever flown, and I've travelled all over the world. No customer service to speak of, rude attendants, questionable safety practices, just bad all around. They now fly in and out of the International terminal in Chicago, a "small fact" they neglect to inform you about until you find you are in the wrong place and cannot easily get to your destination in time. I can't say enough bad things about Frontier Airlines. I'm surprised the FAA allows them to operate like this.

### "Not worth the savings"
Denver to Orlando. Frontier is the worst airline ever. After an extremely bumpy and sloppy flight that was almost an hour late we were still waiting for our luggage an hour after we arrived! I am still waiting now for our luggage at 9pm at night. There are about 300 other people standing here waiting as well. No excuse for such a poor operation. Not worth the savings at all!

### "most pathetic airline"
Not Verified | Miami to Newark. Literally the most pathetic airline in the United States. We landed at 8:50 and got off the gate at 9:50 because the pilot said a catering truck blocked the path. This cheap airline doesn’t even have food on-board to even have a catering truck. The luggage takes 2 hours to reach the carousel. It’s as good as flying a North Korean carrier like Air Koryo where they at least have a sense of responsibility to the customers on board. This entire airline and company is a sham and should really be avoided at all costs. Multiple hidden fees make it more expensive than regular carriers. I wouldn't fly Frontier again, even if they paid me to fly it.

### "telling her she was too late"
Baltimore to Orlando. Mother in law had a flight booked to be back home in time for sons wedding. Was at airport an hour and a half early however ticket booth was already closed and was told they closed early because flight was not full but she might be able to make it. She was rushing up to gate, within the timeframe they were supposed to be boarding, only they shut the gate telling her she was too late. Then they told her they could get her on a flight 2 days later but would have to pay full price. I spent all day on phone with customer service where they tried to say their records indicate she was late not getting ticket until after gate was scheduled to close.

### "told I couldn’t use lavatory"
Phoenix to Newark. Waited about 30 minutes on the ground before take-off because the gate in Newark wouldn’t be ready on-time. I was told I couldn’t use lavatory because seatbelt light was on, but we didn’t land for another 45 minutes. Waited for 30 minutes on the taxi-way because the gate wasn’t cleared yet despite already waiting in Phoenix for that reason. Bags took 45 minutes from when I got off the plane to start coming out at baggage claim. You get what you pay for with this garbage airline.

### "the thing says departed"
First time flying Frontier and this will be the last time! Received my boarding pass. It says gate closes at 6:50. Cool it was 6:10. Go through TSA. No issues. 6:35. Get to the gate at 6:40. Says flight is on time. Sitting there waiting to be called. 6:50, no last call. So I’m sitting there waiting with other Denver passengers also waiting. Look up its 7:04 and now the thing says departed. Go to use my flight insurance and the desk girl says you don’t have it. I paid for it. Check my email and it says dear valued customer, we regret to inform you that the travel insurance you applied for as part of your upcoming Frontier flight was not processed. You were not charged and currently may not have flight insurance. I’m now livid at this point. My next flight that I had to pay $119 for because my insurance didn’t process, doesn’t leave until tomorrow at 3pm!

### "Worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Nashville to Philadelphia. Worst flight ever - was at airport on time then had a delay before boarding plane then boarded the plane and had a five hour wait before they decided to cancel and leave you stuck in airport at 11 o'clock at night and tell you to fly another airline but they are going to give you a 150$ voucher and reimburse you for the money you had to spend on another airline. Why did I book with you in the first place, very unprofessional staff.

### "not recommend this company"
St Louis to Las Vegas. We planned our trip to Vegas in October and paid for the trip then. 24 hours before we leave I find out you must pay for seats or you may not sit next to your loved ones. Get to the airport find out I have a baggage fee for a back pack. On a return flight find out my back packs that cost $168 to fly with were actually free. The flight was horrid! Dirty plane uncomfortable seating no movies no tv no music it is literally greyhound in air. Our original price for our tickets booked two months in advance 404.00 after they added a fee to everything 770.00 was paid. I will not fly frontier ever again and I will not recommend this company ever.

### "3 days stuck in airports"
Not Verified |  Spent 3 days stuck in airports because the pilots and/or the flight crew on every flight of every leg just didn't show up. They offered no apologies, they offered no other flights, they offered no hotel accommodations, no common courtesy by the flight attendants on the plane, which btw were like sitting on concrete. It was the most horrific flying experience I've ever had and I fly several times a month. I wouldn't accept as free ride from them anywhere. Ever. Negative points... negative review. It's not worth saving a few extra bucks. Not even close.

### "our flight back is cancelled"
New Orleans to Orlando. I’ve flown Frontier for a while. We booked our flight over a month ago. We get here the morning of our 11:43 flight at 9:45 we receive a letter stating our flight back to Fl is cancelled and they only thing they can do is reimburse us back our money in 30 days. Other flights with other airlines are $400 it’s 3 of us. The only other flight leaves Friday. So we are stranded here up until Friday or pay $500. I call customer service, it’s nothing they can do!

### "Absolute nightmare experience"
Las Vegas to Washington . I have been in the military for 10 years and flown all over the world on various airlines. I had a week of leave for some rest and relaxation and was stoked to enjoy a stress free vacation. From start to finish this airline was unprofessional and most importantly unreliable. The night before my flight I received a phone call in the middle of the night notifying me my confirmed flight was cancelled.. I spent a sleepless night resolving it. When I arrived to the airport there were hundreds of people waiting in a stagnant line to check in. (I arrived 3 hours before my flight) I barely made it through check in time to board. Many were not so lucky. Absolute nightmare experience on departure and arrival flights.

### "never use them again"
Las Vegas to Denver. Make you pay for a carry on. On top they make you pay for a seat after you already bought the fight. Can it seems to be a pattern with them if there's always something or on whether they don't have a cleaning crew at the gate or security isn't here to clear the plane or a pilot is missing. Because of there miss takes I've miss 3 connecting flight. Hate this airline will never use them again.

### "would rather walk next time to my destination"
Our flight was originally at 7.15am and then we received an email that the flight was delayed until 8.49am. We arrived at the gate with our bags checked in and everything at 7.45am. Myself and another 8 people sat at the gated and waited for the airplane to board and then we realized the airplane departed at 8.20. There was no call over intercom to announce that the plane is boarding and departing. Myself and the other 8 people that also missed their flight went down to the front desk and were told that we have to pay an additional $120 and the next flight was not for another 6 hours and we had to fly through another state. The Manager (located at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport) for Frontier was very rude when we asked when the flight left and why we did not receive any notice told us to immediately leave and the cops would come get us. I also spoke to customer service over the phone and they could not do anything about the situation either unless we paid $120 per person. Apparently Frontier is not obligated to call out for flights over the intercom I was told. So to anyone flying with them next beware because all they want to do is take your money, make it more possible for you to miss your flight and then take some more money. I would rather walk next time to my destination than fly with this incoherent, rude and selfish airline. Thank you for ruining my holidays Frontier, I greatly appreciate your divine service.

### "multiple attempts to book flights"
Not Verified |  I have made multiple attempts to book round-trip flights for 2 adults and 2 children (ages 3 and 11) from RDU to PHX through the Frontier website. We chose days when “Kids Fly Free” if you have a Discount Den membership and purchase 2 adult Discount Den tickets. Each time I try to book the flight, the “Kids Fly Free” discount is not applied. My husband and I have attempted to call the booking line to 5 times (no exaggeration) to request assistance with booking the flight. Each time, we speak with a friendly representative who apologizes for the issue and states that he/she can’t correct the problem, and we will have to speak with someone in the “Discount Den Department.” At this time, we are placed on hold and either immediately disconnected before reaching the Discount Den representative, or we reach the Discount Den representative and are disconnected within seconds of connecting with the representative. We have sent a feedback message through the website to request assistance with this matter and received an auto-response email stating that we will hear back from someone within 10 days or our email. Not surprisingly, we have heard nothing! I guess we will need to look for tickets elsewhere.

### "deceivingly cheap ticket"
Dallas Ft Worth to San Francisco. Terrible airline. Complete fraud. The deceivingly cheap ticket is just that, a fraud. The actual cost ends up higher than the regular airlines. No regular seats were assigned to me. I had to buy premium seats at $68 and $59 each .. then the luggage costs $55. Any carry on item is another $55. Plus the original $106 ticket price the total cost runs up around $350! !

### "prices are great!"
Philadelphia to Charlotte. Frontier might have delays but prices are great! The prices made it affordable and not breakable to see my family up north when i want to. This is the first time flying with them and I didn't miss the high prices for a cup of soda and some pretzels or cookies.

### "the worst airline of all time"
Cincinnati to New Orleans. Frontier Airlines is the worst airline of all time! If you want to be disappointed with a delayed flight multiple times on multiple occasions along with a bunch of rowdy passengers, then Frontier Airlines is the one for you!

### "worst customer service experience"
Las Vegas to Miami. I just had the worst customer service experience ever using Frontier airlines. The representative at the counter at McCarran Airport was rude, unfriendly and unwilling to assist resolving my problem. It is ridiculous that Frontier Airlines system would assign separate seats to my husband and I when our reservation was booked together and check in was completed at the same time. Even more unbelievable is the fact that NO ONE seems to be able to make any adjustment to my reservation unless I pay a ridiculous fee and pay for a seat. I would never use Frontier Airlines again and will make sure to inform my friends and family to make sure they never make the same mistake.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Phoenix to Orlando. We arrived yesterday morning to fly to Orlando for our Disney trip that we’ve been planning for a year. We got there and they checked us in. After being checked in and before the took our bags, they told us that the plane was overbooked and they gave 2 out of our 4 seats to someone else. How can an airline do this? We have 2 small children (3 yo and 5 yo) who are now devastated because we missed our Disney day which was today. They rebooked us for today but we are now stuck in Denver for a 5 hour layover, which was just delayed an additional 50 min. We’ve lost out on our rental car, so we have to rebook that and only hope that they will reimburse us. And we lost one night at the hotel that we will not get reimbursed for. Not sure how Disney will work out but I am highly doubtful we will be able to do that now with all these added costs and less time spent in Orlando. We are devastated! During all this, the customer service rep was no help and had no empathy about this situation and refused to get a supervisor for us to talk to. Poor customer service.

### "they are really good at bluffing"
Charlotte to El Paso via Denver. On the day of my return fight, flight 199 leaving from Charlotte to Denver, did not depart till 10:45am. The agents told us they have no information as to when it will be leaving. We were supposed to depart at 6:01am from Charlotte. My connecting flight from Denver # 383 was supposed to leave at 10:01am. So due to Frontier Airlines own fault, I missed my connecting flight. When we arrived at Denver airport, I went to speak to Frontier airlines agent and they told me there is no other flight leaving for El Paso on November 13, 2019, so I can schedule you for the next day November 14th, 2019 at 3:15pm there is flight leaving from Denver to El paso. I told the agent I have an appointment at Las Cruces and I can't wait till tomorrow. So either give me a partial refund or find me a return flight on the same day. The agent at the airport told me that she can give me partial refund and it will be in my bank account within 10 business days. Till now I haven't received a single penny from Frontier Airlines. I called them today and the customer service is telling me that you arrived at Denver just in time to catch the connecting flight to El paso which was leaving at 3:45pm on November 13th, 2019. Moral of the story I missed my connecting flight all due to the airline fault and lost my money and had to go with United Airlines to reach El paso on November 13th, 2019. Clearly they are really good at bluffing, and they have lots of technical problems and you can miss your flights. You wont even get your money back, I know for the future reference I will not be flying with Frontier ever again, because they don't care about providing good or even fair customer service.

### "made my wife pay for her purse"
Denver to Portland. We travel to PDX a couple of times a year and frequently take Frontier. My wife and I take the small bags that fit under the seat so there is no charge for luggage. However, this time for the first time ever since flying Frontier, the gate agent made my wife pay for her purse and that charge was $60! In addition, the Frontier website did not work when we tried to pre-print our boarding passes. As a result Pre-Check was not provided and we had the hassle of going thru the regular security lines. Fortunately on the return, the web site was functioning properly and we were able to pre-print the boarding passes with Pre-Check on them. As a result we will avoid Frontier in the future.

### "somewhat good, not great"
Not Verified |  Atlanta to Orlando. Customer service was somewhat good, not great. Fees are expensive and added up quickly. No perks - no wifi, no snacks, not much room. Had the hardest landing I have encountered.

### "we were not allowed on"
Orlando to Atlanta. I arrived at the airport 2 hours before my flight, then the flight was delayed. I got a text message letting me know my flight was delayed. Then, it was delayed again. It gave the departure time, by text, as 13:22. I went to get something to eat. I know the doors close 15 minutes before the flight. I lost track of time, and then had to pay my check. However, I was at the gate at 13:00. The doors were already closed, and there was no one at the desk. Another traveler was there as well. We both tried calling Frontier. I was on hold for half an hour. He spoke with someone who said they were sending someone to open the door. I spoke with a Frontier agent at another desk, who called someone, and said someone was coming to open the door. No one came. The plane sat without moving for an hour, but we were not allowed on. There were at least 4 of us who "missed" the flight, one of whom was sitting at the gate the entire time. We were all booked on the later flight that night. When I got there for the later flight, another flight had been delayed at our gate, then left early. There were 9 people left that time. One of the passengers had been speaking with the boarding attendant. The boarding attendant knew where that family was going and, when they didn't hear his loudspeaker announcement, just left them sitting there! Who does that? They were, literally, directly in front of him. I know you're supposed to pay attention, but the flight boards had been wrong all day, and it's very hard to hear the loudspeaker. They were also traveling with 4 children. I understand the closed door policy, due to safety. What I don't understand is not notifying people of an early departure. If you can notify of a delayed flight by text, there's no reason you can't send all important notifications that way. I also don't understand the complete lack of humanity the boarding agent showed that family by not even telling them that it was their flight he was calling for. Appalling.

### "Worse experience ever"
San Francisco to Austin. Worse experience ever! Nickeled and fined for everything including my seat, my carry on. No refreshments offered not even water. 5 hours late! No communication or updated

### "This is the messiest airline"
Orlando to Dallas Ft Worth. Never have I been on a Frontier airline where they do not delay their flights due to some "paperwork " or what one of the captains called and i quote "a glitched paper". If you really want to fly with them, take direct flights or else you surely risk missing your connecting flight. This is the messiest airline I have ever used.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified | I had a flight from Raleigh to Denver on the 22nd of November 2019 where I picked up my daughter for Thanksgiving. My return flight was the same day with Frontier. It had already been a long day so I decided to upgrade to better legroom for the return flight (exit row). Upon boarding the aircraft and sitting down, I was informed that my daughter who is 6 years old was too young to sit in the exit row. I was not made aware of this until we were on the plane and I had already upgraded. The steward said I would have to swap with someone so I swapped with the couple in front of me and I was told to contact customer service in order to have the fee I paid for the upgrade refunded since I didn’t get to sit in the seat. Several attempts were made to call customer service over the holidays. Each met with an hour wait so I didn’t bother. Fast forward to today, the 30th where I finally make it through after sitting on hold for an hour. The first representative was from India, could barely speak English and after giving me the round about for 30 minutes, proceeds to transfer my call to god knows where and hangs up on me. At this point I’m livid but I call again. The second representative, of course, from India and can barely speak English. After going back and forth again I’m directed to put in a request via the website. They can’t solve it over the phone due to there not being any “official documentation that I didn’t get to sit in my seat”. Long story short, I’m probably screwed out of the money I paid to upgrade my seat due to their complete and utter incompetence/lack of effective resolutions. They’re unorganised, terrible customer service, incredibly uncomfortable flights and by far the worst airline to deal with. Do not fly with them. The money you save is not worth the hassles you may deal with. God help you if you travel with them and you run into any delays/issues. They will not help you resolve them because they already have your money. 0/10 across the board.

### "They won't give us a refund"
Not Verified |  Had a flight from Denver to Orlando Tuesday November 26, 2019. A snow storm hit canceling our flight. Spirit could not find another flight to get down there when we need to. My daughter had a chance to cheer at Disney world, my other daughter and friend was also going with us a chance of a life time. Spirit was nice enough to refund our whole amount back but when I called Frontier they wanted 119 each for a cancelation fee. Inform me to do online so I did on Wednesday 27th. They won't give us a refund. Even when our flight was delayed coming home because of the weather. I had to work 5 jobs and my daughter 3 just to afford going on this. Why purchase travel insurance if it does not work.

### "she thought it was funny"
I am taking a flight to Atlanta. While checking in with Frontier I was given a boarding pass during the Security check I was given a boarding pass for somebody else and luggage going to New York. I had to go back to Frontier check in desk and I spoke to the supervisor of the check in desk and she thought it was funny, grinning and smiling no apologies. Laughing she just printed another boarding pass. I know people make mistakes but Frontier needs to educate there employees how to handle customer service.

### "paying for a carry on $60!"
Phoenix to Las Vegas. I had a purse and a small shopping bag I purchased in Phoenix flying back to Vegas which I know is just a personal item. When I attempted to board the flight they would not allow me on without paying for a carry on $60! I told them this item would be with me in my hand and not take up space on there flight and they said you can only take 1 item. I said ok and placed my small bag inside my purse no big deal. They still wouldn't allow me on the flight! I had to call my husband for a credit card number I will never fly this greedy airline again! And the lady at the desk  was very nasty and unwilling to help!

### "they were unwilling to help me"
Not Verified |  I arrived for my flight and the employee was only able to print one of my boarding passes I was told that when I arrived in Miami and checked in they would be able to continue my trip with no problems this was not the case. First off they told me that even though I had already paid for my checked bag that I would not only have to pay for it again that as I had a 5 hour layover that they would not be able to check me in for several hours. After talking to several employees and a supervisor they were not only unable to help me they were unwilling to help me. And insisted I would have to pay over 100 dollars for my one checked bag as well as not being able to check in or several hours. I have flown frontier many times as I travel for business I after this experience I will be using other airlines from now on as this was by far the worst customer experience I have ever endured I would highly recommend paying a little more and flying any other airline in the end you will be much happier in the end.

### "Horrible airline"
Not Verified |  New Orleans to Orlando. Horrible airline, over 3 hour delay with no explanation. Customer service ignored passengers standing in line at the desk, pretended not to see everyone and talked amongst themselves. Outrageous cost for luggage also. Wasted 1 day of vacation on a beautiful sunny day because of this airline. The least they could have done was to keep passengers updated. They gave out $10.00 vouchers but very limited on where they could be used plus they expired the next day - just a big joke, keep them Frontier. I should have believed all of the reviews I had read about this airline and saved myself and family some stress. Never again.

### "Would have rather walked home"
Dallas/Fort Worth to Denver. Walked twelve kilometers to airport from hotel. Happy surprise with carry-on charge that costs twice as much as an actual ticket. Flight bad. Roller coaster seats. Asked four times for water. Almost died of dehydration. Would have rather walked home.

### "the worst flight I've ever had"
Not Verified |  I flew to and from Philidelphia for a wedding with Frontier. The flight there was ok, but the flight back was the worst flight I've ever had. During the flight, I noticed a female flight attendant in the front preventing people from using the restroom. She was getting items from the bathroom, and when someone would go to use it she yelled at them and stated to go to the back. Well, halfway through the flight I needed to relieve myself. I tried going up to the front to use the bathroom, and as I got up and walked past a flight attendant, she accosted me and stated the seat belt sign was on so I needed to go sit down. I stated I was going to the bathroom and kept walking. The flight attendant at the front yelled at me to go use the bathroom at the back and stated I could not use the one in the front. As I went to the back 2 attendants were serving drinks. I went up to them and they proceeded to ignore me. Then the female attendant turned to her male coworker and spoke to him loudly with attitude, "I don't know what this guy is trying to do! So I told them I needed to use the restroom. She then yelled at me, "Well we are serving people! You'll have to come back later! So I stormed off and forcefully sat back in my seat. After we landed the flight crew then informed us they were really tired so we would be doing them a favor picking up after ourselves so they didn't have to. Never again will I fly Frontier and neither should you. Paying extra is worth it for different airlines, at least they let you use the bathroom on-board. Also Frontier hits you with hidden fees so it's actually not cheaper compared to other airlines.

### "never repeat with Frontier"
Not Verified |  Miami to Newark. There are no savings really. Unlike most airlines, they charge you for the carry-on. Almost all of the other airlines do not charge for this. The only other airline that I know does is Spirit which I only use if their ticket price is very low for the destination I want to go to. I will most likely never repeat with Frontier.

### "isn't worth whatever small savings you get"
Las Vegas to San Jose. Horrible airline. Extra charges for bags to include carry on. First the flight was delayed, then a gate change, then the gate changes yet again. Compile this with short tempered employees that provided a horrible customer service experience. First and last time on this airline for me. I don't care what the extra expense is. Frontier just isn't worth whatever small savings you get.

### "delayed for nearly 4 hours"
Las Vegas to Miami. We were delayed for a mechanical issue for nearly 4 hours. Attendants would not provide updates. We missed our cruise out of Miami. They offered only $50 voucher for our delay. Will never fly Frontier again. There are many options available, and even though they may cost more, I will take those options.

### "Pilot and staff were kind"
Newark to Puerto Rico. Seat has just enough space but doesn’t recline. Pilot and staff were kind. Extra fees and got to pay for all food. Great for the cheap prices they provide.

### "the most horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Initially when I booked for this flight, I completed a survey where I commented that I hoped this airline fulfills its obligations. I made that statement based on a previous experience with this airline. This time its even worse. The flight that was going to Florida from California was delayed, and there was no notification so as to make proper arrangements. The staff at the check-in were not helpful either. In fact, they acted as if the delay was my fault. After an hour delay I was told, there was an additional one hour delay, so by the time getting to Florida, the flight to Atlanta had already departed, The staff said there would be no other available flight until 4 days later. I was forced to book another flight with another airline, which costs me way more because of the urgency. The staff said there was nothing they could do about the delay other than to refund. It was the most horrible experience I have ever had with any airlines. Comparing the pain I endured to the cheapness of the ticket, the value of the money is 1/10. I will never recommend nor fly Frontier airlines again.

### "Not worth it"
Not Verified |  Flew Frontier Airlines from Albany to Denver. Horrible. No customer service. Seat and tray were like lawn furniture. Crew was the most cavalier, smug and rude I have ever experienced. Not worth it. This business plan will fail and I can't imagine this airline will be around long.

### "Horrible, inconsistent"
Denver to Providence. Horrible, inconsistent, condescending gate staff that act like robots. My bag fit under the seat on the flight out, but was 2" too big for their measuring device. No exceptions no matter your loyalty. If you're disgruntled, the captain will also join in the 'however I can throw my weight around and not accommodate our customers' party they seem to thrive on. Never again will I endure this joke of a so-called airline. Southwest here I come!

### "Absolute worst experience"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Chicago. Absolute worst experience! Our flight was delayed several times with little explanation then canceled altogether at the last minute.They had our entire plane waiting 8 hours to find out they canceled the flight. They also informed us that we would have a new departure time for today (11/12/19) at 12pm. Now they have delayed departure once more. We aren’t sure. The sheer lack of transparency and information by the Frontier staff is absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional. They will claim they did all they could do, however, this is not true. Out of respect for their paying customers, they should have made decisions much earlier in the day allowing their passengers to find local hotel accommodations versus sleeping nearly the entire flight on the Mexican airport floors. This is truly the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Not because the flight was determined canceled but for the lack of respect for their paying customers.

### "3 hours late and still waiting"
Nashville to Denver. Our flight was scheduled for departure 5:00 AM the crew was late, the pilots were late, then we need some oil in the engines, then the person that added the oil was authorized to add the oil, so we have find someone who is authorized to make sure the oil was added correctly. 3 hours late and we’re still waiting. Wish us luck not sure when we might get to Denver.

### "not fly Frontier ever again"
Not Verified |  Fort Myers to Cleveland. $55 for a carry on. Apparently this was “up to 50% more than I would have paid had I used the app. The clerk told me this as he swiped my card. Good to know I could have stepped away and saved 30 bucks - rip off. No included snacks or beverages. Old, cheap plane. Will not fly Frontier ever again.

### "did not like fee for carry on "
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Orlando. Our flight to orlando was on time, the tickets are cheap but did not like the fee for carry on baggage. We were staying in Orlando for 1 week so we don t have a choice but to purchase a check in baggage and a carry on. No free snack in the plane, seats are very uncomfortable. No entertainment at all. The flight attendant in the plane is a little bit rude.

### "flights are never on time"
Las Vegas to Colorado Springs. This is truly one of the worst airlines around. The last 4 times I have flown with this airline it has been an hour and a half delayed every single time. Not only do they Pimp you out with requiring you to pay extra for everything (including your seat assignment? ), but the flights are never on time and always delayed. I will never be flying this airline again.

### "customer service is poor"
Not Verified | Spokane to Las Vegas. Frontier customer service is poorly if at all trained to handle the many issues that may arise with customer inquiries regarding their policies and procedures. The different fractions of this organization are not organized nor well versed in the necessity to effectively communicate to the appropriate department with a goal of a successful resolution for its staff but more importantly to its clientele. They need to acknowledge the fact that when an unfortunate event occurs, it is not always the client who is at fault and should suffer the penalty. A customer representative hung up in my face when she became unable to answer questions regarding its policies, procedures, and overall movement at their ticket counter.

### "worst flight experience ever"
The worst flight experience ever. I only booked my ticket with Frontier because I wanted to leave Phoenix in the last flight for the day. However, It is hard to believe that there could be a worse flight service than Spirit Airlines. For sure there is - The award of worse flight experience ever goes to Frontier. Seats  are very uncomfortable, it is not possible to recline the seats. I felt like I was seating in a piece of wood. I am 6'1 foot tall and my legs cannot fit in the space between my seat and the seat in front of me. Once I sat down, I could not move for hours. Also the seat is too short, so I could not rest my head for the whole flight. My neck is still hurting from the flight. Staff  were rude and any questions we may ask, they tell us to talk to the supervisor. In Phoenix - I only asked - Why do you only open the check in only two hours before flights - the answer i received was .. Do you want to talk to my supervisor? It is very rude and weird that we cannot have a simple conversation with Frontier staff at check in. In Denver staff on gate A40 doing the boarding were very unprofessional, rude, they yelled at anyone who asked them questions. Our plane was selected for a security check. Although it is a common procedure for airline company and staff, the customers are not familiar with the process. When someone asked about the estimate time our flight would leave, we the lady screamed at us "I DO NOT KNOW - MAYBE 30 MINUTES, 2 HOURS, 3 HOURS". It was terrible. The only person who smile and was professional during my whole flight was the flight attendant Diamond on flight F9 290. I told her thanks for having a smile on your face. She told me  "We need to keep smiling". I am not sure about how much the flight ticket with Frontier cost because I flew from Tampa to Phoenix with American Airlines and I flew back to Tampa with Frontier and I paid for round trip. I heard that Frontier flight tickets are cheap. I am not sure if it is true because America Airlines only charged me $30.00 for check in a bag. Carry on was free. While Frontier charged $50.00 for check in + $50.00 for carry on. Also, American Airlines offered free snacks and drinks. While Frontier charges $3.00 for drinks and snacks. I am positive I will never fly with Frontier again

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Santa Barbara to Denver. This is the second time they cancelled my flight, left all of the passengers stranded at the airport at 9pm, not another flight option for 48 hours. They would not provide accommodations for hotels or alternate airlines the next day. Customer service was useless. I had to miss a day of work and spend almost $400 to get home about 26 hours late. The website won't let me give 0/10 for overall rating or 0/5 stars for the categories below of value, ground service, seat comfort, cabin staff, food, entertainment (there is none), and cabin wifi, but assume all 1 ratings are zero.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
La Guardia to Denver. I told myself on my last flight with Frontier that I would never fly frontier again because they cancelled my flight last minute and after driving 6 hours to another airport they delayed my flight 8 hours for “the plane to be serviced.” Once again, my flight was delayed several times, causing everyone to wait at the airport for hours, then they finally cancelled it leaving everyone stranded and the Frontier lines wrapped around the airport. Long story short, insurance does not matter. Their insurance only covers “incidents that happen on the aircraft”. They put me on a flight 36 hours later but gave me a free 100$ voucher that I will not be using because I will never fly Frontier again.

### "have to wait in the airport 14 hrs"
I bought the flight on November 1st from San Diego to Washington DC. It was 2 hrs delayed in San Diego 11.30am to 2pm. So I missed the flight at 4 pm from Denver to Washing DC. I talked to customer service they told me the earliest flight to DC is 7 am in the morning, but  I have the job interview at 11 am in the morning. I have to reschedule my job interview and I have to wait in the airport 14 hrs! I know this is low cost airline but you guys should not make the business unprofessional like this. Very very dissappointed.

### "Worst experience ever"
San Diego to Washington Dulles. Worst experience ever. I was overcharged for ticket, flight delayed for my layover in Denver, missed my layover, waiting in one hour line so they can try to figure out how to get me to Virginia. I attached a picture of the line of customers dealing with the same thing I am at Denver airport.

### "worst mistake I could have made"
I arrived at ATL Airport around 9am on October 31 2019 only to receive notice prior to arriving that the flight was delayed. My original departure time was suppose to be 11.46am arriving in Miami by 1.30pm. I get to the front desk and the attendant informs me the delay has been extended. New flight time 2.40pm arriving around 4.36pm. I just got home from overseas and was trying to surprise my boys ages 2 and 1 at a birthday party that's ruined. This Airline has no respect for peoples time at all, I might as well not even have a flight schedule. They need to offer a partial refund or something. I usually fly Delta or American but thought I would give the little guy a chance. Never again, worst mistake I could have made. I guess you get what you pay for. Please please save yourself the headache and fly with a more reputable airline. This will definitely be my first and last time flying Frontier.

### "electronics are not covered"
I was traveling from Ft Lauderdale to Denver on Tuesday, October 29 at 7:12 am. I arrived in Denver however my luggage was lost. I did not receive my luggage until 7:20 pm the next day. When I opened my luggage my iPad was cracked. I sent an email to Frontier regarding this matter but never hear back from them. I called them on Thursday October 31 at 8:30 and was on hold for 20 minutes before talking to Carl who told me that electronics are not covered. He then sent me over to Jeff at 9:05 am to said that he would look over it. In the meantime he sent me over to baggage. I talked to staff at 9:35 am who told me that it would not be covered. In the future I will be avoiding Frontier Airlines for their terrible customer service of not getting back to customers and being put on hold for an hour.

### "flight has been canceled twice"
San Francisco to Denver. My flight has been canceled twice, my check in bags are lost and they won't help! I arrived at San Francisco airport two hours before my flight on October 27th 2019. I patiently waited in line for over a hour to check in my bags just to be told my flight has been delayed 4 hours and that I could not make my connection flight from Denver to Kansas. They told me I can reschedule but the next available flight won't leave until October 29th. They refused to aid in hotel or food following the next two days. So everything came out of pocket. I arrived back at the airport on October 29th 2019. four hours before my flight at 7am to talk to the staff before the flight check in time but no one was at the check in counters. so I waited around for two hours before they told me that the flight was delayed until 1:38pm but i still checked in my bags because I HAD to make it to Denver. So I stuck around went thru security just to be told that my flight has been canceled again and again they told me the next flight will not leave until October 31 at 1am. You think thats bad! Well it gets worse, they lost my check in bags. So for the next two days i had no clean clothing, toothbrush etc. They had no idea where my bags have gone. They told me "it might be in Kansas" but they didn't call anyone. They continued to tell me that i most likely would not get a refund so I might as well stick with the flight that is leaving October 31 at 1 am. I have spent over $360 in hotel rooms and thats not including food. I spent $80 for check in bags that the airlines ended up losing and all together I have spent over 24+ hours waiting around at the airport for flights that end up getting canceled at the last second.

### "do not fly this airline"
Washington to Austin via Denver. Don’t ever fly Frontier they got me to Denver late then refused to put me on another airline to get me to my destination. They claim they have no agreements I told them they do have an agreement once they took my money and told me they would get me to Austin today. I have to sleep at the airport because they will not pay for a hotel. They lied that it was due to the weather when we could see them through the glass working on the plane before they allowed us to board because it was due to maintenance not weather. They refused to pay for my dinner knowing I had to wait 18 hours before I could get on the next Frontier plane to Austin. They told me they could get me to Austin today on Southwest so I said go ahead and print me out a ticket and the lady told me I would have to go to the Southwest counter and pay with my own money. Do yourself a favor and do not fly this airline.

### "delayed my flight by 4 hours"
San Francisco to Denver. They delayed my flight by 4 hours before cancelling it at the last minute, they didn't provide any alternative solutions and I had to buy a last minute ticket to be on time, that was another 800$ extra. I will never fly Frontier Airlines, even for free.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Austin to Salt Lake City. This airline is terrible and I would recommend anyone choose any other airline over this one. I flew from Salt Lake City to Austin with a small bag that fits easily into an overhead compartment without any charge or issues. When I flew back I was called to a podium for a seat adjustment and I was told I had to pay 60 dollars to carry my bag onto the flight. The woman was rude and I explained to her that I flew to Austin with no fee or problem and she insisted I pay the fee. Like a fool I paid the fee on their app and waited to board the plane. My flight was was boarding at the adjacent gate to where I was called for the seat adjustment and the demand for paying their fee. The man took my boarding pass and didn't even check or look at the bags I had. I was basically robbed for 60 dollars but this airline. I've never had such a terrible experience and I'll never fly with Frontier again.

### "don’t recommend this airline"
Las Vegas to Atlanta. This is the worst airline ever! I tried giving them a third try after my first two times my flights were delayed, one of them was delayed by 2 days flying from Colorado Springs causing me to miss out of work and paying extra hotel time. Now that I’m flying to Atlanta I tried paying for a seat for my departure flight but it switch it for my return flight. I tried contacting the airline to help me switch it but refused and said the seat was non exchangeable or refundable and the lady was very rude about it. I’m attaching a picture of the seat I was booking and paid for vs what I got. I shouldn’t have to pay the consequences for their system not working properly. I don’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "had an awful experience"
Denver to Boston. We had an awful experience with flying Frontier last August. They lost our luggage, including our daughters car seat. They didn’t have any backup car seats (like they are supposed to, or at least like you would expect from any airline for situations like this) and our flight was delayed and didn’t land until all other airlines in that terminal were closed. We had to sIt in an empty baggage claim (with our 9 month old) until 4:30am (over three hours after landing). At that point, some baggage handlers from another airline noticed us and were kind enough to give us a car seat so we could finally get home. Customer service doesn’t care and I have sent multiple emails to the baggage department. One to complain but also to compliment one of their baggage handlers who, honestly, did everything she could to help us. They won’t even respond to all knowledge my emails. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.

### "Never Frontier again"
Not Verified | Washington to Phoenix via Denver. I travel nationally and internationally 4-5 times a year. Had to fly on short notice and made the mistake of trying this god aweful airline. What a poor experience. You can arrive on time and they will refuse to issue boarding passes. When I finally got my boarding pass, it says doors close 15 mins before take off time. Why can’t I get my boarding pass 44 mins ahead of time? It took me 10 mins to get through security. So, I could have been at the boarding gate 34 mins before departure and 19 mins before doors close. I ended up being charged $120 for rescheduling and had to $110 for a hotel and wasted 12+ hours. Never again on this airline and will advise anyone and everyone to stay away from this pathetic air service. Their policies are not customer friendly. I am pretty sure they oversell their flights and then screw customers to make up for it. The in flight service is as pathetic as their other services. After my flight, I checked airline rankings, and guess what? The rank at the very bottom of the stack. Spirit, the previous bottom feeder, seems to be improving. Frontier took their spot. Congrats! Never Frontier again! !

### "I didn’t get to fly"
Memphis to Denver. Worst airline ever. I showed up over an hour before my flight and the people working the check in closed the line stopping at me. Wouldn’t let me check my bags and I didn’t get to fly.

### "not worth it in my opinion"
Miami to Denver. Never again! I fly to DEN every other week. I noticed that frontier was 1/4 of the price of American. I decided to take a chance which nearly cost my a large project for work. Flight was delayed one hour. Got a notification. No biggie, moved my meeting. But then we waiting nearly another hour sitting on the plane waiting for refuel? It’s dumb and poorly planned and not worth it in my opinion. In addition, seats suck.

### "going to cost a $119 change fee"
Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Denver. I have traveled with Frontier Airlines for years and have always been very happy until recently. I am going to only state today's events, although there are several more that could be listed. I had purchased a ticket online with my points (yes, a member), because of illness, I had to change the ticket. I have previously changed tickets online. Because the first ticket used more points than the second ticket, the online system would not allow this change. So, I call them only to speak to someone who was rude and very aggressive. She would not listen and just kept saying that it was going to cost a $119 change fee (the ticket didn't even cost this amount if I were to buy it brand new). They have never charged to change a ticket purchased with points. She forwards my call to "another department" but before she does so, I ask for her name and ID#, she states that she is not allowed to give this information and it is against policy (probably because of rudeness). I speak to Mike who does the same thing. You must pay $119 to change your ticket, etc. etc. I refuse. I have done this before without a fee. He finally states that I could just cancel my original purchase and he would refund my money and I can go online and buy the new ticket! Each time these things happen, I just start looking at other ways to travel.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Tampa to Colorado Springs via Las Vegas. Left Tampa on time. Got to Vegas with a 6 hour layover flight then delayed and will not arrive till almost 1 am. 2 of our party of 4 will miss a day of work due to this delay asked Frontier to compensate the two of four that will not get paid due to no fault of their own for the missed day. They refused and offered $75 travel vouchers. I declined told them to keep it. They cost passengers more than they save on their rates. Don’t do it! Cheaper to fly a different airline. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "Good experience"
Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Orlando. Good experience; great price for one way nonstop. I had zero luggage, however, so check those fees (sent my bag ahead with family who flew out earlier). Plane looked new (per tail number, 3 years old). Landed on time. Friendly crew. Seat was a bit thin. Tray table tiny. No free drinks. Happy to accept those minor drawbacks on a short haul flight in order to get that price. I would fly Frontier more often if their network out of DFW was better. I also stressed ahead of time because I knew it may be hard to get there had the flight been cancelled (American has more re-route options). Fortunately not cancelled. Bottom line this was a good experience for the price.

### "will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  St. Louis  to Orlando. We were all seated in plane when they told us slight delay because of "maintenance. Another hour went by and told problem was fixed, they were just doing paperwork. Then announced they were overly optimistic and problem not resolved and had to de-plane. Flight was to depart after 5 p.m. Kept getting delayed. The gate clerk disappeared for 2 hours and wouldn't answer any questions. At 10 p.m., five hours past departure they kept saying they had no information and it was finally midnight when they announced a cancellation of flight. From there it was pure chaos. Since it was so late, no other flights were available on any other airline. Flights out of Frontier wouldn't be for another 2 days. People were completely stranded. It took 2 additional hours - now 2 a.m. in the morning before we we had to book a flight with another airline the following day costing $1500 out of pocket for flights back home plus $20 cab and $120 hotel. We had a 7-year-old autistic child with us. This was a horrible experience for her. Autistic children are very sensitive to noise, crowds, bright lights. What was supposed to be less than 2 hour stay in airport ended up being 10 hours, and extremely detrimental to her sensory processing disorder. It was a truly awful experience and will never fly Frontier again.

### "yells at me to stop talking"
Denver to Salt Lake City. When I boarded I was zone 1 so I boarded first! My seat was the front seat as well. I walked in with my ear buds- Unfortunately I’m coming home to Utah to burry my 4 year old nephew. The FA says- your bags need to go overhead. I was in the very front row, so you can’t keep purses or backpacks or anything big with you. I said, without taking my earbuds out “I know I’ll put it up for the flight”. Keep in mind my tote with purchases were already stored up too. Next thing in know, the guy- says “your bag needs to go up top (keep in mind we have 20-25 minutes before take off). And I told him “I just told her I’d put it up in time for take off”. He then says “that’s the attitude”. When I said “excuse me, what is your name” He got so close to my face. He said “oh are we gonna have a problem it’s Fox(his name)” He then accosted me about me earbuds and how I was being disrespectful. So I started to record him, when he accused me of taking his photo. Which I then did. A few minutes go by and I decide to be the bigger person - delete the recording. I go up to be the bigger person and apologize and he pushes me to the side and I start to apologize when he yells at me to stop talking. He needs a witness. Then the first FA and another lady show up. I then am told to take my seat. After he tells me I’ve broken the law and will be arrested. I sit down. Within minutes I’m pulled off the aircraft and told that if I do not listen to him I’m not allowed back on. And it’s his decision to let me back on the plane.

### "flight got cancelled"
San Diego to Charlotte via Orlando. The first flight got cancelled and the second one was delayed with the time being moved later and later. I will not be flying with Frontier Airlines again. They did not compensate for my travel plans being disrupted and the additional costs incurred.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever. We had a flight from Philadelphia to San Diego with a connecting flight in Orlando. in Philadelphia, the flight was delayed from 2:55 pm to 4:00 pm due to weather, however the weather conditions were totally fine. They allowed us to board the plane and assured us that our connecting flight would wait for us in Orlando. We get to Orlando, and we are told to wait for around 30 minutes. we are then told that our San Diego flight is cancelled, resulting in us waiting in a line to get a hotel for an additional 3 and a half hours. Once you get the hotel, you have to wait an additional hour for the hotel voucher and shuttle. The staff had no concern for customer satisfaction and did not attempt to help in any way. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "Horrible service"
Not Verified | Orlando to San Antonio. Horrible service. We paid for our seats to be together with our baby, not only did they charge us $100 for our baby when the travel agent said they wouldn’t, put out seats on 3 different rows! The flight attendants were rude and we were treasured horribly, will never fly this airline services again.

### "They deserve to get shutdown"
Denver to Washington via San Francisco. I had the worst experience and am still living it. I originally had a flight from SFO to dulles with a connection in Denver. Tuesday was the day I was supposed to leave then I keep getting emails that my flight is delayed and when I called them the lady said if you get on this plane then you will miss your connecting flight from Denver to Dulles because the flight to Denver is delayed and the only next available flight is on Thursday. I take the Thursday flight. As my husband and I arrive at the airport we are told our 10:33am flight is now delayed to 11:20am. We get on the plane and we are on the runway until 12pm. Once we reach Denver at 2:45 they are on the runway until 3:28pm. My connecting flight from Denver to Dulles was planned to depart by 3:45 and was scheduled for them to close the plane doors by 3:30. By the time I get off the plane the doors for my connecting flight closed. I called Frontier and they said there is no flight to Dulles, Reagan or even Baltimore airport and that the next flight is on Sunday where its the same flight to Denver then Dulles. They didn't provide a hotel voucher or anything for us to be in Denver for 2 days. The only option they had was to either rebook and refund the money where then you are responsible for buying yourself a new plane ticket. Mind you last minute tickets especially last day ones are about 1000 dollars a person. Also I am a full time college student and cannot afford to be in a state where I am not a resident along with staying at a hotel for 2 days. So I asked them take me back to San Francisco I can stay with my parents and book me on the next flight to Dulles. The soonest flight they have is Sunday. I had to fly back to San Francisco and on my SFO flight we were on the runway for 1 whole hour and this truck drove up to the plane and it pulled out a water pipe then started washing the plane wings. We arrived 50 minutes late to SFO. Also the bags that were on the flight from San Francisco to Denver when I tried going to Dulles. Turns out none of those bags made it to Dulles airport that night so we ended up getting our bags back and they expect us to pay again for our carry on and checked bag on Sunday. When we were at Denver heading back to SFO they changed our gate 4 times. Never again flying with frontier this is a complete joke. They deserve to get shutdown. Do yourselves a favor do not give in to low prices on Frontier go on legitimate airlines like Alaska or Delta they will not waste your time.

### "the flight attendant was a bit rude"
Denver to Charlotte with Frontier Airlines. As my wife and I approached the counter, ready to board the flight, we noticed that my wife’s boarding number was #1 and mine was #3. I was very puzzled because our seats were next to each other, I felt very embarrassed when the flight attendant was a bit rude, making note that we had to respect the boarding order. Maybe, to avoid these kind of situations, seats next to each other, especially of the same group or family, should be same boarding group.

### "I was very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Washington to Phoenix. I was very disappointed when I received a voicemail message telling my flights had been changed. Not only did they change the times - but had the audacity to change my return from Saturday to Friday. Who does that without bothering to call the passenger - the outgoing flight was changed to me having to spend 13+ hours at an airport - the entire first day of my vacation. As a result my I flew out Sunday night - adding a hotel bill to my vacation cost. I have sent an email to the CEO and other officers at the airlines. I did get a call from someone at the airline - I am not sure whose office she said she was from - who said she would send me an email with information to send my hotel bill but as of today (October 10, 2019) I have not received an email nor have I received any acknowledgement from the CEO. None of my other concerns were addressed nor was there an apology for the inconvenience I experienced. I don't understand a company not taking the concerns of their travelers seriously and don't bother to address all of the concerns.

### "Lie after lie after lie"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Philadelphia. Was here on time, they delayed our flight once for weather, then they delayed our flight again for maintenance, then they had to cancel our flight because they had no employees to even run the airplane not even a pilot. Then they didn’t even connect us another flight they reimbursed us then they wouldn’t even pay for our hotel room for that night because they said it was canceled due to weather which is untrue it was weather maintenance and then not enough crew members to fly the plane. Lie after lie after lie, told me to call customer service called customer service they did nothing didn’t even pay for our room.

### "she made me feel uncomfortable"
San Antonio to Washington DC. Meanwhile I haven’t boarded the flight currently be careful flying with Frontier. At the gate I was sixth in line while the agent was shouting she was only taking guests to Vegas (I was going to DC) The guy in front of me had his ID thrown back at him flying off the counter from the agent, and his bag THROWN. Patty the agent was extremely rude while I gave her my information. I held my hand out to receive my ID and she threw out on the counter like the previous person. I had just placed my luggage on the weigh when the agent said your luggage is more than 50 lbs (the numbers on the scale were still moving ) and she said I had to pay extra luggage fees or ‘figure what in the world I was going to do’. I of course responded she should allow for the weigh to finish. My luggage was 47 lbs. I was very upset as she made me feel uncomfortable. As it turns out, the person behind me is sitting next to me on the flight and she also described the agent as unbearable. I usually don’t write bad reviews, but this one hands down deserves a lot more than what I’m writing.

### "I will not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Phoenix to St. Louis. Frontier is the worse airline that I have ever flown with. They delayed my flight for 6 hours then told me at the last minute that it was canceled. I missed a funeral and they showed the least compassion that I have ever seen. I will not fly with them again.

### "customer service is awful"
Atlanta to Las Vegas. Never been on a plane before at all. The flight was ok for being inexpensive but the reason I will never fly with Frontier again is that after I paid for a checked bag I went to the airport and the lady behind the counter said that my bag was free because it was a personal item that I didn't have to pay. She gave me a slip of paper to call for a refund which was great. So when I called they told me they couldn't give me a refund because the lady didn't leave any comments saying that. Now think about it, my first time ever flying I have no idea what I was doing, not a clue. Frontier's customer service is awful. No wonder it's so cheap. Flew Delta on my return flight and it was night and day! Well worth the money!

### "so unprofessional"
San Francisco to Cancun. Such a bad experience with Frontier Airlines they cancel 2 hrs before our flight because they overbooked and they were short staff. They offered to put us on another flight 3 day later which we declined. Never again booking with this airline they are so unprofessional!

### "We will never use Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Orlando. I will never fly Frontier ever again. It's been a complete run-around the entire time. My husband and I are on vacation and unfortunately, we had a death in the family so we need to return home two days earlier than planned. We called to change the flight, they said we couldn't. We had to go book a separate flight then call them back to cancel the original flight. We did, they said they couldn't refund us the money, they could only credit us for another flight. But they told us that they couldn't do that the first time we called. If they did that the first time, we wouldn't have had to book a whole new flight. We could have used that credit for the new flight that we needed to book. So after spending God knows how much money on all of this, we still have to send a copy of our family member's death certificate over to them. Then we're told that we have to scan the death certificate in the airport we flew into for vacation .. are you joking? So I have to fly home to PA, get the death certificate, fly back to FL to scan it, wait until they get it, then fly home? This is the worst airline I've ever flown and they charge you for every last thing. The checked bags, the carry-ons, the seats if my husband and I wanted to sit together...I paid $96 for us to sit together on the way there and the way back. While on the plane, I think they asked maybe one time if anyone wanted snacks or drinks. Any other airline I've ever flown walked up and down the aisle the entire flight asking if we wanted snacks or drinks. They made sure we had whatever we needed. But that's not even the important part. We had a death in the family and we've been given nothing but problems trying to arrange our flights to get to the funeral. This is something that should be an easy fix due to the unfortunate circumstances. But no, they are making it increasingly difficult just for us to make it home for the funeral. We will never use Frontier again.

### "seats were so uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Las Vegas. The seats on this aircraft were so uncomfortable! It was a short load of passengers so the Captain allowed us to go in the empty seating which there were 3 to a row. I got my own, it was very uncomfortable to sleep the whole flight because I kept getting cramps in my leg. I was so tired but I did not sleep on that flight.

### "You have lost my business"
Not Verified |  Inclement weather surrounding the Chicago area on Sept 27th 2019 was evident throughout the day. Our flight from Cancun to Chicago was delayed due to the weather. Frontier knew how bad the weather was and our chances of landing in Chicago were slim. They did not cancel the flight. Instead the pilot stated we had plenty of gas because he new we would be circling for some time before landing. The flight was never allowed to land in Chicago, Chicago closed the airport at around 5:30 PM due to weather. Our flight should have been 3 hours. It ended up being 7 hours. 5 hours into the flight the pilot announced no other airport had available customs open to accept our flight so we had to fly to Denver. Arriving at Denver airport, we were made to find our own way to customs, 120 people had to stand in line at 11:00PM to rebook our luggage for another flight, then rebook our ticket for the next day. This took a couple of hours. No representation from the airline ever came to announce what the plan was. Instead the passengers were all asking each other. I must also add the flight consisted of 2 offers for water. 7 hour flight and they did not offer us snacks or complimentary drink due to the delay. Nothing but water. At 2:00am we realized we were sleeping at the airport. No offer of a blanket or pillow. Most of us were in shorts and sandals. It was 47 degrees in Colorado. Really think about flying with this airline. I did call customer service to see if they were willing to offer any retribution for our troubles. She said no, but they will due better on their customer service in the future. Sorry Frontier. You have lost my business.

### "worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst customer service experience. you sacrifice all respect and common courtesy for a discounted rate with this airline. I was a few min late to airport due to multiple traffic delays. The front counter person informed me that I would need to take my bag with me to the gate due to my late arrival. Flight was scheduled for take off at 1:31pm. I arrived at 12:49pm. I asked if I would have to pay again for my luggage ... as I had already paid for a checked bag online when I checked in for my flight. She answered 'no'. I got through security. Closing doors time stated it would be 1:16pm. I arrived at gate 2 min before (1:14pm). I was greeted with a scowl look from the gate attendant. She was visibly irritated with my late arrival and clearly not interested in the fact that my uber was in a wreck on the way to the airport which delayed my arrival. Without making eye contact .. she asked me my name and informed me that I needed to pay again for the bag fee. I informed her that the lady prior to security check told me that there would not be an additional fee. There was another gentleman that arrived after me. He was sweating and he obviously was running to make it to the gate. The agent saw him running and she stated that there comes another one and he has a bag. She rolled her eyes. He asked "did i make it? No one acknowledged him. I answered him. Yes you did. Are you ok? I asked the agent if there was a reason she was so visibly irritated .. she answered with "this isn't irritated. This is how I always am". I informed her that she should not be in the field of customer service. She told me that she had been in customer service for 4 years. I informed her that her supervisor should be aware of her behavior. She answered: "My supervisor knows how I am". What total disregard for the passenger experience. Once I was boarded, I logged onto Frontier's website and sent in my concern. I received an email from a Customer Relations Specialist apologizing and stating the concern about the lack of customer care had been sent to the supervisor. This Customer Relations Specialist pulled the "policy" card regarding needing to pay again for a bag if checked at the gate. She ended the email with "we look forward to seeing you again". Nope. Not this Texas girl.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Philadelphia to Tampa. Frontier is an absolute garbage airline. Do not fly Frontier! First thing, the check-in kiosks were broken, so there was a really long line to check-in. Once we boarded the plane, we had to get off for a mechanical issue that was supposed to take an hour to fix. One hour turned to three which then turned to our flight being cancelled. They say they will send you a $500 voucher in an email but what they do is send you one for $100 and you have to call in to get the rest of the voucher. The voucher itself is only good for 90 days! Overall, every aspect of Frontier sucked and I will absolutely never fly Frontier again and neither should you.

### "half my flights are delayed"
Not Verified |  Denver to Ontario. I’ve continued using this horrible airline and after all my flights I would get Frontier the #1 worst airline award. About half of all my flights are delayed and I’ve had two times not that they have had us keep boarding and deboarding a plane because of maintenance problems. The last plane I was on was smoking in the cabin and they said it was computer problems. Bad service bad flights and bad planes. Uncomfortable seats too.

### "delayed every hour and so on 7 times"
Seattle to Saint-Louis via Denver. Live in airports 2 days cause Frontiers failures. Stay at night on airport chairs. I bought flights F9 144 (Seattle - Denver) and F9 280 (Denver - St. Louis) As a result, my flight to Denver (F9 144) was delayed every hour and so on 7 times. After 7 hours, the flight was canceled and everyone was sent on another flight in the morning. But my connecting flight F9 280 burned out. And they could not offer me another flight during the day so that I could have a meeting at my business. As a result, I had to skip the business rally and fly to New York (I bought tickets to fly after St. Louis). I also had to spend the night at the airport on an armchair, because the company said that the places in the hotels were over. But it’s not my fault, why should I sleep on an armchair at the airport due to the fault of the airline? There was no compensation, they offered a $ 150 voucher to buy another flight, but I will not use their airline anymore. They refused to pay money or to a bank card And now my flight to New York is just as delayed, I spent 2 days at the airports due to the fault of Frontiers and they did not even take care of my sleep or food. I have to look for where to sleep and eat myself.

### "Most uncomfortable flight"
Not Verified |  Denver to Ontario. Most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. We were packed on like cattle. There was turbulence the entire flight. Frontier added on prices for everything. The seats had no cushion and were difficult just to get in to. The emergency paperwork was old and filthy. The inflight bathrooms were too far away to get to, but with the turbulence, I would not have made it anyway. I would never use Frontier airlines again and would not recommend them at all.

### "charge you for your drinks"
Not Verified | Denver to San Jose. Worst Airline ever. Our flight got delayed for 1 hour so we had to wait at the airport and do nothing. When we were on the plane, everything was going just fine. Then, one of the Flight attendants came. She was very nice. I asked for some Sprite, but the final total was 30 dollars. I mean, what airline would charge you for your drinks and food. I am never flying this airline again.

### "would never recommend Frontier"
Indianapolis to Portland via Denver. Customer service was rude. Flight attendants were grouchy. No in-flight complementary snacks or drinks on a 3 hour flight. My original flight was with a 51 min layover. It went to a 12 hour layover. I only got $50 discount on my next flight. I asked for a hotel voucher, which would be same price as the discount. They said that was impossible. I checked nearby hotels, they were priced around that. Wouldn't give us food voucher either. Snacks and drinks were $3 and up. That's for a can of pop, tiny bag of pretzels, the type of things you get for free on other airlines. I would never recommend Frontier.

### "incompetent and irresponsible"
San Juan to Atlanta. This is the worst possible flight experience imaginable. The flight was delayed 2 hours before we were given any answer as to why. Then the response was that the airplane was rerouted somewhere else because of weather in Puerto Rico, while  no other flights around us were delayed for weather. Then our flight, almost 4 hours delayed, lets us know that what was suppose to be a direct flight, would have to do a layover in Orlando. When asked at the gate why, they said it was to refuel but when we called Frontier they said it was because of weather in Atlanta, and when we actually board they said it was because our flight crew had reached it's daily hourly limit and we had to have a crew change in Orlando so we could make it. So it took 3 tries for Frontier to tell the truth: that 4 hours isn't enough for them to organize themselves and find a replacement crew in Puerto Rico instead of wasting fuel and time and probably a plane full of customers and adding a stop to a direct flight. Then what was suppose to be a 4 hours flight was a 9 hour ordeal and to add insult to injury we asked if we could at least get a glass of water or coffee and the flight attendants said no because it was out of policy. I've read the reviews and heard all my friends complaining about this airline, but since it was the only real direct flight from Atlanta with a semi-affordable price, I booked it. So on my first flight with Frontier I learned the following: they will lie to you to save face and give no direct answers to what is happening, they will have inadequate planning and are disorganized when it comes to unforeseen issues, they have ZERO compensation for screwing over their customers (not even a glass of water), and just because you pay for a direct flight doesn't meant that is what you are getting. It's incompetent and irresponsible.

### "the worst airline in business"
Chicago to Denver. I’m sitting on the runway during my second Frontier Airlines flight in the last 5 days. We are heading back to the gate. This flight is already 40 minutes late. Both of my flights have been extremely late, employees make little to no effort to notify waiting customers of the delays. My outward bound flight was delayed for hours with no communication. Their employees are rude. They act completely shocked when customers request information about their flight. Although clean, their planes couldn’t be more generic and basic. They offer zero comfort. This is without a doubt the worst airline in business.

### "This airline doesn't care about it's customers"
Not Verified |  Their customer service was absolutely horrible in Denver. My Norwegian flight from Paris to Denver was delayed by an hour - I even received a notification. When we arrived in Denver, it took about 20 minutes to get off the plane, followed by another 20 minutes to retrieve bags and go through customs before checking in to my connecting flight. I get to the Frontier Airlines kiosk and the agent told me I could not board the aircraft 30 minutes before departure - yet in their terms and conditions, it says that passengers are allowed to board up to 30 minutes before departure - either this agent was purposely making this experience hell for me, or was a complete idiot and had no idea how to do his job. I tried explaining to them that my flight was delayed and I had come up to the kiosk as fast as I could after having to wait through customs and baggage claim. The agent alongside him said I needed to calm down and that I was flabbergasted - no regard nor understanding to the frustration after flying 11 hours, and then being told I would not make my connecting flight and that "it's not their fault I missed my flight". The agent also said that they do not receive any notifications at the kiosk about delayed connecting flights, which I find absolutely absurd. They told me I needed to go speak with a manager but there was no one to be found at the moment. I spoke with Spirit Airlines next door, they said I would have to pay for a new flight if I were to fly with them - but that I could attempt asking the manager from Frontier Airlines if they could assist with that. The manager was now at the kiosk at Frontier, and her presence, attitude, and tone of voice was the worst I have ever experienced at an airport. She was extremely rude, and would not even listen to anything I tried to explain and kept dismissing every sentence without thought. She was robotic in tone of voice and did not care at all about what happened with my flight, and blamed me for missing the flight and that there was nothing they could do. I left crying out of frustration and rudeness that I experienced from that so-called "manager" - it's a mystery as to how someone with such a horrible attitude and personality would have that role. I had to buy a new ticket from another airline, as well as transportation and hotel for the night since they had no other flights to offer me. This airline doesn't care about it's customers, nor do they offer any type of class in their customer service. What a disgrace.

### "worst airline I’ve ever been on"
San Juan  to Orlando. The worst airline I’ve ever been on. This was my first time flying with frontier and my first time visiting Puerto Rico I was so exited For My amazing vacation the price seemed very attracting so I decided to give them a chance and try the airline out! Never knowing what was to come, I arrived at San Juan super happy and exited waited for my luggage next thing I noticed is my bag very badly damaged (wheel torn off, hole punched in, and several other missing parts) ran quickly to the front desk and told them what happened they took pictures and filled a report the lady said in 2 days max I’ll get a answer, got an email that night stating the issue was filled, 3 days went by and no answer! Had to make a new claim all over again! Next thing you know they said they”ll give me just a voucher or 75$ check - my bag cost me $299 and they where offering that? Disputed it they said the only way to refund me that was with receipt. Called friend back home to search all of my house, bills, Emails exxxx to find the receipt and thank God he found it and I sent the picture right away. Next thing you know they said they couldn’t pay me because the receipt was a little faded? Why ask for receipts then obviously some may be faded away by time! Spent several of my vacation days upset on the phone, suddenly hurricane Dorian came by Puerto Rico it was a mess and never got all the mess sorted out. In conclusion I never got refunded my bag price.

### "nothing redeemable"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Houston. There is a reason Frontier has the lowest customer satisfaction ratings (and by lowest, I mean the rock bottom friends). The "flight attendants" are mainly just teenagers who can do little more than handle three main things. Seatbelts. Trash. No loitering. It takes one whole flight attendant for each category. We spent the better part of three hours toward the front, watching four flight attendants do the following: eat oatmeal, drink various items (which you won't get on this airline unless you're willing to hand over your card for a $4.00 Coke). We're suspicious that the fourth person was actually just a passenger dressed like one of them. Nothing is free and the only time we saw actual activity from them was when one went down the aisle saying "trash? while another followed at the same time saying 'seatblets? The third one spent about an hour moving soda into one cart and back again (because no one wants a $4.00 Coke). Clearly these folks aren't at the top of their multitasking class. Their seats honestly feel like you are sitting on stadium seats. You know, the hard metal bleaches that cause your butt to fall asleep after an hour? I did say a silent prayer that at least while it's numb, it didn't hurt. Aside from the pilot managing to get this plane and passengers to its destination (I mean, that's really as low as the bar can go), there is nothing redeemable about this airline. Do yourself a favor and spend the additional $60 (on average) to fly a major airline. Even United looks like a five-star experience compared to this airline.

### "charge astronomical fees"
Denver to Jacksonville. Frontier Airlines seems to try to present themselves as a budget airline, but charge astronomical fees. I have consistently seen very rude employees in personal experiences with Frontier Airlines. They entice you with low fares, but I have seen them raise their prices before I can complete a booking. I have also seen error messages on their website when trying to book their "low" costs. When I go back to try again; the error has mysteriously vanished and the prices have gone up significantly. I have had numerous conversations with their customer service agents on the phone, and they are extremely rude and have even hung up on me. My family and I have been mistreated and humiliated at the boarding gate as well as observing the poor treatment of other Frontier Airline customers.

### "3 hour delay with no compensation"
Denver to Milwaukee. Of course just like all the other reviews, there was a 3 hour delay with no compensation. No wonder why Frontier has that reputation, I will not travel Frontier again.

### "entire crew were great"
Little Rock to Denver. I read a lot of reviews concerning Frontier before deciding to give them a try. I am disabled and traveled with my personal mobility scooter. It was transported in the baggage compartment and I was able to ride it to the aircraft door and they then placed in baggage and delivered it to the aircraft door upon arrival. It was handled professionally and with care. Flight attendants were most helpful. In fact, the entire crew were great about keeping us informed on flight status and progress. Aircraft was clean and well maintained. I have no problem with charges for baggage. The overall cost was a bargain compared to competitors. Lack of free drinks and pretzels on a 2-hour flight was not a problem. I will not hesitate to recommend Frontier to friends and family. Just do your research and know what to expect.

### "flight was delayed"
Las Vegas to Indianapolis. One of the worst if not the worst airline I flew with during my 20 or more years of flying. The flight was delayed for more than 2 hours with no explanation to why it’s delayed. If you want to fly cheap fly with a different airline. At least you’ll get to your destination on time.

### "an interesting experience"
Cancun to Seattle via Denver. The problem I had with this airline is that I was asked to check-in online and told that if I did so I would save money, especially if I bundled the options: bags, carryons, seats. So I did. Or I tried to. I am not unfamiliar with making arrangements online but had problems with navigating the site. I think I had to try three times, but at least twice, for everything to go through. I noticed that they were listing my flight as "roundtrip" even though it was Cancun to Denver to Seattle. The charges were astronomical. I ended up paying $254.12 at check-in on top of the $191.24 I had paid for the flight itself. And this is supposed to be a discount airline? So, at the airport I checked with the agent at the counter as I checked my one bag, total charges $86.24 instead of the accustomed $25-30. And I had to pay another $86.24 for the carry-on, which I have never had to pay for. The agent checked the record and told me that I should call Customer Service when I got home because it looked like I had been overcharged. So I called Customer Service and gave them the confirmation number so they could check the charges and I am informed that they had to charge twice because I did not have a connecting flight! What? So I asked if every other person my the flight from Cancun to Denver who then continued to a second destination had to pay the same fee for each "flight" and I was told that "yes" they all would have paid the same fees! Rather than argue I chose to pass the word around. No way I will fly Frontier again, that's for certain. I have been inundated by emails from them about $29 specials and wondered how they could offer such cheap airfare. Now it becomes clear! It was an interesting experience, no beverage service, no wifi, no nothing. The seats were not uncomfortable. No significant delays. Weird having to deplane to the tarmac at Seatac and walk a very long way to get baggage after the buses drop us off at the far end of the main terminal. But all the walking outside was on-ramps, no stairs. To get value from this airline, don't have checked bags or carry-on (they allow one personal item free) and take the seat they give you! Bring your own food and drinks, a blanket and a pillow, noise-cancelling headphones, a book, and you will be fine.

### "Never again!"
Philadelphia to Tampa. Never again! Their server confirmed I checked in then their system said I didn’t ,and they forced us to miss our flight and buy all new tickets ($2100 to fly from Philadelphia to Tampa Florida). On the flight home they messed up again and wouldn’t allow me to check in because of a $30 fee due and I called and asked how I owed money when I already paid in full and they said sorry it was a mistake, you're good to fly home now. I called to speak with them about this and they were rude and obnoxious and told me their system is perfect and no way they made a mistake. Spend the few bucks extra for a better flight!

### "Delays, failure to communicate"
Savannah to Philadelphia. This airline is the worse at every turn they work at disappointing their customers. Some businesses fail to meet customers expectations by mistake. Frontier must hold meetings to discuss how best to provide a completely horrible experience. Delays, failure to communicate, rude employees to name but a very few events a trip with Frontier has provided us. At this time I stand in a line that was to start moving an hour ago waiting for baggage check. Better off with any other airline.

### "sent car seat to wrong place"
San Antonio to Ontario. The lady at the counter at San Antonio airport didn't seem to have knowledge of anything. She got my flight confused and sent my car seat to the wrong place. When I landed in Ontario they had to provide me a loaner car seat. Thankfully within 24 hours customer service called and had my car seat. I didn't have time to go pick it up so I just switched it back when I returned for my departure back to San Antonio. I asked the girl in Ontario if everything was good with the car seat. She never specified to me to pick up car seat on the side entrance. When I arrived in San Antonio I waited at baggage claim for my car seat and once again it was not to be found. I was quite upset and had to go talk to customer service representative. The customer service representative blamed me for not picking up my car seat in the correct section when the ticket given to me clearly stated baggage claim. The lady was quite rude and offered terrible help. Eventually after 40 minutes I got my car seat. I think next time when choosing my flight I'll just go with a different one. I also don't like the fact that the company charges for carry on bags and had no complimentary drinks on board.

### "Horrible airline"
Raleigh to Orlando. Horrible airline! Out of the last 5 flights, 3 delayed and 2 cancelled. Its not economical when you have to get motels and pay for extra parking. Their solution was to offer $25 off of a future flight which they can keep as I wont be flying Frontier Airlines again.

### "our luggage being lost"
Denver to Fargo. Ending of a great trip was concluded with our luggage being lost. Frontier was also unable to find our luggage as they do not utilize any tracking system. This really caused unnecessary stress on us as customers of Frontier.

### "flight was cancelled costing us hundreds of dollars"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to Jacksonville. I’d never flown Frontier before and I never will again. After waiting hours to board we were told that our plane was given to a San Diego flight. The San Diego plane originally slated for that flight had mechanical issues so we were to wait on repairs. That never happened and our flight was cancelled costing us hundreds of dollars!

### "I won't ever fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Ontario to Orlando via Philadelphia. Worst airline experience ever, and I have flown a lot. Most of the seats don't recline, they have no padding, and the armrest sticks out when folded up so we couldn't even lean sideways on each other without being stuck in the ribs. What executive decided it was a good idea to forego the passengers comfort to save a few dollars? I am going to semd Frontier my chiropractor bill. I definitely need to go after flying with Frontier. The icing on the cake was $45 per carry on bag, per leg of the trip. I won't ever fly Frontier again!

### "they are not worth it"
Philadelphia to Las Vegas. Our vacation to Las Vegas was ruined by Frontier Airlines when the Pilot never showed up to the flight due to a scheduling error. Which was bad enough, but their customer service to make up for the extremely inconvenient situation was even worse. We dealt with at least 4-5 customer service agents who where horrible at providing any type of satisfactory resolution. Nobody from that company was willing to do whatever it took to make the situation right for us, we had to fight and complain to everyone we dealt with. Our flight tickets were over $300 each and they were only willing to provide travel vouchers for $500 - we lost hotel reservations and an RV rental worth way more than that. I am NEVER using this company again, no matter what the "Deal" looks like - they are not worth it.

### "canceled minutes before"
Austin to Orange County. This airline will be out of business soon! They canceled my flight, only notifying me minutes before it was scheduled to board. Waited an hour to find out there not going to help me on to a different flight on a different airline, any flight vouchers, miles or even a life back home! On top of that, the manager was billing the passengers repeating, two options. Refund or rebook! What jerks had to spend another $400 to book on United Airline. Ugh

### "Horrible customer service"
Raleigh to Hartford. Had booked trip 3 months ago to visit family and to have my daughter meet her grandmother. We received notification flight was delayed 15 mins on way to airport, then when we printed boarding passes it said delayed until 7pm. Then once again it was changed to 6pm then 5 minutes later canceled. When we went to get explanation none was given, just telling us to book with another airline and they maybe would reimburse us up to a certain dollar amount. But roundtrips were 400 plus a person and no direct flights but no one at frontier cares. I learned my lesson and will never fly with them again and will never recommend them to anyone. Horrible customer service and for a airline not to have a contingency plan is inexcusable.

### "they are cheaper than you think"
Houston to Philadelphia. Frontier Airlines is cheap, but they are cheaper than you think. The staff tried to send us back from the check-in counter. They tried to sell their tickets for the next day, meanwhile tried to sell our seats to someone waiting at the gate for the last minute tickets. Overall they cheated us, tried to steal from us and tried to sell the stolen goods to someone else as well. Misconduct by the staff. Frontier airlines staff at the check-in counter misinformed us about TSA service hours and asked us to go back. She also tried to sell Frontier air tickets for the next day. We would even doubt that she took 15 minutes and it was intentional to delay us. Misconduct by the airlines manager 1. When the customer asked for resolution the manager stepped in. He also misinformed us about TSA service hours and asked us to go back. The manager did not correct his staff’s mistake but instead he covered it up by arguing with us. The manager just brought up a reason that we were informed to check in early and refused to help. Both the staff and the manager explicitly said “TSA at Houston IAH airport stopped working at 11.30pm”. They also said “there is no way you are going to fly in the Frontier flight tonight”. TSA service at one terminal was closed, but we cleared the TSA check, reached the gate 2 hours before the departure and boarded the flight. The manager was there to board us. Therefore the information they gave us was wrong.

### "delayed then finally cancelled"
Had to cancel my whole vacation this past weekend by booking Frontier. Boarded plane ready to take off then turned around and de-boarded plane. Not weather related but had communication issues within plane. Told once it was fixed then not fixed, delayed 4 hrs, then finally cancelled. Tried to find another flight only to be severely disappointed with cost increases for last minute and expensive airlines. Next Frontier flight of course 2 days later giving me not even 24 hrs at my destination. Customer service less than satisfactory considering they ruin one of the few times I take time off (unpaid as well!). After already spending 9 hours in the airport and on the plane, they'll try to impress you with a one night stay in a 2 star hotel (only after a lot of insisting), offer you a future $500 travel voucher (for two people, NOT one) as if you are excited to book your next flight with them and end up costing you hotel cancellation fees, your weekend, wages, time, and much needed vacation. Save yourself the trouble and fly Southwest whenever possible. Have flown with Southwest the most and now I remember why. No delays, no cancellations, and no problems. First time flying (or trying to fly) with Frontier was my last time trying to fly with Frontier! May as well drive! You'll get there quicker and enjoy your vacation.

### "truly the worst airline"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight at approximately 13:40 pm on 14 August for a flight leaving from Seattle to Denver on the 16 August and returning on the 18 August. When finishing my purchase, apparently the airline offered me and alternate flight for different date that I didn't catch on their website. I was sent an email on the confirmation of my flight about five minutes later and realized that the flight was on the wrong date and time. I called a representative not even a minute later to let them know what happen and the only solution they had for me is to cancel the flight and receive a Airline credit and by the way you have to pay an additional 25 dollars to cancel flight in order to receive the Airline credit. I'm truly done with Frontier Airlines, they are truly the worst airline in the Continental US. Beware of doing business with this carrier.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
This was not a flight my partner and I were able to get on, per day. We flew Frontier from Denver to Albuquerque and on August 12, arrived at the Albuquerque airport to fly back to Denver via Frontier. We arrived at the airport at 12:35 pm, and had already received a text at 13:16 pm stating “Travel Alert!! Frontier flight 630 leaving from Albuquerque is delayed. Departure now estimated at 14:22.” We proceeded to go through security and the monitor confirmed the delayed flight time. We decided to eat at a restaurant in the airport due to the delay. After, we checked the monitor again and it still verified the delay. We arrived at the gate at 1:35 pm. The check-in desk screen said the flight was delayed. We sat down waiting for an update but none came. Eventually we wandered around looking for a Frontier associate but were told that we would have to exit security to speak to someone at the initial check-in desk. Before this, we checked the flight status online for an update and it said the plane departed at 2 pm, even though we arrived to the gate 25 minutes before this time and there were no final boarding calls. We left the secured area and headed to the Frontier ticketing counter, but there were no more flights going out and no Frontier employees on-site. After a long phone call with Frontier, they are reimbursing our flight, but the only other flights out through other carriers were $548 or more (with a 22 hour layover in Seattle). We settled on $612 a piece for a one-way flight from Albuquerque to Minneapolis. I will never fly Frontier again and I will gladly pay for a somewhat more expensive flight to avoid going through them. Terrible experience.

### "It left 4 hours late"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Cancun. I flew with Frontier Airlines in the past and my experience was always fine. This time I was flying a route my family and I took every year, Chicago - Cancun. I am an aviation geek as you might call it, so I caught that are flight was going to be delayed by an hour tops the night before. We got to the airport on time and waited as the time kept getting pushed back. It left 4 hours late at the end of the ordeal. The people who stood by the desk by the gate were useless. They only tried to act helpful by putting up boarding signs, even though we didn't leave for hours after that. Frontier has a policy where if you are delayed for 4 hours or more you will get a voucher. Everyone got a $10 lunch voucher! Which is outrageous, especially at O'Hare! When we landed Frontier Airlines gave everyone a $50 gift card that expired in a few months. Most people on that flight were chartered from Apple Vacations or FunJet Vacations. They wasted 12 hours of valuable time! 7 Hours at the airport, 3 in the air, 1 in the airport, and 1 in the car. We were supposed to get to the resort at 1 PM, we got there at 7 PM!

### ""Zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Denver to Charlotte. Zero customer service or compassion. My daughter’s late night Thursday flight was cancelled. Frontier only provided partial payment toward the resulting need for a hotel stay, and re-booked her on a late flight for Sat. She checked in early, sat at the gate, fell asleep after checking her flight was in time and set her alarm accordingly, but her flight was moved up, and she missed it. She was out of funds, asked for help with rescheduling and received absolutely no attempts at assistance from staff to help her find a solution to the issue created first by the cancelled flight and then by the second changed flight schedule. Would it have been too hard to wake the sleeping girl sitting at their gate for a midnight flight? Or, If they had even tried to look online after she missed it they could have found her cheaper flights in Frontier’s own airline to help her get home. But no one bothered. Customer service and compassion should be present. How sad it can’t be expected from this company:

### "never fly Frontier Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Trenton. Flight 810 August 10th was the worst experience I ever had with flying. We are currently waiting to check in our bags we arrived ever since 11am and no one has reported to the check in since 12:45. Such a horrible Service. I am disgusted and will never fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Atlanta to Los Angeles. I would not recommend this airline. There is zero customer service, the employees do not care about anything other than their cell phones. They just plain do not care & the fact that they have 2/10 (I would give negative if that were an option), yet they have done nothing to improve, shows the upper management’s level of concern for the consumers who pay their salaries. Trip was booked through a travel agent & unfortunately, we will not use him again either, primarily due to the entire Frontier experience.

### "additional $311 to keep my flight"
Not Verified |  I was online trying to add a checked bag to my flight and I somehow accidentally cancelled my flight. I immediately called back and advised them of the mistake. I spoke to 5 different people and I escalated it all the way to customer relations. They all advised me that regardless if it was an accident that I would have to pay an additional $311 to keep my flight. I was shocked. They then tried to charge me $10 for making the change through representative. I strongly recommend paying extra to book through any other airline. It is not worth the small savings you get by going through Frontier. I have never been the victim of a policy like this that is enforced regardless of circumstance and will never be flying Frontier again.

### "telling me i was late"
Not Verified |  Arrived 45 minutes before a frontier flight to phl. Stood on line while 2 agents worked and 3 congregated behind a open checkin terminal talking and not helping anyone on line. Finally, one of the 3 waved their hands for us to come over just to tell us we were late the flight leaves at 1230 and we had only 29 minutes. They proceeded to say they can not check us in since we had to check in bags. I let them know we had no bags to check. One agent turned the computer screen with the supervisor there for us to see in clear view of other people in the path of the screen. The screen contained real time seating charts and they pointed at the screen to tell me the flight was overbooked so they could not help me anyway. I asked for a later flight or the next morning but they said I had to buy a flight with a different airline. The flight ended up leaving late at 1250. I called frontier customer service and the agent on the phone just kept on repeating a script, telling me i was late. I had to purchase new flights with a different airline. I raised concerns to frontier management about the customer service and about showing a passenger real time seating charts. They stated they will note things down but only could do that. Ultimately, offered no real solution. Out money and time. Phl is very clique and frontier is terrible at all things airline services. Do not recommend.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
Denver to Phoenix. We got to the airport at about 8 in the morning and our flight was supposed to start boarding at 9:15 and leave by 10:30 they finally let us board at 11:30 and we all sat in the plane till 12:30 and they made us all get back off to wait for another hour. They have pushed it back three times now and it is 1 in the afternoon and we’re still sitting at the gate with no updates. They won’t tell us why they are doing all of this just "oh we don’t know". I would not recommend this airline.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I was on the second stop of my trip from Albuquerque to Salt Lake City and the layover was in Denver. When I left Albuquerque the agents at the Frontier ticket counter assured me that my carry-on was fine to take on the plane. The first flight was ok. When boarding the plane in Denver the ticket agent was incredibly rude. She raised her voice at several passengers and had us wait to board insisting we needed to pay for our carry-ons. Said she wasn’t going to lose her job over us and we should’ve paid before hand. Very unprofessional! The flight boarded at 10:00pm and we sat on the plane for an hour and 20 minutes before finally leaving. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "paid to take my guitar by plane"
Not Verified |  I have been traveling with my guitar to different places in the world for 3 years and I have never paid to take my guitar by plane. It happens that today, August 20, I had to pay 60 dollars that I did not have on my card because I had to I call my wife so that she transferred the money to my card.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Charlotte to Las Vegas. This is my first time flying frontier. We got an email saying our flight times had changed going and returning with no explanation. Then when we arrive at the gate, we were informed that our flight was delayed 3 hrs, which caused me again and inconvenience. We are travelling for business. While I understand, delays happening but entire flight had been rearranged. I'm also seeing a pattern that the airline has issues with being on time period. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "never get my business again"
Boston to Ontario via Orlando. Avoid Frontier airlines like plague! Worst customer service I have received. Needed to get confirmation of flight over the phone, bad idea, airline rep. would not meet simple request. Wasted my time on phone trying to get information correct and was disconnected not getting the email info I was needing. The boarding desks, a joke, I could not get a airline representative answer a simple question. A fellow passenger yelled out on the plane the best description of the airline while on the plane. Greedy! This company will never get my business again, period.

### "not recommend this airline"
Denver to Buffalo. My mom past away and needed a quick ticket back east. I flew Frontier years ago when they were the Cadillac of airlines. Now they in my opinion are not very good. I purchase bag and boarding passes but when at airport they did not have kiosks to check baggage , had to wait in line 1-1/2 hours for someone to check my baggage and tag it. Then even though they had seat assigned they loaded weird first passenger's that paid for full baggage then passenger that paid for carry on then the rest instead of by row. The seats were terribly uncomfortable. They were hard narrow and did not recline. You had to pay for better seats. The seat I had was dirty and pocket and floor food spilled all over. Then snacks you had to pay for anything other than water. I would not recommend this airline there are better discount airlines.

### "worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  Denver to New York . People's Movers - that's how to qualify Frontier. July 2019 RT 4 hours flight from Denver to New York was a torture: not a single TV screen on board, ugly food for $$, and seats are not reclining! A Greyhound is more comfortable! The worst flying experience in my entire life.

### "I don’t recommend Frontier"
Providence to Charlotte. At first, the flight price was reasonable until you start to look into the price of baggage and seating. I pre-paid online for my bags and paid additional costs to be able to sit in the first row to give more room for my ESA who is a well trained GSD that has flown a dozen times with other airlines and never had an issue. Other than the costs, what really was distasteful was after I was aboard the plane the attendants made me aware I would be unable to sit in the front row even though I paid for it because I had an animal. I told them I paid extra and hadn’t ever had issues with this before. Half the attendants agreed with me and half said it was a new policy just this week. No one could give me a straight answer other than they needed to find me a different seat. I was very put off by this because I have followed all the rules and even paid additional fees to be sure I was accommodated and yet, the attendants didn’t seem confident in the actual policy themselves. I don’t recommend Frontier not only because of hidden fees but because of the disorganization and failure to accommodate those who actually follow all policies. Southwest has always gone above and beyond for myself and my ESA so I regret my decision to try a new airline. Hope this helps someone out.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Hartford to Ontario via Denver. When I checked in, the clerk saw I had a carry on — I said I wasn’t checking it and he did not advise me that I would have to pay extra. When I got to the gate they told me it cost double to pay at the gate. $60 extra one way to carry on my bag. I will never fly Frontier again if I can help it.

### "Horrible customer service"
Seattle to Denver. My flight was for 24 July at 6:35pm, the flight was delayed by 3 hours that we didn’t get any notification for till we got to the airport. At the airport, Frontier does not have any kiosk for self checkin or printing boarding passes. There was one counter with 2 frontier employees that were helping the almost 100 passengers in line. I waited in line for almost 2 hours just to get to the frontier rep. Horrible customer service. They had no valid reason why flight was delayed except technical issues. They donot care about their customers or their customer’s time. A gentleman in line had an overweight bag which they made him pay for the extra lbs. They could have just let him take those few lbs without having to pay that extra money as a way of compensation for the 3 hr pls delay of flight. Horrible! Donot fly Frontier!

### "our experience was so awful"
Salt Lake City to Boston. We had a few flights scheduled with Frontier Airlines on June 29th, 2019. The first flight out of Salt Lake was supposed to depart at 10:10 AM but there was a delay because the plane that we were supposed to board had not arrived on time. We understand that with flying there can be delays so this didn't bother us too much. We ended up departing Salt Lake City to Denver around 10:40 AM. Once we had arrived at Denver w started our scheduled 6-hour layover to our next flight with Frontier to Boston. The flight was scheduled to depart at 6:15. The flight was again delayed but with no notice this time. We waited around for 1 hour before even being able to board the flight. Then we had to wait an additional hour for our flight attendants that were landing on a different flight scheduled to arrive at 6:25. First of all, if all the flights had been on time, I would like to know how we were expected to leave at 6:15 when our flight attendants were not expected to land until 6:25. Not surprisingly there flight arrived 40 minutes later then the scheduled 6:25. At this point we are noticing a theme that all flights with Frontier have been delayed due to what seems to be poor scheduling and even the pilots were extremely frustrated. Every person between TSA, stand in flight attendants, pilots and passengers were extremely frustrated with the lack of communication and issues that seemed like they could've been avoided from the start. I have never had such a bad experience flying from Salt Lake to Boston before. These issues definitely seemed to be avoidable and even if they weren't, the communication and empathy for our frustrations could've been a lot better since there was a definite lack of both. Due to the great inconvenience and horrible service, I am requesting to have a refund credited to my card that I had purchased the tickets from. Our experience was so awful we will never be flying with Frontier Airlines again. This was absolutely unacceptable.

### "flight had been canceled"
Denver to Washington Dulles. On July 22, 2019 I went to the airport to board my flight from Denver to Washington Dulles. When I arrived I found out the flight had been canceled. There was no explanation why. When I went to customer service at the airport they handed us a piece of paper which said we could get a refund on our ticket Or a book a new ticket and they would reimburse up to $500 in two weeks. The result was after speaking with other passengers that everyone who did not live in Denver or surrounding lost some of their own money even though this was not their fault. My flight cost $560 in addition I had to lay that money out and send documents and I’m now hoping in two weeks I will get $500 back. There was a car option to drive but no hotel option. A woman sitting in front of me on the United flight I rebooked to get home that day told me she spent 100 or more dollars of her own money. I would really like to know how this is even legal. They sent us a coupon code for $100 on a flight. The people I spoke with all said they will never fly Frontier again

### "such a horrendous experience"
Baltimore to Orlando via Houston. My first experience on Frontier will be my last. I have flown countless times on various airlines, including budget airlines in Thailand, Guatemala, and Panama, and have never had such a horrendous experience. After being delayed over an hour we finally boarded our plane, I was content thinking my checked bag was safe and sound under the plane. It is nice boarding with a small personal item not having to find room for a carry-on bag. The flight landed late into Houston and I began the rush to the baggage claim, anxious to get some shut-eye in my own bed. After waiting for close to an hour for my bag, me and three others were left bagless. Moving upstairs we found some Frontier representatives on their phone confused as to how our bags did not arrive. Over the next three days, I was put through endless circles of atrocious outsourced customer service representatives. Throughout this time I chatted with about 20 different customer service reps and various airport staff; hearing different stories. My bag had been found and lost again once, and then permanently lost, with zero concern, assistance, or assurance from Frontier. On day four I took matters into my own hands and begun contacting airport baggage service offices. Finally, I was dealing with friendly and understanding airport (not airline) staff. I seemed confident my bag may indeed be found. Day 5. My girlfriend and I began to compile an Excel spreadsheet with all of our missing items in the checked bag with the corresponding dollar amount to bring to a Frontier supervisor at our closest airport because we still had no news about our bag. Frontier had told me every day I would receive an email and phone call within the hour pertaining to my bag and I never heard a word. Day 6. I receive a call from IAH (Houston) baggage service department that my bag had been found! Another airline sent this bag on their plane when Frontier brought it to them days later. I still never heard an apology or was refunded for any submitted expenses from Frontier.

### "There are truly no savings"
Not Verified |  West Palm Beach to Islip. This is my third flight with Frontier and the third time a flight has been delayed! This airline should ever ever be your first choice when searching flights! Unless you’re desperate go anywhere else. Terminal crew are rude and abrupt. In Flight attendants are inattentive. Bought the same drink on my flight down that my seat neighbor bought. Attendant gave her two bottles of vodka for her beverage because she in conversation she said she had five kids. Same drink he gave me one bottle. Never asked how many kids I have. (Five too) In general your tray table is too small to hold your drink and your cell phone. Seats don’t recline. By the time you pay for a carry on and anything else they nickel and dime you for, you could fly another airline. There are truly no savings on this airline in reality.

### "a 16 hour layover in Denver"
Norfolk to Portland via Denver. Changed our flights after we had already flown to our destination. Return flight is a debacle - now with a 16 hour layover in Denver! Will, most probably, be fired from my job due to this change. They, also, charge for everything!! Not worth a penny to fly with Frontier.

### "treatment was completely absurd"
Atlanta to Miami. This was my first flight with Frontier. Myself, my sister, my brother and 4 more of our friends were traveling to Miami to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday. Our flight was delayed three times and then ultimately cancelled due to 'weather'. Other flights left that same airport going to that same destination without incident. If there were truly weather conditions I completely understand. However, the treatment that we received after being completely blindsided by the cancellation and devasted by not having any other options was completely absurd. Frontier airlines showed absolutely no remorse for the inconvenience that all of their passengers were facing. Trips to Paris, weddings and honey moons were also plagued by this unfortunate event. They tried to make us keep our returning flights, they were hesitant to return the money we spent on baggage and they lost one of our passengers bags. How do you lose a bag and we never left the airport. Me nor anyone in my family or friend circle will ever fly Frontier Airlines. If you are looking for whether you should or not. Please don't!

### "nobody caring whatsoever"
❎ Not Verified | Orlando to Cincinnati. Don't fly Frontier. Not worth the risk. The flight was delayed but we weren't notified until boarding started about an hour later. The guy working the gate kept "hiding". After boarded, went to get our seats but they were taken. The flight attendant said they overbooked and had me and my 2 daughters stand until they find us seats. We get seats and smell like burning rubber. Take off and about 20 minutes later, the pilot says we are rerouting back to Orlando because of an issue with the door. Had to deplane. Long story short, they kept saying we would fly out but then after midnight once customers started getting emails, they made an announcement they have a plane but no pilots. No flight next day available, flights after that are first come first serve. It was a chaotic mess. No one knew how to handle the situation. I specifically asked if we had to use the link they provided on paper and he replied no just screenshot your new reservation on Delta. The paper they gave us had no number to call for assistance. Paid $1200.00 out of pocket to be told a week later it'll take 4 to 6 weeks to get our money back. To sum it up, they lied, scammed, deceitful and took full advantage of us with nobody caring whatsoever.

### "constantly delayed or cancelling flights"
Las Vegas to Austin. Frontier is constantly delayed or cancelling flights. They advertise low cost fares but nickel and dime you to death on extra charges for inflight drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic. This airline is beyond cheap. Buyer beware. By the time you add up all of the extra costs, you are better off on any other major carrier.

### "such bad business techniques"
Not Verified |  I fly frequently and had my first Frontier experience this week. They cancelled my flight and were only able to offer a flight four days later. There was no inclement weather whatsoever. I was given the option of staying where I was stranded and paying for three days of accommodations or getting half a refund on my ticket while I had to pay triple the price to get my one way ticket from a different airline due to the last minute cancellation. I cannot believe this is considered a legitimate business. I truly have never seen such bad business techniques in my life - agents yelling over me while I was calmly talking, rude and condescending comments, and zero apologies for the cancellation, inability to book me on another flight, and stealing koney from me. I was also on the phone with them for 5 hours total the day of the cancelled flight. Complete train wreck situation. Above all, they were dishonest and practiced slimy business the entire process. I will obviously never fly with them again but absolutely want to warn others as I would hate for more people to get taken advantage of too. In reviewing other people's reviews I came across someone who gave a "how to survive a Frontier flight" review. I would add to expect to be scammed, disrespected, lied to, and treated less like a customer and more like target. Don't be their next victim!

### "flight was canceled"
Not Verified |  Delayed flight for 2 hours. Boarded plane at 12:30 AM and when all boarding was completed flight was canceled. They had no crew. Claimed it was weather related. No compensation. They are awful.

### "absolutely terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Orange County to Denver. I am so irritated with this airline. Do not be fooled by the “less expensive “tickets on this absolutely terrible airline. They have zero people or service skills and repeatedly fail every time I’ve made the mistake to fly with them. Never again will I willingly give this company my money. Stay far away and pay the extra few bucks for a company that cares about your experience and time.

### "could not check in online"
Syracuse to Phoenix via Denver. Frontier Airlines will not allow you to check in for your flight and print boarding passes if you are not checking a bag or declaring that you have a carry on item, they make you check in at the airport and get your boarding passes from the customer service rep. My kids were flying with only one personal item each and therefore could not check in online. The website said to get to the airport 45 minutes early to check your bags and get your boarding pass. My kids having no bags to check showed up at the Frontier counter 42 minutes before their flight. The Frontier Airlines customer service rep at the Syracuse Hancock Airport refused to issue my kid's their boarding passes for a flight that was not set to depart for another 42 minutes, claiming that it was a TSA guideline that kept her from doing so. This was at an airport that two days later my family of 5 showed up to the airport, checked 2 bags and received boarding passes from two different airlines and got through security (even with two of us going through more extensive security checks) all within 10 minutes of arriving at this airport. I have arrived at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport 30 minutes before a flight and never had an issue getting my boarding pass or getting on my flight, but then again I had not tried that with a Frontier flight. The Frontier Airlines rep is not a TSA employee and therefore should have issued the boarding passes and then if TSA had a problem with the time they arrived they could have handled it. This was unacceptable behavior and we are out almost $700.00 for these two flights and my kid's lost two days of work. I will never fly Frontier again and with 3 of my 5 family members working at the Grand Canyon National Park we will be sure to help spread the word to the 7 million visitors we get each year.

### "procedures are dismal"
Kansas to Philadelphia via Denver. The procedures within this organisation are dismal. At check in the have insufficient staff which leads to lines. There is no useful communication directing people where to line up when the limited ribboned areas are overflowing. The check-in process for me took 58 minutes, and I had prepaid my bags. Our flight was then delayed by 85 minutes to 9:40 but did not commence boarding until 9:45. Passengers were checked through to the sky bridge until it was full, with no air conditioning, but not onto the plane. This was due to a ‘maintenance issue’ but the procedure was not in place to either communicate a further delay or to prevent passengers being checked through to the sky bridge. There appears to be a culture of getting the job done without having a systemised procedure.

### "I'll never use Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I was recently a passenger on the flight on July 6th from Philadelphia to Orlando. On the way there we were supposed to arrive in Orlando by 4 pm. Due to their being a rain storm in Orlando, we were delayed a good while and had to stop at Tampa International Airport for more fuel. We ended up flying into the rain storm in Tampa instead of just flying to our destination in Orlando. Because of this, we did not arrive at our Disney resort until 12 am. I was fine with that since I know that this was just to ensure that we were safe rather than traveling through a storm. We knew passengers on our flight here from Philadelphia who got off in Tampa and said they would not be returning through Frontier. We were still hopeful and gave the company another chance. Then on what was supposed to be the day of our flight back, we were delayed some more. Our flight was set to leave on July 11th at 2:01 pm. We were then told that our flight had been delayed until 5pm. At about 4:36 pm we were informed that our flight had been cancelled. Our family members back home had already left for the airport waiting for our arrival, and we then had to tell them to turn around and go back home. We were forced to book another hotel room for the night and had to wake up extremely early on July 12th to make it back to the airport. We were not given any food vouchers, hotel vouchers or any other accommodations that airlines regularly make for people going through these issues. I had to miss work the following day, July 12th due to all of the travel changes and delays. This travel experience inconvenienced my whole trip and made me realize that I'll never use Frontier again.

### "flight was continuously delayed"
Seattle to Cleveland. I couldn’t drop off my luggage until 2 hrs before departure, even though the TSA line was long. The flight was continuously delayed with no mention by the gate attendant. (it could have been nice to get an announcement every time the time changed) Later on she was doing it more but nothing compared to other flight experiences. 3) The flight was delayed 5+ hours. This delay was known prior to the initial departing time. However, it wasn’t until 2.5+ hours after the initial departure that the line decided to cancel the flight due to employee fatigue. I understand the extra workload is a lot for them. However, prior to departure time it was known the flight was delayed 5+ hours. If they knew the extended hours meant the employees couldn’t work, why didn’t they let is know earlier? My family could have booked another flight during that time. My family could have been home! Never again am I giving my money to Frontier.

### "Going back to Delta"
Not Verified |  I was scheduled to go to IAD from MCO on 7/11. I am sitting here on 7/12 at a motel, I had to book last minute because Frontier decided to cancel our flight. When I first arrived there was no staff at the podium. Received the first info on my nightmare by text. There was some rain in DC. I sat for hours to be told “delayed, delayed, delayed”. Then we finally board the aircraft and taxi for positioning. Long story short on that, we sat on the plane for 2 hours, only to run low on fuel, be deplaned and have our flight cancelled. Why? Not because of the weather that had finally cleared, but because the crew had “been on the clock too long”. Not one comp was offered for the trouble. I came to MCO at 11 am. Left at 8.30 pm. I am a Type 1 diabetic who mentioned low blood sugar. Nothing was offered. Not a soda. Not even water. I feel like the discount price comes in the form of you being willing to accept the treatment of cattle, not the treatment that human beings deserve. No compassion. Just indifference. I am rescheduled to leave Sunday. We’ll see how that goes. Next time though? Going back to Delta. Would rather pay more and actually get there.

### "a great flight"
❎ Not Verified | Charlotte to Las Vegas. My first flight on Frontier Airlines was great. Very enjoyable and comfortable. The entire staff was excellent. The only negative thing was having to pay for my checked baggage otherwise, I give them a five-star rating. Would definitely fly this airline again.

### "absolute worst travel day"
Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Nashville via Denver. Today has been the absolute worst travel day of my life thanks to Frontier. This was my first and last time flying this joke of an airline, as they have disappointed at absolutely every opportunity. Firstly, my first leg flight was delayed almost 3 hours, and we weren’t offered so much as a free soda as compensation for the inconvenience. In fact, I was told that there was a charge for everything except water. The staff was indifferent and the landing the roughest I have ever experienced. Then, they changed the gate for my connecting flight at the last minute without any notification whatsoever, causing me to almost miss my connection. Then, that flight was also delayed because they decided to kick off an elderly man for being “unaccompanied,” and then threatened to kick off all the passengers who spoke out against this cruel and unnecessary act. I am not the kind of person to get salty about little things, and this is the first negative review I have written about anything, ever, but I have had such an exceptionally bad experience I feel the need to speak out. Please, pay the extra 50 to 100 bucks and fly with a halfway competent airline. I know I will.

### "Frontier is very unprofessional"
Philadelphia to New Orleans. This will be my first and last time flying with Frontier. I was told 2 hours before the flight was supposed to take off while I was checking in my bags that the flight was cancelled. The reasoning: because there was no pilot. That made absolutely no sense to me. There was a national convention and about 75+ other sisters from my sorority were just as confused as I was. Instead of trying to find another flight ASAP, our only options were to fly out the next day, get a refund, or find another airline. Other airlines charged anywhere between 500-1000 dollars to book the day of. Frontier wouldn’t reimburse until days later. The worst of it all? They only gave a $100 voucher. Who can travel with $100?! Long story short, Frontier is very unprofessional and I don’t see myself giving them a dime ever again.

### "you get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  Flight wasn't bad on the way there, but one of the flight attendants on the way back was extremely rude. They lost my wife's bag en route to Las Vegas, which pretty much put a damper on the entire vacation. It's been a few weeks since we filed the initial report with the Frontier's baggage claim staff, and I haven't heard anything back except for automated emails. I called today to find out what was going on, and they told me I needed to file a 3rd report in order for them to track the bag. From what I've seen, no one at this company is aware of their processes and they are not willing to answer my questions regarding compensation for my bag or divulge any meaningful information. The worst part is I was foolish enough to sign up for the "Discount Den", and, according to the "customer feedback representative" I will be unable to recoup that money. So I will be able to get discounts on flights for the next year from an airline I will never use again. Great. Go ahead and just fly American, Southwest, or Delta and save yourself the hassle, you get what you pay for.

### "It wasn’t explained very well"
Our flight was to leave Philly at 5.40pm on 6/28/19. We boarded and were told that due to some minor storms in Allentown many flights were being rerouted and so the tarmac was backed up. We were number 27 in line for take off. Everyone waited patiently and approx 2 hours later we were told we were getting ready for flight. A few minutes later the pilot got on and told us that we needed to head back to the gate because if we flew at that time, he would be over the 9 hour limit of time they’re allowed per day. I would assume they could figure this out when we were number 27 in line. We were told that hopefully they could get new pilots and we were given $15 vouchers for food (but at this point it was 8.30 and the restaurants in the airport closed at 8.30). We waited and reboarded at 10.45, hungry. Many people had left to other flights. Once boarded we were told by the pilot that this particular plane flies on computers and the computer was down. (Makes a passenger a little uneasy.) So it would take 5 minutes to reboot. At this point people got very anxious and they tried to reboot a second time and a third. I went up and asked that the staff explain the situation as people were getting very scared and another woman asked if we would be refunded if we left. Most Staff said they could not guarantee refund but one staff stepped up and took those that wanted to get off out and did fully refund the flights. Even the one staff member said she didn’t blame us for being concerned. It wasn’t explained very well. The flight eventually did leave at 3 am (I believe) and did make it. But those people sat for numerous hours on the plane and in my opinion a pretty nerve wracking situation as far as safety (from passenger perspective). We ended up altering our vacation by 3 days and booking on another airline at 3 times the price due to last min tix. For 6 ppl, it was a huge expense and our jobs were affected by date changes. If you have a set schedule choose elsewhere.

### "Frontier just has bad logistic planners"
I tried to fly Frontier Airlines from Dallas to Philadelphia on Sunday June 7 2019 on the 11.26 pm flight but to no avail. After 5 text messages on delays, delays, delays they finally cancelled the flight at 1.11 am on Monday morning. After sitting in the airport all night into the early morning Frontier cancelling the flight after Spirit and an American Airlines flight arrived from Philadelphia who departed nearly the same time as Frontier would have from PHL all arrived in Dallas. You certainly cannot blame the weather. We were offered re-booking on Frontiers next flight out of DFW, on Tuesday. You of course would have to sleep 2 days in the airport because Frontier does not offer any compensation for hotel, rental car, food. Nothing. We were told by the gate agent that you can get a refund in 5-7 business days just go on Frontier website and fill out their forms. Just seems a little suspicious that 2 other airlines flying the same routs did not encounter any "bad weather". I think that Frontier just has bad logistic planners!

### "Super unhelpful and unprofessional"
Not Verified |  Denver to Boston. Never fly with these scammers. My flight was delayed 2 hours (initially for unspecified reasons) and when we boarded the plane, the flight attendants announced that the pilots should arrive any minute. After an hour when they still had not shown up, we were deplaned, and the flight was canceled about 4.5 hours after we were supposed to depart. The customer service person told us we would likely get vouchers for $400-500. The vouchers we got? $100. Super unhelpful and unprofessional. You’re better off staying home than flying with Frontier Airlines.

### "Never trust these scammers"
Not Verified |  Absolutely awful company. Do not, I repeat, absolutely do not ever fly with Frontier. They claim to be the cheapest flights around then proceed to charge you for every single aspect of flying - you want to sit by your child? $25 per person, per way to sit by your own child. Bags? A purse won't even cut it for a carry on - another $38 per bag, per person, per way. Absolutely insane. We had to cancel one of our flights ($150 flight) for outside reasons and the representative charged us $119 each ticket to cancel. They, then, added a cherry on top by saying that we did not actually get the money back, it was in a travel credit with their company. So we didn't even get face value for our tickets! They explained that they can transfer our tickets to another flight time - perfect. Or so it sounded. Nope. They charge you $119 to transfer tickets as well! They charge you to the same amount to lose you as a customer by canceling as they do to keep you by transferring - no benefit of transferring. Trash company ran by money hungry awful humans who claim to be the best, cheapest flight option. Never trust these scammers. They get you with fine print and shiny cheap labels that are quickly overtaken by baggage fees, seat assignment fees, and the list goes on. Never in my life will I ever give this company my business again, and I pray you don't either.

### "never book with them again"
Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Philadelphia. Do not book Frontier. June 17, 2019 Frontier cancelled our return flight 4 hours prior. Recourse: next flight 5 days later. Nothing else: no assistance booking with other airline or hotel, no accommodations. Just: good luck, so long. Two terminal attendants just to deliver this line, nothing else. I ended up eating $800 new flights and extended rental car to fly home. Will never book with them again.

### "out over $400 from extra day/night"
Tampa to Las Vegas. After 8 hours of saying our flight was 'delayed', they finally cancelled it. They printed a letter stating we had two options - one to book another flight with Frontier and receive $500 in travel vouchers, or book with another airline and receive $500 in travel vouchers. I found another Frontier flight online for the next day (24 hours later), however the representatives at the flight desk were telling all of the other passengers the next flight wasn't available until 2 days later. I brought my computer and the flight I found to the receptionist and she pulled me aside and asked me not to tell other passengers this flight existed! And told me not to book it with my card and kept pushing that she would book me personally. They were so shady about the whole thing, but we were desperate to get home. They were nice enough to book us a hotel for one night - not two nights. So, we checked in at 5AM and had to check out at 11AM! We had to pay for the extra night, food and transportation to the hotel ourselves!! After all was said and done, I called Frontier about my $500 travel voucher they promised and was told I no longer qualified because the receptionist booked my flight - not me! Looking back, she purposefully conned me into booking the flight herself so Frontier wouldn't have to give me any sort of travel voucher. I'm out over $400 from the extra day/night in Las Vegas.

### "can't imagine using them again"
Not Verified |  Denver to Minneapolis. This was the first time We have used Frontier Airlines, and we can't imagine using them again. The only positive from the whole experience was that their counter representative was friendly, pleasant, and helpful. I booked the flights over four months in advance to make sure we were not going to run into scheduling issues. Less than two weeks later, I receive notification that they were delaying our flights six hours from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM with no explanation. That got us into MPS at midnight instead of dinner time. So after getting our car from the park and fly, we made it home to Duluth at 4 AM. Thanks a lot! Also, the plane we flew home on had the most uncomfortable, cheap seats we have ever encountered in our time flying. (If a usual plane compares to a coach bus, think of Frontier as a school bus) I have no idea if this is how Frontier is to fly with normally, but I can't imagine they will stay in business if that is the case.

### "not be flying with them again"
Detroit to Orlando. I am very disappointed with Frontier Airlines. My flight was supposed to leave from Detroit at 10:09am and is now delayed until 2:30pm because battery acid was spilled in the cargo area. I do not recommend Frontier, and I will not be flying with them again after my experience.

### "incident was handled poorly"
San Diego to Denver. I will never fly Frontier again. There were 3 of us traveling together. The flight was delayed and then rescheduled to the next day. They would only give us 1 voucher for the 3 of us for the hotel. We had a difficult time finding a hotel and restaurants that would accept their vouchers. The whole incident was handled poorly.

### "made my travel a living nightmare"
Not Verified |  Denver to Orlando. It will definitely be the last time I ever fly with them! They made my travel a living nightmare. My honest opinion their too expensive for the quality of service you receive. Pay the money to fly a different airline, it's worth out! From the moment we went to check in, they were yelling at you and if they weren't yelling at you they were ignoring you, rolling their eyes, or making snooty comments. Their flights are never on time. If you're flying with young children I recommend not taking this airline. If you don't purchase where your sitting you'll probably be on the other end of the plane than your child. And there's nothing there gonna be able to do about it. If you have a stroller make sure it's very sturdy and cheap. It will be thrown around and if pieces come off of it, they will just throw it away. And they will enjoy telling you that. Don't bother going to customer service because they're just as useless and disrespectful as the rest of the staff. By the look on their face can care less about what you got to say to them. They will tell you that "if they find anything they will probably just throw it away". If you're flying solo or just adults with a carry on it might be worth flying with them. If you can handle the rudeness, disrespect, and not being on time.

### "worst customer service experience"
Nashville to Chicago. Frontier cancelled this flight just as we arrived at the airport, due to some issue on their side. Since they have no partnerships with any other airlines, their offered option was the next Frontier flight, which was 2 days later! Missed 2 days of work and had extra expenses with pet boarding, hotels etc. After spending over an hour on the phone with customer service and escalating to the supervisor, their "customer service" compensation for my "inconvenience" was a $25 travel voucher. By far, the worst customer service experience I've ever had in my life. will never fly this airline again nor recommend this airline to anyone either. Please do yourself a favor and use an airline that cares for their customers and has a real level of customer service. Would have rated a "0" if permissible.

### "blatant lack of care"
Not Verified |  Atlanta to Las Vegas. I booked a flight with my family and had no knowledge that it was a requirement to check in early or the previous day for our family to be able to sit together. They didn’t care if my family sat together or not and said we should have just paid extra for us to sit together. It’s not really what they said, but how they treated the situation. It was very apparent that it wasn’t important to them. My Frontier flight to Las Vegas has been a bad experience today, with no one willing to help. When asked if there was something that was able to be done I was told “let me check”, without looking at his computer screen then followed by “there’s nothing I can do to help.” On top of this, the rude representatives talked about customers behind their backs as soon as they walked away, in front of other passengers waiting at the desk. Along with complaining about other team members behind their back. But it wasn’t not being able to sit together that pushed me to write this review it was the blatant lack of care that made me feel it was my duty to warn anyone from dealing with the mess they call an airline team.

### "Frontier doesn't care about the customer"
Philadelphia to Dallas Fort-Worth. Imagine the slimiest, most immoral, dirtiest cheat of a car salesman you can think of. I would like to enter a review of how the actual flight was, but I wouldn't know, because Frontier decided they wanted to cancel my flight 1 hour after it was supposed to depart. This is bad enough, but they then refused to refund the cost of the flight after they said they would. They handed me a paper saying they would reimburse the cost of my next flight up to $400 if I submitted my ticket. I did this, and two weeks later, I received a follow up email stating they would not refund the cost of my flight because it was cancelled by the ATC. I called customer service and they said I was a no show, which is a lie. Frontier doesn't care about the customer. I don't even think they care about money because the way they run their business is idiotic. In summary, I paid $200 to be told by their horrible customer service that I didn't show up to a flight that was cancelled, despite having the baggage tags to prove it. Unfortunately there is no option for negative value for money.

### "never book with Frontier Airlines again"
Phoenix to Chicago. My flight was cancelled and I received my notice at all - no email, no SMS. I was continually checking the flight status on the airline site and it was not shown as cancelled. I only found out when I arrived at the terminal. Frontier cancelled the flight for "weather" (standard snow) but I knew that other airlines were flying out such as AA, United and Delta. I was offered a flight 6 days later which I could not accept. They offered no other options. Because of my work schedule and monetary reasons, I was forced to buy a ticket on another airline which was six times the cost because it was a last-minute purchase. Their customer care offered no compensation for the huge inconvenience and cost. They even claimed they sent an email about the cancellation. That is not true. I purchased my check-in bag online after the supposed cancellation email and I received an confirmation email for the purchase. I also received an email the day before for early check in. So their claim rings hollow. When I told their customer service about my issue, they responded with a canned message. No empathy, no concern. I will never book with Frontier Airlines again and I recommend the same to anyone reading this. Save yourself the misery.

### "I will never use again"
Direct flight from Fort Myers to Milwaukee was cancelled. Frontier staff did nothing to help the passengers find alternate flights home and left all the passengers to figure it out on their own. Now will not receive reimbursement check for 4-6 weeks. Horrible airline that I will never use again.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Cancun to Denver. Do not fly this airline. The worst airline I have ever flown on. Had a diversion due to an emergency and had to land at a different airport, no drinks or snacks were offered during the sit on the runway for over an hour. Sent us out at the Dallas airport with very little info. Most passengers were lost and as we tried to get through security again, no one knew about the emergency landing so we were kicked out of lines only to have to go through 2 more times. Offered a $15 voucher for $500 tickets.

### "customer service is horrible"
Norfolk to San Diego via Orlando. Flight booked for my adult daughter through Priceline on frontier. The first flight boarded but didn’t take off. After an hour my daughter got off the plane. Weather issues (not the airlines fault). The connecting flight also was cancelled. The first flight took off 7 hours later. We already left the airport with a phone number the airline gave us to rebook. Called the number for 4 days. Only got through twice and was hung up on. Today I had Priceline call and connect me with frontier and I was hung up on by frontier again. Called Priceline again and they were going to stay on the call until it was completed except they could not even get through to frontier. Waited a couple hours and called frontier again. I finally got through and the representative repeatedly informed me that we were a no show and the flight had taken off! I told him that I have an email that says the flight was cancelled. He then asked if we were even at the airport and maybe we were a no show. I asked him if he could see the $50 charge for her bag. He said yes. So obviously we were at the airport since we paid for it at the counter. He then told me again that the flight had taken off. Every time I was speaking he would talk over me. 2 other family members had their flights cancelled on the same day but were flying on a different airline. They had no problem rebooking. I was informed that my only option was to receive a travel voucher refund and I could then book a new flight on frontier. No thanks! In the end I received a refund and will book her return flight on any other airline. I will never fly on Frontier. If you have a problem their customer service is horrible.

### "avoid flying with this airline"
Don't be incited by their low prices. Go ahead and book the more expensive flight! Me and two other colleges flew Frontier from Orlando to St. Louis. A quick two our flight there and back for a two day trip. The trip there, our flight was delayed an hour. This was after the gate was changed twice! The flight staff all seemed incredibly confused. The pilot spoke over the intercom like: "Welcome uh to Frontier uh Airlines. We're um...flying to St. uh uh Louis. We should um uh get there soon and safe..." However, all this was forgivable. We received news that our 6:30AM flight back to Orlando was cancelled 30 minutes before it was scheduled to board. Leave us and about 40 other people stranded. After being left standing around for forty-five minutes or so, the airline contacted us about of cancelled flight through text to offer $100 vouchers for an upcoming flight with them to compensate. This did not work because the next flight to our destination or anywhere near our destination wasn't until the next morning. After seeing this I called their customer service line to weigh my options. This is the only redeeming quality of the airline. A person answered immediately and gave me many solutions: the best being to book a flight to our destination through any airline and they'd reimburse us up to $500 per person. Although difficult, we did find a flight the day of within our financial restrictions. Still costing a little over $1400 for the three of us. It was three connecting flights from St. Louis to Houston to Pensacola, to Orlando, departing at 11:30AM and arriving at 11:10PM. Thanks to the unreliable quality of Frontier what was supposed to be a two hour commute stretched into 12 hours. I lost and entire day to correcting their shortcomings and now have to was 7-14 business days for a $1400 check in the mail. I appreciate each customer service representative I spoke to, they did their job immaculately, but the airline's one job of getting people to their destination wasn't accomplished. I cannot express my flat out anger and extreme exhaustion after the incident. Do everything you can to avoid flying with this airline. From my day wasted at multiple airports, I also noticed quite a few delayed Frontier flights for other destinations. And I didn't even mention the just okay quality of the one flight I did have with them! They couldn't get me to book with them again even if it was free. I would rather walk.

### "She said the plane was gone"
Nashville to Las Vegas. We saved up for the trip for months. My husband was taking me to Vegas for my birthday. We were at the airport 3 hours early. Got checked in went to find out just were we would be boarding and the walked to get food. It was 45 minutes before time to get on the plane. We walked back to the area the lady was on her phone talking to a friend. I know this because I could hear her conversation when I walked up to see if we were still in the right area. Well we got in the boarding line when we got to the check in door the girl taking the ticket said please go to the counter. I said for what, I had read all the bad things about this airlines but hey I try to stay positive we were excited about a getaway. We talked to the so called Supervisor. She said the plane was gone, she said she announced it several times I said but we were right here I even talked to her. She became rude saying well you all are the only ones that did not here me. Well can we get on another flight no she states well can we get our money back .. no it's not my fault she states. Then threatens to call security. What about our bags they are in the flight that has left. She said what you want me to do? Then she says we usually don't do this but I can try and get you all on a flight on Wednesday. I said but we would we do about rooming until then she said I dont know. Or you can get on a plane Friday.

### "cancelled well before departure"
Not Verified |  My flight from Albuquerque to Denver was cancelled well before departure. The reason stated was weather. There were indeed thunderstorms in the area. I checked on all other flights on other airlines and they were delayed by about an hour but none of them were cancelled. I checked on Flight Stats to see the on time rating of this flight, Flight 630 and was shocked. The overall flight rating was "Very Poor" The On Time percentage was only 36%. The Excessive (over 3 hours) rate was 55%, and the "Very Late" percentage made up the remainder. This means that Frontier deliberately operates this flight with no intention of getting it's passengers to their destination on time or in my case, at all. I can understand why Frontier is rated the worst in the country, but this seems fraudulent. I cannot believe the FAA allows this bad an airline to operate at all.

### "dont recommend it to anyone"
Portland to Denver. So first day of vacation was super crazy. We packed the house, dropped the dog off at doggy camp and headed to the airport at 1030pm with all 4 kids under age 7, 4 carseats, 4 checked bags and 1 grandma to board our 1255am flight. Papa dropped us off and we headed to the Frontier counter to check in. I hand them my id and they tell me did i know our flight was cancelled. No!? They said they sent me an email around 6pm for our flight saying it was cancelled due to weather in Denver. Not delayed., cancelled, and the soonest next flight would be  5 days later! Or they could refund my money in 5-7 business days. I cant believe how horrible i felt looking at my excited kids and the mountain of stuff we had to move with no plan. Frontier refused to accommodate us in any way and as of now i am not even sure the refund has started processing because all 4 times i called customer service it disconnected me. Of course there were no other available flights out last night but some out during various times in the week costing double what we had booked 4 months ago. Needing to get to a funeral, we decided our only option was impromptu road trip. Rental cars cost triple what we had reserved in Denver so we came home, threw everything into our traverse and away we went. After 26 hours of basically driving through the night we made it from Washington state to Denver. I will never fly on Frontier and dont recommend it to anyone who wants to get to where they are going!

### "Absolutely had a great trip"
Birmingham to Denver. Absolutely had a great trip! Love this airline, this was my 4th time flying with them and they all have been great! Being over 6’ tall there is plenty of leg room. All my flights have been on time and the flight attendants were all friendly. You have to pay for you food and drink but for the money I saved on the ticket it’s well worth the 2 dollars. My ticket was 156 round trip, well over 200 dollars cheaper then anyone else. Thinking about getting there frontier credit card and will definitely be booking a trip in the future.

### "Don't fly Frontier"
Nashville to Denver. They cancelled my flight back home and wouldn't have another flight out for 3 more days. My husband and I had to buy a $1000 ticket just to get home through Southwest. Don't fly Frontier, just go ahead book originally through a reputable airline. It may be a little more expensive right now, but it could save you $1000 later. They also charge you for anything other than water (soda, tea, coffee, crackers, etc), their plane smells, they charge you $50 each way for any luggage larger than a computer bag, and if you're 5'5 or taller, you're going to have an absolutely miserable flight due to having zero leg room.

### "is the worst company"
Philadelphia to Dallas Ft Worth. This airline is the worst company. Today they cancelled my flight. They offered a new flight 5 days later, they do not pay for hotel. I gave $ 430 to book a new flight from another airlines. My flight was at 7:42 pm. Now it is 23:49. And i am still at the Airport. I am trying to find a place this night.

### "they have had multiple delays"
Not Verified |  I have fly with Frontier 3 times so far, 2 times from Dallas to Denver and 1 time from Columbus to Denver. Every time they have had multiple delays, this airline is king on delaying flights. It’s not just a few minutes it’s always more than an hour. They start with 20 min. Delay and keep adding until they frustrate their passengers. It’s not delaying because of any unexpected events or weather conditions, it’s always mismanaging their scheduling.

### "every flight has been delayed"
Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas. Worst airline, every flight has been delayed 3 hours and one flight was delayed 3 days. Now my flight home after waiting 3 days of waiting is delayed and they are asking for people to volunteer to get a different flight.

### "delays and no notifications"
Denver to Minneapolis. If you love missing shuttles, connecting flights, car rentals, or even whole events this is the airline for you. They feature delays and no notifications free of charge. The seats are so uncomfortable you won’t sleep a wink.

### "aeroplane was dirty"
❎ Not Verified | Denver to Las Vegas. The aeroplane was dirty and disgusting. Seats were all dirty and windows had smears and handprints all over. Trash on the floors like it had not been cleaned in months. Flight attendants were not very friendly at all. Worst flight since I moved to Denver.

### "not happy with my experience with Frontier"
I booked round trip flights from Fort Lauderdale to Islip and on the way there was an hour delay but otherwise smooth. Service was great. I was in the front row and had ample leg room and reclining space and it was very comfortable. The way back, however, first the flight was delayed an hour due to internal Frontier issues. At this point the flight shouldn't have taken off at all due to weather at the destination predicted for this later time. Instead, we get to the destination to not be able to land due to fog. I literally saw the runway each time they tried to land and then it was a tease and they just went back in the air). After flying in circles for hours (almost 2), they finally decided to divert the landing. It was a mess. Everyone was standing on the moving plane fighting each other and Frontier did nothing to settle it. We were all also dizzy from all of the circles. After landing in the diverted location (3 hours away from the intended location) we were told we could not take off again until the next day and no hotels would be provided. I am currently waiting for this flight and it has already been delayed from the intended time. The forecast in the destination still says severe fog, Frontier just wanted to make the flight early enough where they can almost kind of prevent giving us somewhere to sleep all night. Let’s see how much longer this flight gets delayed, definitely not happy with my experience with Frontier and will not be flying with them again.

### "terrible customer service"
Denver to Pittsburgh. This was my first and last trip on your airline. From the headache of checking in forcing me to pay to pick my seat after an hour of checking in online. You lose my bag on a direct flight from Denver to Pittsburgh. They had us in our line for our flight and me and one other girl didn’t get our bag every one that checked in before and after did. Then the lady in Pittsburgh try’s to tell me she worked for you for years and you won’t pay to have it come on another flight. I will get it Thursday at best. So now i has to by dress shoes for work since my tennis shoes and dress shoes where in my bag so i can go to work. Then the lady questioned whether or not we were checked in an hour before like i was to blame. Which is a bunch of bs. Because everyone else in that line got there bags. This is your fault yet i felt like i was to blame. You should be doing everything in your power to make this right yet your too cheap to get me my bag. Poor experience all the way through with this airline. Nickel and dime people to death for terrible customer service.

### "worst airline out there"
Austin to Detroit. This is the absolute worst airline out there! Saving a few bucks isn’t worth it. Plus, those cheap flights are never as cheap as they advertise. You have to pay for your seat, cary on, check bag, food and beverages  nothing is free. I got to the terminal & no one was at the front desk. Everyone knows how frustrating it is to feel like you’re going to miss a flight. Well imagine having enough time but no one is there to check your bag, which I paid $32 for. I bought a flight with Spirit because I knew I would never make it to my flight. When I get to the other terminal I see that my Frontier flight got delayed. I still could’ve made my 1st flight if a worker had just told us what was going on. But they left a line of like 10 people worried sick for who knows how long because I left. The difference with my second flight is that Spirit kindly canceled my flight for me & even fetched my checked bag from the room in the back & now I have a flight credit with Spirit. I tried to get a refund from Frontier & they didn’t even give me a reason why. They just said no  because I missed my flight.

### "algorithm to upcharge people"
Boston to Denver. My girlfriend and I were seeking to sit next to each other on our flight this morning. Naturally, and understandably, we each had to select a seat and pay to do so. What wasn’t natural or understandable was why, for the exact seats, she was billed a higher price. We tried this on multiple days and seats. See the attached photos. I don’t know if it was because she was female, or had been on the website before, or fit whatever weird algorithm Frontier uses to upcharge people. But it was clearly not right. So I called customer service. Not the poor representative’s fault by any means, but her utter lack of English comprehension was not helpful, and it took 20min of her jumbling up words before I requested to speak with a manager. When I spoke with the manager, he told me that his system had it much more expensive, so we were getting a good deal regardless. Which was incredibly dismissive. As I saw it was getting us nowhere and this was something beyond his pay grade, I asked to be transferred to the survey so I could express these concerns. Instead, he hung up on us. I fly Frontier a lot for their cheap flights, but with multiple delays over my last few flights (which is usually not even announced until the last minute), poor customer service, no complimentary cups of water on board (odd way to save a buck), and more, I’ll be spending the same money for Spirit and/or other airlines.

### "not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Jackson. Worst flight experience ever. I was supposed to land in my home town before 8am. They delayed for two hours and then finally let us board. We got halfway there when they turned us around and took us back to the departure airport because of maintenance issues. They got us off the plane and switched planes, making out new departure date 1:10 pm (original was 6:50 am). After waiting almost 2 hours again, they cancelled the flight because the pilot “opted out”. I had to cancel work shifts to be able to fly home and made plans and ended up losing an entire day (only had 4 days off) of being home (haven’t been home in months and it was my cousins birthday and hadn’t seen anyone in almost half a year) because of this airline. The cheap price is not worth the hassle. Will not fly with them again.

### "charged me $60 for a carryon"
Not Verified |  Denver to Spokane. This airline is an absolute joke. I had the smallest duffel bag with me, that I’ve flown with over 50 times this year, and not once have I ever been charged for it because it fits under the seat in front of me. I’m going to get on the plane and the mean lady said I needed to pay for it. They charged me $60 for a carryon.

### "Worst service ever"
Denver to San Francisco. Worst service ever my first flight was canceled waited two days to get a flight to San Jose the only flight available was to San Francisco. . I had paid extra for zone one isle seat, upon cancellation of my first flight. I was specific as to the location of the seat and was told it was confirmed, when I entered the plane I was not given the seat I paid for. In regards to customer this company failed miserably.

### "Very unprofessional"
Philadelphia to Pensacola. On May 28 received email that flight time changes, spoke with representative and confirmed that flight time changed to 5:20 pm on June 6. During my check in paid for bags but wasn’t able to finish check in. Called customer services again and find out that flight canceled on May 28. Did not received any notification. To keep my family trip paid 2099.40$ for new tickets. Very unprofessional.

### "disappointed with Frontier"
I took flight from San Jose to Denver on June 2 in frontier 594. Flight attendant blame that weather is bad but it was not. Flight attendants was not helpful at all. Very disappointed with Frontier and never fly again. Flight is canceled and they were giving other flight after 1 week.

### "Worst customer service"
Denver to Charleston. Worst customer service. Also making customers pay double for bags at counter. Don’t believe the cheap ticket hype, because their hidden fees add up to costing more than cleaner, more reputable airlines.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  My daughter booked a flight through Expedia for Frontier Airlines. Flight 475 from Jacksonville to Denver. She tried to check in on their website but had problems with the check in after trying multiple times. She then called Frontier to check in via telephone. They were very unhelpful and sarcastic on the phone. They quoted her a price for the carry on bag and the seat selection that was higher than the quoted price on the website. She then asked for a supervisor since the first representative did not appear to understand that she was trying to check in with him as she could not do it through their website and continued to refer her to the website. The supervisor, James #1075189 was rude and dismissive of the problem and became more snarky as the conversation went on. My daughter became so upset that she wanted to cancel her flight because she was then afraid to fly with an airline who could not even handle a simple check in. Price to cancel the flight was $119. I suggest that you address this complaint with the airline as you represent them as a third party. We will never fly this airline again and will take any opportunity to make sure that everyone we know is aware of their poor service. I have also filed a complaint with the airline itself.

### "plane is still there"
Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. I just sat at the Las Vegas Airport for over 3 hours because of a flight maintenance delay and the plane is still there. The pilot left the plane and told us he has no idea when they can leave. I had to rebook and flight with Southwest just to get home. Flight F92086 is still sitting at the gate while another airline is happily getting me home. To top it off, no customer service agents were at the desk to help us. We felt alone and didn’t know what to do! How can I have faith flying Frontier again? !

### "no customer service approach"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Austin. Will never buy tickets from Frontier Airlines. Totally unprofessional staff, no customer service approach, very rude personnel. We arrived late with enough time for boarding 1:41 departure arrived 1:15. And they did not gave us any option to take the flight.

### "my luggage was lost"
Denver to Pittsburgh. This airline is filled with the most incompetent, unconcerned people I have encountered on a flight. Not only were both of my flights considerably delayed, but my luggage was lost and can’t be returned to me for three days. I was legally supposed to be informed that I could take my medication as a carry-on, but wasn’t. They provided no help considering the circumstance and told me I’ll have to wait a minimum of 3 days before seeing my medicine. I would go on literally any other airline before this one. Never again.

### "we missed our flight"
Atlanta to Los Angeles. Would recommend literally anything else besides this company. We (me and 3 other friends) missed our flight because the staff at the gate did not do their job. They claimed they announced last call, but that seems hard to do when literally no one was at the gate to announce it 20 minutes prior to boarding. They would not work with us on rescheduling a flight and they were going to charge us an extra $120 per person to get on a flight for the next night (which would put us two days behind for our trip). The customer service was the worst I've ever experienced and I'd honestly rather lose out on my $400 trip there and book with someone else, which we did. Thank you to American Airlines for saving the day from the monstrosity that is Frontier. ALSO, not to mention that a frequent Frontier customer (who had a frontier miles credit card) stated that he's never been on a flight with so much miscommunication and rude employees.

### "not be flying Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Denver to Boston. My wife, son and I recently took a trip for a wedding and flew on Frontier Airlines. When we reached the self-check in machines none of them worked. So we had to go to the counter and check in which is fine but once we left the counter and got to the security checkpoint we realized all 3 of our tickets said “0” for the seat number. So then when we finally got to the gate and asked the frontier folks there about it they tried to get us seats but now we would not be sitting together. We complained and luckily they were able to ask another passenger if they would be willing to move so that we could sit together and they agreed. Once we boarded the plane we ended up sitting on the tarmac for 2.5 hours because frontier screwed up the maintenance log for the plane so we couldn’t take off until it was fixed. During the 2.5 hours Frontier didn’t as much as offer anyone water, even after I told one of the staff that they should probably at least do that. To wrap up the trip we went to check in for our flight back home and realized that the person from Frontier that we scheduled the flight with over the phone didn’t know the difference between May and June and scheduled our flight back for June 28th instead of May 28th! Because of this we incurred a lot of additional expenses to stay an extra day in addition to missing an additional day of work. We will not be flying Frontier again.

### "never fly frontier Airlines again"
Flight from Philadelphia to Mexico Cancun was supposed to leave at 10:30 and arrive at 1332. We didn’t leave until 3:30pm. We only got a $10 food voucher to replace the time we lost on our first day of vacation ( it was an insult). To make matters worse the staff was rude and inconsiderate! We will never fly frontier Airlines again. Save your money! The headache isn’t worth it!

### "I'm so unhappy"
San Francisco to Little Rock via Denver. Absolutely appalled with the customer service of this airline. Got the airport early enough to nap before our flight (very long day and had a 12:30am red eye flight) so when we get there we hear an announcement for the flight before ours that they were canceling due to "weather" which was never elaborated on and later overheard a conversation between the customer service agent at the gate and someone on the phone saying it was delayed because the plane was not serviced in time for flight. Not long after we were told our flight to Denver would be delayed. I had a funny feeling we would end up like the flight before us and prepared myself for the worst. Sure enough they came over the speaker again saying we would miss our connecting flight in Denver to Little Rock so we were offered either a refund or another flight through them. They were very rude in informing use they would not provide a hotel room for the night. They said we would have a "50/50 chance" of making our connection in Denver but if we took the chance and it didn't work they would not provide a hotel or a refund because they couldn't give us a 100% answer if we would be able to make our next flight. They were very unprofessional and did not speak to people in a polite tone or manner. There was one agent there for 65 people, up until the end of the line where another agent showed up and treated us with such disrespect. Some people hadn't even been helped when they made the final call for boarding on our original flight to Denver that they were then forced to take because their bags were with the plane and there was no attempt made to get them. Simply because they hadn't gotten a chance to speak to a representative before time ran out. I'm so unhappy and it is not worth saving the money.

### "Luggage are such a rip off"
Orlando to Pennsylvania. Luggage prices are such a rip off. They docked us an extra $75 per bag for an extra 4 pounds. If I’d known that at the hotel I would’ve just bought another bag or brought an empty and checked it because that would’ve been cheaper. So don’t plan on buying an souvenirs. Cause you will be charged additionally for the extra weight. Completely not satisfied seeing I made sure it all fit in the case I brought! This is outrageous an extremely high price. I would like a refund for the inconvenience cause I will be looking for a different airline in the future. I’ve never been charged extra off any other airline!! And will be sharing this review on Facebook and and everyone.

### "The service was horrible"
Louisville to Vegas. The service was horrible they were rude, they lost my luggage and I did not get it back until my trip was over. They only refund me 50 dollars of the money I spent on clothing and other things that was in my luggage and I had receipt for everything I purchased.

### "Frontier is a clown operation"
Syracuse to Chicago. Frontier is a clown operation. Flight was supposed to be from Syracuse to Chicago O’Hare. Things started to go wrong when gate agent announced that the flight to Orlando was delayed (yes, she thought ORD meant Orlando). No ETA was given and board at gate still said “on time” until after about two hours they announced the flight was canceled. Oops, I mean “delayed” (from Thursday to Sunday). Gate agents lied and claimed they would process refunds, but then got tired of dealing with angry pax and referred us to 800 number. Entire Frontier staff at SYR was ill informed and unfriendly. Getting refund (hopefully) meant an hour on the phone mostly on hold and otherwise dealing with barely comprehensible foreign call center worker. Also booked now useless Chicago hotel reservations through Frontier’s website. My attempts to get this refunded meant another ultimately futile two hours on the phone with more foreign reps and of course got nowhere, so now disputing it with credit card. I also note that gate agents said cancellation was due to mechanical problems but customer service rep on phone claimed it was weather. No straight answers from this airline. Obviously never got to Chicago and just drove back home.

### "horrible experience"
Denver to Orlando. All around horrible experience. Never again. Every flight was considerably delayed or late, employees under trained, lack of communication between employees and passengers, bought a straight flight to Albuquerque and ended up taking 3 connecting flights with a 8hr layover. Not worth it!

### "Customer service was horrible"
Customer service was horrible. Gate agents did not seem to know the company policies. I was told that I had to pay for a carry on bag or I couldn't board my flight. Was instructed by 2 gate agents to take what I could carry on board and to place my bag next to trash can. which was tossed in trash can after I boarded plane. I had a 10 hour lay over in Denver and no change of clothing. I really thought they would put my bag in lost and found but it was actually tossed out. I spoke to Frontier about this and was offered a 200.00 voucher to fly in the future. This is still hard to believe I will never fly this airline again! By TSA guide lines I was not suppose to leave an unattended bag but was told by the Frontier gate agents that it was ok.

### "had to pay for extra baggage"
On May 15 traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico from Florida. We had already paid for carry on, then at the airport at the gate as we were boarding, a Frontier employee started pulling people off the line telling us we had to pay for extra baggage! Extra baggage? Ok souvenir bag with gifts. So, why would they have concession stands and tax free shops in the airline gate area, just to then want to charge you $120 for additional baggage? First and last time flyer. Overall rating is a (2), just because the pilot got us safely on ground.

### "charged for a checked bag "
Portland to Birmingham. I bought a package from Priceline I flew Delta on the way down and had never flown Frontier on the way home. I was charged for a checked bag 50 and 55 for my carryon. I should have paid the extra money and flew another airline they charge for everything including water. The flight was 1 hour late leaving Birmingham no explanation. Once in Denver our plane sat on the runway for an additional hour. Captain announced it was due to mechanical difficulties from the plane at the gate. Frontier stated it was weather and offered no assistance. Booked me on a flight 2 days later for my return home. I was returning from dealing with a death in our family. My 83 years old uncle and my 82 year old Aunt were on the same flight going to LA and stranded in Denver with medical issues. Frontier again denied any responsibility or gave any assistance.

### "not book with them again"
I wouldn’t recommend this airline, its cheaper but you paid for it one way or another. On May 15, 2019 I had a layover in Denver, I get to the gate A52 it a 30 minutes delay flight was supposed leave at 10:35 pm flight 751. Frontier overbooked the flight ask 5 people to give up their seats for one nite stay in hotel and $400 travel voucher. We boarded onto a hot plane with no air and no pilots to start the plane to turn on the air - that plane felt like 100 degree. People were complaining about the air I will not book with them again. The flight was rough from Denver to Phoenix.

### "Excellent and friendly service"
St Louis to Orlando. Excellent and friendly service both on the ground and in the air. Staff have always been polite and enthusiastic about attending to customers. Out of 10 flights with Frontier, only 2 flights have been delayed by a couple of hours. That means that 80% of the time, flights are on time. And I should definitely point out that the two times that the flights were delayed, I have gotten compensated. I had a 2 hour delay, and I got a $20 voucher. Then, I had a 3 hour delay, and I got a $50 voucher without even complaining to customer service! No other airline does that! The rates are incredibly affordable. Frontier's tickets have made my long distance relationship a lot closer than what it actually is. I just happen to be in one of the nonstop routes, which is why I get such affordable and convenient flights. The Den's Deal is Amazing! I paid $50 to become a member for a year, and within one year I have saved more than $100. This means that the Den's Deal was paid off. The customer service folks are extremely friendly as well. Whenever I call, I don't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be transferred to an agent, and their knowledge and expertise is exceptional. I absolutely love the emails with the promo codes that they send on a weekly basis, and I think their "kids fly for free" and "friends fly for free" programs are the best thing an airlines can do! The Frontier App for iPhone is extremely well-made, everything we need is in there, and we can even get boarding passes to our Apple Wallet. Also, the fact that the airplane liveries have animals on the tails and winglets is the most adorable thing an airline has ever done. My dad, my mom, and my boyfriend all agree with me that Frontier is an excellent airline. Overall, I am extremely satisfied, and I cannot emphasize how grateful I am with this airline! I wish people would appreciate this airline as much as I do because it definitely has the potential to beat its competitors (for select routes).

### "Terrible information"
Salt Lake City to Las Vegas via San Francisco. Terrible information on purchasing the flight, did not know I had to pay additional fees for a carry on, had a 20 hour layover and after the layover was asked to pay for carry on again! Flight was an hour and a half late, and the soda or beverage would have cost me an additional 4 bucks! Not cool Frontier.

### "service counter was very nice"
Not Verified |  Denver to New Orleans. The young man, Daniel, in the New Orleans airport at the service counter was very nice, friendly, smiling and was very helpful with our checkin! I wasn’t very pleased with the airline changing my flight several times. But they accommodated us with taking care of our baggage fees. Not pleased that they nickel and dime you for everything and luggage fees are over priced!

### "incompetent airline"
Chicago to Punta Cana. Frontier had officially given me my worst experience as a customer. For starters, my luggage never made it to Punta Cana so they provided me with $75 a day clothing allowance until I get my bag. I had to provide receipts for every purchase. For 3 days shopping I had to provide $120 out of my pocket for taxis which don't provide receipts and $140 in clothes receipts to possibly get refunded. On day 4 of my trip, they found my luggage in Denver and asked if I want it sent to the house or returned home. First of all, I flew international so how did my luggage get sent to Denver and since I spent hours shopping before my vacation, I chose to have them send my clothes. For the second time during my vacation, they lost my luggage again. I gave them the receipts of my clothes and phone charger at the Frontier desk in Punta Cana and they lost them. My baggage just came in today 2 days after my trip. They apologized and offered me a $150 travel voucher for my inconvenience. What a joke. I hope this is enough to deter anyone from using this incompetent airline and getting treated so poorly. I hope they figure out that is not how you treat first time customers and expect return business. I hope this will help in making airline decisions. P.S. I paid over $1000 for 2 round trip tickets to get treated like this. Buyer beware!! !

### "delayed 3 times then canceled"
Buffalo to Orlando. When it was time to return to my home town, my flight was delayed 3 times then canceled 1 minute after I got a “delay” email. The customer service was terrible. They would not book me another flight home, they would not give me my money back, nor would they accommodate me and my Family having to pay for our own hotel! They also threatened to have me arrested because I was asking to many questions! Gave me two minutes to get out of Line and leave their section at the airport! Over $800 wasted on frontier airlines. We had to stay another 3 days at the airport and no food nor vouchers for us to eat!

### "flight was horrendous"
Islip to Orlando. Not even for free will I fly this airline again. The ground crew were very accommodating but the flight was horrendous. After I made my reservations I wound up in a walking boot due to a foot injury. No issues at all, provided wheel chairs and moved my seats to front of the plane upon request. I knew not to expect internet, food, etc. as it was a no frills airline. So no issues there. Flight to Islip went without a hitch, seats not as comfortable as other airlines but also paid half price of other options. Flight back to Florida, now that is where the issues began. At 1:15 am the day of the flight I receive a text that the flight was to be delayed 8 hours. Our 12:55 flight now scheduled for 8:55pm. No explanation, no other options. Fortunately, we have family near airport so dropped off rental car and was picked up. While there I went to Frontier counter to speak to rep to see if anything had changed and what were the chances the flight would be canceled. Of course no answers. Only that the next flight out was on Thursday, it was only Monday. The other options, maybe, would be another flight in the am although not scheduled or a voucher up to 500.00 for another airline. In the meantime, left in the dark. Well the flight that was now scheduled for 9:07 finally departed at 10pm and arrived in Orlando at 1am. The flight crew was a joke, never have I seen such an unprofessional group of flight attendance. They talked the entire flight with another group of flight attendants they were apparently returning to Orlando. We were sitting in row 2, the other flight attendants in row 1. They complained about their day and yadda yadda yadda the entire flight. I was so exhausted I managed to sleep for 2 hours.

### "Worse flight ever been on"
Not Verified |  Worse flight ever been on, where to start, changed our flight plans more then once, no internet, no movies, no food unless you want to pay 4 dollars for a can of soda or more. Was on the plan from Orlando to Salt Lake, a 4 hour trip lasted all day, from 4 PM till mid night with one layover (which was delayed half hour)and one stop where I had to wait on the plane for an hour with a baby while the airline was getting ready for new quests. Finally got to my destination to come to find out that they lost my baby's car seat. You pay 50.00 for all bags including carry on. If you are looking for complimentary there will be none on this airline.

### "never fly with them again"
Los Angeles to Denver. Don't fly with them if you do have work. You have to have plenty of time for waiting without notice. I flew from DCA to LAX and have one stop at DIA. Both flight was delayed one hour each. That's so terrible. Believe it or not my flight back from LAX to DCA was delayed again! Plus, they don't have complimentary snack or beverage (no water too). The seat is not comfy at all. No WiFi, no screen and no any entertainment. I could say that I will never fly with them again. If you already booked the tickets, I wish you luck.

### "no one was rude or unwilling"
Buffalo to Orlando. Travelled Frontier for the first time this week with 2 other adults and 2 children. Flight ended up costing more than expected but still less than major airlines. Both flights were on-time, had no trouble boarding or deplaning, some employees were less cheerful than others but no one was rude or unwilling to assist. I've read many bad reviews about this airline, but I cannot say that our experience was negative.

### "cold and rude performance"
Tampa to Cleveland. I purchased a ticket for my disabled daughter who lives in Florida to see me in Cleveland. She had been hit by a pick up while walking. She is walking with a walker now but only for a couple weeks. She flew alone and the airline was notified that she was disabled and would need assistance, we were told we would be able to assist her at the gate via a gate pass. Drop off went smooth, no resistance allowing Grandma to escort her to the gate. Things went south when I arrived to pick her up. I approached the ticket counter to obtain the gate pass. The plane was due to arrive at 8:35. I arrived at the counter at 8:00 knowing the plane left Florida 45 minutes late. I was met by what I later learned was the counter supervisor. I explained my goal and she immediately started scolding me for arriving at 8 and not earlier. I let her know that I will handle the delay with security and kindly asked for the boarding pass. She looked up my daughter and after noticing she was over 18 she quipped "I can't tell you if she is or is not on the plane" after re-explaining my situation she did not care. I stepped away from the counter called the airline help #. They were kind, noted the system and told me to try again, that there should be no problem. By this time the supervisor was gone. The lady now helping me stated she was not looking in the system and that her supervisor had already made a decision. I stepped away and called home office again. They asked me to take the phone to the counter and they would speak to the lady, I did so and the lady refused to talk to the home office by simply ignoring me and asking for the next guest to come forward. In the end I waited another hour (30 minutes after the plane landed) not knowing if my daughter who again could barely walk and had a traumatic brain injury which has altered her mental state would be assisted or would be scared to death because she was alone. She made it to the front with the help of the airport (not airline). Bottom line, I have never seen a more heartless cold and rude performance from a group of people in the service industry. Horrible way to accommodate the disabled and horrible way to treat fellow human beings!

### "Do not fly this airline"
Not Verified |  Miami to Philadelphia. Do not fly this airline - no amount of savings in the world can make this truly miserable experience worthwhile. 8 hours of delays in the Miami airport, with the departure time pushed back by an hour at a time with no explanation as to why. I booked this flight so that I could be home by 9pm before a job interview the next day. Instead, I landed at 5.30am. This airline should not exist. Do not put yourself through this.

### "Anyone got trash"
First, we were routed from Providence, Orlando, Dallas to Vegas. In Dallas we were grounded due to severe weather (not Frontiers fault) for at least an hour and were not offered even a glass of "free" water. Everything costs on Frontier, carry on, checked lugguage, drinks, and all food. No peanuts on this airline. Trash! Anyone got trash. The crew went up and down, up and down the aisle I counted 6 times in a two hours flight, Trash! Anyone got trash. That's Frontiers customer service. I will never fly this airline again.

### "the worst airline ever"
Miami to Philadelphia. This is the worst airline ever, and I am never flying with them again. First of all their baggage fees are ridiculously expensive and you have to pay for carry on bags. Also they changed their flight time without telling us so we arrived to the airport 9 hours early. Then they kept delaying the flight for 5 hours for no reason. Finally we were supposed to board at 11pm and right as the plane arrived they announced that the crew had to rest and the plane would be delayed until 2am. But they should have known that so why didnt they tell us earlier? They gave us 10 dollar food vouchers but every store and restaurant is closed. Because it's such a small airline they did not have any other options for earlier flights and could not give us any other options. Seriously, avoid this airline at all costs. It might look cheap but it is not worth it, plus there are all of those extra fees.

### "Seats were extremely uncomfortable and cramped"
Not Verified |  I typically fly quite a bit on business each year (approx 10k + miles per year). This time I traveled with family. Received cheap round trip tickets that turned out to be the same price as comparable airlines due to the hidden charges. They nickel and dime on baggage ($40 per carry on bag per person ‘each way’ and seats about the same $40). So if you have 3 persons wth carry on and want to choose normal seats you will roughly pay extra $480 round trip. Arrived at check 2.5 hours ahead of return departure. Took 50 minutes for Baggage drop off as Frontier had a huge line of about 150 persons wrapping around a wall back to the terminal information desk. Baggage check in desk was antagonistic and argued that any missed flights would be the responsibility of the passenger. Barely made the flight. Loading was disorganized and rushed and passengers were informed they must be boarded 15 minutes before take off. With everyone loaded plane did not even taxi until 45 minutes later due to baggage loading delay. Pilot did not make up time and told us that we were fortunate to have bags loaded on the plane. Seats were extremely uncomfortable and cramped. There is no WiFi offered even at a fee. No inflight entertainment. They offer no courtesy snacks or drinks on 5.5 hour flight ($3.00 for a coke or coffee). Service is not friendly. Baggage claim was also delayed. No shock at that point. I experienced above on both flights to and from Orlando/ONT.

### "not be flying Frontier again"
Not Verified |  My worst flight experience ever. $50 for a carry on bag. Flight attendants not professional and rude. No free food or drink, you have to pay for everything. No charger outlet, no WiFi, no entertainment. They also made me stay on the plane for a hour between flights, no I had no chance to grab food use the bathroom or charge my phone. Will not be flying Frontier again.

### "1.5 hours for luggage"
Not Verified | Cincinnati to Orlando. Horrible. First off our flight was delayed two hours. Then we board and while still waiting for flight to take off they say there has been mechanical issues and they were waiting for someone to sign off. Paid $300 for my ticket and couldn't even be offered a drink unless I paid for it. Then we get to Orlando. Took 1.5 hours for luggage - ridiculous!! Was offered $25 credit for our trouble. Wish it was a refund because I won't be using their airline again.

### "Rude supervisor"
Sacramento to Las Vegas. Rude supervisor. Rude remarks, sarcastic, unhappy person. If I had another choice from my company I would definitely fly another airline. Flight 2090 May 2nd 2019 10:19pm flight. When I asked if I can get an aisle seat she immediately started to tell me no without checking her system. I informed her that I was claustrophobic and if possible for an aisle or window. She was sarcastic with her reply. When I asked for her name she stated go ahead and file a complaint - do you need my badge number also?

### "the worst flight of all"
Louisville to Orlando. It was the worst flight of all. Before this flight I had one from Philadelphia to Louisville with another airline it was very comfortable and they gave us a snack in the two hours flight. But with Frontier seat can only positioned in one position - very uncomfortable, and they didn't give us anything as a snack, they are all paid for. This was the worst worst flight.

### "charge you for everything else"
Tampa to Milwaukee. Customer service is a total joke, they were rude and disrespectful from the moment I tried to check my bags in at the front all the way to the gate where I missed my flight due to the total run around I was given by their staff. I have never flown Frontier and will never ever again after the experience I encountered with them. I do not recommend flying with Frontier, Yes, they have cheap flights but they also charge you for everything else. $40 bags each way, $15  for your seat each way and they do not offer complimentary drinks or snacks for your flight. Want my opinion? Pay the extra money with Southwest, at least with them you get two free bags, complimentary snacks and drinks and don’t have to pay for your seat. I will pay the extra money next time just to come in contact with polite employees. I was traveling with a small child and still treated poorly.

### "airline is a joke"
Norfolk to Orlando. Initially booked a round trip ticket. Several days later got notifications from them advising my return flight was canceled and they were putting me on a different flight 2 DAYS later. Wouldn't budge to switch me to a different airlines, said they had NO return flights on the return date so they refunded me 1/2 my ticket. Problem is, this is spring break for many and tickets are now through the roof! Booked with United and had to pay double. Then go to Frontier day of flight and long lines because no one is at the check in line, then when they come they nickel and dime you to death with more fees for luggage, carry on etc. Then they switch departure gates, then they were late departing, then when we get to FL it took about 30 minutes for the luggage to even begin to show on the luggage carousel...mind you everybody knows how long it takes to get to the carousel in the first place to have to wait 30 more minutes. This airline is a joke.

### "delays of up to 8 hours"
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Orlando. I’m done. Flew with frontier for about a year once per month or more to Orlando from Philadelphia. Some issues but all airlines have some delays and issues. Last 4 flights have had ridiculous delays of up to 8 hours. Can’t trust Them anymore. I’m out.

### "Buyer beware when booking"
Not Verified | I have flown Frontier Airlines back and forth between Orlando and Milwaukee. Every single flight there was some type of issue. The final straw I was trying to book a flight for 2 days on my Frontier app and the app was not working. So I finally called management they told me due to that problem they would eliminate $10.00 fee for booking over the phone. And then they tried to charge me almost 50.00 more for the exact same flight I was trying to book on their app! On one of my flights the charges me 38.00 to check a pool cue that their own website stated I could take it as a carry-on. They may advertise low rates, but they dont honor posted prices or honoring things stated on their own website as a free carry on and making me check my custom pool cue, charged me money and when I said I have no way to secure my property and they reassured me by telling me "people dont steal at airports". The worst customer service ever and this company may not honor anything they post on their website or mobile app. Buyer beware when booking a flight on this airline

### "lack of professionalism"
Miami to New York-LGA. Frontier's lack of professionalism, empathy and overall courtesy has a direct impact on retaining customers. On the date mentioned above there was no representation from Frontier through the numerous delays and ultimate cancellation of the flight. I have never experienced such a degree of miscommunication between an airline and its passengers in a similar situation. When the cancellation was announced, a supervisor on the phone came across aloof, callous and nonchalant about the entire situation. Providing nothing else other than a repetitive statement of "sorry, we can't do anything". Frontier's solution to the cancellation was either be stranded for the next 3 days or receive refund. Ultimately spending more money than you can afford to be home for an emergency/family. Disgusting.

### "I'll never book with Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Denver to Dallas. Horrible. Politely asked flight attendant about USB port to charge my phone where I was rudely told, "you should have used the ones in the airport. My response, "Well that's some great customer service" and was told, "well you booked the ticket" by your flight attendant. Flight attendant just reminded me while I'll never book with Frontier again. Then after looking around the flight and happening to make eye contact with this flight attendant was threatened to be kicked off the flight. Completely unprovoked, just looking around. This company charges for every tiny thing and then you are greeted with rude attendants that will threaten you. Never again will I fly Frontier.

### "No reason given for cancellation"
Miami to New York. Usually, I‘m lazy to write reviews, but here I will. First told that my flight (#2880) is 3 hours delayed! After 3 hours waiting flight was cancelled, at 8pm! No reason was given for the cancellation. Rebooking was offered for a 3 days later flight which I obviously rejected! No refund received until now! Had to stay at hotel that night (at own costs) and flew next day, of course with another airline.

### "Today was the last straw"
Phoenix to Colorado Springs. We will never fly Frontier Airlines again. We boarded our plane and once everyone was on we were told that the captain would not be arriving for another two hours and we could deplane it we wanted to. This is not the first incident we have had with this airline! We have used them a few times and have run into delays or mechanical issues every single time no matter where the departure or arrival! Today was the last straw. Don’t know when we will be headed home today.

### "give Frontier all zeros"
Orlando to Washington. If I could give a zero rating, I'd give Frontier all zeros. My mom booked a flight for my family and when we checked in, we paid $100 to check two bags. We get to the gate and I get a good look at the boarding passes only to realize they've separated the entire family. We're traveling with a child. I go to the ticketing counter where the agent asks me if I paid for seating. I'm a clueless traveler and I'm like really I have to pay for the seats, too? We proceeded to board and the flight attendant said she would see if she could help us sit together once the flight boarded but thanks to a series of awesome passengers, I didn't have to deal with the flight crew. They  were full of attitude and fresh out of hospitality.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
Not Verified | I made an error with check on bags. Called customer service because I couldn’t cancel them on the Frontier app. They told me I couldn’t be refunded on the bags because it had been over 24 hours, 25 hours to be exact after realizing I could not cancel the carry on bags on the Frontier app. I asked if I could redo my ticket order because of the error and they told me I would have to pay $190 per person, I bought 3 tickets from Denver to Des Moines and 3 tickets from Cedar Rapids to Denver. I don’t want to pay cancellation fees and now I am stuck paying $210 for carry on bags that I will not have. At the end, the customer service lady asked if I was satisfied with the phone call. That is a joke right? Never flying Frontier again and I will make sure to tell my friends about my experience.

### "not worth the money paid"
Islip to Ft Lauderdale. One of the worst planes I’ve been in. The seats had garbage and my seat was soaking wet. The seats have no space for your legs. Definitely not worth the money paid for. However the staff was very friendly and welcoming, when I started to peacefully complain. I was told an option was to leave the plane and get out. Great way to respond to a customer.

### "negative points related to service"
Denver to Washington DCA. The good thing (and the most important) was that the flight departed and arrived on time at a resonable price. The negative points are related to service. Check in was slow and somewhat chaotic. Seat comfort and service not good and the general appearance of the aircraft not the best. Looked a bit worn out. But, Frontier delivered. I`ll fly them again.

### "Horrible customer service"
Norfolk to Orlando. Horrible service. I called and was told as long as I was at the airport 30 mins prior to arrival I would be ok. I got to airport 40 mins before departure and could not get on my flight because check in issues no one was at Frontier desk and manager waited til flight left to come down and say we could leave out Monday when my trip was over. Horrible customer service and misleading information.

### "Don't fly with this company"
Not Verified |  Don't fly with this company! They cancelled our flight from Denver to Tulsa (due to weather), and did not inform us. No advisory on the website or app, either. When we tried to check in online, we got an error that said we needed to call the airline, but did not say why. We we're on hold so long that we were late, so we decided to call during our 3 hour drive to the airport. After being on hold for over an hour, we were finally told about the cancellation. But she lied and said they had sent an email. She told us to get on our flight to Denver, and they would put us on another flight to Tulsa. Refused to tell us when the next flight would be. The counters at the airport were closed, and didn't open when the sign said they would. When they did open, we were again told to go to Denver, but then told the next flight to Tulsa would be in 4 days! We called again, and they offered a flight to Wichita, but refused to pay for a rental car or bus tickets from Wichita to Tulsa, and we couldn't afford it, and couldn't get ahold of friends or family for help, due to the late hour. Could have done that if the lady had told us on the phone 5 hours earlier. They also wouldn't give us a flight with another airline. And refunds take 5-7 business days. Couldn't afford another airline because of that, and rates were higher due to late hour. Refused to get us a hotel for the night. Refused to get us a shuttle, Uber or taxi. We missed our trip entirely, but still have to pay for all of it, due to lack of notice and lying. And they don't even care. Horrible company; I don't know how they are even in business.

### "was the worst experience"
Chicago to Orlando. This was the worst experience I have ever had and I will never fly with them again. The customer service was absolutely horrendous. I was going to research conference and absolutely every other attendee got to take their posters as a carry-on while I had to pay $90 to take it. I even saw individuals on the same plane with posters. They just made me check mine. The flights were delayed both ways. The crew and staff just could not get it together. In addition, all my colleagues decided to fly Southwest. I decided to fly frontier because I thought it would be cheaper. The southwest flight was $285. Frontier was $183. But that was a huge lie. I ended up paying $340 for my flight with Frontier with all the additional fees. I would have given 0/10 if I could.

### "Customer service lacks"
Ontario to Orlando. Customer service lacks for this airline. I did my research before purchasing my ticket and thought the lack of snack and beverages weren’t an issue for the greatly cheap flight to Rhode Island from California.. Shame on me for assuming nothing would go wrong with the flight. The flight got cancelled right after boarding and no one was given a reason as to why. Get off the plane and I was told another flight to my destination would not be available until 3 days after my original flight. I proceeded to then ask about a hotel being accommodated if I’d have to say so many days and was told only 1 day would be accommodated for me. Ridiculous. You have someone be stuck for 3 days but can’t provide housing or a flight through a different airline or to go a different route. I then had to buy another ticket through Southwest, luckily but also unfortunately because the ticket costed almost 5x the amount I paid for Frontier. I called and asked to be partially reimbursed for the fact that I paid a great difference between the two tickets and was told since I selected to get my original ticket refund I could not be partially reimbursed for the nearly $600 ticket I had to purchase last minute because of Frontier’s screw up. A $120 refund from Frontier is not close to $570 at all. Frontier is absolutely trash.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Albuquerque to Orlando. 12:50 am flight got delayed til 2:50 am. We sat there for over 6 hours with 2 kids at the airport for them to tell us that the pilot has been flying for too long, so the flight is canceled - at 3:30 am. They knew the entire time. They tell us to go back to the check in to reschedule- only to have 1 person working the check in area. They decided to let us stand there for another hour only to have other flyers tell the entire line that they aren't canceling the flight, they are classifying it as delayed so they don't have to pay insurance. It's 4am, no one has slept, we've all been there since 9pm, and they have the audacity to allow all 200 of us to stand there waiting to see whats going on. I understand this is a red eye flight but the employees are absolutely unprofessional, they allowed all of us to stand around, most people even missing connecting flights, instead of being straight up with us and telling us to go back home or to the hotel because the flight is being rescheduled.

### "So much room to improve"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Denver. Boarding schedule at 8:25 and take off at 9am but flight arrives one hour late. There wasn’t a gate agent, no announcement, no screen information, their online is not updated. It’s awful service from them and totally not organized. I’m an elite member but I’ll not fly with them for a while now. So much room for them to improve

### "Keep away from Frontier"
New York to Orlando. Should have done my homework! As I sit here on a two hour delay. I took the time to look at their reviews. There is a reason why they only get one star reviews from practically everyone. I travel fairly frequently and have never run across such a delay. I feel like lm on standby while the airline try’s to get a plane. What a joke! As you read this. Learn by research. Check the reviews. Keep away from Frontier Airlines.

### "never fly this airline"
I will never fly this airline again! Do your homework before you book, you will pay extra for everything! They do do not even offer a free non-alcoholic beverage! I had a a flight from Salt Lake City to Puerto Vallarta via Denver. When I went to pay for my luggage ahead of time, I realized that they do not offer any free bags including your carry on! I had to pay for my checked bag and my carry on for each flight. (So from Salt Lake to Denver I was charged and then from Denver to Mexico,) and the same on the way back. (I paid an extra $152 for one checked bag and one carry on bag). The next night when I went to check in 24 hours in advance, I found out that I also had to pay extra to choose a seat. Anywhere from $5 to $45 per flight. I chose a middle of the road seat. When I got on the plane the only seats that reclined at all were the most expensive seats! So unless you paid another $180 per person round trip you did not get a reclining seat. There was no in flight entertainment, there was not even a place to plug in your phone or device! There were plenty of other issues when I was trying to book the flights but I felt that people need to know about these the most. If I could say that I felt like I got a good deal and paid less for the flight than I would have with another airline, this may have been a better expereince but the only reason I went with them was because all of the flights with my usual airline were booked.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service ever. I arrived at the airport and was delayed because of an accident on the highway on my way there. However I arrived at the ticket counter at 6:05 to check my bag. The agent was looking up my reservation and then when he found it he said its too late to board we are 20% boarded. I said my boarding pass that I have from checking in says you're not even to start boarding until 6:13. It's not even that time yet. He said I can't take your bag and I said ok I paid for a checked bag but I can bring it as a carry on it's small enough. He said well it will cost you $60 and I said ok whatever I already had my boarding pass and am tsa Pre. Can you give me a $30 credit for the bag I was supposed to have checked.. He said no, call customer service. I said ok where do I pay for this to be a carry on and he said it's too late you should have been here 2 hours prior to plane taking off. I said it says here the doors shut at 6:33 this is a very small airport I can get to that gate in plenty of time and he said no it's to late. What really happened here? Did they sell my seat or where they leaving early? I don't know but the agent was very rude and of course I was already upset. I asked if there were any more flights and he said no not until Monday (this was Friday) I asked about a refund and he said we don't do that. You can call customer service but they won't refund you, you were late. I did call customer service and the person I talked to seemed to have a problem understanding the time lines I was talking about and just kept repeating themselves. No satisfaction there.

### "no apology from the airline"
Not Verified |  San Antonio to Denver. Frontier knew that our flight from SAT to Denver will be delayed ahead of time (the same aircraft going to Salt Lake City departed two hours later than scheduled), but never bothered to communicate with passengers via text, email or phone call. Our bags were checked so we had no access to the essentials or medications for 6-7 hours (it should have been a 2 hour flight). When I called the customer service, there is no apology from the airline; the agent just told us it’s important that we showed up at the airport early for announcements because the flight status can change again. It appears that this airline does not care about their customers while also lacks essential infrastructure/resource to manage flight status change, and basic communication. Their agents are also not trained nor prepared well to handle situations like this either.

### "book with a different airline"
Chicago to Orlando. Booked and paid for flights and rental car through Frontier’s website. When I reached my destination the rental car carrier would not provide a car because the credit card I had (the only credit card I have and the same one used to pay for the flights and car on the website) is in my husband’s name and he was not on the trip with us. I had to use all of the cash I had with me for the trip to book with a different agency. The carrier that would not provide the car told me to call their main office and they would refund my money for the original rental, but then he found out I had paid through Frontier’s website and said I would have to call them instead since they had my money. I did that and was told repeatedly that they would not give me my $250 back since “car rentals are not refundable.” I understand the situation with the credit card (which was a stressful start to our vacation, but I was understanding about it until I called Frontier’s customer service). Now I’m extremely upset because I’m out $250 and the only explanation the customer service rep or her supervisor could provide was what they were reading off their screens—“car rentals are not refundable.” Next time rather than throw $250 away for absolutely nothing (except to pad Frontier’s profits) I’ll be using it to book with a different airline.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Grand Rapids to Salt Lake City via Phoenix. Many hidden costs. Very expensive fee for carry on bags. Rude people during check in time. Once on the plane, no communication with pilot, snacks and drinks had to be purchased. There was an ill passenger. He tried to get by stewardess, he was told he had to wait. He tried again to say he wasn't feeling well, they made no effect to move. He started to vomit and started to go down, luckily we had a ob/gyn she jumped over the seats and was able to keep him from falling on the floor. She was able to get him to the restroom, but not before vomiting on people. Another nurse offered to help out also. There were no bags in any air sick bags. Do you know how aweful the smell was? There was nothing to use on the vomit that was on seats and floor. Finally using coffee grounds. Then they didn't have any dust pan or broom to clean up. The staff had to use a piece of cardboard and a piece of plastic to scrap it up. My travel partner had asked how much longer was the flight, he received a rude remark. Not once did the pilot come on to let us know we were going to experience rough weather. The seats didn't recline and was like seating on plywood. It was over a three hour flight. We will never fly with Frontier again. And if you are smart you won't either. Horrible experience.

### "avoid flying Frontier"
Not Verified |  Due to Frontier Airlines’ poor sense of planning, the delays and staff, we will not be flying Frontier again. On our first flight from Spokane to Vegas, the flight was delayed 4 hours and we were not notified until we went to check our bags. There was no email, phone call or text that would give us any kind of heads up that our flight was pushed back so late. Then once at the gate, the two ladies at the counter were extremely unclear about everything they were trying to explain to the already irritated passengers and delayed us from boarding for even longer so they could print out $15 food vouchers for everyone on the flight, which mind you, they already had 4 hours to attempt to do. Bag check, food and beverages, and the flight in general was overpriced compared to the experience. On our last day as we left our hotel to head to the airport, luckily we checked and found that our returning flight was also delayed 40 minutes, and once again no notification. My advice to you is please treat yourself and avoid flying Frontier, an absolute waste of your time and money.

### "Our flight was canceled"
Not Verified |  Tulsa to Calgary via Edmonton. This is my first experience with Frontier and likely my last. Our flight was canceled but we received no prior notice via email or text. When we arrived at the airport in Tulsa and saw on the monitor that our flight was canceled so we approached the counter for information. Instead of being greeted or receiving a quick apology or explanation, we were handed a sheet of paper from the agent. The sheet was dated from the day before (this is how I know that they knew prior that our flight would be canceled) and gave 2 options for how to move forward with the flight being canceled. We were offered via the sheet: 1. A full refund + $500 in future travel vouchers with Frontier. OR 2. $400 credit to find another flight home + $50 in future travel vouchers with Frontier. We needed to get home so we chose option #2. However, I am traveling without a laptop and my cellular service does not have a plan to use in the US (we live in Canada) so I immediately have an issue with the thought of trying to rebook my own flights at a moments notice. Also, I was immediately panicking because $400 is not going to get me home. We were now going to miss our connection in Denver so I would essentially be out 2 flights per traveler. But when I asked if we were going to receive $800 (for 2 flights) per traveler I was told "Uh, I don't know. Now I feel very uneasy. I asked the agent to help me look at flights to get us home. She said we would have to do it ourselves. Absolutely no customer service. I explained to her that I had no lap top and no cellular service so she relented and used her computer to look up flight information for me. After 15 minutes she said she could not find a flight and told me that I would have to look on my own. I asked her if there was someone else I could talk to and she said that I could use their phone to call Frontier Customer Service to which she gave the phone number. After 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone with customer service I was rebooked on a flight with United Airlines the next evening that would get me back to Calgary. I inquired about a hotel or food vouchers now because we were now stuck in Tulsa for 32 hours with no lodging or transportation. I was informed that there would be nothing that they could do about that. I ended my call with customer service and waited for my new reservation to show up in my email. When it arrived within a few minutes I opened it only to find that yes, they had booked a flight for me but not for my child! I went back to the counter and asked the agent to verify if this was a single passenger booking (or was I mistaken) and she told me that I would need to go down to the United counter and ask them to check! I am losing my mind now. I asked the agent if she would get us a hotel for the night so that we would not be stuck at the airport for a day and a half. She said she would not be able to. At that time the gentleman who was also working there said that he would help us get a room through the airport when we returned from the United counter. My son and I walked down to the United counter to verify if the booking was for 1 or 2 travelers. As we were standing in line waiting we can still see the Frontier counter and all the lights start turning off. We stand there and watch the 3 employees gather their personal belongings and leave the counter. They walk right by us with no acknowledgement. What about helping us get a room? What about a flight for my son?

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Not Verified |  Raleigh to Orlando. Original flight was scheduled for 2:00. It got delayed until 3:30. Boarded the plane at 3:45 and was left sitting on the plane for 3 hours and the crew could not tell us what the problem was. No water was offered, not allowed to get up to use the bathroom, nothing. Turned around to be dropped off at the gate again and wait for further instructions. This is not the first time I’ve had problems with this airline. Don’t let the “cheap flights” fool you. What you don’t pay in ticket prices you pay in luggage fees. $35-60 for a carry on both ways. Worst airline I have flown with.

### "delayed by seven hours"
Not Verified |  San Diego to Cleveland. Got in two hours early for my 10:30 am flight. Before long, my departure time was delayed by seven hours due to "maintenance". Took forever to get a reason out of customer support, who offered a garbage voucher for my trouble. Hands down the worst airline there is.

### "high fees for two carry on"
Not Verified |  We booked to fly to Fort Myers from Trenton on Jan. 3,2019 and return March 31. Both flights were delayed in departing by more than 4 hours. The seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The staff on both planes were courteous but non existent except to offer a drink (water is free) and to collect garbage. We landed March 31 during an arctic windstorm. The rolling walkways were visibly trembling and I, an old lady, had trouble reaching the thin handrail as the wind blasted us leaving the door opening. Happily another passenger gave me a hand. The staff just stands as passengers leave, making no offer to help problems of passengers except to order wheelchairs. And try to find your driver in the dark and cold! This is the second (and last) year we walk up and down a winding street freezing after a southern vacation unable to find our ride. Why isn’t there a better system to allow drivers to find their passengers? Oh yes, we paid full fares when we reserved many months ago. And we were not notified of the plane’s problems when we left for the airport in January! In addition, we unexpectedly were made to pay high fees for two carry on small cases. We flew Frontier because it is not too far from our home, convenient we thought. Please take warning. Do not make our mistake.

### "unfriendly and unhelpful"
Orlando to Toronto. Ground staff is very unfriendly and we arrived at gate before door closed time. But he never announce for final boarding! My families with 2 kids were sitting in front of the gate for 15min until the gate door closed we just realized that flight is departing. No one announce for final boarding, I only saw one staff who closed the gate door and walked inside the bridge to the plane. No staff in the gate counter!? (We were sitting there for 15min waiting for boarding announcement. ) By the time he came out from the gate door, he just said nothing he can do, flight is leaving. there are other few more passengers where behind us and mentioned that they just sit in front of the gate for last 1hr and no body announce for boarding. We are NOT late, we arrived before gate closed, but never get inform that we can board. (There are many other passenger sitting at the gate, we don't know that actually our flight passenger were all already on board. We still sitting there for 15min waiting for announcement.) Frontier ground staff is very unfriendly and unhelpful.

### "They always have an excuse"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to San Francisco. Most garbage airline ever. I have never been on one that’s actually on time. They always have an excuse / with no help. If you fly frontier it’s cause every other flight is over priced but the satisfaction of knowing you will be there on time is worth the money.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Atlanta to La Guardia. Charged for carry-on bags, dirty seats, horrible customer service. I will not fly with them again. Shredded safety magazines. You have to pay for WiFi. Warning - do not fly with Frontier.

### "company has lost a customer"
Orlando to Nashville. Frontier has a very high cancelation fee of $119. Their cancelation policy is listed differently in different places on their website. If you look in the wrong place you will be mislead! Make sure to read on their FAQ page here https://faq.flyfrontier.com/help/will-i-be-charged-a-fee-to-cancel-my-reservation. Additionally, their website will not inform you of the policy before you cancel the flight. Your money will just be gone with no explanation. I could not even tell that my flight reservation had been canceled nor did I get an email that made my cancelation clear. I had to call and wait to talk to a representative on the phone just to confirm that my flight had indeed been canceled. This company has lost a customer.

### "the first and last time"
Not Verified |  Denver to Buffalo. You get what you pay for. I’ve flown quite a lot in my life and my most recent travel experience involved Frontier Airlines, this was the first and last time. I purchased a seat selection in advance and upon arriving to the airport I was told that those seats didn’t exist and that nothing could be done. The gate agent was horrible - like the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I would never call for someone to be fired but in this case it feels warranted. After reaching out to Frontier they basically told me, “too bad” and that nothing could be done about the seats I had paid for or the terrible gate agent. Bottom line: Avoid at all costs. Frontier isn’t that much cheaper after everything is said and done to bother with the headache. I’m required to give them a rating between 1 and 10 but we’re it up to me they would get 0 stars.

### "Horrible experience"
Denver to Tampa. Worst airline you can pick. Our flight was canceled due to the weather which was understandable, but they put us on the flight 4 days after our original flight and we had to stay in a hotel and pay for it. On top of that, flight to Denver and flight back home was delayed almost two hours. This company should stop operating. Horrible experience, this is my first and last time flying with Frontier

### "canceled my daughter's flight"
Not Verified |  If I could give them a 0 that's what they would get. They canceled my daughter's flight and would only put her on a flight for 2 days later, which meant that she would miss her grandmother's funeral. On top of it, they would only book her to a flight in Orlando whereas she is going to Tampa. And that Orlando flight was arriving in the middle of the night, 11:50 something pm. Which means we will have to drive from Tampa to Orlando to get her in the middle of the night. I've been trying to call them, but every time I call within a few minutes, they hang up without anyone picking up. So, now after 12 calls, I finally get a little bit further with the recording, but that's just because I said that I would be willing to pay $25.00 to speak to a live person. Even after that, I have now been on hold for nearly 2hours.

### "charged for our carry on items"
Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Orlando. Horrible customer service! Was charged for our free carry on items that fit under our seat and will not refund. Will never fly with this company again. Also the flight attendants were talking trash about customers, I was in the last row and heard the female speak poorly about people near the exit row.

### "never fly with them again"
It’s not worth the discounted flight prices to go through the Frontier Airlines horrendous customer service agents both on the phone and in person. They say you get what you pay for and these people work here and deliver mediocre service bc they get mediocre training and pay. I am a 6 month pregnant woman who was denied checking a bag because I was 1 minute late. The agent said he couldn’t help me and to “be on my way”. Rude, col, young men that had no people skills. They threw away half of my liquids and perfume of course because I had to clear the bag thru security, ultimately missed my flight and ruined my morning. I’ll never fly with them again!

### "flight is delayed 4 hours"
Tampa to Grand Rapids. I honestly don’t know how this airline stays in business! This was my first and last experience. I should have checked the reviews before booking but this was a bereavement situation and I wanted to book this last-minute flight quickly and without paying a fortune. At the time the boarding process should have begun, I noticed it said “Denver” at our gate instead of Grand Rapids. I panicked because I hadn’t heard an announcement of a gate change. The monitors nearby now say the flight is delayed 4 hours. I went back to the gate for additional information only to hear an announcement that now the flight is canceled altogether! We were told we had to collect our bags and return to the ticket counter to rebook or to get a refund. Customer service was shabby at best. I will not be using their $100 voucher (that is only good for 90 days). I will not put myself in their hands ever!

### "will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Denver. Frontier has taken passenger torture to a new level. I have never been so miserable on a flight since the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. Their seats are so close together it is nearly impossible to bend over and get any thing off the floor. At 5’9” my knees are almost touching the seat in front of me. My husband at 6’3” has his knees jammed in the seat in front. The seats are barely padded there is no real head rest and they do not lean back. It is sheer hell to try to sleep in them. The tray tables are pathetic useless and small. They no longer offer drinks and you pay for baggage. They are not even cheap enough to merit the misery. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "gotten on the aircraft dipped in perfume"
I love Frontier, I book 10-12 flights a year for myself and family, great fares and convenient times. But yesterday’s 6am flight from Chicago to Tampa made me incredibly ill and nauseous. Some inconsiderate individual had gotten on the aircraft dipped in perfume. Then, to my surprise, that over powering smell was from one of the flight attendants.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airlines. My flight from Jacksonville to Philadelphia has been delayed four times from this morning. The agents at the gate have no clue what’s going on. All my hotel bookings and return tickets will go waste if they cancel the flight.

### "the worst travel experience"
Not Verified |  La Guardia to Miami. This was my first and last time ever using this airline. From beginning to end it was a terrible experience, customer service is a foreign concept and the nickel/dining is very real. The plane was over 2 hours late to depart and it just progressed from there. Hands down the worst travel experience.

### "being completely rude"
Not Verified |  Atlanta to Denver. Absolutely terrible. My aunt and I tried to buy seats next to each other and were not able to do so, so I bought a seat directly behind her. When getting on the flight the seat next to me and next to her were empty. I asked if we were still boarding and the man rudely answered “no does it look like it” besides being completely rude I asked since we are no longer boarding could me or my aunt move so we could see next together. He yelled at me to sit down and that I could pay him money to sit there. Then stating I should have bought that seat ahead of time making a scene. So rude, there was no need for his rude behavior. If the seat In front of me was more money, why could my aunt move to the seat next to me which was also empty? The one behind her?? Rude and unfriendly staff. Will not be taking this airline again.

### "nightmare to get reimbursed"
Not Verified |  Providence to Ft. Myers. Flight was canceled 2 hours before flight. A nightmare to get reimbursed. NOTE: this must be done within 72 hrs or you get $0.00!! Cost a day of vacation.

### "Customer service is atrocious"
Denver to Cancun. Customer service is atrocious. The app glitches upon attempting to book a flight. If you book through the phone they charge you extra. Then the app switches your bags to default carry on if it glitches and they won’t switch it to carry on and credit you the money because they’re thieves. Such a joke that you can spend thousands of dollars with them just to get to your destination and they won’t take care of the little things like $40 in baggage fees. Would never recommend anyone fly with Frontier. Not worth keeping a company in business that doesn’t take care of their customers.

### "flight was canceled"
Not Verified |  Buffalo to Orlando. After a preliminary email stating the flight was delayed by 2+ hours, the gate employees were unable to provide any useful updates. The 7pm arrival finally showed up an hour later and passengers disembarked at 8:30pm. First we were told maintenance was delayed for clean up of the recent arrival so we were delayed indefinitely. I’d say they never intended to depart. At 10:30pm we were finally told the flight was canceled and as stated there were two options. Rebook with them or $400 for another airline ticket. Since they have one daily departure from Buffalo, I might leave by next week! That’s if they ever reimburse us for the new airline tickets. Frontier management is obviously thrilled to reek havoc on their clients vacations on a daily basis. Credits with them are useless. Prices are too good to be true. Do Not Book with Frontier unless you don’t really want to travel anywhere beyond the airport.

### "awful customer service"
Detroit to Ft Myers. I had booked a flight for today on flight 914 which was cancelled due to the weather conditions. I received a text message that my flight was cancelled and the text said to wait for an email with further instructions which I never received. I then called Frontier to see about a rescheduled flight and was given 3 options: the first was to fly out of Cleveland at 3pm which was impossible considering I live 4 hours away and it had been 1:00 by this time, the second was a 9:50 flight for tomorrow which was booked? So not sure how that was even an option.... and finally a new flight for March 3, which is a week from my original date. Obviously these options are ridiculous and none of them were even remotely reasonable or accommodating. Therefore, I decided to get a refund which inconveniently will not be available for another week. I personally have never had such an awful customer service experience in my life with any airline in all the years of travel. I’m not sure how the 50 other customers on that cancelled flight got to where they are going. I feel that the goal of any business/corporation is to try their best to fully accommodate their customers and frontier airlines does not do that. I understand that weather conditions cancel and delay flights but to just throw your hands up and leave travelers fending for themselves is absolutely absurd. I will never book another flight with Frontier airlines again and will be telling as many people as possible to stay away from this company. I suggest looking into finding a solution to better accommodate your customers.

### "refused to give us a refund"
Orlando to Denver. They delayed our first flight so much so that we missed our connecting flight, then they refused to give us a refund on the flight that we missed because of them, after promising that they would wait for us because we had over 10 others that would be on the same connecting flight on our flight. They lied. Very dishonest. Very unethical.

### "deceptive practices on rental car"
My issue is not with the flight, but rather with deceptive practices on book a rental car. I was charged $192.89 for the rental car; however, only $150.40 was credited as a prepay. After a dozen or so calls to the twp companies, I finally got Frontier to admit they had pocketed the difference ($40.49) as a "third-party fee". However, this "fee" was not disclosed on the website or in the reservation. When confronted with this deceptive practices, the service manager I spoke to just kept repeating that Frontier could only provide information for the flight, not the rental car. There are other airlines out there, e.g., Southwest, that do not impose fees for facilitating car rentals and hotel reservations. Bottom line: don't make car reservations through the Frontier website.

### "flight itself was ok"
Chicago to Puerto Vallarta. The flight itself was ok, after the delay of one and a half hours because of a mechanical problem. My issue is with the obnoxious, rude drunk women on board. She talked extremely loudly the entire flight. Also, she had several cocktails. She had snuck her own alcohol on board and was never without a drink in her hand. The flight attendants knew about her, knew she was extremely loud, and also knew that she was drinking her own alcohol and chose to ignore the whole situation! I was shocked the the attendants allowed this to happen. I suppose it’s just easier to ignore the whole thing. It was an extremely difficult flight for the rest of the passengers anywhere around where she was sitting. I do hope the flight home is without her! I won’t “be patient “ if it happens again.

### "lost a day of our vacation"
Minneapolis to Fort Myers. Our flight was delayed because of broken plane. They kept delaying it until it was finally cancelled late in the day so we couldn't fly out on another airline. They promised the part was on its way and would be fixed by 7:30 am next morning. Instead of taking care of situation and getting another plane for us, they just delayed us the next day as well, saying the part didn't come. They lied to us over and over again. We only had a four day vacation in Florida from Minnesota, so we were so frustrated. There is definitely a need for better customer service with this airline. Not only did we sit in airport for 2 days and spend money on food and drink, we lost a day of our vacation. When I asked them what they would do for us, they simply said here is $100 voucher to use with Frontier. Like we would ever plan to fly with them again, not.

### "charge you for everything"
Not Verified |  New York to Atlanta. This was my first time taking Frontier. I will never take it again. They charge you for everything is a sip of water. It's so uncomfortable and the stewardess was rude. There is no communication between the pilot and the customers. We were taxing for about 25 minutes and the pilot didn't say anything. It's hot and the seats were uncomfortable. I wanted to leave a 0 for overall rating, but it wouldn't allow me too.

### "unbelievably poor service"
Tampa to Chicago. My flight home was cancelled due to mechanical issue with engines. It happens. No problem. But, they absolutely cut bait on us once the flight was cancelled. They offered links for other flights that they’d reimburse for up to $500 total. But all the flights they linked to were sold out or were $1700. They gave us a number to call if we needed further assistance. I called, and was placed on hold 4 times for about 30-40 min each time over the span of 2.5 hours. They were uninterested in helping me find a way home after they cancelled my flight. They simply came out, handed everyone a piece of paper with two useless options and the phone number is sit on hold on and told us we were on our own. It’s that unbelievably poor service that this poor review is for. Don’t blame the employees. It’s their management. Employees are just the ones in front of the firing squad.

### "didn't care one iota"
Sacramento to Las Vegas. I've never experienced a situation as bad as this with any airline in all the years I've been traveling. Our flight was delayed because the pilot did not feel comfortable landing in snow which was apparently coming down in Las Vegas? I verified that at the time it was supposedly snowing, it was actually raining. The gate agent was the rudest woman that many passengers said they'd ever encountered. She told us the flight might not leave, and the soonest flight we could get after today (Sunday) was Wednesday, so we could get a refund right away. Well, as we got to the ticket agent to get the refund, we learned the flight left with our luggage. They didn't care one iota, too bad, too sad. Lies, delays, rudeness, and then the agents started whispering, gossiping and laughing at us to our faces. The worst ever! Don't fly Frontier!

### "Deplorable service"
Not Verified | Denver to Orlando. Deplorable service! Flight departure was delayed over three hours due to a door issue. The desk attendants were far less than courteous. The "compensation" for the delay was a meal venture to McDonalds in the airport that was closed. Ridiculous at best. Dont waste your time and more importantly your money with Frontier.

### "Don’t get lured in by the price"
Cleveland to Tampa. After a four hour delay, our flight was cancelled! Losing a full day of vacation! Now waiting hours for our luggage to be returned to us so we can spend more money renting a hotel room to try to fly tomorrow. I won’t be flying Frontier Airlines again despite the $100 voucher. Staff were not friendly about the changes or forthcoming with information. Don’t get lured in by the price. It’s not worth it!

### "flight was changed again"
Denver to Las Vegas. I received an email stating my flight was delayed by 30 mins. I didn’t make my flight because I arrived to at the gate at 7.35pm. The flight was changed again back to its original time at 737 and was not delayed to depart at 807pm which I had received an email for.

### "It can't get any better!"
Our flights to and from Orlando and Buffalo were great! I was initially put off by all the negative reviews about Frontier, to the contrary! Here's a summary - 1) Check-in staff at Buffalo and Orlando - Polite and efficient! No long waiting times in queues! 2) Flight attendants - Smiling, friendly and helpful! 3) Seats (this was a big one for me, I'm 6'3" tall) - cosy and comfortable. No idea why there are so many whiners out there! Had a family seated next to us with an infant strapped to his chest, never once did he cry! 4) Take-off from Buffalo (delayed by 35 mins). The captain made it a point to apologize (over the intercom) and informed that he would try to get us to Orlando on time! And he did! Obviously using extra gas in the process but he had a plane full of happy passengers! 5) Take-off from Orlando (on time!). Reached Buffalo 35 mins ahead of scheduled arrival. 6) This is the best so-called "discount airline" I've flown in so far. I am from Toronto in Canada. Had I flown from any airport in Ontario, Canada I would end up paying more than double the cost for a direct flight with no stop-overs. For 2 return tickets with 1 carry-on and 1 checked bag - only CAD$495.00. It can't get any better! Thank you, Frontier Airlines!

### "Horrible customer service"
Denver to Phoenix. Worst airline ever. Staff members are rude. They lost my bag. They wanted to charge me for a bag that I had already purchased. Horrible customer service. Never flying with them again.

### "airline by far is the worst"
Las Vegas to Denver. This airline by far is the worst I have ever been on. If you don’t mind getting wherever you want to go 3-5 hours behind schedule every time you get on then don’t ride this airline. This airline is trash.

### "Always delayed"
Salt Lake City to Atlanta via Denver. Worst airline ever. After waiting for over 2 hours, flight got delay for 2 hours then flight attendant was giving attitude. I will never every purchase a ticket for this airline again and you shouldn’t either. Always delayed.

### "never heard them call my flight"
Not Verified |  I was set to fly out to Orlando at 6:50am boarding at gate D18. I never heard them call my flight over the intercom. I saw people sitting at two gates near me. I walked up to the help desk, the plane doors were closed. Located at D16 instead of 18. I asked someone how to get on and she said she doesn’t work there. At approximately 6:43am I see the plane backing out and a woman with a Frontier shirt on say that the plane was leaving. It was a group of us waiting and no one heard the flight get called. I told her that my items is the plane and she said she couldn’t stop it. At this moment I’m livid. I showed her my boarding pass and showed her either way it was wrong. I did not hear them call. All she could tell me it happens often and she’s sorry. Now I have a flight to Orlando Florida at 10:40pm with my luggage in one city and I’m in another. What really annoyed me is, my keys to my car, House, and job is in there and I cannot drive to get my luggage. This has been the worst flying experience ever. They are unsympathetic and inconsiderate.

### "Frontier is a good value"
San Diego to Milwaukee. I think that Frontier is a good value, and they had a non-stop in the winter between San Diego and Milwaukee, which was great. My first problem, though, is that Frontier has seasonal routes, or they discontinue routes altogether. Now that I will be traveling to and from Milwaukee regularly, I tried to book another flight, and there is no more non-stop service between these cities. I joined their Discount Den, because I thought I'd be a repeat flyer on this airline, but that seems to have been a waste. Also, on the return flight, not a huge deal, but they had no coffee creamer! Glad they at least had sugar.

### "told we were 5 minutes late"
Orlando to Nashville. Made it inside with 40 minutes left until boarding time, just to get told we were 5 minutes late and they could rebook my flight for Thursday. This is on a Tuesday. So I accept that and go find a more competent airline to get me home. Call customer service today to cancel the flight for tomorrow and they want $119 to cancel it (the one way ticket itself was $62.30) or they could forfeit the ticket and issue no refund -  nothing. Avoid this airline.

### "Excellent service"
Charleston to Tulsa via Denver. After reading the reviews of this airline and going through their website I was scared this was going to be one of those companies that squeezes money out of you for everything. But actually everything was great. Really nice employees. A good pilot. Excellent service. I had an issue with my baggage and they immediately figured out a solution. The next cheapest airline was double their price. A great value.

### "showed zero customer service"
I was originally supposed to be on the plane for about 5 hours, which includes boarding time, and it turned into 9 hours. This was because of an issue they were unable to control. However, they showed zero customer service or remorse for the delay. Something as simple as a complimentary snack or beverage would have made a huge difference. There was also very poor communication between the crew and the passengers. Every time they said they were in the process of doing something it would take an eternity. They also failed to complete paperwork prior to the flight back to Chicago so that flight was also delayed. No one should ever fly with Frontier Airlines because I certainly never will be again.

### "Poor quality seats"
Miami to Chicago. I never write reviews, with that being said the service with this airline was so bad I had to. No food trays. Poor quality seats. If you have any other luggage other than a personal item it’s $50 -we were on the parkway for a half hour after we landed. Staff was fine but still giving 1 star to reflect my overall feelings.

### "no one told us a thing"
Portland to Denver with Frontier Airlines. Absolute worst flying experience ever! Sat on the plane that was late for an hour and no one told us a thing, then the flight attendant had no clue what was happening. So much for the pilot, who had no clue either. Worst experience ever.

### "absolute worst experience"
Cleveland to Phoenix, We just had the absolute worst experience ever with Frontier airlines! I would never, ever recommend anyone to travel with them. To start we were boarded on the plane that was absolutely filthy there was food and trash under and around our seats. The seats were abnormally small. The bathrooms were dirty and smelled. And after we sat on the plane for an hour and a half waiting for take off we were asked to get off the plane because the plane was not heating correctly. After three delays and a two and a half hour wait our flight was cancelled! They did not have another flight to offer until 3 days later! No one apologized or compensated us for having to cancel our entire trip. I will never fly Frontier ever again!

### "Poor poor service"
La Guardia to Atlanta. Frontiers flights are wonderful if you have all day to spend in the airport due to their flight delays I have been in La Guardia for hours waiting for flight 419 to depart. I have received two emails that the flight has been delayed There are no customer service at the airport until 3:00pm so if you have questions you are out of luck! I called customer service and after being on hold for over an hour I was told the flight was delayed indefinitely. What kind of mess is this. I could not even get a refund for my inconvenience. I not only will never travel with again but will tell everyone I know Please don’t fly on Frontier not matter what, not worth your wasted time or extreme stress. Poor poor service.

### "ridiculously handled"
Cancun to St. Louis. This is ridiculously handled. We had a flight cancelled and it has taken us 2 hours standing on a tarmac to get to walk back through customs and they still aren't ready. We are now in a clostrophobic tunnel with no idea when or where we are going.

### "I'll never fly Frontier again"
I had the misfortune of flying Frontier Airlines on January 28, 2019. I arrived in Denver from Los Angeles after 4:00 am. My flight to Greenville, SC, where I live, was scheduled nearly six hours later. Around 8:30 am we received word that the Greenville flight was canceled, but we were not told why. We were told the next earliest flight into Greenville would be Friday - four days later! The best Frontier could offer was a flight to Charlotte, NC the next day! It was not possible to take a connecting flight with another airline, because Frontier doesn't have that kind of relationship with other airlines. Frontier did not even offer meal vouchers for those of us who had to stay overnight in the airport. When another customer expressed concern over not having a place to go for the night and needing to get to her destination, she was offered a number for people who are "distressed. The Denver-based Frontier staff was callous and insensitive to inconvenienced travelers. I'll never fly Frontier again.

### "Better to stay away!"
Trenton to Orlando. I have never experience harassment from an airline employee until we fly frontier. When we arrived for our first flight in Orlando, we went up to the customer service desk to check in our daughter stroller, and car seat and carry on. But the rep there told us “oh no you that bag wouldn’t be considered a paid carry on because it was our daughters suitcase. Now on our returning flight back to Orlando. The moment we went through security (literally a 5 minute process because the airport is so small) and sat down at our seat, a lady came up to me without stating her name or credentials, she had a black coat on (no frontier uniform on) and asked me to check in our stroller and asked me did we pay for our carry on (mind you, we arrived at 8:30 and the flight was not departing till 10:51. I immediately thought what is the rush, this airport is super small and we have plenty of time before the flight departs). When I told her we have time for all of that, she started looking at me with an attitude and said it’s best to do it early, please do it now. When I told her, we will take care of it when we are ready, she stormed off, rolled her eyes, and told the reps behind the desk about us. When I got to the gate, they immediately said, “you need to pay for your bag” and the lady with stood right next to her. At this point I looked at her and asked her to please stop harassing me over a $50 carry while I hold my infant. My husband who was behind me started telling the rep what the Orlando Rep said and that if it’s not the same case okay we will pay. Before he could even finish his sentence, the lady immediately interrupted and said we have to pay or we won’t board. We weren’t even attempting to board but rather trying to talk, She literally stood in our, and harassed us. I have never experience such a rude and disrespectful employee in my life. We had every intentions on paying for that bag but what was so frustrating was the fact that she would not let us finish our sentence, assumed we wouldn’t pay, and threaten us by saying she won’t let us board the flight. I should of listen to and sticked to my gut when I saw so many bad review about this airline. There’s a reason, there flights are so cheap! There is no legroom, the cabin feels very tight, no snacks or drinks for free, extra fees on everything, rude employees and delayed flights. Needless to say we will never fly frontier again. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. Better to stay away!

### "Customer service is horrendous"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. I used to fly Frontier years ago but switched to Delta for the past 5 years. I flew Frontier in 2019 and I am blown away by their horrible business model. They are the worst airline there is. Every single thing is an additional fee. Customer service is horrendous, the plane is awful with rock hard seats and they proving nothing! Pay a few dollars more and fly with a different provider!

### "nasty customer service"
Syracuse to Orlando. I understand when a delay occurs and it did on this day. I was told by other passengers they were given a $75 voucher for a future flight. I was not. I was offered $25. No one can be called and communication through email resulted in a nasty customer service person who despite me proving the other passengers did get this, was rude and not willing to help me. I was suprised that the same courtesy was not given to me. Despite being delayed the staff on the plane were nice

### "worst customer service ever"
Our flight from Tampa to Syracuse NY was delayed every hour, 6 times and then was finally cancelled due to a problem with one of the engines. Which is fine, but at 930pm when the flight was finally cancelled they handed out a piece of paper with instructions on how to find our own transportation. The next Frontier airline was not for 48 hours, which apparently, was all full. Nor did they assist all passengers with hotel accommodations. I will not fly this airline again, and would recommend anyone thinking about flying Frontier to plan ahead when Frontier cancels your flight and leaves you without assistance. The worst customer service ever.

### "customer service is the worst"
Albany to Ft Myers . Worst customer service ever. I was 4 mins late to check in during a snow storm on January 19th 2019. Went to the Frontier Desk and tried to check in. No one was there so I asked someone standing at the next counter. He went to get the ticket agent who came out with an attitude. She told me she couldn't print my boarding pass but if I wanted to try to get on without a boarding pass to run upstairs. I asked her to rebook me on thier next flight and she said she couldn't. For the past 3 days I had tried to call frontier to rebook my ticket and was hung up on repeatedly. Today I finally get through and they tell me I am too late and sorry. Well as far as I am concerned they are the worst company to deal with and I bought the flexible extra plan that was of no use. Frontier customer service is the worst and you purposely don't call people back until the deadline is over to rebook.

### "the price rose again"
Fort Myers to Providence . Frontier Airlines was the worst airline ever. I could not add my bags online, even though it said to do so would be cheaper. Literally the toggle was unavailable to do this. Tried at airport and kiosk was charging 45 per bag. That wouldn’t allow me to add either. Next stop the counter where, because I didn’t check bag online or on kiosk, the price rose again. No one cared that I was not allowed to add bags by either prior method. Most expensive flight from FL to RI ever!

### "never be using this airline again"
Ft Myers to Milwaukee. Terrible airline leaving fort Meyers there ended up being an hour delay which is fine but there was no information brought to the people at all. Not a word and there wasn’t any works either so you couldn’t ask. Then we get to Milwaukee and they lost half of the flights baggage some how. I will never be using this airline again

### "do not fly Frontier"
Not Verified | If you have another option do not fly Frontier! I've never been treated so disrespectfully and unprofessionally by flight attendants after patronizing just about every airline and a frequent flyer for three major airlines. I flew from Dallas to Denver and landed in Los Angeles approximately 4 hours later after purchasing a Frontier "ultra-low-cost" fight. Make sure you read find print because when booking a Frontier flight, customers have to pay extra fee for a seat. And save the hassle even pay for carry on luggage. $45, yikes. Don't bother inquiry about there "Stretch row seating" ("extra 5-8 pitch") lumbar support and diamond stitch supposely available for an "addditional fee seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on any airline.  The seats were the smallest they possibly could be, there was no padding in them (like sitting on a board), and it did not recline. I get into the cabin and there is no WiFi, no electrical outlets, no free beverages (other than water), no free snacks not even an movie. Beverages start at $2.99, just incohert. Rather go the bathroom go straight to the baggage carousel otherwise they may keep your belongings.

### "delusional discounts"
Atlanta to San Francisco. The worst airline I have flown in the entire world. I missed my flight beyond my circumstances due to long TSA delays during the government shutdown. The TSA queue in Atlanta was 2hr 30 mins long (if you have flown to or through Atlanta you know what I mean) & noway I would have made to that flight. When I arrived at the gate the agent impolitely told me the next flight to San Francisco is 4 days out and couldn't wait for 4 days to catch my next flight. I asked for refund which they refused and they told me even if I had to wait for 4 days for the next flight, I was still going to pay for the new ticket. I have never seen something like this in my entire life. I gladly booked with United Airlines the same day. Frontier is the worst airlines in the World. I thought I would try it just one time, turned to be my worst decision which cost me more money than the delusional discounts they give. Will never fly it again and my family too.

### "this was a horrendous experience"
So I will never be flying with Frontier again. I don’t care if their tickets are cheaper but my experience was horrible. It began when I went to the self-service station to print our boarding passes. I had one bag that needed to be checked because it was just slightly too big and when I mean slightly, I’m talking like 1-2 inches. When I selected check baggage it was $45! We then asked one of the guys in a Frontier shirt if they do anything for military personnel, he said to get in line. So we do. We asked the guy behind the computer and he said they check one bag for active duty but do nothing for those that are retired. Mind you my brother served 8 years. So not even a 20% discount or anything? That’s just absolutely absurd. We paid the $45 fee and moved on. Our boarding time was 6:15pm, come 6:20 no one is getting in line and we are told by some fellow travellers that there will be a 45m delay because they need to change a tyre. 7pm comes around, no word over the intercom. 7:23pm hits and finally someone says they are still doing repairs and it will be another 30m. Well, they suck at estimating their repairs because we did not get in line to board until 8:57pm! This causes us to miss our flight from Denver back home to San Francisco and for me to have to call my boss and miss a day of work. We figured they would offer some sort of compensation for having us be delayed so long, even the pilot said normally it doesn’t take that long. As we approach the man who scans our boarding passes, the group in front of us asks and he says he’s not sure, but probably not. (They missed their shuttle that was going to take them somewhere in Denver.) We get into the cabin and we were told there is no WiFi, no electrical outlets, no free beverages (other than water), no free snacks, no movies, no games, no magazines, seats do not recline the trays are no bigger than a small tablet, and more. So we said to hell with it we will pay for food and alcohol because we are hungry and thirsty from waiting so long. The alcohol list was sad. The bourbon they had was disgusting, Breckenridge?, had to choke it down. The snack pack had a beef stick that was oily and gross, the cheddar cheese was this creamy texture similar to cream cheese, but it was salty and slimy, not as good, and half my crackers were broken. I took a bite of everything and gave up. 4 bourbons, 2 sodas and 2 snack packs was $30. You’re welcome. The plane is one of the loudest I have been in, thankful I brought ear plugs. It’s the 21st century Frontier, I can tell you, your guests expect more. Then to top this all off we go to customer service to see what our options were. We are told the next flight to SFO isn’t until 10:55pm tomorrow. They offer a hotel, however, we have to check out at 10am. We asked why they can’t put us in a hotel for two days they literally said, “we’re not gonna put you in a hotel for two days sorry.” We ask for a refund to purchase with a different airline. They said , “it won’t be a full refund.” So you’re telling me you guys fucked up and didn’t follow proper pmcs, so we had to suffer a delay and now further suffer? What kind of company is this?! All in all this was a horrendous experience. I’ll be paying an extra $100-$150 more on my flights to ensure I’m on a better airline next time. First time flyer with them and we won’t be returning customers, nor will any of my friends or family.

### "Seat sizes are a joke"
3 Frontier flights in 2 weeks, all delayed. Seat sizes are a joke (average male, shoulders extend beyond the width of my seat), very little cushioning and no lumbar support for 4+ hour flights. I used to be a loyal Frontier customer but I will be trying different airlines from now on, the small amount saved on tickets is not worth the delayed flight times and discomfort.

### "was the worst experience"
Denver to Charlotte. If you have another option do not fly Frontier. This was the worst experience. First I showed up 2 hours before my flight took off and I stood in line for most of the time they were calling people to come up to a different line if they were about to miss their flight and there were many who missed it just while I was there because they only had one person who was working hard to get through the line I only had 5 minutes to get onto my plane after I got out of the line then when I got to my flight I was in the front so it wasn’t to bad but the seats aren’t great and they don’t have a lot of what other airlines have then when I got off the plane to go and get my luggage my bag was unzipped so I lost a shoe my clothes were falling out when I got it and my lotion was missing that I just got. You would think if they went through your things they would zip your bag back up before losing your valuables if I would have lost something that was more important than those few things I would have been livid.

### "I never got my points"
Atlanta to Los Angeles. Several weeks ago Frontier offered "Triple Points Tuesdays" in which the customer was awarded triple points for flying Tuesdays. I signed up for this offer and flew 2 Tuesdays. When I was awarded single mileage points I called and complained. The agent refused to make the correction and when I asked to speak with a supervisor she finally said she would forward my request and a decision would be made within 7 days (just to get me off the phone). I never got my points, of course.

### "agent said they won’t refund"
I booked a round trip flight, from Des Moines to Denver, CO then from Denver to Orange County and back. They made me wait at the Denver airport for 10 hrs prior to departure. Then on the day I need to return, even though, I arrived one hour prior to departure, at the check-in counter, had some problem and staff told me to check in my bag, but I don’t have to then finally got through the TSA and got to the gate at 11:52 am with two other people. The couple that arrived were going from Orange County to Denver then Denver back to Washington D.C As we arrived no body was at the gate. I had to ran down stairs to get their attention but It was on ink that departure time is 11:59 The agent said they won’t refund. We have to book another flight from another airline and its out of our pocket. Frontier airline have only one flight each, while other airlines has many that is available. To me time is money. They wasted my time; very important and people’s money, so if you don’t want to waste time and money, avoid Frontier.

### "Worst flying experience"
Charlotte to Oklahoma City via Orlando. Worst flying experience ever. They lost my bag and when I called and tried to get updates on it, it seemed like I was inconveniencing them. Very unprofessional crew at OKC. They were never at the counter. Wouldn't answer the phone either. Had to call a customer service number to get somewhere. A very frustrating experience dealing with uncaring people who aren't doing their job. I practically had to beg them to send me my bag to my hotel room when it finally arrived. They wanted to wait until morning instead of sending it immediately. The plane ride was also very uncomfortable and sketchy. Super cheap and nothing is complimentary. Prices weren't that cheap for what I experienced. Should have been free for all of that trouble. I’m currently awaiting a refund for the items I had to purchase while my bag was located. I had a military event to attend and I had to purchase nice clothing along with beauty cosmetics to attend. It has been almost 3 weeks and I have yet to receive a refund check they promised to send to me. It’s unfortunate I had such a bad experience flying to an event that was so special and well planned ahead of time. Save yourself and don't EVER book a flight with them!! You’re welcome!

### "Save the hassle"
Orlando to Atlanta. Flying with Frontier was a horrible experience! I didn’t know but you have to pay for carry on luggage. Added cost! You have to pay for any soda on the flight. Added cost! They gave us the run around about my ticket regarding my name and I almost missed my flight! You’re not saving money by flying with Frontier! Save the hassle and fly with another airline!

### "no refund on the check bag fees"
Not Verified |  Tampa to Philadelphia. Frontier cancelled return flight of round trip to FL. They offered to pay for another airline. I booked another airline to return the family home. We had paid to have bags checked on the Frontier flight. Upon cancelling the flight they refused to refund the checked bag fees for the cancelled flight. I ended up having to take Uber to another airport to catch my return flight and pay to check bags to get home that day. Out an additional $150+. I contacted Frontier customer service and they responded that covering the cost of the flight was all they would do - no refund on the check bag fees for the cancelled flight (approximately $75) I fly frequently, this was the first and last time with Frontier.

### "We had a lengthy delay"
Nashville to Philadelphia. We had a lengthy delay (4 hours). I know that was beyond the control of the airline however when we checked in in with our boarding passes were two meal vouchers. That is how we found out there was a delay. It would have been appropriate to mention the delay when we checked in. Additionally the pilot never welcomed the passengers on or have information as we approached our destination. There was only communication for flight attendants to take their seats.

### "I wouldn’t recommend"
Tampa to Denver. Yes they have low prices but you seriously get what you pay for, the lowest of the low. Definitely the worst seats I’ve ever sat on. The trays are less than half the standard size barely enough room for you to put your head on, and no cup holder spot. Everything costs money, from bags to every little thing besides a cup of water they offer on the last half of the flight. I wouldn’t recommend at all unless maybe a flight an hour or less long.

### "been the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Denver. Frontier Airlines has been the worst experience we have ever had with travel. My family chose a direct flight from RDU to DEN via Frontier and received 3 out of 4 of our checked bags. The 4th bag never arrived and after speaking with a representative, we quickly learned that this was nearly expected of this airline. However, this bag happened to contain all of our expensive and necessary ski equipment, so it creates a much bigger issue than a normal lost baggage claim. We have attempted to contact Frontier several dozen times, and succeeded only a handful of times, only to receive the same speech stating that they don’t have a clue where our bag is, but that they are sorry and do not know what we should do about our belongings but they guarantee they won’t reimburse us or help at all. We are now in Denver, paying for lodging, and unable to use the ski lift tickets that we’ve paid for because Frontier will not reimburse us for anything until a week has passed and they will then decide the bag is “missing.” Well, in a week we will be back home and short several thousand dollars because of Frontier’s carelessness and incompetence. Frontier has offered no solutions to their mistake, and has been very clear that they do not care at all. They are knowingly ruining paying customers’ vacations and making no effort to remedy the situation because they are more concerned with making money and cutting their costs. Needless to say, we are never going to fly with Frontier again. In addition, we are making it our mission to warn as many friends and family as we can to avoid this airline at all costs, because it’s become so evident that they will cut corners to cut costs and maximize their profit off of their trusting and innocent customers. A slightly cheaper flight is definitely not worth the costs of replacing your belongings, and especially not worth the risk it may pose.

### "last time I am flying with them!"
Denver to Orlando. 2 out of 3 times I've flown with Frontier I had problems. This time my first flight from Seattle to Denver got delayed by 2.5 hours so i missed my connecting flight to Philadelphia. Seeing that i won't make it in time the Frontier desk changes my flight to Orlando first and then to Trenton, NJ! I thought I don't mind, but asked what was going to happen to my checked bag. The associate told me it will travel to Trenton and gave me a new baggage claim stub. I barely made both of those connecting flights only to find that my snowboard gear worth 1300$ didn't make it back to Trenton. And the Frontier person there told me i did not get the right claim stub. I filled out a form and now am hoping for the best, but i swear this is the last time I am flying with them!

### "Awful from beginning to end"
Syracuse to Tampa. Awful from beginning to end. They charge you for water on the plane. Staff are rude and unprofessional. That was all while the going was good. Then our flight was cancelled. They kept us in the airport for three hours, sent us up and down all over the airport until they finally gave us our hotel coupon. All they would say is "we are waiting to hear from headquarters". Each reservation got one hotel room, so you have a family of four adults - two couples - in a room. Everyone on the flight was furious with how it was dealt with. The next morning, the flight was delayed. Again, not a word. Imagine watching your plane be driven away from the terminal. And this is the rescheduled flight. Later they told us they were warming the engine. We were travelling with 2 kids and there was no accomodation. There's more, but I have no time and patience. Do yourself a favor - stay away.

### "Don’t go with this company"
Orlando to Las Vegas. Flight was delayed 2 hours for some reason but not mechanical. I made ticketing agent aware in Orlando that I would miss my connection to Las Vegas in Raleigh, NC. They told me to go ahead and try to make connection as there was a possibility of the flight being delayed as well. When I got to Raleigh of course connecting flight was missed. I contacted the ticketing agent and she informed me that because I did not change in Orlando that I would not be able to make a connection to Las, Vegas for 24 hours. I explained my situation and what had transpired. The lady arrogantly handed me a boarding ticket for a flight 24 hours later. I contacted customer service and they were very short and unconcerned. So, I get to pay for a hotel, meals and travel. Don’t go with this company and shell out the extra dollars for a more reputable airline.

### "will never use them again"
Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas. The tickets are reasonable, but when you check in the cost per baggage is $50 including a carry on. Besides the price of tickets I had to pay an extra $400 round trip for baggage. I could have gone with a different airline an still save about $200. I will never use them again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Washington to Salt Lake City via Denver. Worst airline ever. This was the first and last time I will fly with Frontier. When we had arrived at our destination they had lost our car seat and told us we never checked one. Then they didn’t have a temporary one for us to use which left us stuck in the airport until a store was open for us to buy one until they figured out where ours was. All customer service reps we talked to were rude, unhelpful, and combative. I can imagine that it is due to the fact that frontier doesn’t care about its customers. The greatest service they could provide us all is to shutdown their business. I am only rating them 1/10 because I can’t give them less.

### "they have given up on us"
Denver to Norfolk. My family of 5 travelled with Frontier returning from CO to VA. We checked 7 bags, paying a total of $500 in baggage fees. The flight was not bad although we paid extra for seating also, to only have seats that did not recline. Our trip back home became a disaster upon arrival in VA. We received on 5 of 7 checked bags. We were told bags agents usually lost, we should have it within a day. Whatever. They lost our 6 month old daughters car seat! We were told at least 5 times the “loaner” car seat must be returned when we get our original. The car seat was not up to my standards to have my child riding around in. It was flimsy and awfully cheap. I was so disappointed. Luckily one of our rides home from the airport had an additional car seat in their vehicle. We filed the claim and went home. Roughly 2 days later the car seat appeared at our front door with a tag from Fed Ex. No communication just at the front door. I am grateful to have her car seat back but communication would have been great. Nonetheless we still had a suitcase missing. After 4 weeks going back and forward with Central Baggage in CO via phone and email, I was told my case was being escalated. They asked for a lost baggage claim to be filled out and to add receipts for what was in the bag. I sent in receipts for more than $3800. The email stating it was received stated compensation can take up to 6 weeks. I received an email 3 days later stating they would compensate my family $840, everything received was used on a depreciated scale, have a nice life. How dare they tell me my personal belongings for my family is nothing but a quarter to the value after they lost it! I would love to have our bags back but it seems like they have given up on us.

### "never using Frontier again"
Austin to San Jose. Originally scheduled for 7am takeoff. The plane had a mechanical issue and was delayed 3.5 hours. Almost 4 hours later, they cancelled the flight. Customers, including myself, were trying to call to get things sorted out, but the Frontier agents on the phone failed to acknowledge that the flight was cancelled and wouldn't do anything about it. The woman I talked to gave me a refund right away because I had paid the extra money for the refundable ticket, but this was before she told me that my flight wasn't actually cancelled. After hours of arguing that my flight was indeed cancelled, they refused to give me a hotel voucher or any extra compensation for a new plane ticket. I was finally able to get to customer relations after repeatedly asking three different people to be transferred (they initially refused to transfer me). After speaking with customer relations, they gave me $550 in credit and $150 towards a new plane ticket on a different airline. Not ideal, but this was at 4:30pm and I as tired of dealing with it. I'll be using my voucher and then never using Frontier again (this is not my first issue with them regarding a situation like this).

### "There is always a delay"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Trenton. I have flown many Frontier flights over the years. I know they nickel and dime you and I know to pack real light (i.e. a backpack under my seat). I know that most likely we will not get there on time and I plan for that. There is always a delay. I think I’ve only every had 1 of their flights leave on time. I expect this. However in the last year I have had not two flights cancelled. The crew at the desk would make the announcements and just disappear with no answers as to why. In this latest cancellation, the flight was delayed 3 hrs and now set to depart at 6:08pm. The other flight lands, deplanes, and we get ready to board. Then they close the gate. It’s been 30 mins and no one has told us anything. We see a Frontier agent and ask them what’s happening. They said they just need the captain to sign off on some paperwork and they can board the plane. Then we start seeing that the flight is saying cancelled online. We ask the agents, they know nothing. When you call frontier, they said our flight was in-flight! Finally they come out and announce that the flight is cancelled but they have no idea how we can get our bags and go about finding another way to get to our destination. We wait at the gate for another hour, while they say their manager is coming with information. A manager never came. They still had no idea. They said the reason the flight couldn’t take off is because they were short 1 crew member. They couldn’t find anyone to staff their flight. Are you serious? We finally get told our baggage will be in baggage claim and wait another 30 mins for it with, as you guessed, no one to give us any information. In the line for the ticket counter they give us a paper that says we can use a website to rebook our flight and that we will be reimbursed with the cost up-to $400. A new flight on American so I can get to my destination cost me $410. I’m now worried based off of other reviews that I may not see that money. Things happen, I get it. However, you should keep your passengers aware of the situation in a timely manner so they can adjust their plans. Your staff should know what is happening and should be able to answer questions. Being held hostage in the airport for 5+ hours with no idea what is happening, how I can get to my destination, and how I can get my bag is ridiculous. The likelihood that your flight will get cancelled is high and in the end you will shell out more money than the $100 you saved.

### "receive bags 4 days after my flight"
Not Verified |  Denver to Huntsville via Orlando. Checked 3 bags at Denver. Had a connection in Huntsville to Orlando final destination. Baggage failed to mention that it's necessary to re-check bags at a connection. During layover in Huntsville, I got a call from the Frontier luggage service saying they had my bags at the claim. I told the representative that it must be a mistake because Orlando was my final destination. I told them what flight I'm going on and they said they would get it on the flight where it needed to go. Obviously that didn't happen as I am to receive my bags by mail about 4 days after my flight. I could have saved money and express mailed them myself. Maybe I'll just mail myself next time too.

### "their staff are not helpful"
Tampa to Vegas. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 2:59pm and we did not board until 9pm. Once we boarded we did not start moving until 10, and that’s when we stopped and had to return to the gate and eventually get off due to cancellation maintenance issues. They kept pushing back departure time, not communicating with their customers what exactly was going on. The plane hadn’t even arrived until around 6 and then we’re told it was in maintenance. We had Golden Knights tickets and had booked our hotel at Aria. So missed out one night at Aria and our Golden Nights game tickets put to no use because they kept giving us hope by continually pushing back our departure time like there was a chance we’d make it. Bottom line, this airlines is a joke and their staff are not helpful. We are scheduled for a flight now tomorrow at 11 but who knows if it’ll take off in time. To be continued...

### "Missed flight due to staffing"
Denver to Indianapolis. Missed our flight due to staffing issues. Got rebooked from Denver to Vegas to Cincinnati - flight delayed. Got a flight from Denver to Indianapolis - no bags of course. Just trying to get to Ohio to see family.

### "take a different airline"
Orlando to New York. Customer service is absolutely horrible. Do your self a favor pay the $100 more each way and take a different airline! A small gesture goes a long way. My poor mother drove 2 hours to the airport and got there an hour prior on Christmas the poor thing made it to baggage and got declined entry because it was 45 min till flight time were on their website/ itinerary it states black and white that is totally fine.

### "never fly Frontier again"
San Francisco to Las Vegas via Chicago. My husband and I first flew frontier in a package we purchased on vegas.com in December of 2017. We had a bad experience with the flight attendants, on the return flight, who were rude and seemed to be talking about and making fun of customers, but we did not do a review. On the first leg of that trip, attendants were great, but I applied for and received the frontier credit card, on board and was told that I would receive 40,000 miles, that would pay for two round trip tickets to anywhere in the continental US. Not true, Fast forward to December 2018, we needed a round trip ticket from Chicago to San Francisco and back, for our trip to Hawaii. I earned several thousand more points throughout the year, but barely had enough points to cover a one-way ticket from San Francisco to O'Hare on the last leg of our trip. We had to go through another airline for one way tickets from O'Hare to San Francisco. On the one way, with Frontier, from San Francisco to O'Hare, on December 22, 2018, had a layover in Vegas for 3 hours, so we had two different flight crews. On both of these flights, we had the worst flight attendants we have ever had on any flights we have ever taken! They were some of the most rude individuals I have ever seen. These attendance had bad attitudes and I heard and observed them making fun of customers who were on the flight. They were complaining amongst each other when they had to wait for a handicapped man who was being pushed in a wheelchair. We sat in the first few rows for both flights and several different times we heard and observed the attendance laughing and making fun of customers on the flight. At one point my husband woke up and observed a female flight attendant looking directly at him, laughing and speaking to two other attendants. She turned away is sharply upon seeing his eyes open and then walked into the galley with the other attendants. Why do they have attitude and display nasty behavior? They are in a customer service related field and should act as such! I took three other flights for this trip, with Hawaiian Airlines and American. All attendants on the other flights where awesome! Frontier needs to retrain or have new training on how to treat customers. Can you please explain to me why we could not put our carry-ons in the empty bins above are row, but was rudely directed to put them in bins four rows back, causing a back up upon getting off the plane? I will never fly Frontier again! Four flights were enough for us!

### "would definitely recommend"
Flew with my kids for a few days from Cincinnati to Las Vegas. Basically you get what you pay for. Great prices. Flights were on time, Service was good. We arrived safe. What more can we ask for? The seats were close but you can upgrade to more roomer seats with quicker boarding and exiting. I would definitely recommend and fly with them again!

### "very pleased with Frontier"
Orlando to Lafayette. Lafayette finally has straight through flight to Orlando, and I am so happy! I fly Frontier Airlines  at least once a month and appreciate the low cost, new fleet, and professional employees. I fly out of New Orleans and Lafayette most of the time. Sure, they are not perfect, but I haven’t discovered an airline that is perfect. They have flights that can be delayed, just like other airlines. I think they have done a better job at handling the delayed flights than other airlines I have flown. So far I have not had a canceled flight. On 12/21/2018 I had a flight that could have easily been canceled, but instead Frontier worked hard to get us in the air and to our destination. After boarding (9:45 a.m.) our Pilot let us know that he had been alerted of an EXIT sign missing on the plane and “as ridiculous as he felt this was, the FAA won’t let him fly without it”. He said he they were asking other airlines if they had one, but would have us deplane for our comfort, while they worked to solve this problem. We disembarked and within 30 minutes they had another plane for us to board 2 gates down. It did take a while to get our plane boarded (was in my seat at 11:04 a.m.) because there were no less than 6 wheelchair passengers to board (Christmas families crowd). I am sure they appreciated the care they received to get onboard safely. We arrived in LFT at 1:27 p.m., only 2 hours late on one of the year’s busiest travel days. The Orlando staff kept their cool, under a lot of pressure from disgruntled passengers. They got all the people needing some extra assistance onboard safely - TWICE. They got the rest of us onboard safely - TWICE. They communicated with us often, transferred all the bags, and did a good job getting us loaded in a timely manner. The Crew and Pilot did an excellent job keeping us informed. I did look up the FAA laws and verified the EXIT sign missing would “deem the jet unflyable”. There were many passengers questioning the truth of the Pilots’s announcement, so I wanted to check his truthfulness. We arrived safely a couple hours late. I was very pleased with Frontier for getting us to our destination and not canceling our flight during the holidays!!! I paid $335 for 4 seats round trip during the Holiday period.

### "feel like I was targeted"
San Diego to Denver via Charlotte. After flying frontier 7x with a bag bought for frontier and had no issues in Denver I was pulled out of line and after another 75 passengers boarded was told to go to cust serv to pay a carry on fee - I said it fit under the seat had just came flown in and have used this multiple times before. The girl said she wasn't letting me on the plane and to go to cust serv and she was closing the door in 4 min. So I went and both girls there said my bag looked fine. The station manager Brian came over and said it wouldn't fit and no sizer was available. I said it was. I was then told that if I didn't pay them that they would charge me a 99 rebooking fee on top of my baggage fee and Id miss my plane. I paid it and as I did one girl said that they were getting audited and trying to get their #s up and I was just the unlucky one on this flight. I ran back to my gate and the door had been shut. Luckily security reopened it for me and the girl who had pulled me aside that I had no right to have security open the door and that I should have rebooked and she took my carryon coupon and would not return it. I was in tears by this point. I have never been treated so disrespectfully. I feel like I was targeted as a young female travelling alone. Do not fly frontier through Denver. It is not worth it.

### "One excuse after another"
Not Verified | Jacksonville to Philadelphia. My mom was coming to visit and have Christmas this weekend here in Jacksonville. Her flight was leaving at 7:30 this morning was delayed to 1:30 and then four more delays. One excuse after another. First hydraulics. Then weather in Jax. Then oxygen malfunction. 12 hours later at 7:40pm they started boarding. She was comped a lunch and a dinner. She is 76 years old who has spent over 10 hours at the airport so she could meet her great granddaughter and spend the weekend with her daughter and family.

### "the service is terrible"
Not Verified |  Austin-Bergstrom to Philadelphia. With Frontier not only are there hidden fees, but the service is terrible. They charge extra for carry-on, water, coffee etc. As well as no WiFi movie music etc. Attendants huddle in back socializing ignoring patrons! All ages had to carry bag up stairs to board plane in tarmac, while attendants watched and ignored your struggle. American Airlines flight in reverses ticket covered the seat, carryon, drinks, snacks, WiFi, movies, and actual service for the same price as Frontiers seat only! Have at least $100 per person extra when taking a Frontier Flight as you will need it to get your boarding pass home etc. It was a horrible experience with Frontier but an amazing one with AA! Both trips were one way non-stop flights and should have cost the same but if you can’t see the small print on Frontier you are out of luck, money and a decent trip.

### "nowhere to put my bag"
New York to Fort Lauderdale. Lady at check in told me I could bring my checked bag as a carry on because it was the right size. Then I verified with one of the counter guys to make sure since it was suppose to be a checked in. When it was time to board I scanned my ticket they said I didn’t have a carry on, and I informed them I paid for a checked bag, so they detained me to “confirm”. Once they confirmed me I boarded the plane late and there was nowhere to put my bag. I walked up and down the isles and waited for more people to take their seats. I would have just checked my bag, originally. None of the flight attendants were helpful, and the person that detained me ended up being the guy who took my bag and he didn’t even apologize for detaining me.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Oklahoma City to Denver. I had a flight in July and they cancelled my flight to and from. While they will tell you they will reimburse you for the extra flights you have to to buy to get where you are going or back home, they will make it to where it is like pulling teeth to the the money back. They cancelled 2 flights and I spent over 600 dollars and they are trying to screw me over by only giving me 400$! They say up to 400$ per flight cancelled. And they are just trying to put both my cancelled flights as one so I don’t get my money back! I have talked on the phone for hours and hours with these people. Finally was told the rest of the check was on its way - it’s been 4 months since then and I still haven’t received the rest of my money. Called today again and they have no idea what I’m talking about like I’m not in the system. Horrible customer service.

### "worst airline in business"
Colorado Springs to Phoenix. The worst airline in business today! Aside from the ridiculous surcharges for luggage and carryon and where your seat is located they are never on time! Four hour delay in COS on a plane coming from Vegas, and after the plane arrives and the passengers deplaned, our crew is not available? Where have they been for the last four hours? ?

### "terrible service on the plane"
Not Verified |  Austin Texas to Salt Lake City. First off I’m not even sure where I begin with my complaints, they claim you get cheap flights and although that is true they more than make up with it with their bag fees and then some. Then there is terrible and I mean terrible service on the plane, no pretzels, drinks, no internet, and speaking of service, customer service is even worse. I’ve given Frontier Airlines my last dollar, absolutely no more, I’ve given them several chances to prove they can be a decent airline and they’ve proven each time they can’t. I’m telling everyone go with anyone other than Frontier, don’t let the ads for cheap flights fool you, you end up paying more and getting less in the long run. I average flying once a month and I’m just done with getting ripped off and terrible service. I’m actually amazed they’re still in business.

### "unpleasant and stressful"
We book month an advance a trip from Charlotte to Puerto Rico and last minute we get a email flight update notice their would be a layover to Orlando and delay 13 hrs when we ready to board they couldn’t find us in the system for our seat and made it uncomfortable for me very unpleasant and stressful, did not do anything for us or wanted to very unprofessional. We got stuck getting our paid luggage in the plane which clearly did not have us on it stated we will get it at Puerto Rico. We had to book a flight with JetBlue and when we got to Frontier PR luggage terminal it was closed, stated to us come back later or wait her.

### "never book with Frontier again"
Not Verified |  The fees and customer service for Frontier is a complete and utter rip-off. First, I booked a non stop reservation to Denver they changed to add a stop in Las Vegas. When I went to cancel the reservation, I was charged a cancellation fee. When I tried to talk with customer service the language barrier was so acute, I gave up. They charge for every little thing which makes your ticket far more expensive then other airlines. To add insult to injury and add a cancellation fee, is unbelievable. I will never book with Frontier again.

### "you get what you pay for"
Denver to San Antonio. Our flight left at 8 a.m. We arrived to the airport at 5:50 am and started to get in line and an employee told us to go to a kiosk we tried for 20 minutes to check in at the kiosk. She tried helping us only to find out we couldn't check in so she put us in the line after all. There must have been close to 60 people in this line with only two people working at the counter. At 6am in the morning we waited in this line until 7:15 am that gave us 45 minutes until our flight left. When we got to the counter they told us we couldn't check in because we were too late. They only had two people working and their computers went down for a short while causing everyone to wait in this line. After putting us on another much later flight to Austin, checking our bag to Austin, and we got to Austin they lost our luggage. We were here in San Antonio for 3 days with no luggage, we kept calling and they never answered our calls never answered our emails, they called us one time to tell us they had no information. This is very poor customer service. We finally received our luggage back in Denver four days after we got back home. We had to go back to the Denver Airport and pick it up finding that it was in Austin the whole time even though we had drove to Austin three times to see if it was there. Frontier is a very poor airline. They need more communication. This ruined our entire trip. We didn't have money to buy new clothes, we didn't have money to even buy some amenities that we needed. They cost us a lot of money and we're not getting reimbursed for any of it and they didn't even really apologized. I will never fly Frontier again. I don't care how cheap they are, this is definitely where you get what you pay for.

### "Seats are as bad as other reviews"
Cost $500 CDN for tix. At check in, an extra $1000+ on way there, $1500+ for way back. $3500 instead of $1000? They double charge for all fees on a connecting flight. Flight delayed on way there. Seats are as bad as other reviews. Flight delayed on the way home then cancelled. Got 2x $400 vouchers to be used up with Frontier within 90 days only in same name as tix say GRR. No refund of extra charges. Stranded at MCO trying to get back to Canada with a child. Had to pay either $5000 USD or the $2000 CDN that I went with. Will never fly Frontier. Can’t even sell vouchers. I’d rather throw them in garbage. Thanks for a $5500 CDN return flight by the time all is said and done (instead of the original 1000 for the 2 tix). I just went on a holiday that cost me too much because of you, now I’m supposed to plan a trip again within 90 days!

### "Worthless airline and staff"
Not Verified |  Palm Springs to Denver. I’m sitting on a plane to Denver. Late 2 hours; de-planed everyone; reboarded everyone; back out from gate and now waiting an hour. No updates since we reboarded. Frontier is an utterly incompetent airline. Now it’s canceled. Worthless airline and staff.

### "The worst airline ever"
Orlando to Minneapolis booked for December 2018. The worst airline ever. They have canceled flights on us several times. They advertise low cost fares, then a few weeks before the flight is to departure they cancel it stating aircraft availability. They just don't want to honor the low cost tickets. I have seen them cancel our flight and still have the same flight advertised with availability. Don't trust them.

### "Had to pay $50 at airport"
Colorado Springs to Phoenix. I needed an extra bag on morning of flight so went online to purchase but it wouldn’t allow me to. Had to pay $50 at airport. Just another way to nickel and dime you. Of course I had to shell out another $50 on the way back.

### "nastiest people I’ve encountered"
Orlando to Norfolk. The flight attendants were probably some of the nastiest people I’ve ever encountered. There were two main flight attendants. The first thing I noticed was one greeting the customers. I was sitting right in front of him, when I noticed he would giggle or make faces at the different people walking by. I didn’t think this was too big of a deal, just a case of immaturity. Then, a single black mom and her child boarded and sat in front of me. This seems to have caught the other FA's attention - she asked the mother how old the child was, and she replied “1, turning 2 tomorrow. Why do you ask?”. The FA said, “she looks a lot bigger than you say she is, but okay” and walks away. From that point on, it seems the FA is constantly picking on the single mother. 5 minutes after the encounter, the FA says “your baby can’t be in a seat, she has to be in your lap if she isn’t officially 2 yet”. The mother complies, but mumbles something under her breath. Is there an issue?” the FA snaps, staring at the single mother and her child. Another 5 mins has passed, and the FA walks up to the mom again. Your seat can’t be reclined”, and she reaches over and adjusts it half an inch, without asking of course. Another 5 mins, the FA complains that she can’t see the Mom’s seatbelt, even though she clearly had it on. This consisted almost the entire two hours, the FA constantly calling out the single mother for the smallest reasons. As the FA was in the back talking loudly about all the bloody mary’s She intends to drink for her birthday, the mom fell asleep. As we were fixing to land, the other FA was walking up and down collecting trash, before stopping at the sleeping mom and daughter, pointing and smiling. The FA walks up, “don’t worry, I’ll handle it” and she takes off her gloves. She pokes the mother, “We’re about to land, you might want to hold your baby”, she says, and afterwards, running off to the bathroom to wash her hands. The other FA goes to the back and I can immediately hear them giggling again. I felt so disgusted after the flight, even more disgusted with myself for not saying anything. This was clearly a case of bullying, and the flight attendant was clearly picking on the black mother and her child. It made me sick to my stomach. That was my experience, hopefully anyone flying with Frontier has more decent flight attendants.

### "only allowed one personal item each"
Chicago to Las Vegas. We bought one way tickets from Kiwi.com connecting from Frontier Airlines in Vegas to Hawaiian Airlines onto Honolulu and Sydney. Then found out we didn't even have the option to buy checked bags or carry ons. We're only allowed one personal item each. They claim it was made clear at the time of booking, however, neither of us saw the notice while booking. That piece of information is by far the most important thing to know about that flight and should be flashing in red! I made the booking through kiwi.com so they are who I dealt with on the phone and were extremely unhelpful and said there was nothing they could do. We were looking at mailing our bags to ourselves, and at $300 per bag it was our cheapest option. Luckily, the next morning we received an email saying we could each pay for one checked bag, but still no follow up from either company with an apology for the headache.

### "the worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Denver to San Jose. Terrible airline - avoid at all costs. I was not able to check into my flight because their app is faulty. Then the front desk agent at the ticketing counter was extremely rude to me and charged me extra for my luggage because I was not able to pay earlier due to their mobile app being faulty. Now I’m at the gate and our flight was supposed to take off at 9AM but is now delayed until 3PM. First the agents said it was because the previous plane didn’t land. Now they’re saying it’s because there is an issue with the plane. There are no other flights they can get us on that leave earlier. Overall, this has been the worst airline experience I’ve had and I intend to discourage everyone I know from ever flying Frontier. They clearly use outdated plane and are too cheap to invest in maintenance so that this doesn’t happen. They also clearly don’t care about customer service - both the front desk agent and agents at the gate have been extremely rude. Update: the plane is sitting at the gate but they are still saying it’s delayed until 3:45pm. The gate agents didn’t even tell us the plane was delayed again - I had to hear it from a fellow passenger. They don’t even have the decency to give us real time updates.

### "scam of an airline"
Not Verified | Charlotte to Las Vegas. This is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown with. The seats feel like you are sitting on a bus terminal seat at the most desolute place in the country. My flight was cancelled for whatever reason and they simply handed me a piece of paper and told me I was on my own. I had to rebook my flight and fly 2 more legs to get to my destination. I applied for a refund and was told 6-9 weeks for a refund. Worst customer service I have ever seen. With all the hidden fees you are better off flying with a top tier airline rather than these guys. I will never fly with these folks again. I have had more comfortable rides in C130 and C141 aircraft when I was in the military. If you want bottom of the barrel with absolutely no frills and a hope and chance that you may eventually get to your destination this is your airline. Military members do not make the mistake of taking this airline because they are cheap. You leave is alot more valuable than this scam of an airline

### "I’m extremely disappointed"
Tampa to Buffalo. I’m extremely disappointed with Frontier airline as they trick the customer into buying what seems to be a great price airfare and then at check in time they charge for the seat, luggage, carry on, and the in flight snack. That’s another $175. What a deceptive airline. Even if you purchase trip insurance, they don’t honor their side of the deal indicating they have nothing to do with insurance. You must call the insurance yourself and they won’t give you a number to call. Frontier gives absolutely no refund in case you need to make changes or cancel. In addition, it is extremely difficult to navigate their on line options and the cost of speaking to customer service is $25. What a rip off.

### "Worst airline ever"
Salt Lake City to Grand Rapids via Denver. Worst airline ever! The day of the flight they canceled without calling. At the ticket counter, all of the employees had this look in their eyes knowing the customers they were about to serve were going to get screwed over. I was told that I would be reimbursed up to $400 for a flight with a different airline. I purchased a flight from Delta for $543.26. I called to explain my situation to a customer service representative at Frontier and they assured me I would receive a refund and be able to take my round-trip flight back. On the day I was to fly home the agent at the Frontier ticket counter told me I did not have a flight booked and would have to purchase another ticket. Now it is four months later and I have not received any refund at all. Just called their customer service department again and the representative transferred me to their manager because of my problem. This transfer was to another agent who then told me I had no case. This airline is dishonest and not customer focused. It's employees know the policy transfers the problem along until the customer gives up.

### "incompetent to do such things"
Denver to Greenville. Every single time I fly Frontier there are issues. Last time someone "lost a sheet to the flight log" this time someone "lost the fuel slip". Both times flight delayed by an hour. Before boarding this time the bay i was in had a deafening feedback coming over the speakers. The lady at the counter couldn't figure it out so she left the bay. We were next to the frontier customer service bay (literally right next to it). I went over and asked if they could hear it(you could loud and clear) they said what noise, i said you cant hear that. They said yeah what do you want us to do about it, i asked if they had contacted anyone, they said they didnt know where it was coming from (you could tell perfectly where it was coming from). I asked if they had attempted to figure that out and they said no. It took a passenger to go up yo the bay counter and hang up the intercom speaker because apparently everyone that works for frontier is to incompetent to do such things.

### "won’t fly with them again"
La Guardia to Denver. Horrible airline. They cancelled the flight and refused to give a full refund even after a manager from Frontier approved the refund and processed. I won’t fly with them again.

### "didn't have a single issue"
I read all the horror stories and I'll admit I was super nervous. But I absolutely didn't have a single issue flying out from Denver to Las Vegas and back.

### I was pleasantly surprised"
Raleigh Durham to Austin. After reading a number of negative reviews and horror stories about Frontier, I was pleasantly surprised to experience just the opposite. Both of my flights were right on time, all staff was kind and helpful, the price was great, the planes weren't super comfortable but nothing to complain about. I will definitely be flying Frontier again, especially if they continue to offer low airfare rates

### "flights have been delayed hours"
Denver to Austin. Frontier Airlines is the worst airline. Time and time again my flights have been delayed hours, sometimes cancelled. Guess what happens when they cancel? Well, once you're at the gate and you find out that the flight has been cancelled by pure rumours (no representative wants to go anywhere near the counter when this happens), you get to go back out of security and stand in a line for an hour to get the forty dollars you spent on your flight refunded. I wish I could say you get what you pay for, but with this company you get far, far less.

### "Absolute worst airline"
Orlando to San Diego. Absolute worst airline I’ve ever traveled with. Ended up loosing my career and money because they decided to let someone else with a similar name take my seat on the plane when I had confirmation numbers, emails, passport, identification etc argument for hours still wouldn’t admit they were wrong now have to spend 2 days in the airport and sleep in a chair. Thanks a lot frontier.

### "disappointed and infuriated"
Not Verified |  Colorado Springs to Orlando via Greenville . I'm extremely disappointed and infuriated with Frontier Airlines. My family and I had a delayed flight on Friday, and our luggage didn't connect with our flight afterwards. So we were told Saturday that our luggage would be FedEx'd to the address we would be staying at. We were called Monday morning by a representative updating us on the status of our bags, and she concluded our luggage was sent to Denver and would go with the flight to Greenville and be there that afternoon. We drove up there 30 minutes later and found the staff left early and the representative lied when she said she'd leave our luggage with the airport/security. So we called today, this Tuesday morning and found that the previous representative lied to us and that our luggage was still in Orlando where our connecting flight was and that it would be here tomorrow morning. Just how can an airport be so unreliable?

### "I missed my flight"
Chicago to Tampa. I missed my flight, and one attendant told me I would probably miss my flight when I was trying to do the self-check in (those machines are useless too) without offering to help at all. Another told me to walk through the line with absolutely nobody waiting when I was in the process of trying to rebook. I will not be buying a ticket with them again.

### "could not be let onto the plane"
My fiance and I arrived at our departure station on time for our vacation in Vegas to get married. The airline boarded and closed the doors early, so when we went to check in at 6:50 (7pm departure time), the staff said that we could not be let onto the plane. We asked the staff for a supervisor to see if there was any way for us to be let onto the plane. We had no carry-ons and we pleaded with the supervisor to see if he would at least ask if we could be boarded. He took the walkie and huffed under his breath before making the call out of sight. He came back less than 2 minutes later and said there was no way. I am so incredibly disappointed and extremely bothered by the lack of customer service and lack of professionalism. Our wedding will now be delayed, we lost our rental car, and we were given a less than desirable flight option at an airport even further away. The cheap tickets are not worth the apathetic and unprofessional staff.

### "Terrible customer service"
San Antonio to Denver. Terrible customer service. Bag was overweight 6 lbs. flight was delayed 2.5 hours and there was no exception to the weight limit. If you are going to inconvenience me, then it would be nice to allow for some exceptions.

### "do not fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Denver. We booked a flight for Frontier Airlines 4 months in advance, our flight was scheduled to depart at 7:30am on November the 18th, meaning we had to wake up at 4:30 am to get to the Orlando International Airport on time. We checked our bags and got through security in a reasonable time frame (because it wasn’t Frontier controlling it). We arrived to our Gate number (Gate: 17, after being switched from Gate 23) and after waiting for about 20 minutes we received an announcement that our flight would be delayed for 2 hours, so we thought “okay, at least it wasn’t cancelled and we will still get to Denver at a reasonable time. Within not even 15 minutes of receiving the announcement, we received another announcement that our flight was cancelled at 7:58 - almost 30 minutes after we were originally scheduled to depart. If Frontier cared enough and used this little thing called “effort” (I know it’s unheard of) then they could’ve arranged for another plane to get us to our destination over the Thanksgiving Holiday, but God Forbid that ever happening! Because of this, we lost a dayof our vacation out of our already short vacation (4 days). Because OF Frontier Airlines we had to get our bag rechecked for our new flight which costs us another $30 which we had already paid to Frontier for our cancelled flight! On top of that, we had to get our hotels ans rental car rescheduled. My advice to any person who values getting to your destination in a reasonable timeframe and flying on an airline that is reliable is do not fly Frontier.

### "nickel and dimed so bad"
Las Vegas to Denver. Horrible business model and terrible customer service from ground crews to flight crews. You will see the rates thinking Frontier offers great deals until you actually check in. You will get nickel and dimed so bad to the point you end up paying more than any other airline. Basically a professional scam. Will never consider flying with them again.

### "would use the airline again"
My wife and I had a recent trip from Buffalo New York. The cost was insanely inexpensive. Based on the reviews I expected a run down old plane with grumpy flight attendants. I was pleasantly surprised at how new the plane was and how pleasant the Flight Attendants were. The plane was delayed, which happens. The only part of our experience that I would say needs improvement is communication with the passengers waiting. There was no indication of when the flight would depart. The sign at the gate simply said it was delayed. Fortunately I Have a flight tracker app and was able to follow its status. I received an email before arriving at the airport about the flight delay so I was able to kill time before going to the airport. The only suggestion I have is that flight delays be updated more regularly on the app. Based on my experience I would use the airline again. Great value.

### "No consideration for customers"
Orlando to Raleigh Durham. Flight delay announced shortly before boarding. I checked online site (not |Frontier) day before flight and arriving plane was scheduled here 1 hr after this flight was to leave. Frontier site showed this flight on time. They must have known that the incoming plane was delayed at least the day before. Why didn't they let customers know know of the delay in advance. Now stuck here for 4 hrs unnecessarily. Airport packed, nowhere to sit. Counter agent says it's a weather delay, but the knew it yesterday. No consideration for their customers.

### "canceled 4 hours before leaving"
Knoxville to Orlando . Flight was canceled 4 hours before leaving for vacation to Universal in Orlando Florida. We have lost as a family about $700 in room and tickets. Trying to fly cheap can cost you in the long run. Don’t fly Frontier in the hopes of saving money!! !

### "horrible customer service"
Los Angeles to Milwaukee via Denver. I booked a round trip flight with Frontier Airlines months previously and the morning of, I was texted that the flight was going to have a significant delay which would cause me to miss my layover flight in Denver. I tried calling customer service right away but of course it takes at least 10 minutes to speak to an actual person and when I did get ahold of a person she was very unhelpful telling me to fly to Denver and they would connect me with the next flight (2 days after mind you). So I proceeded to head to the airport for actual answers. I was told they couldn’t fly me to my destination for 3 days after I was supposed to leave! Pointless! I immediately asked for a refund and I was told I would be getting it. Of course I didn’t get it so I had to call customer service number twice more to actually get the refund. And I had to book a last minute very expensive flight out of Chicago. I will never be flying Frontier  again! Horrible airline and horrible customer service.

### "Zero customer service"
Austin to Atlanta. Worst airline I have ever flown. Zero customer service, even after a month of back and forth with customer service I have gotten nowhere. They left me stranded in 2 airports, making a 2hr flight into a 3 day ordeal, then they overcharged me on in flight purchases and refused to correct the charges. They feel that even though it doesn't even come close to the expenses incurred even for the original ticket, they feel that a $100. voucher for future travel on their airline is more than enough compensation! Why on earth would I want to go through that again, or even risk it knowing that if something were to happen, they don't care enough about their costumers to even try. Don't risk it, the cheap price isn't worth it.

### "bottom of the barrel"
Not Verified | Denver to Washington DC. Although the crew was very nice this is a terrible, low quality airline. The seats are absolutely horrible to sit in with no ability to recline. They are extremely uncomfortable which caused me severe back pain for the entire flight. There is also very little leg room, tiny tray tables, and they also charge for every snack and beverage except for tap water. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this pitiful, low budget, bottom of the barrel airline. I have no idea how they are staying in business but I will never use them again.

### "extortionate practice"
Austin to Indianapolis. Wow, that's all I can say about the super extravagant extortion forced to add a carry on or checked bag. Extras" that are forced onto you if you ever plan to travel with a carry on or checked bag. Almost everybody has at least one or the other with every flight. To add just one bag to your ticket incase you forgot to add or who ever bought your ticket did not know the severity in fees and fines for not doing it at the time of purchase. To add 1 checked bag is $38 + 38.50 carrier chargeable + 4.50 except + air tax 4.00+ fee+ fee+. It was $82.50 for 1small bag that might make carry on size but that charge is super overcharged as well. $82.50! For a ticket that was $42.50, it would have been cheaper to just book 2seats. How in any way does it cost more to stow a bag than fly? How can an airline force such charges? This is an outrageous fee for forgetting or adding a bag. Heaven help me, I just did not know the extremely overpriced extortion fees for just taking 1 small bag. This company should feel ashamed for such extortionate practice! Outrageous!

### "They cancelled my flight"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my flight out of Orlando hours before the scheduled departure but never bother to send me an email, text or even a phone call. To make it worst I checked their website before leaving my house for the airport and the flight was said to be on schedule, (not true it had already been cancelled) . Went through counter and TSA , waited at the gate before knowing flight was cancelled. They had no interest in helping or accommodating me, though I explained I live 2 hours from Orlando and didn't have a way home, by now it's almost 10 pm, was told the next available flight that can accommodate me will be in 2 days. They refused to give hotel voucher or book me on another airline - was in the airport but could not get any help from Frontier Staff. Called 800 number and was told to provide receipts for hotel and new flight and they will reimburse. That happened 10/15/2018 - today is 11/10/2018 after countless emails and documents still no refund. Someone said they wound reimburse but no money still.

### "Just unintelligent business"
Not Verified |  I flew this airline almost every month a few years ago and had a large number of miles accumulated. The airline then changed in structure and ultimately stopped servicing my home city of Spokane, WA. I was pleased to hear they had re-started service this year and so I could finally again use all my miles I accumulated. I reached out after finding they had wiped my account of all miles. Generally speaking, I understand they expire at times, but in this case the airline itself prevented me from using them as a result of their stop in service to my market. I reached out on 3 separate occasions to get some credits, even partial and all were met with a non empathetic tough luck. This airline will never get my business or anyone on my staff's again. Losing thousands and thousands of dollars to save 2 free flights which were earned by someone who had reached one of their former elite tiers in flying. Just unintelligent business.

### "slightly better than Delta"
Not Verified |  Well at least Frontier is slightly better than Delta, the plane was clean. The prices are great until you realize how much they charge for baggage and they lie and tell you that it is less expensive if you pay online. That is if their system let's you, if not it costs you an extra $20. Think about this if they deliberately keep 100 people a day from paying online and collect an extra $20 from each person that is $730,000 a year. Tell me they are not doing this on purpose, oh and no refunds on baggage by the way.

### "Horrible, pathetic airline"
Orlando to Denver. We were previously on another airplane ready to take off for Denver when they told us the plane couldn’t fly for maintenance issues. All of the passengers departed the airplane and went on to wait about an hour in the terminal. After waiting and seeing that all the other Frontier flights were delayed or cancelled for mechanical reasons, we were told we would be going to another plane. I’m currently on the plane and have waited over 5+ hours and have been told that there were maintenance issues and also that we needed a new staff. They advised us every 15 minutes that we would be taking off soon, and there is currently no sign of any departure. Horrible, pathetic airline. Pay a few extra bucks and fly with a decent airline.

### "how bad can it get"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to Louisville. I have never left a review. Delay for an hour and a half. Fine I get it. Board the plane. It starts moving, they announce they “apologize” but they can no longer fly us to LGA because of a “curfew” that can’t be flown in past 11. They rush us onto the plane and then we all have to get off. Is this an actual joke. Flight isn’t rescheduled until 11:30 the next morning. So everyone lines up to make arrangements. Computer is down so everyone has to shuffle through the airport where we are lead to the ticket station with ONE representative for a full flight of people looking for hotel vouchers. I understand you get what you pay for but how bad can it get.

### "out to nickel and dime you"
Orlando to New York. I managed to get away with flying on this airline without them getting me for any ridiculous fees, but I wanted to leave a review noting what I've observed. This airline is out to nickel and dime you for everything, even to the point where they'll lie or manipulate the situation. Flying out of Orlando they admitted they don't know who paid and didn't paid for carry on baggage and mentioned they would only check if they ran out of room on the plane in the overhead bins. Then they proceeded to shut half full overhead bins, thus creating a situation where there might not be room for all overhead baggage since they specifically told passengers they may not reopen the bins. Also, no one offered to help when I struggled to get my carry on (paid for) into the bin. It's under the weight limit, I'm just a string bean. The plane itself was also dirty. The one I'm sitting on right now is on par with the NYC subway. They need to vacuum these planes once in awhile. It's pretty gross. There's crushed M&Ms in the seat and what looks like crusty bread remains and candy wrappers laying around. On my flight from New York they were also delayed by 45 minutes because they hadn't received their departure logistics from their Minnesota office, the pilot noted that normally the New York office handles the New York flights but didn't on this particular delay. Overall, if you're on a shoestring budget you can make it work, but bring Lysol wipes and be prepared to know their rules to the T, get your bag in an overhead bin asap, and not play any games with your luggage.

### "worst airline I've flown"
Austin to New Orleans. This is the worst airline I've flown. I honestly felt like it was a comedy of errors and every single employee looked at you like they were marginally compensated. My flight was delayed 5 hours which in itself is not so bad, it happens. No one knew where the new gate was and other passengers were leaving saying the flight was canceled. I called the airline to verify and it took the customer service agent 20 minutes just to pull up my reservation and confirm that I was leaving at 5:30 although it was already 7:30 p.m.! I felt like I was in a Saturday Night Live skit. traveling frequently I knew that the flight could have been cancelled without it being posted so I waited and sure enough, finally they posted where the new date was. when I arrived there, approached the gate agent and told them what we've been through -  they looked at me like deer in the headlights. I was very kind, they just looked at me like I was lost. I literally said hello can you confirm that this is the gate? They just kind of nodded it was really really weird and I will never fly that airline again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Tampa to Denver. I will never fly frontier again. We flew into Tampa for my grandpas funeral and on the way back our flight was canceled. They loaded all of us onto the plane, we sat on the runway without air conditioning for almost two hours before they unboarded us. Then we sat in the terminal for another 3hrs before our flight was canceled. It was 2am and they told us all to go downstairs for a hotel voucher, so we went downstairs and stood in line for an hour only to be handed a slip of paper that said “thanks for your feedback” with a customer service number. We slept in the airport. No apologies, no communication. Worst airline ever.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
Calgary to Denver. Never flying Frontier again, would prefer to be treated like a human being. I thought I was getting to my gate early, and by early I mean 20 minutes before the scheduled boarding, and I started running cause they were calling the last boarding call for our flight. Then I got on the flight (thank god I was on time cause they left people who weren’t). Then when I asked I got up to go to the bathroom (because I didn’t have time because they impromptu decided to take off 30 min early), they told me I couldn’t -  and then when I asked if they could fill up my water bottle because I didn’t have time to because apparently it doesn’t matter when the flight is scheduled to leave, they told me that I could pay $3 for it. I miss the days of warm cookies and friendly smiles, that cost pretty much the same as they do now. All of their customer service cut backs are not worth the price, I’d prefer to get treated like a human being. Couldn’t afford to give me any water,  even though the plane was 50% empty and paid to upgrade my seat, pay for a carry on and payed for a glass of wine. I was trying to be a perfectly civil human being but they defiantly do not reciprocate. Prepaid to be taken advantage of.

### "Frontier charges for everything"
Omaha to San Francisco via Denver. Horrendous customer service and they charge for every little thing. Our flight was cancelled with no explanation and no attempt to get us on another flight. There was no option to reschedule online or in any other way besides talking to customer service. When we called, customer service was closed even though this was just a few hours before our flight. Once they finally opened, we had to spend an hour on hold trying to get ahold of anyone to tell us why our flight was cancelled and tell us how to reschedule. Then we had to pay out of pocket for another flight on another airline because Frontier didn't have another option. Frontier assured us that we would be reimbursed for this flight, but we are not only still waiting on this check after a month, but we have called four times, having to speak to a supervisor each time, and Frontier has been unable to confirm each time that they have submitted our flight for reimbursement. We just called again and after spending two hours on the phone with them and speaking to the supervisor they still won't even confirm with us that they have submitted for reimbursement or when we can expect our money. We are still waiting for any kind of confirmation that they are indeed sending us this reimbursement as promised. Each customer service representative we have talked to seems intent on keeping us from getting any information, they refuse to answer any question with a straight answer. Even if you don't end up having a horrendous experience with them, it's important to note that Frontier charges for everything, even checked bags, any drinks on board except water, seats that recline, and seats with a tray table big enough to hold anything besides a drink.

### "customer service was exceptional"
Phoenix to Denver. Myself and my husband, we were saving money to visit the USA for a long time. We chose budget airlines so we could spend more money on actually visiting places and experience what the USA has got to offer. Frontier flight was delayed and we had to leave our luggage behind (to get back to the UK) not knowing if we would ever see our belongings again. I can't praise enough the staff on the board of the plane (making every possible effort for us to get our luggage on time). As well as the only simple email of understanding I wrote to them that it was important for us to get our luggage back once we arrived home. We got our belongings free of charge and the customer service we received was exceptional! Frontier may be faced with challenges but at the end of the day, it all depends how they react to it. I personally would book a flight with you again! Don't be put off by all of the negative feedback. There is more to life than complains.

### "delayed hours upon hours"
Raleigh to Milwaukee. I purchased a ticket with Frontier Airlines because it was a direct flight. Nevertheless on my day of departure I arrived at the airport 2 hours early like you are asked so I arrived in RDU around 12pm and upon my arrival there is no customer service from Frontier just a empty counter. An hour later a gentleman shows up and checked me in and I head to the gate that my boarding pass says. I get to gate D17 and there I began to sit for a hour, after that hour I decided to go check the board and it shows that my gate was changed to C8. So I go to gate C8 and there is still no customer service in site. The flight continues to be delayed hours upon hours. So after sitting from 12pm-9pm a gentleman comes out and tell us that the flight was cancelled. I had to wait 2 more additional hours for someone to come and pick me up from the airport.

### "choose Frontier Airlines again"
Milwaukee to San Diego. Had a great experience with Frontier from Milwaukee to San Diego. Both flights were on time we made the mistake of missing our flight home and they gave us no issues. The girl at the counter found us a flight home within a couple hours at no charge. If we fly again I would definitely choose Frontier Airlines again.

### "Would never recommend Frontier"
Pensacola to Salt Lake City. I’ve flow twice with Frontier Airlines. The first time I had a flight leaving at 5 AM from salt lake to Denver. As I arrived to the Salt Lake City airport I got a text notifying me at 4AM that my flight was now leaving at 9 AM meaning that I was going to miss my connecting flight to Pensacola and get stuck in Denver for the night. Now her I am on my way back home from Florida with another delayed flight of two hours. I will not be getting home till about 2 AM now. I talked to customer service desk and said I would have to pay 100 bucks to fly home at the original time I bought my ticket for. Now I’m stuck in the Denver airport again with and 8 hour layover. Would never recommend Frontier to anyone.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Denver to Orlando. Absolutely the worst airline in the business. It had been five years since I had flown with them, which I suppose is just enough time to forget just how bad they are and allow myself to do it again. There is nothing positive I have to say about this airline. Perhaps the low cost fares would justify the terrible customer service, cancellations and delayed flights under the umbrella of "you get what you pay for" if the flights were actually low cost. But their hidden fees and charges quickly make the lowest far double or triple to cost as much as any other airline. I will never be tempted by one of their advertised fares again, and from now on will set all my travel search engines to exclude Frontier from the results completely.

### "does not deserve to earn the business"
I flew from Denver to Cedar Rapids on 10/30/18. I am a Veteran and was told before the flight was booked that I would receive a free checked bag both ways. I checked my bag from Cedar Rapids to Denver no problem. On my way home I was told at the counter this free bag only applied to active duty. I calmly explained to the lady at the counter that I was told differently, as I politely paid the $50 fee her response was loudly and very rudely stating “I’m not going to argue with you”, “this conversation is over keep on moving”. This was my first flight with Frontier and I will never fly with them again. Any company that treats paying customers (especially veterans) like this does not deserve to earn the business of anyone.

### "kept changing my flight"
Philadelphia to Denver via Omaha. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again. They kept changing my flight thru emails, then my flight was delayed. I missed my connecting flight, had to stay in Omaha which was 2 hours away from Vegas, also my luggage never left Philadelphia. I have been with my luggage for 2 days.

### "never fly Frontier again"
San Antonio to Ontario. Horrible, horrible service. The flight attendants are rude and inconsiderate. The price seems very affordable until you get to the website and realize that it’s only cheap if you only fly with a personal item. I will never fly Frontier again. Last time my girlfriend and I flew, we were delayed by 4 hours and we got a text message 10 minutes before our scheduled flight.

### "Unacceptable and unprofessional"
Denver to Little Rock. Frontier is unprofessional. My flight was delayed and passengers were not informed until 15 mins before we assumed the gate would open. On all of the monitors for departures, and online it says our flight is on time and we were all super disappointed once we found out we can’t board for another 2 hours. Unacceptable and unprofessional. Passengers should be informed at an early enough time to adjust for the inconvenience Frontier has placed on us. If we were not at the gate on time we would be denied our flight and turned around but it seems to be ok to the airline and staff to just tell people their flight is late without any concern, compensation or anything. This is why Frontier has bad reviews and unsatisfied customers.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Cleveland to Phoenix via Denver. Worst airline ever, delayed for 10 hours before cancelling because of mechanical issues! No updates from the staff for the last 3 of those hours until they cancelled it. They told us the only options was a flight on Tuesday mind you this was a Sunday. I was going to take them up on the hotel room but by the time they found hotels rooms it was 2 am. I bought a 600 dollar last minute with American so I slept at the airport. Thanks for the 25 dollar food voucher! And the 150 dollars in flight vouchers that have to be used before 90 days. I will never fly this airline. Pay the extra dollars saves you time and money in the long run

### "won't be flying Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Kansas City. Our plane was delayed due to mechanical issues for over two hours. No explanations given, and very little in the way of updates during this time. We paid extra for seats near the very front of the plane for more leg room but had to stow our carry-on luggage halfway back in the plane, causing us to have to wait for half of the plane to get off after landing before we could get our bags and leave. All of the refreshments and snacks are pay only. Want that half a can of coke and small bag of pretzels that you'd get for free on other airlines? That'll be $2.99. Each. The seats themselves were very uncomfortable. I don't know if it's due to a lack of padding, or a worn out seat, but I ended up with bruises on one of my hips from just sitting in the plane for three hours. Unless I have no other choice, I won't be flying Frontier again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Seattle to Denver. Worst airline ever! Had to change my flight last minute and the rep I spoke with on the phone booked my flight for the wrong date. Rudest and most unhelpful people work at Frontier. I will never fly with this airline again. I have never been treated so horrible for a mistake by their staff. They have no sympathy and act as if they hate their jobs. Why are you in customer service people if you are a miserable human being?! I don’t appreciate that I was not helped at all when I shared how unhappy I was at their mistake. I was handed a small piece of paper with “call customer service!” That is the help that was given to me?! I would rather talk to an actual person and have them help me out versus spending another $300 plus on another ticket for their screw up. Beyond angry. All this could have been avoided if I received the slightest help or even a little sympathy.

### "our flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Cleveland to Orlando. Found out 2 hours prior to our flight leaving that our flight was cancelled. No explanation or reason to why. Frontier would reimburse up to a certain amount to rebook our flight but of course flight prices are easily doubled on the day of flying. We ended up paying an extra $230 out of pocket and will now arrive at our destination 3 hours later which caused us to have to change airport pick up reservations and dining reservations also. This is the second unsatisfactory experience I have had with them in 4 months. I will no longer be flying with this airline.

### "rudest, inconsiderate airline"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Detroit. Took a weekend trip to Orlando for a visit with family. Spirit on the way there was great. No issues. My flight coming back was on Frontier. Flight was canceled, had never happened to me before. I was handed a form letter and told to go find a new flight. No help no directions. Just a couple links that i am suppose to navigate on my phone in the middle of an airport. No flights out on any airlines till next day. I get a room and call Frontier. Almost an hr on the phone and they state that they will give me $400 and my ticket price which will basically pay for my airfare but i am stranded in Orlando for the night. The issue was a mechanical one and no fault of mine. I take care of my disabled husband. I not only missed a day of work but need to make arrangements for my husband and pay for a hotel. When talking to customer service they were rude interrupting and made no effort to try to rebook, no help with a hotel or any compassion at all. The ticket agents where just the same. Prices were not low enough to deal with the rudest, inconsiderate airline i have ever dealt with. I will not fly with them.. I will pay the extra for service and know i am protected.

### "the worst airline ever"
Orlando to Nashville. This is the worst airline ever. At first my layover was delayed 3 hours to Ontario ca, then coming back on sunday oct.28 they canceled the flight to Nashville. As a minor flying alone they left me abandoned with no help booking me another flight. The last flight frontier will have to Nashville will be on Tuesday November 1. I asked for help but the people working for Frontier do not care and will just tell you to book it yourself. My friends mom bought my ticket and my parents tried helping by calling frontier to see if they can book me a direct flight to Nashville and they refused to because they don’t care about there customers. They handed out a paper and it just said that we have to pay upfront and book it ourselves. This is the first and last time I will ever use this airline.

### "not be traveling with you again"
Orlando to Nashville. My family and I were on our way back from vacation at WDW. We checked in the day before our flight. Paid for our check bag (which is a ridiculous fee by itself) prior to arriving to the airport. When we got to the airport, we dropped off, went through security, arrived at our gate no problem. After waiting at our gate, we assumed our flight had been delayed so I walked to the counter and found out the flight had been cancelled. No announcement made. The woman at the counter said I needed to go to the main ticket counter (outside security) and get my “letter”. This letter basically tells you you are own your own and finding other flights is on you. They will reimburse a portion but to find a flight home for the same day on any airline is outside of their reimbursement limit. The people at the counters were very unhelpful and showed no sympathy or remorse for our “inconvenience”. The next available flight they offered us was 48 hours later, but they would not cover hotel or other fees that we would acquire while waiting for that. We ended up renting a car and drove 9 hours home. You can keep your refund vouchers Frontier, we will not be traveling with you again.

### "very stressful for me and my wife"
St Louis to Orlando. Frontier canceled my flight to Orlando just about 2 hours before departure. They did not even inform me of this cancellation and I learned it long after it was announced. I was given no assistance in rebooking by Frontier airport staff and told to help myself. This proved very stressful for me and my wife as other flights seats quickly vanished. I ended up purchasing 2 AA flights via Charlotte to Sarasota (and NOT Orlando!) and arrived to my destination at 2am instead of 9pm. My wife has serious medical issues and this 10-hour ordeal was extremely painful and stressful for her. In addition, I had to rebook a car rental for Sarasota instead of Orlando and my cost went up about $150. This airline should NOT be in business. Nonexistent customer service. They do noy care about their customers!

### "very sorry I flew with Frontier"
I was headed out on a trip from Denver to Grand Rapids and already paid 40 bucks each way for my checked bag. Once at the check in desk for the outbound flight, they weighed my bag and discovered it was 5lb's heavier than their limit which I did not know about. The charge was 75.00 for 5lb extra. I was told to take some stuff out in order to make it lighter and was never offered a bag to put it in. The total cost of my one checked bag that weighed +5lb was 105.00 one way, not including the 40.00 return checked bag fee which puts the total at 145.00 for one checked bag that accidentally weighed 5lb's more than the limit on one leg of the trip. Astronomical. I called customer service letting them know what happened and asked for a refund of the 75.00 due to a mistake that will never happen again. They could have cared less, didn't budge, didn't do anything. I have to suck it up. I hate Frontier, I told them I was going to leave this negative review if things could not be altered and once again no one even cared. Horrible, very sorry I flew with Frontier.

### "unhelpful customer service"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. Yes, the flights are incredibly cheap, so I shouldn't expect much right? Exactly! But I think after 5 delays, it does get frustrating. Let me explain. I was flying home with Frontier with my husband and brother in law on an afternoon flight. I got my first email notification with 2.5 hours notice of a delay. Great! It sucks to have a delay, but at least they gave us enough heads up. Too bad we already got through security at the airport so we had to stay in there. Second delay, they gave us a 1 hour notice. The next 3 delays, we weren't so fortunate. The emails came less than 25 mins prior to take off time. Aren't we supposed to board 30 minutes prior to take off? So how can this company email us at 4:08pm letting us know that our departure time is at 4:30pm? Another email at 4:48pm with a departure time of 5:00pm?? The last email coming at 5:08pm with a departure time of 5:30pm. Our original flight was at 12:15pm and we were delayed over 5 hours. I understand that situations happen, but can you at least give us enough time to inform us of our departure time? It's not fun having to hover around the gate waiting and waiting to board. Not only that, it's not enough time for us to leave to grab meals (not to mention most of the good restaurants there take about 30 minutes to prepare food). On top of that Frontier decided that to compensate us, they would give us meal vouchers. Great! Just kidding! It was only a $10 meal voucher for a 5 hour delay. That's not even minimum wage in San Francisco! The Frontier staff was so flustered by all the angry customers that it took them forever to passout the meal vouchers. My brother in law had to step in and actually help pass out the meal vouchers so everyone could get them. By the way, not everyone received a meal voucher. And everyone who received them couldn't even redeem them because of how long it took too pass out. By the time My husband, Brother in Law, and I received our meal vouchers, it was 5:00pm. I thought we had enough time to grab food, but remember, at 5:08pm, we all received an email letting us know that our departure time was at 5:30pm. So I quickly grabbed my food and booked it to the gates. My Husband and his brother went to Burger King, which took them 25 minutes to receive their food, then having to book it to the gate. We all barely made it to the gate in time (we were literally the last few people to enter the gate). My experience doesn't end here. Frontier decided that a fair way to compensate everyone of this incredible inconvenience was to give us a $75 voucher for our next flight with Frontier. After this incredibly horrible experience, I wouldn't fly with Frontier. I personally emailed their customer service representative and after a few emails back and forth, she said the company is unable to do anything to compensate us futher because we did end up flying back with Frontier. After a 5 hour delay, I don't plan to stay in Vegas, so what do you expect? I want to get home as soon as possible! It's also absurd that a multi million dollar company can't refund us for the return flight home. So long story short, My husband, Brother in Law, and I don't plan to ever fly with Frontier. The poor communication and unhelpful customer service left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Cheap flights? Yes, but it comes with a price that I'm not willing to pay. I'll pay $500 more for a much better airline company next time.

### "Very annoyed passenger"
Raleigh Durham to Providence. As usual, Frontier Airlines has multiple problems with the aircraft. The thing that has always annoyed me about this particular airline is the lack of sense of urgency. I’m so sick and tired of being told about problems 30 minutes after they’ve been discovered. I’m so annoyed by the nonchalant way that passengers are notified of problems. Today, for example, we boarded and had been sitting at the gate for 30 minutes before anyone even bothered to tell us that there was a problem with one of the computers. Then, after no updates, another 30 minutes later, we are told that Maintenance was still looking into the first issue and that they would ALSO be looking at an engine problem. They just so casually grazed over the fact that not only are they investigating the original issue, but they are also investigating another, potentially greater issue. No apology was given. No updates have been given on either issue in the past 15 minutes. Love just being dangled from a string. Very annoyed passenger. Update- Just had to deplane and now we will potentially have to wait for another aircraft to become available.

### "experience was beyond awful"
Denver to Charleston. Our experience with Frontier was beyond awful. We will never fly with them again, the staff was unfriendly, rude and incompetent. We missed our flight along with 10 other people (more were behind us so the total number who missed the flight is unknown) we arrived to the gate in time to make the flight but there was no one standing at the gate counter to alert the aircraft we were there. Someone went and found someone and she called down, she was told if you had called me 3 minutes ago I could have gotten them all on. We had all been there for 8 minutes. They were not at all helpful in rebooking us, they stated the next flight out was 4 days later. They would not offer connecting flights or to help us get to our destination. It was beyond the worst experience I have had with an airline and I have flown all over the world. They have the worst customer service and understaff in order to make more money. Do not fly frontier.

### "definitely the worst experience"
Missoula to Orlando. This is the worst experience ever! First off our flights get cancelled after waiting for hours. Then they try to put us in the cheapest hotel they could find which I choose to get my own in hopes to getting refunded. For us on a plane the next morning to Denver leaving me and 5 children between the ages of 6-16 to sit in the airport for 12 hours. We missed 2 days of our vacation has to cancel and reschedule my rental car which ended up costing me more. Not only that a friend that was meeting us as a surprise for my daughter wasn’t able to check into our resort with out me leaving her to pay for a separate room until we got there. This is only the experience to Florida. My husband came into to Florida a couple days later from Louisville and both his flights were delayed. Now my two 16 year olds flew home today Wednesday) and the rest of us stayed. They delayed their flights out of Florida causing them to miss the connecting flight in Denver. Then tried to tell me they couldn’t get them home until Friday. Seriously two 16 year old girls stuck in Denver for 2 days knowing no one. Now we have been on the phone trying to get help as we are In Florida still and have been on the phone for over 2 hours! I don’t understand how they can run a business like this. They ruined our vacation. This is definitely the worst experience I have ever had.

### "never fly with this airline"
San Antonio to Cleveland. One passenger on my reservation could not check in without selecting a seat. The only seats available for selection required us to pay more on top of what we already paid for the ticket. We showed up to the airport early (as everyone is told to do) and no agents were at the counter. There was a sign for baggage drop that we stood in for 45 minutes before a lady came out and told us to go to the back of the line because there was really no baggage drop line and we had to go through the regular line. 2 of the agents were on their cell phones while checking customers in. The agents were very rude. We paid for our tickets, extra for baggage, extra to choose a seat to check in so we ended up paying more than any other airline. We will never fly with this airline again.

### "how is it acceptable"
Not Verified | How is the following acceptable? I’ve been at Denver airport waiting 10 hours for a connecting flight to Salt Lake City when I learned there was an earlier flight to SLC. I asked if it was possible to change my flight to this earlier departure in the event that there were any no-shows. With 15 open seats and only 5 people in standby I was told that I could move to the earlier flight if I paid a rebooking fee of $99. That doesn’t make sense to me. Open seats? Already a paying ticket holder? To top things off, my original flight has been delayed 2 hours. So my legitimate question is this: how is it acceptable to charge someone a fee to for the inconvenience of making a few key strokes and mouse clicks to get them on a flight with plenty of open seats, then in return, after actually causing a real inconvenience to me, expect things to be settled with a simple “we’re sorry for the delay”? There is a clear double standard in the way I’ve been treated by Frontier and the cooperation they have expected from me.

### "They should be out of business"
Flew Columbus to Orlando with Frontier Airlines. Once again flight was delayed 4 times then ultimately cancelled when it was too late to do anything about it. This airline does this every time I book a flight. They should be out of business. I am done with them. Once again out of the money and missed another vacation with my grandparents.

### "We are so angry"
3.5 hour delay for flight to Orlando (plus 1 hour Budget car rental line) put us at hotel at 3.30 am and now a 6 hour delay for the return flight! Unbelievable! We are so angry and will never fly Frontier Airlines again!

### "they refuse to communicate"
Not Verified | This is not my first or second or third problem that we've had been flying on Frontier. Often the flights are delayed, they refuse to communicate with their passengers to explain what is causing the delay or how long the delay will be. I once waited 5 hours at the airport with no one able to answer questions. I was traveling with my two small children and at 11 at night when the airport closed we are forced to get a hotel room. That's unacceptable. I would have made arrangements.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Austin. My flight was cancelled for "maintenance" so I was stranded at an airport, and they required me to find my own airline so I could get home on time. I was then only reimbursed for the cost of the new airline ticket. I was not refunded for Frontier's ridiculous baggage fees (which they make you pay a fee for each direction you go, and not just one fee for the whole trip like every single other airline), and I was not refunded for the cancelled ticket either, like they said they would do. Terrible customer service, and I am never flying with Frontier Airlines again.

### "the flight got cancelled"
Providence to Denver. This is my second time flying Frontier Airlines and for sure my last. My flight was delayed 3 different times last night (thats fine things happen) and then when we got on the plane, made it all the way to the runway, the flight got cancelled due to crew working over hours - they had to of known they were cancelling this flight for this reason MUCH before then. We got off the plane were offered no assistance, no hotel, no help. 50+ of us slept in the PVD airport last night after receiving no help. I got booked on another flight for today and 1130 and that flight has already been delayed an hour - trying to be understanding but this is ridiculous. I have never had such a bad experience with an airline before. My last trip on Frontier I was delayed ~4 hours and upon landing was emailed a travel voucher (without even asking for one). Where was that kind of help on this flight?

### "describe the nightmare"
Las Vegas to Philadelphia via San Antonio. Where do I begin to describe the nightmare that is Frontier Airlines. I booked a flight 2wks ago to leave Las Vegas and travel to Philadelphia. The flight I bought had me on Frontier Airlines from Las Vegas to San Antonio and after a 3hr layover in San Antonio I was supposed to board a flight (still with Frontier) and proceed to my destination to Philly. I was supposed to arrive in Philadelphia yesterday which was Thursday night (10/18) and stay through Sunday. The airline to take me home was American Airlines. While typing this message I’m in San Antonio and it’s Friday 10/19. I never boarded the plane to take me to philly because Frontier canceled the flight. When the plane arrived they made an announcement that the pilot is requesting for a new tire and it would be about an hour wait to get the tire. Two hours later they announced that finally they would start boarding the plane in 18min from that moment. Twenty minute later they announced that they would start boarding 15min from that moment and then 10min later they announced they were canceling the flight all together because the paper work regarding the tire swap was going to take too long. Well all hell broke loose from there. People were upset (understandably) however the Frontier ticket agents were rude and without a sincere apologetic tone as they hand us a print out that explains Frontiers canceled flight policy. First option is to just get a full refund and find your own way home. The amount of you refund to be mailed to you within a week or two. The second option was to purchase a new ticket with another airline and Frontier would reimburse up to $500 for your new ticket later by sending you a check in the mail after you email them your receipt that you bought another ticket. This all happened at night so of course they brought up that if we had to get a hotel room then we’d have to come out of pocket for that and they would reimburse but only up to $150 for a hotel room also to be sent later by way of a check in the mail. Unfortunately for me, this was my first Frontier flight, I had never flown with them before. And while I understand that things happen like the plane and the tire issue, it’s my opinion that Frontier should have a better policy as to how they assist their customers in the event of a cancelation that outside of bad weather. We’re all not rich and all don’t have $500 or more to buy a flight on the spot to get to where we need to go within 24 to 48hrs.. All flights out with other airlines started at over $500 and only went up from there. At the moment I’m sitting at the airport in San Antonio, having been here for 24hrs now wondering how I get home simply because I’m one of the unlucky ones who’s bank account isn’t cushioned enough to purchase a $500 or more plane ticket out of here. Additionally, the portion of the money for my American Airlines flight home from Philly back to Vegas is now gone down the drain all thanks to Frontier a Airlines. Thanks for nothing Frontier!! To who ever is reading this.. If your considering this airline then don't. Your money would be better off spent with an airline that treats their customers better in the event of an emergency and there are airlines with better canceled flight policies that won’t cause YOU the customer more money and more headache to be taken care of should a series of events happen that are beyond you control.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Atlanta to LaGuardia. Frontier is the worst airline I have flown. I will never fly with them again. And considering this was my other family member’s first time flying, I guarantee they will never fly again considering this disaster. The plane was disgusting. They did not clean between flights. Our flight was delayed hours, which set our entire trip back a whole day! With no accommodations. Literally did not even apologize for the delay. Asides from that, you have to pay an extra $100 in baggage. You even have to pay for a carry on which is absurd! Considering the flight delay I at least would have been greatful for a comp on my baggage,  nope.

### "cancelled my flight at 3am"
Minneapolis to Austin. Frontier cancelled my flight at 3am the day of my flight and although they offered a refund of my ticket they did not compensate me or help me find a flight through a different airline. I was left paying for a $310 flight that didn’t arrive until 4 am the next morning. It caused a massive inconvenience for me from a time and financial standpoint. It should be illegal for an airline to put people in this situation. As a physician frontier directly affected my ability to care for my patients and that is truly unforgiveable.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Denver to San Jose. Do not fly this airline. It is not "low fare" - there are fees for literally everything! Want to sit next to your friend or significant other on the way? That will cost you $15 to $30 per seat each way depending on the part of the plane you select. Want to check a bag? That will cost you $40 each way. How about a carry-on bag? Another $40 each way. So, on top of my original fare, I paid $320 to get 2 seat assignments each way, 2 checked bags each way and 2 carry-on items each way. On top of that, my flight home was delayed. Initially, the delay was about 20 minutes. But, once we were boarded, we were on the plane for 4 HOURS! Just sitting on the tarmac (btw, their seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced on a plane - almost no padding/cushion). The first issue was some part was frozen/stuck underneath the plane - so they had to fix that. We finally left the gate to taxi to the deicing area. Once the plane was deiced (almost 2 hours after the original departure time) they realized that the cockpit door was not closed appropriately. We then had to taxi all the way back to the gate and wait for them to fix the cockpit door. After that, we again taxi'd back to the deicing area. The entire process, before we actually took-off, lasted 4 hours. To make matters worse, they lost my checked bag. They do not have a scanning/tracking system, which is pretty scary. They told me to come back the next day to see if my bag comes from the next flight from Denver to San Jose. Sure enough, my bag arrived almost a day after I arrived. The funny part, Frontier emailed me even after I received my bag, to apologize, that they are not able to locate it. They still think my bag is lost. Do not fly with this airline. The absolute worst - I thought I'd seen it all.

### "will never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to New Orleans. Do not fly Frontier. In a span of about 1 month we dealt with a cancelled flight from Philly, a 3 hour delay in Philly, and a cancelled flight from New Orleans. The reimbursement does not cover the flights we had to find to get to our destination. Totally ridiculous. We will never fly Frontier again.

### "Avoid this airline like the plague"
Philadelphia to Charleston. Return flight home was cancelled 3 hours before takeoff. Had to frantically locate another flight for 4, delay of 12 hours, additional flight cost of $1600, $48 extra day for car rental, and Frontier (via email) gave me $50 coupon for my next Frontier flight. Avoid this airline like the plague.

### "Never use Frontier Airlines"
Philadelphia to Punt Cana. I'm going to make this real short, I've used Cheap Caribbean for many trips especially to the Dominican Republic. I recently booked a trip to Punta Cana and got a "GREAT DEAL' , however to keep the cost down they used Frontier Airlines. Not knowing their reputation did not think twice. We showed up at the Philadelphia desk over a hour before the flight was boarding. There were three couples trying to board including my wife and myself. The clerk states that We are late and that we can board the plane however not our luggage and that it would get there three days later. Obviously this was not a viable option, so we asked for the supervisor. The supervisor arrives about twenty minutes later, and said if my lead person says your late that's it. I asked how late were and she said 6 minutes but then she let the one couple board with luggage because the clerk then told the supervisor that we were not late, however we were all standing there together. I cannot believe I am even writing this write now , but I truly want people to know what a horrible experience we had . Needless to say we did not make our trip. Please be aware of the flights that you choose with Cheap Caribbean, it's well worth it to pay a little more for a piece of mind. Never use Frontier Airlines.

### "Goodbye forever Frontier"
This is a general review of Frontier Airlines. If you are a no nonsense flier that wants to get from point A to point B and you only travel with nothing more than a school sized backpack, and on that flight you enjoy rigid seats with a tablet sized tray table and no accommodations, then Frontier is for you. For the rest, Frontiers hidden fees when it comes to baggage check, and paying for overpriced beverages on the flight instantly makes them a no go. The service is nothing to gloat about and the aircraft  are dirty and unwelcoming. Frontier has encouraged me to finally get a Southwest Airlines credit card because I will pay the extra $50 to be treated with respect and a valued customer. Goodbye forever Frontier.

### "rest of the flight was fine"
Not Verified |  Portland to Denver via Oklahoma City. I bought my ticket before reviewing Frontier. I went to the airport stressed because of all the bad reviews. I just knew the flights would have issues. The first leg of the flight was on a 45 min delay. (That has happened to me before so no big deal.) I was warned through email for weeks and again at the airport to purchase a carry on ticket (You are allowed a personal item, but the size limit is pretty small. My purse barely made the cut off.) Once we were all seated and ready to go the flight attendants notice a man trying to sneak his bag on. Needless to say they told him he needed to get off the plane and pay for the bag or not fly. He made a big scene about it. The attendants were very nice about it, the police had to come and remove him. The rest of the flight was fine. The second leg of my flight was fine. One of the attendants really loved her job and was very nice. The seats are a little small. You have to pay for and drinks or snacks (card only). Other than the mishap on the first flight all was well.

### "cancel flights without notice"
Trenton to Charleston. I would not recommend Frontier Airlines. I wanted to like it so much with their route from Charleston to Trenton. Price was great. Until Wednesday 10/3 arrived. Flight delayed an hour, I can accept that. Arriving in Trenton was great, front & rear doors open as soon as you land. Then, I push the door open at the airport & put my hand right into a fresh bloody handprint. I assumed it was a Halloween decoration. Not. Luckily my ride had hand sanitizer. But still not a deal breaker. Now to Wednesday 10/10. Here’s when the nightmare begins. Plane supposed to leave at 9:30. I get a text at 9:18 saying delayed til 12. Then 5 mins later I get another text saying it’s now only delayed til 10:45. Nobody there to ask, but there are plenty of flies. You’re crammed in the basement with another flight that is also delayed. No where to sit for hours. Finally take off at 12:30. We get to Charleston only to be stuck on the tarmac over an hour because no frills airlines have to wait for a gate. They cancel flights without notice frequently, so beware. One & done for me. Too bad

### "entire experience was bad"
Not Verified |  Was suppose to fly New Orleans to San Diego. Drove from Baton Rouge. I get to check in and they informed me my flight has been canceled. They said they could get me on next available flight which was Wednesday. I needed to be in San Diego for October 2. They told me I could cancel my flight and get refund and purchase another airline ticket. I asked when I’d get my refund. They said 7-10 business days. I had no way of purchasing another ticket. I didn’t have money from my refund and no way I could afford to purchase a ticket for a last minute flight. Baggage check people were rude. Customer service was bad and entire experience was bad. Will never attempt to fly frontier again. Cheap airfare isn’t always the best.

### "senseless inability to solve problems"
Not Verified | Raleigh to Las Vegas. Never, ever, ever fly with this airline. The couple hundred bucks you might save will be paid for ten times over in inconvenience, frustration, delays and senseless inability to solve simple problems. I arrived for my flight seven hours early and tried to get placed on a standby list for an earlier departing flight. With any other airline this is an easy request and usually with no fee. I waited in a long line to see a ticket agent and was told that Frontier does not do standby lists. I was told to call customer service to see if they could help. I finally got a hold of a customer service rep and was told that only the ticket agent could help me with the request. Classic circular hopelessness. I tried again with the gate agent and as he tried to change my ticket he told me that it would be over $500 to change my ticket to fill an empty seat on the earlier flight I was trying to board. These guys are seriously untrained, uncaring, powerless idiots. I don't see this airline lasting long. Good riddance!

### "delayed a few hours"
Denver to Minneapolis. The flight was delayed a few hours, the TSA had the worst attitudes. We landed and are now stuck on the plane due to another plane being at our gate. Frontier needs to get it together - every time I fly with Frontier I have the worst experience and it's very uncomfortable.

### "delayed with no explanation"
Raleigh Durham to Denver. Do not waste your money and time with this airline. Poor customer service, rude employees, have no regard whatsoever for customers. The airline blatantly tell a lie upon lie upon lie upon lie. When there are flight delays the least the airline should’ve done is be honest to us customers. Shame on Frontier Airlines. My Flight delayed with no explanation. Incompetent staff.

### "flight was delayed 3 times"
Charleston to Austin. This was the most unprofessional thing I’ve ever had happen to me, the flight was delayed 3 times and pushed over 5 hours back, in the end the flight was cancelled and without giving us a reason. With no reason as to why our flight is cancelled we will leave tonight and have to reschedule our flights. The flights also overcharge for everything, I mean $45 to check in one bag?

### "reservation system went down"
Denver to San Jose. Ahhh Frontier. It's like a hangover. You think, I'll never do this again. But then, they bring out the happy hour menu, and you think, "look at those prices! How bad could it be? ugh. Their entire reservation system went down this morning, or as their desk agent put it, "we're dead in the water" (better to hear that now than later). This guy, thankfully, was cleaning off the kiosk machines so that all of us could read the spinning / buffering / thinking-icon better. Then, instead of updating the departure time, they left it only showing only 30 minutes delayed. We didn't start boarding the plane until after that time. Full hour delayed.

### "delayed multiple times"
Not Verified |  Frontier is one of the most unprofessional and poorest value airlines I've ever had the misfortune of flying with. On my flight out from Providence to Raleigh we were delayed multiple times without explanation, and I was charged $45 for a single carry on item. On the return trip, after landing, we waited an hour or so before being allowed to dock and deplane, meanwhile the engine's idle rumble was extremely painful to the ears the entire time we were on the ground waiting. You couldn't pay me to fly with this airline again.

### "wildly inefficient and not punctual"
Baggage was costly addition during check-in, as was an actual seat. The minimum cost to select a seat was $15, no free option. Baggage and reservation of my seat cost an extra $105 round trip, roughly 30% higher than the advertised cost of the flight. When using their mobile site to check in and purchase the luggage, there was a timeout error which caused the check-in status to go through without even agreeing to the hazardous materials clause (illegal?). Had to call customer support to manage the reservation, and the phone menu said there would be a $25 charge to speak to an agent to change anything (never applied). When I finally was able to get to a human he modified my reservation and added the bag and selected the seat. Checking in took 1.5 hours with the combined online and phone support effort. Flight was over an hour late departing the first half of my journey. Now am on the return flight. While we landed 25 minutes early, the plane Has been on the tarmac, sitting, no action for over 1.5 hours. We’ve received 5 15-minute updates, one extra water service. Frontier is wildly inefficient and not punctual. The service is bare minimum. No frills means you are only offered water service for free, the rest requires a credit card. This is my first flight with the airline and it shall be my last. Between the misleading advertised pricing, charges for bare minimum services, and severe scheduling errors, i can confidently say that either ineptness or malpractice are at play.

### "had to pay $45 for carry on"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Charlotte. Flew this airline cause it was a shorter flight and it was relatively short compared to other airlines. Then when I got to the counter I had to pay 45 dollars for a carry on. I’ve flown many times before and have never had to pay for a carry on. If I would have know this I would’ve packed a bigger back to check instead of cramming everything into a small suitcase

### "flight was cancelled"
Ft Myers to Philadelphia. I purchased a ticket with Frontier due to the low prices, will not be making that mistake again. The flight was cancelled due to a bird going through the windshield as the plane was landing. This is understandable of course, but the way this airline is addressing the situation is absolutely ridiculous. I could not even get to the counter with one CS serving 300 passengers at 10 min per passenger speed. Tried to call the Frontier phone number, not available. Had to rent a car and drive. The circumstances of why the flight is cancelled was out of Frontier's hands but the fact that they do not have the capability to get a different plane or have a more reasonable second flight option. Talking to their representatives on the phone is impossible. The customer service with this airline is non existent. Will be voicing my disgust with this airline to any and everyone.

### "Save your money"
Not Verified |  Save your money. By the time you pay for your luggage, ticket and unknown fees. You're better off flying with another airline. My husband and I flew RT from Chicago we paid $45 for our checked bag. Our return trip the same bag we traveled with cost $125.00. we was told our luggage was a few pounds over weight. I was told I was being charged $75.00 for the few extra pounds but actually charged $125.00. We've called Customer Service only to tell us no refunds. After back and forth explanations we were told a manager will call us back. Still waiting. I had high hopes and great expectation for this airline, so unfortunate.

### "don’t deserve 1 Star"
Seattle to Austin. Flight was late boarding. Boarded then they made us take our bags off and go back to the lobby. Boarded 2 hours later and had to go back in again! Then flight change and had to reclaim and check baggage. They lost my checked luggage. If you’re thinking about flying with them, don't. You’ll regret it 100%. I am so frustrated right now and no sleep. It’s now 9 am and I was suppose to leave Seattle at 11:45 pm last night. I better not get charged for baggage. They don’t deserve 1 Star.

### "Was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Santa Barbara to Washington. Was pleasantly surprised with timeliness and service. Looking forward to my next flight on Frontier. Bag fees in line with other domestic flights. Paying for stretch seat was well worth it. And, fare was significantly better than competitors.

### "hit with a bunch of expense"
Not Verified |  Spokane to Las Vegas. The discounted price of $78 each way ended up being over $300 after baggage charges, seating charges and drinks / snacks. Did not pay extra for early boarding, would have been additional $50. The  flight was delayed an hour at scheduled boarding time for mechanical issues. My real dissatisfaction though is being hit with a bunch of expense after purchasing the tickets. The price was the same if not more than the other airlines after all was said and done. And I could at least have had a reclining, fabric covered seat. And a chair back tray big enough to hold a cup. And an in flight magazine. Not to mention a barf bag. Also, the poor flight crew had to do a 5 minute advertisement for the Frontier miles credit card. I found that extremely annoying.

### "extremely poor call center"
Not Verified |  My review is not about my flight but about the extremely poor customer service at their call center. Tonight I was on the phone for 1 hour and 40 minutes trying to use my frequent flyer miles for a rent a car. I talked to 5 different people who barely spoke English and not one could answer our questions. Don't bother with signing up for their rewards program because you get absolutely nothing with it. It's extremely difficult to use miles. I was upgraded to Elite status and they won't even give you a free can of coke or a carry on bag. The whole program is a joke. I will be spending my money elsewhere from now on.

### "I would not recommend"
I was scheduled to fly from Oklahoma City to Salt Lake City via Denver with Frontier airlines. They cancelled the flight right before, so I was forced to find another flight with Delta. I was promised a reimbursement of $400, so I did the requirements of sending in pictures of proof of another airline flight. They told me I would get my money back within 30 days. It is October now, and I still haven't gotten anything. I have called every single week, been put on hold for countless hours, and written a letter to the company. That money is rightfully mine, and they are doing nothing about it. I would not recommend Frontier airlines to anybody. This is the second time I've had an awful experience.

### "They lost my luggage"
This airlines customer service in Denver is the worst. They don't care and don't follow up. They lost my luggage and didn't put any notes in the computer. It's been almost a week and they still haven't gotten back to me. There even was an incident on my flight where the cops had to assist. Between the cops and not being allowed off plane and them losing my luggage, i missed my flight. The next flight the had to my destination was a fee days out. They wouldn't pay for another airline flight. Had problems with them refunding my ticket even for partial flight and was told that i was wrong that they lost my luggage, even though their office called a group of us in to fill out paperwork

### "the gate was closed"
Frontier Airlines has the worst customer service. I showed up around 55 min before the flight but the ladies at the counter told me that the gate was closed, gave me a piece of paper to call Frontier and just walked away.

### "Rip off to check bags"
Phoenix to Denver. Fares are cheap. However, Frontier has 12 inches between rows, seats are hard plastic, itinerary changed (went from direct flights round trip to an 8hr layover in Denver) spent an hour & half trying to contact Frontier customer service (nobody ever answered. Rip off to check bags!

### "Awful, Awful, Awful"
Not Verified |  Flew Frontier Airlines from Portland, Maine to Orlando, Florida. Awful, Awful, Awful. Cancelled our flight. Would not help get us another flight within 4 days. Would not get us a hotel. They did nothing for us. Ruined out family vacation. Never again. I would give negative 10 if I could.

### "customer service is sub par"
Ft Myers to Philadelphia. I purchased a ticket with Frontier due to the low prices, will not be making that mistake again. The flight was cancelled due to a bird going through the windshield as the plane was landing. This is understandable of course, but the way this airline is addressing the situation is absolutely ridiculous. First there are no vouchers for food or hotel provided because "it is not the airline's fault". Fine. The 2 options were getting half of your money back or waiting 3 days for the next flight to Philadelphia that has 2 layovers and will take almost 24 hours to get there. The circumstances of why the flight is cancelled was out of Frontier's hands but the fact that they do not have the capability to get a different plane or have a more reasonable second flight option. Talking to their representatives on the phone is impossible. The customer service with this airline is sub par, and that is being generous. Will be voicing my disgust with this airline to any and everyone.

### "flight time kept changing"
San Antonio to Columbus. My flight time kept changing which made me nervous. I purchased the first seat for $30 because I thought it’s wider than the back seats, but it turned out it was the worst seat in plane. Very tight, you can’t extend your legs. They put it more expensive because people would think is better. I was scammed by this airline. Their flight attendant was rude, I called him and he said “one second” without looking to my eyes, then he never come back to me.

### "customer service is the worst"
This is my returning flight and now the two times I've flown with Frontier Airlines I can count the number of smiles or "thank you" or "have a nice day" on 2 fingers. The customer service is the worst and Frontier should be embarrassed. I stood in like for 45 minutes waiting to check a bag, and literally not a single customer was given a smile. The employees make it known that their work life is so miserable which then makes the customers experience horrible. Also, its 2018 and these airlines dont have wifi? Get with it Frontier, you are an embarrassment of an airline. I am a frequent flyer and bought these because it was the only airline available for the specific times I needed to fly.

### "Frontier should be ashamed"
Denver to Seattle. We arrived at sea-tec and our checked bag didn’t arrive. We left our contact information and headed to car rental. While there, we received a call that the bag had been found. Staff refused to wait the 15 minutes it would have taken to return for the bag. Was told we would have to wait until 11 pm, which was three hours later. We decided to return to airport following day around noon to get bag and was told no frontier staff would be available until 8pm, as they only show two hours before flight. I was due in Vancouver that night. I was assured that the bag would be delivered to our hotel either Monday, Tuesday at latest. We called them on Monday night to check on bag; no answer. We did not receive bag on Tuesday. No calls from frontier. We talked yet again to the baggage people who were located in Denver and was told they would take our message and have someone in Seattle return our call. Never received. We called everyday the entire week. We had to buy everything new, and I had to go without diabetic pump supplies and monitoring supplies as they were in bag. We never received a call. We returned to Sea-Tec on Saturday evening. A frontier staff took us to the cage where it had been the entire week. We were told the bag person in charge was out sick or on vacation. No one cared about the distress of not having the bag delivered, that frontier has no staff on site to open the bag when we were there on that sat and sun to unlock the cage so we could have our supplies. We were told all medical supplies should be in carry on. It was the worst experience ever; one of the most stressful weeks of our lives without access to our stuff, numerous unanswered calls, hours spent trying to find someone on site to even confirm bag was there, going without diabetic supplies. What a joke for a company. I will never use their service again. Frontiers effort to make up for their service? A reimbursement for the checked bag and a promise to reimburse purchases up to 100-200 dollars a day for items needed to buy. I bought the cheapest toiletries I could find and it certainly exceeded their max reimbursement. What they don’t reimburse for is the psychological distress to be in another country with no supplies, no medical equipment and all our time spent in the drama of dealing with a company who has no staff available during the days except for 90 min before a late night flight. I strongly discourage anyone from considering using this company. I absolutely guarantee they do not care nor will make any effort to do the right, let alone professional, thing for their customer. And to their poor personnel who are contract workers for the mere two hours before flights? I feel bad for them. Watching customer after customer expressing their frustration to a low paying attendant who has no control to make anything better. Frontier should be ashamed of themselves.

### "worst airline experience"
Denver to Harrisburgh. This was by far this worst airline experience I have ever had. Not only did our flight (6AM departure) become delayed by 2 hours with no explanation, but when I was finally able to board, my seat "did not exist! A seat that I had paid for, "did not exist. When I asked why, I did not receive an appropriate explanation and no solution was offered. The flight attendants were beyond disrespectful and presented themselves as though they did not want to be at work, almost annoyed. I ended up missing my special event due to the tardiness of this airline and when reaching out to the airline to discuss my concerns, I was shut down and told that due to my flight being completed, there was "nothing they can do. Never again will I opt for the cheaper tickets / Frontier Airlines. It is not worth it.

### "Horrible experience"
Tampa to Denver. The plane broke going toward our destination. The one coming back also broke. We had delays both times and we missed our rental car. Our kids were exhausted and falling asleep on the benches. Horrible experience.

### "Poor customer service"
Denver to Atlanta. Poor customer service. Airplane but no crew to operate. Now will miss my connection in Atlanta. This is a sorry excuse for an airline. Will not be using them ever again unless I need an excuse as to why I can't get somewhere

### "Do not waste your money"
Sacramento to Las Vegas. This is an absolute disgrace of an airline company. On August 21st I had a flight from Sacramento to Las Vegas that was originally scheduled for a 7:40pm. When I arrived at the airport, the flight was already delayed an hour. Okay, not a huge issue until it was delayed again and again, until ultimately being cancelled around 10pm. I had received a notification on my cell phone that the flight was cancelled and when I went to the counter to confirm this (As no announcement had been made), they tried to tell me that the information was incorrect and they had heard nothing about the flight being cancelled. Backtracking to the "meal vouchers" they handed out, at about 8:50pm, and guess what time all of the Sacramento restaurants stop serving food...9pm. Thanks for the useless voucher. At the counter, once they finally announced the cancelled flight, they announced that they would be providing a document that stated how to rebook a new flight either with Frontier or with another airline (that would be reimbursed up to $400). Given that the next Frontier flight into Las Vegas wasn't until two days later, I rebooked with another airline through the website that Frontier required and was on a flight to Vegas the next morning. The letter that was given out at the gate stated that Frontier would be reimbursing (via checks) the refund for the cancelled flight and the amount for the rebooked flight (up to $400) within 10 business days. It's been over a month. They've ignored all of my contact submissions and refund requests and at this point I am planning on reporting the charges to my credit card as fraudulent and seeing how far that will get with me with them. Do not waste your money. The cheap rate is not worth the headache that will inevitably ensue.

### "often canceled or delayed"
Seattle to Denver. Frontier flights are cheap but you get what you pay for. There are no complimentary snacks on the plane, and they charge for everything like bags and even your seat selection. The worst thing though, is that the counters to check your bags dont even open until 2 hours before the flight. We always try to get to the airport early because traffic is unpredictable, and it gives us extra time to make sure the kids are good to go. However, we end up stranded at the ticket counters with two bored kids and giant bags and car seats that would not be possible to drag around while shopping or eating. Also, the Seattle airport didn't have much to do before going all the way the through security. It consistently makes the airport experience terrible. Then there is another consistent issue where they often board planes an hour late without updating their information boards and it has been confusing several times...and again...standing in line with no clue how long it's going to be for an hour with bored kids is hell. In general, their flights are often canceled or delayed.

### "worst service I’ve ever received"
Not Verified |  On my way to Salt Lake City from Albuquerque, both of my flights were delayed. This was only the beginning of my problems with This airline. On my way home was supposed to originally leave Saturday morning at 11:23 AM. Flight was delayed due to some reason unbeknownst to me. Because of this delay and I had a connection flight with the same airline, I would end up missing my connection flight. This airline wanted to do nothing to help me. They could not get me on another flight for a couple of days, but then only offered me a one night hotel stay. What was I supposed to do the other night, sleep on the streets because they had an issue? Then I decided to get a flight with another airline, because I actually did need to get home to get back to work. Believe it or not my work life does not revolve around airlines having delays. So I get the other ticket, and was told they could not refund my ticket, even though the delay was their fault. So they won’t refund your money, can’t get you on a plane for a couple more days, and only give you a hotel for one night and leave you out with nowhere to stay for the other two? Maybe I’m crazy, but shouldn’t the company who is putting you out to be the ones who are inconvenienced and not the paying customer? So not only would I have been left with no where to stay, I also had to get a new airline, and ended up paying $231 out of pocket just so I could still get home on the day that I needed to. Because “they” have a delay. This is the worst service I’ve ever received, and I will never ever fly this airline again, and I recommend that you don’t either, unless you would like a big headache and to be out of pocket - at the mercy of their ineffective policies, that protect them, while leaving those of us who are paying for a service are put out on the street and out of pocket to cover their inability to Perform. If I’m paying for a flight, and you have a delay, then you need to be the one that is in convenience not me. That’s called customer service, and simple common sense. In the end, the manager at the customer service did refund my ticket for the one-way home. However because I had to buy a new ticket the same day, I was still out $231 of my own money regardless of the $150 refund that I was given. Huge inconvenience, not to mention the worst service I’ve ever received from an airline

### "Avoid at all costs"
Charleston to Trenton. Avoid at all costs. They would have gotten 0 stars if it was an option. This is the 10th or so time I have used Frontier simply because of the proximity of the airport and because of the price but it’s not even worth it anymore. Two of my flights have been cancelled and i have never had a flight that was actually on time. Currently sitting on an aircraft for what’s been over an hour after boarding early (I should have known better than to think this was going to be the first flight with zero problems), and it’s not due to the airport, it’s due to the “computer system being reset,” isn’t that supposed to be checked prior to even leaving a gate? If we were still at the gate I would have gotten off. If you are looking for a reliable flight experience, do yourself a favor and listen to everyone else’s reviews along with mine and avoid. Their customer service is absolutely terrible as well, give out vouchers to “satisfy” you, no thanks no one wants a voucher to maybe fly your airline again. The little bit of extra money for another airline is beyond worth it.

### "guaranteed to be delayed"
Chicago to Las Vegas. It is by far the worst experience. Do not get baited with the low price flight. It'll be guaranteed to be delayed, terminals at the farthest corner in the airport and with any bag, pretty much out price the mid tier airlines. And then there's 7 hour delay which is almost a rescheduling at this point, and at 330am. You're not saving any money, you will pay more, spend more time and guaranteed to be delayed. No reason whatsoever to choose this airline company.

### "finally cancelled"
San Antonio to Las Vegas. Worst airline I have ever try to travel! $350 for 2 one way tickets from San Antonio to Las Vegas. The flight as been rescheduled 4 times from a departure at 4:30 to finally 11:20 and had being finally cancelled at 11am. So I lost my hotel reservation, had to take a night in a hotel near SA and finally paid $658 for each ticket with an other airline because Frontier was not able to reschedule a similar flight within 3 days. At the end it finally cost me around $2,000 to go to LV.

### "strongly consider staying home"
Denver to Bozeman. Our Frontier flight was completely cancelled. Although we understand that these issues do happen, we were not informed of the cancellation until we arrived at the airport. The flight was cancelled at least 24 hours beforehand when we attempted to check into our flight via the app and there seemed to be an issue. At that point we did not expect a cancellation because we were allowed to pay for our carry-on baggage. Once we arrived for our flight at DIA we found out that no other flights (Frontier or other airlines) were available to get to Bozeman, MT. As such, we were forced to fly into a different airport, then drive, to get to our destination. That's when the real frustration began. We were told that we would be reimbursed $400 per passenger (I was traveling with my wife). After two months of negotiation Frontier finally cut a check. We negotiated to get the check up to $500 per person, but they first deducted the cost of the original flight and our baggage fee. The real kicker is that our last minute flight (through a different airline) had a cost of $1,000 per person. All in, we spent over $2,400 and were reimbursed $1,000 (still waiting for that check so we'll see about that) plus two $250 Frontier travel vouchers (insert sarcastic excitement). If you have alternative options other than Frontier, choose the other airline. If you have no other options, strongly consider staying home.

### "Don't waste your time or your money"
Worthington to Phoenix. Don't waste your time or your money. Unfortunately, there is nothing that I can say positive about this airline. It was my first time to fly Frontier. I should have known when I only paid $348.00 for "2" round trip tickets on a non-stop flight that it was too good to be true. First time they rescheduled my flight, they had me stopping and changing planes in Denver. Ok, the times weren't far off, so no biggie, right? Wrong. Because they decided to change my itinerary a second time. This time, I had to arrive the day before and then coming back, I had a "12 hour" layover from midnight until noon the next day, so I also got back home a day late. But for my inconvenience, Frontier offers "2" $100.00 vouchers to both me and my husband ($400.00 total). Wait for the catch on these "I'm sorry vouchers". You have to book (not travel) within 90 days or you lose your vouchers. My husband works for Marathon Petroleum and their schedule hasn't even come out yet for next year; so you tell me, how am I supposed to book another vacation when I don't even know what days he's off yet. So I call Frontier and ask if there is any way to "delay" the date of booking and using the vouchers. The answer is "No". (Like I thought it was going to be anything else). This was my first and last time to ever fly Frontier. You would be very wise to heed my warning, as well. Everyone I talked to in line, in the airport, on the plane, had all experienced this same thing with Frontier. They do not care about their customers. In their minds, since their flights are cheap, basically your service is cheap, as well. Nope, no more for me and my family.

### "Poor customer service"
Atlanta to Miami. Poor customer service and terrible attitude of the counter personnel, they think they are doing you a favor by checking you in, despite the fact that you are paying additional $100.00 for a carry on luggage that most airlines don't charge for. Bad experience, I would not recommend Frontier Airlines to anybody .

### "Shame on you Frontier Airlines"
I'm actually typing this from the air on my flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico back to Atlanta. Several weeks ago I booked a R/T flight thru Frontier to San Juan to celebrate my birthday this past weekend. I've flown with them one other time on a trip to Los Angeles a couple of years back. Which, I might add for a cross country flight, was uneventful. Now, departing from Atlanta on Thursday 9/20/18, my flight was delayed an hour for reasons unbeknownst to me. A mild setback-- but no biggie. I had a fabulous trip until it was time to depart on Sunday. Approx 30 min before take off an announcement was made that there would be a delay due to mechanical issues. Then 15min later we were told that our 440pm flight was going to be delayed until the next day. After grabbing my bags from baggage claim, I proceeded to the Frontier counter to see what my options were. The line was wrapped around the building. I decided to take a chance to see if just maybe I could find another flight with a different airline departing that evening. Tried Delta, American and Southwest. No such luck! In fact, many of the counters were closing and their last flights had already departed for the evening. Keep in mind at this point its only around 515ish. So back to Frontier I go and hope for the best. I stood in line for hours. By around 815pm I finally got up to the counter, was told I was booked for the 11am flight the next day and was given two meal vouchers totalling $25 and are only good for the airport eateries. When I inquired about accommodations, I was told that at this time they weren't offering any hotel accomodation, assistance, vouchers, nothing. For the sake of time I decided not to argue with the clerk and just took my vouchers and proceeded to look for dinner. Now it's 830pm (which is when I was expected to land in ATL) and most of the shops in the airport are closed with the exception of a coffee shop and one restaurant. After hiking across the airport, luggage in tow, I see a line at the one restaurant still open for us to use our dinner  voucher. This has to be a joke. After 20 min of standing in line with no movement, I gave up. Went outside to attempt to catch a taxi and it was also a ghost town. After waiting around for 10min or so an unmarked black van pulled up and asked if I needed a ride. Could've been a taxi. Could've been a serial killer. At that point, I didn't care. I was exhausted, my body ached and I just wanted to get to my room. For $10, he drove me to a hotel in Carolina (Hotel La Playita which was great btw) where I had made reservations while in line for food moments earlier. I know that things happen- sometimes out of our control. I understand that flights are cancelled and delayed all day, every day. That's not my issue. But the fact that our flight was cancelled due to the plane leaking hydraulic fluid and Frontier making it the passenger's problem to figure everything out, is where I take issue. Scrambling to find sleeping arrangements, taxis, meals, etc can add up. In my case, my best friend had flown back home to DC on JetBlue so I was stranded alone and having to foot the bill by myself. This cancellation wasn't due to weather or some other natural disaster and the responsibility of their customers fell on Frontier. Shame on you Frontier Airlines in your lack of compassion for your passengers and for totally mishandling this situation.

### "terrible customer service"
Austin to Charlotte. I have never flown with Frontier by choice before. This was my first time purchasing a ticket to fly with Frontier Airlines. I know that it will also be my last. The flight was initially delayed for a tire change. It was a 6:30am flight. It wasn’t until 6:15 (boarding time) that the passengers were given this information and told hat it would be another 45 minutes until boarding. At 7am an agent was sitting at the Frontier ticketing desk wearing the frontier logo and just sat there watching all of the passengers waiting to board. I approached her and asked if there was any update. She answered that tires are pretty important and take time. I replied that I knew this but would appreciate some kind of update being that the quoted 45 minute delay had already passed. She said “ok” and proceeded to sit. Moments later she left the desk and went behind the door to the on ramp and never came back. We didn’t leave until 8am and didn’t arrive to my destination until 1 hour and 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst flights with poor communication and terrible customer service. I don’t foresee a successful future for Frontier Airlines and will never recommend them.

### "never use Frontier again"
Not Verified |  My husband and son had a flight home from Austin, Texas today. They got to the airport and found out it was delayed. They kept delaying it more and more. When I called customer service they told me the flight from Atlanta to New York had air conditioning issues. So I said “what has that got to do with anything”? I asked where the plane was at the moment and they had no clue. The plane finally left 4 hours later. It was a connecting flight at Cincinnati but they didn’t have to get off the plane. Meanwhile online they had all the wrong times when the flight was leaving even after it left. It was delayed in Cincinnati for about 1 1/2 hours. I had to pick them up so after it finally departed I checked online to see when it was going to arrive. Needless to say it had it 1/2 hour after takeoff but it’s a 2 hour flight. So I called customer service again, which is outsourced to the Philippines (which I don’t care if they knew what they were doing) and she said the plane was arriving at 10:20 and it 10:40 and they just departed. I was so angry that I said to the girl “why aren’t your computers updated. That’s very dangerous for people on the ground trying to get information on their loved one 35000 mile in the air. Your website is wrong and you don’t have the proper information either”. She put me on hold and came back with a more reasonable time. So now I have to pick them up at 2:00 in the morning. So I will never use Frontier again and don’t recommend them. Also after you add in the luggage and seat it’s almost as much as any other airline.

### "chaotic and very unprofessional"
After long delays, the flight, scheduled for 9:21 pm was canceled. The situation that evolved later was chaotic and very unprofessional. Staff were confused, gave contradictory information and were extremely rude. There were no refreshments offered despite the many hours we had to spend at the gate to be informed about our options. We were given a one night stay at a hotel. no provisions were made to help us out.

### "this exceeds my expectations"
This airline deserves more than its rating! I've been flying with Frontier Airlines for a while. I'm a frequent traveler and this exceeds my expectations a lot in terms of low fare budget airlines. They are not your typical expensive airline so their perks aren't as many as Delta for example, but for what you pay it's much more.

### "never attempt to fly Frontier again"
Canceled first flight 1 hr before and no one knew why with no other flight options except for days later. Do not recommend booking that same flight option (it’ll get changed too.) you only get reimbursed up to so much. Had to book with other line to get to my destination. So more $$ for one way. And surprise to go back home 10 days later the red eye flight gets delayed - try to see someone at a counter., no one came had to call - now sitting overnight in hopes it takes off next option in am. If canceled next flight option is 4 days from now! If delayed due to weather etc, then understandable but neither of these situations Are even answer. I am by myself and can suck it up sleeping at an airport but if I had kids this would truly be a nightmare. you have to call for any chance, but they do nothing there either. I’m curious if I’ll even get to be on a frontier flight. I truly will never attempt to fly Frontier again.

### "I don't care attitude about it"
I picked this flight from Denver to Miami to surprise a friend of mine. Got delayed twice. Asked why and they just said the plane hasnt left yet. Over 3 hours of delay. Still waiting to see if I get delayed again. Options is get my money back or get a food voucher. All food places are closed now. Just stay away from Frontier Airlines unless you have hours to kill in an airport. Happens so often that customer service has an I don't care attitude about it. I hope they fix the problems or go out of business.

### "friendly and helpful"
St Louis to Las Vegas return. Flight left on time and arrived in Vegas earlier than expected. Left Vegas about 20 minutes later than departure time but that was no biggie. Pilots were informative on both flights and flight attendants were friendly and helpful with assistance.

### "cabin crew were efficient and attentive"
This was the best option I had to fly from Orlando to Las Vegas without any layovers and after reading the negative reviews, I went on the plane with butterflies in my stomach (the nervous and painful kind and not the high school crush coming closer kind). I was actually pleased with how smooth the trip went. We flew on time and reached Vegas ahead of schedule. The cabin crew were efficient and attentive and although the seats felt like sitting in a school cafeteria, I didn’t mind them much. I will never forget the moment the female cabin crew picked up the phone and said “yeah, Las Vegas baby” as it was iconic. I didn’t go wrong when choosing Frontier Airlines. Also, I really appreciate the flexibility and the ability to add extra options and perks like extra checked and carry on bags, etc... whenever you feel like it with very reasonable prices.

### "Run the other way"
Where do I start? They charge you for carry-ons. In Denver, there were 8 or 9 desks with only one person accepting checked bags (which they also make you pay for) and a line of more than 50 people! We got to the airport 2.5 hours early and barely made our flight on time. Almost everyone we dealt with from Frontier was rude and/or ambivalent, and they went the extra mile to make sure we felt like cattle. The seats were barely more comfortable than standing and even the tray tables are pathetic. I knew going in it wasn't going to be amazing, but wow was I surprised at just how patently horrific it was to fly on Frontier. Next time I fly, I am going to pay extra to Alaska Airlines, just because they are not Frontier. I will never, ever fly this airline again, in fact, I would prefer riding a seatless bicycle to Denver than flying Frontier Airlines, and that's not hyperbole. With all of their hidden fees and charges, you end up paying more than you would to fly a decent airline anyway. Run the other way away from this awful business.

### "I will fly again with Frontier"
I scheduled a surprise day trip for my son’s 10th birthday to Denver from Dallas (leaving and coming back on same day). He had never flown before and was super excited. We got to airport before 5am only to discover about an hour later that the flight was delayed until 10:30am (not sure if airline was at fault or not). Although the wait was bad it effectively ruined our trip bc I had planned to drive to Breckenridge and spend only 5-6 hours at their adventure park so we could make it back for the return flight. As a result of the delay, we drove up there but only had less than an hour before having to drive back to the airport and drop of the rental car. This trip was pretty much a bust. I emailed customer service and was impressed that I received a response the next day (Sunday) who really took the time to express his apologies and sympathy for my son’s big day being ruined - very long email and was quite personable. I didn’t expect that personal touch which was appreciated along with the vouchers they sent to cover a future flight. That level of customer service is rarely seen these days at larger companies which is why I will fly again with Frontier which I probably would not have before receiving that response.

### "lost our checked car seat"
Flew Cincinnati to Dallas with Frontier Airlines. The airline lost our checked car seat and the only solution they offered was to give us a car seat belonging to someone else that they had lost on a previous flight. This car seat was too big for our baby and did not even meet the safety legal requirements in regards to our childs age, height, and weight. The airline offered no other help or service on the problem their inconpetence created. It would have been cheaper to buy another ticket for the car seat as we will be having to buy a new one.

### "fly with them again anytime"
Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Minneapolis. First time I have flown on Frontier, flew up for the birth of my Grandbaby. Checking in was easy and quick. Return flight was cancelled due to Hurricane FLorence, they notified me by text and email and kept in contact as we waited for a return date to become open. They we wonderful assisting me with rebooking my return flight. I will fly with them again anytime.

### "lack of communications"
Chicago to San Antonio via Colorado Springs. We were suppose to fly at 9:00 AM, we sat on the flight till 9:20 AM before the Captain announce our delay. The cockpit cabin door was opened all the time, the captain was busy chatting and talking. We had to leave the plane after being inside till 10:00 AM . Around 11:00 Am announced that maintenance issue was resolved and took over 120 minutes to get paper works ready. This is is an evidence of poor management and lack of communications on all staff at Frontier Airlines.

### "each leg has been delayed"
Philadelphia to Orlando. We’ve had three round trips with Frontier in the past two months, each leg of which has been delayed by a minimum of 1-2 hours, the latest of which was canceled after twelve hours in the airport being told our plane would be arriving shortly. For a budget conscious customer that flies frequently, we’ve decided it’s no longer worth the savings flying with a Frontier. The headaches of missing work, expensive reservations and events along with full days at airports waiting for a plane that won’t come isn’t worth a few hundred in savings.

### "truly get what you pay for"
Albuquerque to Bozeman via Denver. Well just got done with one of the worst flight experiences of my life! My flight was delayed 10 hrs. They gave us no explanation as to why and all of the people working the counter had no idea what they were doing and they didn’t really even care to try and help. Because of this delay I was going to miss my connecting flight in Denver. Frontier offered no help because they don’t work with any other airlines to help you get onto another flight home. I will never book with Frontier Airlines again because you truly get what you pay for. I would rather walk to my destination than fly on Frontier Airlines. Please save your money.

### "most untrained staff"
Philadelphia to Cancun. They are the most untrained staff I have encountered. I have a valid I-551 stamp - temporary green card on my passport, the crew refused to let me boarding. My friend had to drive 2h to the airport to give me the actual card. After I got back I check with my lawyer, it is valid for a year starting 04/2018, so by law I'm allowed to travel with it. They charged me $100 to go on the next flight. not only do they waste my time, that I end up with a transfer flight with 10 layover flight instead of the 4h direct flight, plus the extra hotel out of my pocket.

### "never fly on this airline "
I had a horrible experience without even getting on the plane. First they say to be two hours early for your flight and they were not even open. Finally they check us in around 4 am and say the flight is delayed as the plane got in late. We said ok no problem and go through all the security measures. Then I check the sign to see our flight is canceled, by the way no one announced this. We had to go all the way back to the front desk, the lady was rude saying no-one gave you your options. No sorry for the inconvenience, or any help whatsoever to find a new flight. Then we call the customer service for help and they say the only option is for a refund. The customer representative was not understanding at all. He didn’t offer anything like another flight, we had to book our own tickets with another airline and start the process all over. Waking up at 2 am to catch a flight at 6:50. To hear it's delayed until 11am then to 12 and then cancelled. I will never fly on this airline ever!

### "delayed and eventually cancelled"
Orlando to Buffalo. Originally flying round trip buffalo to Orlando and back, our BUF-MCO flight was delayed over 5 hrs and eventually cancelled. Forced to book onto JetBlue (who were awesome!) now, in Orlando headed back to Buffalo, we boarded and were informed that there was an issue “they don’t have the parts to fix so it has to come from outside the airport” -  we’ve now been delayed over 1 hour and no doubt this will turn into a cancellation. They don’t have any update on if they will even be able to get the parts. On the plus side I found the staff fairly nice, they refunded our original cancellation without much hassle. Issued 10$ voucher for food. They needed to be more up front that the flight was going to be cancelled. This whole time I can only wonder one thing - how does this airline stay in business? !

### "plane left 10 minutes early"
Orlando to Denver. Sat in front of a woman with a 2 yr old child she let continually kick the metal table behind me, she did not stop him until I had to tell them to stop. Why are children flying as lap children at this age, they are not bottle fed. She should have been required to buy him a seat. Why is a child not required a car seat and belt at this age yet, I have to have mine on almost the whole duration. Its ok for a child to bounce around if there is a crash but not a adult? Is this what they gave up tvs for to give children a free ticket to annoy paying customers. I was told if my son over 6 feet and almost 300 lbs could not fit in a seat I had to buy him a 2nd seat yet this child clearly could not fit without problems and was not required to purchase 1? The plane left 10 minutes early leaving my 6 family members behind at the gate. Leaving early is a privilege for having all passengers on board before time to leave yet they left 8 checked in people at the gate to do this? I did not find out about this until a seat belt release period as my 12 yr old daughter had to sit alone because her grandma, aunt, uncle and cousins were not there in back of plane, as my ticket was row 6 due to space for my son. If there were extra seats why was I required to sit by the bad mom who could not control her kid. Stewardess not doing job. At the end of flight passengers got there bags and stood in the walk way making it difficult for others to get theirs and return to seat. Trying to rush past customers who payed 33 dollars to choose a front seat. No stewardess leading them until I got in front of all them and told everyone in rows 1-6 before me to go and told everyone behind me they dont have no manners to wait their turn.

### "don't fly Frontier Airlines"
I trusted Frontier Airlines to get me home to Delaware so I could be with my wife and witness the birth of my first child. The flight was first delayed then ultimately cancelled. I went to the ticket counter and asked for a refund because their next flight was 2 days later and I couldn't wait that long due to being on a time crunch and having to be back for training a few days later for the air Force. I was told to call a number which I did and was on hold for over 30 minutes then finally talked to a person that I could barely understand. If you want to fly somewhere don't fly Frontier Airlines because you'll probably never get there and they'll have you jump through hoops to get refunded.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Frontier Airlines has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I suppose it's understandable that flights sometimes get cancelled for no apparent reason/explanation - but they make it very difficult to get the promised refund. I have been waiting since early July (for a July 3 flight) to get a refund. It's now September 10. I have jumped through all their hoops (twice) and was finally approved the refund about three weeks ago - but despite my having stated in all documents and correspondence what my mailing address is they stated they are mailing to an old address where I have not lived for over 6 years. I have emailed, called, went through their website to try to get his corrected and zero response over the last three weeks to this request. Assuming they will send it to wrong address and everything will be delayed even further - who knows how long. They also make it very difficult to get anyone on the phone; it's pretty clear they don't want to actually talk with their customers! So very frustrating and a lot of wasted time for something that was their fault to start with.

### "overall unpleasant"
Not Verified |  Portland to Raleigh. I originally booked this flight in July for trip this month and thought I paid for an economy class seat. I did the pre check in the day before and at that time, I had to pick my seat which was fine. However, when I picked one of the few seats left, I was charged an additional $28.00. I thought I was being moved to business class which is supposed to be a larger seat in the front of the plane. When we finally boarded I found my seat and it was not business class and was the most uncomfortable I have ever had on a plane. Hard as a rock, little leg room, skinny and overall unpleasant. When I finally got off the plane I was more tired from that flight than from all the walking I did the day before. Plane did leave early and staff were relatively pleasant but that does not excuse charging me extra for something I thought was paid for. If I ever fly again, rest assured it will not be on Frontier and I will advise my friends to choose another airline.

### "airline is the worst"
Not Verified | Orlando to Colorado Springs. This airline is the worst. An hour before our flight was supposed to board, we get a text saying it had been cancelled and there were going to give us $400 for a ticket on a different airline. Even with that, it left us having to spend $1500 on tickets and not to mention the struggle of trying to find a new flight and where our luggage was - all because they “didn’t have a crew”. Will never fly this airline again.

### "disgusted by the behavior"
Seattle to Detroit via Austin. I've worked as a customer service rep for 5 years and I know things can be out of our control, so usually I'm a very cool and collected customer who is easy to talk to and easy to please, but the foolery I experienced at the hands of Frontier Airlines definitely took me out my character. I had my Detroit flight out of Austin canceled literally an hour after the time we where suppose to depart. I'm a mother to a 10 month old, who is traveling with me and I've never been off the west coast where I'm originally from. I never had a problem with the flight being canceled. What I did have a problem with is how they refused to accommodate a mother with her fussy 10 month old. They basically told me all they could do is give me a "voucher" for my flight (which isn't even a voucher it's just the money for the flight I paid for, coming back, so I can pay for my flight for tomorrow again) and that the earliest plane was 24 hours from that point (It was 9 in the morning, mind you, we where suppose to depart at 720) and that they don't do hotel vouchers and that me and my daughter will just have to wait it out. Then on top of that, they lost my bags for a couple hours. It's been well over 10 years since I've been on a plane, and now my experience has been ruined! I wasn't given any blankets until I had to hunt a random employee down and ask. They didn't offer to pay for Dinner. I've never experienced such horrible customer service quality in my life. Frontier Airlines is the definition of selfish money hungry company that doesn't care about the people it's suppose to be accommodating. The phone representative play phone games with you and just switch you back and forth between employees like its a big game. I'm so disgusted by the behavior of this business and its employees and I'll definitely be warning people about this. I hope you all heed warnings and stay far away from this airline.

### "cancelled few hrs before"
New Orleans to Philadelphia. Flight 1062 Sept 1 2018 cancelled few hrs before flight had to purchase ticket on Southwest for 503.00 one way, then Sept 8 2018 while at gate flight on frontier 1063 cancelled. No reason given, purchase 1 way ticket 501.00. The refund policy on frontier was 279, I'm screwed out of the rest. Had to walk to baggage pick up walk thru rain back to departure stand in line purchase new ticket, then go back to security wait in line. 3 time it has happened but never again.

### "flight they cancelled"
Providence to Charlotte. Waited at the gate for 4.5 hours waiting for some type of notice then they finally cancelled. We were originally told mechanical error, which then changed to environmental error so no refund will be provided! They provided no lodging discount or accommodations due to cancellation. Rescheduled us for the following day and 3 hours before flight they cancelled! When I called Frontier they said they could get us on the next flight ( 2 days ahead) or refund us partial of trip but that would take 10 to 14 business days! Worst customer service. We thought that $100/ticket was great, you had to pay for luggage but we thought we'd give it a try; never again!

### "absolutely dumbfounding"
On Sept. 2nd we were supposed to depart from PDX to DEN at 7:29pm, but due to and I quote the Captain of the plane "Had a flat tire, but we couldn't get a maintenance person to the change the tire, then after he changed the tire he realized he had to change both tires if he changes one, but then he couldn't find another tire" we didn't depart until after 1:00am. Our connecting flight from DEN to CVG departed on Sept. 3rd at 12:25am, so we missed that flight, but was rebooked prior to departing from PDX, for a flight that would leave September 4th at 12:30 am. We were also given a hotel voucher prior to departing from PDX, and were told we could stay there until our flight from DEN to CVG. Upon arriving at the hotel at 7:00am (After traveling for almost 24hrs straight) We were told we had to leave the hotel by 11:00am, we called Frontier for help, and they told us "to go back to the airport and talk to customer service", which was out of the question. I asked for a number to call the airport, and they don’t even have a number to contact them. We never checked into that hotel, but instead had to go check into another hotel. I called into Frontier customer service late afternoon the next day on Monday Sept. 3rd, to explain the situation again, but was told us they do not handle refunds and I have to go talk to airport customer service. They gave us 2 $50 vouchers, which I told her we didn't want because we will not be flying with you all again...when I got to the airport that evening I went straight to customer service at the check in. I had Frontier employees just walk away from me and tell me they couldn't help me (Including the supervisor) I then went to the customer service next to where we board the flight, and they told me "they would've never given a voucher like that, and that I should go back to Portland and talk to them there", that they don't handle these type of situations, told me it shows online that I settled for 2 x $50 vouchers and finally gave me the same number to call that told me to go to the airport. I am very much paraphrasing all that your employees told me, as it was absolutely dumbfounding how they talked to and treated their customer(s).

### "completely worthless"
Not Verified | Denver to Las Vegas. Completely worthless. Canceled my flight 2 hours before it was supposed to take off and instead of throwing us on a later flight they forced me to rent a vehicle to get back home with nothing but a sorry you're on your own. After submitting the all the receipts for the reimbursement no information afterwards. I had to call to get an update and now there you they're saying that is 6 weeks not 3 weeks that I have to wait for a reimbursement check to get the money that I had to spend because they decided to cancel their flight. Will never book another flight with these guys. Seats were stiff made out of plastic. Where charging $3 for a soda. I have flown with many other airlines and decided to give these guys a try and I regret every every second of it. Will never be flying with Frontier Airlines due to this experience they are a joke.

### "never fly this airline again"
My fiance booked a flight from Columbus 3:46pm Thursday 9/6 landing in Austin at 9:30pm. They kept pushing the departure back hour by hour until 9:30pm-- then cancelled it outright. They only offered a $400 reimbursement, when round trip replacement flights were up to $800! (Labor day weekend). Luckily, she had booked a one way from CMH to Austin and was flying back to Columbus on Delta already, so she was able to find a one way to Austin on Delta for the next morning (9/7) for $550. The gate agent was quite rude and told her she "was not allowed to ask questions. Later this same gate agent in Columbus clearly helped a man get his baggage, but ignored my fiance (female) when she verbally asked to get her luggage. I've spoken with customer service about trying to get the full $550 flight reimbursed. They wanted to put her on another Frontier flight Friday that lays over in Denver overnight for 10 hours--which would put her getting to Austin on Saturday, 2 days after her intended arrival. Then they tried to send her to San Antonio on Frontier for a shorter layover time, then pay for a car to drive to Austin, all of this instead of just covering the Delta flight. At that point paying for rental cars and all this they may as well just cover the extra $150 flight on Delta. Bottom line: We lost $150 booking the replacement flight. We may have lost another $103 on the original flight purchase that was cancelled (we'll see if they actually refund that). Parking fees are lost A full day of the trip is wasted, a day of work was missed to sit in an airport from 1pm to 9pm. We will never fly this airline again.

### "Absolutely pathetic"
Denver to Cleveland. Absolutely pathetic. They get everyone on board. Then make them wait 45 mins while the pilot who is actually flying the plane lands a completely different aircraft on the other side of the terminal and then spends an additional hour doing his paperwork. A 2hr delay sat on the plane for absolutely no reason at all. Why the hell would they not wait to board until the pilot is on the plane or at least in the same airport? Communication was absolutely disgusting. Would never fly with Frontier again!=

### "unnecessary discomfort"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Frontier ever again. The seats are a preformed hard plastic and don't recline. My back is still (after 3 weeks), hurting me. There's no snacks or drinks unless you want to pay $2.99 for a can of soda. And the serving tray is so small. You also pay for your seat. We sat towards the back, so ours were $6.00 each and the same when we changed planes. ($24.00 total). Everyone must of bought the cheap tickets because the pilot came out 3 times saying the "plane was off balance" and people had to move around. You can bring only one tiny carry on, which HAS to fit under the seat in front of you and  if you use the overhead storage it's $45.00. You are so squeezed in together that after 7 hours of flying, your shoulders are in a permanent squeezed position. I'm giving Frontier Airlines a #1 rating, because even though the staff were very kind, and the pilot got us to our destination alive, it doesn't make up for the horrible and I believe unnecessary discomfort.

### "attendants were pleasant"
Cincinnati to Orlando. Returned home from Orlando to Columbus. Both flights were on schedule. The staff was efficient and cordial. The planes were clean and flight attendants were pleasant, wore smiles. I felt safe. .I would suggest neck rests.

### "forced to buy a new flight"
Austin to Detroit. I’m not going to try to be polite or professional because clearly this airline knows nothing about either. I have traveled over 30 countries and 20 states and have been on hundreds of flights. That being said, never in my entire life have I ever had two worse travel experiences than the only two times I have booked with Frontier. Both times I have had to spend hundreds of dollars out of my pocket to buy a new flight from a different airline because Frontier had canceled the flight without even a 12 hours notice. Not only is the money an issue, but the stress, time, and energy to find a new route within moments notice while trying to check in, has been immense. The employees were of no help, and neither was customer service on the phone. I felt as though the employees did not care about any of the passengers needs at all and only gave responses that would make people leave them alone. I was offered a travel voucher for Frontier, which is absolutely the last thing I would ever want. I will never contemplate buying another ticket with Frontier. I had to spend $498.20 on a new flight this last time, with a very superior and well organized airline, Delta. I highly recommend spending the extra money on a Delta flight first time around. It's worth it. Plus, in circumstances like mine, you're going to be forced to buy a new flight anyways so may as well choose any airline besides Frontier. Low fares, done terribly wrong. We are a scam" should be their new slogan

### "my luggage was lost"
Atlanta to Ontario. With Frontier Airlines you get what you pay for. No complimentary refreshments. Cabin staff had good customer service. My only complaint is that my luggage was lost. Actually my luggage and a gentleman that was on the same flight. I had to wait 30 minutes just to talk to someone about my lost luggage. One of the employees finally came out and said that they would contact me once found. He stated that it probably was taken off the plane during my layover instead of staying on the plane and traveling with my to my finally destination. I got my luggage the next day and was told that I would have received it sooner had the employee written my address down correctly. That night I had no clean clothes for myself or my two year old daughter.

### "absolute worst airline"
Denver to Providence. Pretty much the worst. 30 min to drop off bags, website wasn’t working, seats are uncomfortable and don’t recline. Also we left late on both legs. On the way back we sat in the middle of the tarmac for 30 min waiting for a plane to back out of the gate so we could go in. This was also at 12:45am (an hour late). Also their tray tables and seat pockets are so tiny. I’ve flown a tonne and this is by far the absolute worst airline. Definitely worst than spirit. Never again!

### "definitely fly with them again"
Austin to New Orleans. I was nervous about flying with Frontier Airlines after seeing some negative reviews about their customer service, but the price was great for a last minute flight so I risked it. Every staff member I can into contact with was positive and helpful and the flight was on time and comfortable. I had no problems and would definitely fly with them again.

### "experience a trip from hell"
Chicago to Las Vegas. Let me start by saying, I have had no issues with trips on Frontier from Chicago to Colorado. Apparently, if going from Chicago to and from Las Vegas, you will experience a trip from hell. On my way out there, my flight was delayed repeatedly. I can't blame Frontier for weather, as it was storming in Chicago, and Sam did everything he could to not only get us rebooked, but feed us and give us travel vouchers for future flights. On my way back was a nightmare. We got checked in at the airport after midnight on a red-eye and from the time it took for us to walk through security to the gate, we arrived at the gate to find out the flight had been cancelled. The way we found out was through an email stating that Frontier was sorry to have to change our plans, but here is $200 in flight vouchers. Our first question was, "What changes? We went into the Frontier app and saw the flight had been cancelled. The airport flight boards had not even been updated. Apparently, everyone scrambled to get rebooked, and the soonest we could get rebooked with no additional costs to us was 2 days later on another red-eye. We were handed letters at the gate letting us know that we had a couple options...rebook on Frontier and they would give us $200 flight vouchers, get a refund on our flight and rebook with Frontier on a later flight and we'd get $200 plus $500 in flight vouchers, or book a flight on a different carrier and they'd reimburse us up to $400 for the flight/rental car expenses, plus give us $200 in flight vouchers. It was Labor Day weekend, so flights on short notice through other carriers were upwards of $800. That is $400 more than I would get reimbursed by Frontier, so we took the flight on 9/4. A different nightmare involving the Tropicana Hotel commenced after we left the airport, but that is another story. At least we had the forethought to book a hotel room to cover us through when the next flight left Tuesday morning, in case this one was also cancelled. That flight started out much like the other one: delayed from 12:59 AM to 2:10 AM. At least this time, we stayed in our hotel until we absolutely had to go to the airport. We ended up sitting at the airport for about an hour before the flight eventually left at 2:15 AM. I am not surprised about how bad this trip was, as most airlines like Frontier and Spirit are notorious for this kind of run-around, however, I was shocked that we had to call repeatedly to Frontier to find out if they would cover the lodging and food charges we've incurred from having to stay 2 extra days longer than we had intended since they cancelled the flight. The other thing that annoyed me was that in order for us to submit a claim to our credit card company to try to get reimbursed for travel expenses, Frontier would need to supply a letter stating that Mechanical Failure or 1 of 4 other approved reasons were why the flight was cancelled before we could get money back from the trip protection provided on our credit card. We've submitted claims to Frontier to see if we'll get any more money back from them, but I'm not holding my breath. I'll update my review if/when it gets resolved. That said, I haven't put Frontier on my do-not-fly list, due to the ease of at least 4 trips to Colorado, but I definitely won't fly them anywhere but Colorado which is their home base.

### "Definitely worth going elsewhere"
Denver to Seattle. Our flight was scheduled for 1630 and has been delayed to 2000. The delay is not worth saving the extra money. Beyond that, they charge you for all bags (except personal items), seats, and anything else you do. Definitely worth going elsewhere.

### "Both flights were delayed"
Las Vegas to Portland via Denver. Most incompetent airline ever! 3rd time flying Frontier, definitely the last, and they won't care in the slightest. They can't even have a flight crew ready to go. Both flights were delayed because of missing flight crew.

### "Awful, terrible airline"
Awful, terrible airline. I fly 1-3 times per month, using a variety of airlines, and Frontier is the most unprofessional, and unconcerned that they're screwing up regularly. It is not worth it to just to save a few bucks. They are cheap for a reason, and from many experiences, I can almost assure that you'll be disappointed. Again, this is based on my experiences from many different flights I've taken with Frontier (and comparing to many other airlines I fly with regularly).

### "Will never fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Kansas City to San Francisco. We had a personal emergency the day before our flight and tried to use our travel insurance to cancel the flight. Well, we found out that travel insurance covers things like natural disasters and terrorist attacks, but does not actually enable you to cancel the flight like the marketing suggests. With crazy baggage fees (have to pay for carry on as well as checked bags) our ticket ended up not being the great deal we thought it would be. On top of that, to cancel the flight so they can sell the seat, there's a $99 fee just to give you a small partial credit that has to be used within 90 days. When I called in, customer service was rude, condescending and totally dismissive. Reading from a script - it's like speaking with a robot. Wish I would have read reviews before booking and wasting my money. We have a newborn so we definitely can't afford. Will never fly Frontier.

### "never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled and the unhelpful employee at the front counter through a piece of paper at me with directions on rebooking with another airline. He offered no help whatsoever. Of course rebooking our flight on another airline cost us 1000 to rebook. They gave us vouchers which only covered 800 of it. So because of them I am out an extra 200 plus dollars. Will never fly them again. Terrible service.

### "kept delaying our flight"
Chicago to Orlando. My family's vacation was all screwed up because Frontier kept delaying our flight out from Chicago to Orlando. Happened 3x before they canceled the flight 6hrs prior to departure time. They rebooked us on a flight the next day that literally left us only 10hrs of a stay at our hotel before we had to leave for our cruise. I had to rebook our hotel and car rental because of their canceled flight. Had I booked the flight the day before our cruise and all this happened, we would've missed our entire cruise. Then they give a voucher for $200 pp as an incentive - so I'm looking at flights to Vegas. They only offer a straight flight at 9:30pm or midnight and everything else took 20hrs to get there - like what airline would send you to Boston from Chicago before you fly to Vegas? And 20hrs?!?! I'm only going halfway across the country, not the world. When we arrived at Orlando, one of our luggages didn't make it on our flight because it got mixed up with another one - I go to customer service at MCO and how about this lady told us our luggage will arrive the next day in the evening. At this point, I lost my Jesus because our cruise was the next day and she couldn't do anything about it. Another thing, every airline I've used would have your checked luggage on the belt right where you get your tickets. Not Frontier - you have to walk to a separate area with your luggage. Employees are as dry as can be with the exception of 1 flight attendant. The only positive about my entire experience is the pilot on our way back to Chicago from Orlando - best landing ever and he got us thru a storm.

### "wouldn’t help with anything"
Providence to Myrtle Beach. Had the enjoyable experience of finding out just how little Frontier values there customers this past Labor Day weekend. My return flight from Myrtle Beach to Providence was cancelled (which I see they do all the time) becuase of “enviromental damage” which Frontier explained to me was likely caused from hail. Because that issue was deemed “out of their control” they only gave me two options, reimbursement or rebooking. Rebooking my flight would be fine, but they dont fly often enough so they expected me to stay another two nights away from home before they could get me on a flight. They wouldn’t help me find another non-Frontier flight home, they wouldn’t help me find a place to stay for the two nights, they wouldnt’t help me rent a car so I could get around, they wouldn’t help with anything. The reimbursement option was a joke as well, as I had paid 286.95 for my flight, and they were only willing to give $83 back. Truly pathetic customer service. Never fly with this airline, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. An extra $100 or so is worth it to avoid this mess.

### "wouldn't recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Nothing to eat or drink unless you have a debit or credit card. No room in the most uncomfortable seats ever made. They are hard, tiny, and painful to sit on for a cross country flight. But, the worst part is that after paying to check one bag, they lost it. So now I'm sitting in Utah almost 2000 miles from home with no clothes, medicine, hygiene products, dress and shoes for my daughters wedding and my daughters wedding veil. And now trying to reach someone by phone to find my bag is a joke. I wouldn't recommend this airline.

### "flight was completely cancelled"
Colorado Springs to Minneapolis. We were delayed going to Minneapolis by over 4 hours due to some malfunction on the plane. (I’m thankful they were taking precautions to keep all of us safe.) But then our flight was completely cancelled on the way back with less than 12 hours notice. They didn’t have any other flights going to CO for days! I was forced to use another airline to get home and spent twice as much on a last minute one way ticket as I did on the original round trip ticket with Frontier. I was not impressed. Saving a few bucks on my original ticket ended up causing me a lot. Live and learn I guess. Another thing that should be noted is their “trip protection”. In May of this year I booked tickets for my mom and dad to come to town for the birth of my son. I brought trip protection in case baby decided to come early. At the time my husband was deployed and I had 4 other small children at home, so it was important and necessary for my parents to be there to help me out. I ended up needing them earlier but I found out that the trip protection offered (that I purchased!) is only for certain emergencies and apparently helping a deployed spouse give birth is not one of those emergencies. Ridiculous. So I had to buy my parents new tickets and got a very small amount refunded to me for the other tickets.

### "endless hours waiting"
If you are looking for an airline that will delay/cancel, require you to spend endless hours waiting, to finally put you on a plane, keep you there for a long period, only to have you get off, wait in terminal, then again board, wait more than 30 min on runway, with no compensation, this is the airline for you! My all in delay time was 14 hours! While I watched all other airlines have zero issues leaving the airport. Only positive: the overwhelmed staff were super friendly despite the barrage of upset passenger's.

### "won't fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Omaha to Las Vegas. This trip to Vegas was booked months in advance (it would of been my first time there.) The day of the flight, we arrived 2 hours prior, had our baggage fees already paid (did so the day before on the app), we checked our luggage and went on our way through security, to the gate. The plane arrived on time to take us, those passengers de-boarded rather quickly and before I knew it, it was time to board. Which is a pretty quick process. Everyone got on, they did the usual security and safety stuff. We belted up, and the plane moved backwards about 15 feet. And stopped. We then find out there's an issue. So we wait, and wait. After about 45 mins were all asked to de board, and take our stuff. Never a good sign. We then wait again. About 2 hours. Flight cancelled. We are now responsible for re booking on another airline, and they will "refund" us up to $400.00. What? Last minute tickets were over $800 a piece. Really? So we were spending an additional $800, after refund, for a trip we already paid for. We also had the option to be fully refunded - and cancel our trip. Seeing as we couldn't get out of Omaha to Vegas for the next few days, and only had 4 days for this trip due to work schedules, we opted to cancel. Super disappointing. But really? These are you only options? How about re-booking your customers at your cost? None of us were late for the flight. None of us caused the plane issues. We were all in accordance of your policies. But we get punished by having to spend even more? What about the kids flying solo? What happened to them? I'm not even upset there was an issue with the plane. Things happen, I get it. What i'm upset with is the absolute lack of integrity and customer service. Once the flight was cancelled, it seemed Frontier washed their hands of us. The "It's not my problem" attitude from all levels is disgusting to me. We had to go out of our way to get our money back. Why isn't this done immediately? We took the time to fill out all forms online and submit them, it wasn't until someone, with Frontier, responded back to our FB message. (YES! FaceBook message - as you can not get anyone on the phone) with a response on our next steps - and this was 6-7 days later. You have to beg them for your money back, but they had no issues taking it right away when booking, or paying the ridiculous checked bag and carry on fees. We also received $500 in vouchers a piece that I could care less about since we wont use them, but they act like that's a gift from them to us. I've had flights cancel on other airlines before, but never have I had an experience like this. Hey Frontier, here's some advise, if this is how you're going to do business and how you're going to treat people, put a disclaimer on your website that if the flight cancels we are responsible for re-booking at our cost. Reading these reviews, its a very common thing. I won't fly Frontier again. And I still haven't been to Vegas, as I used all my vacation time for this trip, just to see the inside of the airport, that's in the same town I live in. Thanks for nothing Frontier.

### "nickle and dimed to death"
Not Verified |  Phoenix to Colorado Springs. If you enjoy being nickle and dimed to death, this is the airline for you. You pay for everything beyond the right to sit in the most uncomfortable seat imaginable. Pre-selecting a seat, carry-on bag, checked bag, any kind of food or drink (except tap water) all require an extra fee. And God forbid you should decide to choose a seat or bring a bag after you book, you get the great privilege of paying extra. Strangely enough, at least for my flight, it was cheaper to check a bag than bring a carry-on bag.The closer you are to the plane, the more you pay. If you want one of the "stretchy" seats you pay $20 when you book, $25 after you book, and $50 once you're on the plane. I'm only 5' tall and I've never before felt that I needed more legroom until my flight on Frontier. My experience was so bad that for my return flight, I'm considering booking on a different airline even though it will cost more even after adding in the fees. The customer service wasn't too bad. But nothing else is worth a nickle.

### "was not worth it"
Frontier should instead be named "Front Me More" $$$ and time. Not worth in stress what you think you may be saving. First time with Frontier "Front Me More". I was so excited to get a direct flight RT so cheap, but was not worth it, in deceptive $$ grab, time wasted, and sheer rudeness of Frontier "Front Me More" airline personnel. Wow, you get no carry-on. And there are Third Reich measurements for your one allotted personal item (it has to be kid sized backpack). When you try to Check in 24 hrs in advance with actual seat assignment they charge you. There are no options for free seat assignments on the pick a seat menu, they didn't appear until a few hours before flight time. When you go to the application it keeps saying application needs more info and it repopulates to: 1) Bundle and pay $$ + 2) Pick seat for $12 or $18 + 3) Carry-on for $30+. Stressful. And when I finally was able to get a seat number and tried to save the boarding pass as a PDF (they don't email it like the other airlines) the PDF barcode was jacked up. When I got to security line I tried to regenerate it with a clear barcode. and you guessed it, right back to Front me some more $$ application. Had to go back to Frontier Front Me More Money counter because of the boarding pass issue. More stress and rudeness. Non-stop was supposed to leave at 7 am and since it was the first flight in the morning you would think it would be on time. Wrong again. Front Me More tells all passengers to board over half hour before scheduled flight time (0630) plane late to depart yet another hour (8 am). Do a Layover through a different more reliable airline. A 7 am direct flight of 2 hrs and 15 minutes, when you add 30 minutes sitting on closed doors and forced boarding (06.30) and another hour stuck on plane delay to scheduled time (8 am) that is almost 4 hours total. No time savings from the other airlines with Dallas layover. Check the Travel sites. Frontier sucks at reliable departures. That along with rude Airline personnel and deceptive online money grabs and 24 hour Check in practices are why Frontier should be renamed "Front Me More" ($$, Rudeness, Time).

### "seats were very bare"
Denver to Seattle. The airline advertises cheap prices but charges for bags. I suppose it’s nice to to have the option to just bring your person and go cheaply. The seats were very bare. Think riding a city bus. I couldn’t figure out how to lean my seat back, and the tray table was effectively useless. It is a change from other flights I took with them years ago. But I think they went a different model. Anyway, If you are looking to bring anything with you, I would look else where for a trip.

### "a pretty bad experience"
Calgary to Salt Lake City via Denver. With the understanding that this would be an "economy" experience, I took my first (and last) flight on Frontier airlines. While I expected less leg room and not much by the way of entertainment, my experience was damaged by inconvenient booking, the barrage of "nickel and dime" expenses, and the disregard for any actual schedule. While booking my flight online, I had to call Frontier as it would not allow me to purchase a ticket with a connecting flight to SLC that did not require sleeping in the airport overnight. Long story short, after being on hold for 25 minutes, I was told I had to purchase each leg of my flight separately. So, I had to pay twice as much in taxes and fees to avoid an overnight layover, even though a much more convenient layover (1 hour) was available. From the time I booked my flight I had to navigate through the constant calls to upgrade and spend more. On the flight itself (delayed 45 minutes), the flight attendants were terse at best, drily suggesting to the packed flight that an exit row seat could be available for a $50 upgrade. During the flight, the flight attendant gave a loud, "hard-sell" pitch for a Frontier credit card that lasted at least 20 excruciating minutes. This was a late-night flight with crying babies trying to rest, and the sales pitch was simply unbearable. I felt like was trapped in a timeshare sales event. Knowing I could possibly miss my next flight to SLC, I sprinted to the gate and barely got on the plane in time, only for the plane to sit at the gate for 45 minutes. With no time to eat, drink, or use the bathroom, I was hungry, thirsty and uncomfortable. How unfortunate that even a snacks or drinks are several dollars each. While I know Frontier isn't responsible for the two crying babies near me, the large guy "manspreading" into my space, or the terrible turbulence, these things, combined with the delays, aggressing selling, and poor service, made for a pretty bad experience.

### "I would fly with them again"
Raleigh  to Syracuse . My first time ever flying. Frontier was not bad at all. Ive seen a lot of negative reviews but dont like to judge until Ive tried it for myself. Everything was fairly easy for me. I did not have to check in through the long line. I checked in through my phone and had my boarding pass already. I had a personal bag and that was free. Seat was not bad and i had a lot of leg room since Im only 5'2. Ride was smooth. The only thing I can agree on is the customer service phone number take forever to pick up. The trays were small, but I barely used it so it didnt matter. There is no complimentary snacks or drinks except for water. You have to pay for carry-on per trip. There was a delay but thats normal. For the flight being only an hour and 30 mins, I didnt need snacks. I made my trip simple. Overall, I would fly with them again.

### "cheap is not worth it"
Not Verified |  Detroit to Orlando. Worst airline ever! Our flight was delayed an hour then 2 hour then 4 hour then 6 hours because of maintenance. Our flight was supposed to leave at 2:13pm. We left at 8:30pm, all they did was give us 15 dollars for food. You can't get a meal at the airport for 15 dollars. Frontier Airlines don't care about you and they they don't have extra planes. Flying cheap is not worth it.

### "Not worth it"
Not Verified |  Dallas to Denver. Not worth it. You really do get what you pay for with Frontier. This is the 5th flight, maybe more, that it has been delayed. We should up 2 hours early, to wait 4 hours more. Our flight was set to leave at 5:24AM and it still hasn't left yet. Its supposedly leaving at 9:30AM now. I call customer care, no reason given and no apology or compensation. I should be home.

### "zero support from customer service"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Las Vegas. The most horrible flight experience I had was with Frontier airline, horrible customer service and inconsistent departure time. Never ever fly with Frontier Airlines again. They revised the flight 8 times and made us rush to airport for early departure and then flight delayed for 5 hrs. Please stay away from this airline! These people should learn to respect people’s time and know how to address customer’s concerns! We recived zero support from their customer service after all the changes they made to our travel time!

### "Do not send kids alone with this airline"
Do not send kids alone with Frontier Airlines, especially if they don’t have a way to communicate with you. They charge a lot and they didn’t bring my son to the area to pick up the kids (Meeting area). My son is old enough to call me and that is how a knew he was waiting for me in front of the gate. It took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to him and when I got there nobody was with him or ask me for an ID, I just walked out with him.

### "very reasonably priced"
Raleigh to Houston. Ticket was very reasonably priced. The plane was clean and boarding was organized well. The staff was friendly and courteous and the pilot and flight attendants greated passengers with a smile as we left. It was my first time flying Frontier and I will definitely fly with them again.

### "treated with disrespect"
Los Angeles to Atlanta. My children and I were treated with the utmost disrespect at the ticket counter in Los Angeles. We have no learned this is a common issue in this area. My advice is save yourself the hassle, pay the extra cost and fly with an airline that believes in creating a positive, fun experience and environment. My children and I will never forget this day.

### "the flight was canceled"
Denver to Tampa. After a 3 hour delay the flight was canceled, I get it. But I was then told I could fly out in two days, nope that flight was over booked and we got set back another day. The night of the canceled flight, the people at the ticket counter were rude, condescending and of No help! One lady had No clue what she was doing and the guy I spoke to was an ass. We were told we could pay for another flight on another airline but, wouldn't get our refunds for 7 days. They acked like everything was going to be ok because they gave us vochers Only to be used with Frontier, so we shouldn't be mad. Keep your vouchers, I will Never fly frontier again..Ever! Their customer service is absolutely awful, the seats are uncomfortable and nasty. I dont understand how they stay in business! The money you may save using them is Not worth the hassle, rudeness or discomfort at all!

### "By far the worst airline"
Columbus to Salt Lake City via Austin. By far the worst airline I have ever flown with. Our first flight to salt lake was supposed to leave on Aug 19th and got cancelled. Our next flight was scheduled for the 21st and we actually made it on board and sat there for over an hour before they cancelled it. The ticket counter lady basically told us to go to hell, the $400 per person we were supposed to get didn't work, and once again there were no more flights going out that night! When we booked different flights through another airline on the website we were told to use, it only booked my husbands ticket and not mine, but still marked the seats I was supposed to have as taken so I can't sit next to him on the way home. I could get into the work I missed because of this, but that's another story entirely..

### "never fly on Frontier again"
Raleigh Durham to Providence. I will never fly on Frontier Airlines again. Last flight was delayed for 8 hours. We finally got on the plane but had to exit the plane so they could work on it. That took another hour. Should have drove and save some time and money. I book another flight with them to give them another chance. That was a big mistake. I went through Expedia were my flight is with a real airline. My return trip is with Frontier airlines which was a big mistake. You have to pay for your bags before you get to the airport or you will pay up to $60 per bag. Online is only $30 but there is nowhere to purchase the bags. So I signed up with Frontier and got there app for my phone. Only took me three days to find out where I can purchase my bags. The web site was made by a third grader. Every time I tried to log in it wouldn’t take my email and password so I had to reset my password. The web site is very confusing. Now I had to pay $38 for my bag. I hope this helps.

### "I will never fly them again"
San Diego to Pittsburgh. By far the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. We flew in to San Diego for a week with a round way ticket and when we were supposed to be flown home the flight was randomly cancelled and we weren’t alerted until two hours before, by which time we had already traveled to the airport to check in. When we went up to check our bag(which cost 75$ to check) and get our boarding passes, they told us the flight was cancelled, not delayed, but cancelled, because of “lightening storms”. Ironically, other planes from different airlines were still flying to the same location the same day and time. How funny! We tried to talk to someone at the front desk and they wouldn’t give us any help. They told us the only options frontier was providing was rebook or refund. The next flight home to Pittsburgh on frontier wasn’t until two days later, they told us. They wouldn’t refund our entire round trip flight, only the “unused portion of our ticket”. They weren’t able to help us get another flight on a different airline and they were not willing to help us in the slightest. It was outrageous. They also weren’t going to pay for us to stay in San Diego another two days. We went to book the flight for Wednesday, two days later, to get home but, who knew, there was no space! They told us we could fly out Thursday instead. We go to book it and there’s not enough space. We are told that our only option is to stay until Friday! An extra four days! Stranded! We had lives to get back to! So what we ended up having to do was by last minute flights on other airlines and it ended up costing us almost an extra four thousand dollars to get home! And they couldn’t even refund our entire ticket. Despicable, and I will never fly them again.

### "delayed and then cancelled"
Just when I thought it couldn't get worse with this airline, my first official flight with Frontier was from San Diego to Denver. It was delayed 5 hours and not one person was accommodating or helpful while we continue to get the run around as to why we couldn't fly. Flash forward to today, my flight from Denver to San Diego got delayed for over 2 hrs and then cancelled. There was no compensation due the plane being struck by lightening. I was forced to pay $460 to book another airline just so I could get home to my son. The next available flight...2 days away. I will never use Frontier again!

### "I am very pleased so far"
Raleigh Durham to LAX via Kansas City / Denver. Have flown the first 2 legs of my trip today and my first time on Frontier. Both of my flights were on time and serviced as promised. Yes they nickel and dime you for extras but if you don’t need them, why pay for them? I am very pleased so far. I have 2 more trips on Frontier within the next month. I will review those too for consistency.

### "worst airline experience"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. This is the worst airline experience i ever had. My flight time was 12.15 pm but I am still in the flight waiting. The pilot says they have no idea about the delay it can be 6 - 8 hrs. Worst is that they made us sit inside the airline for more than an hour now. The staff and very rude anddont even provide food and water. They are charging for water even after delaying the flight for so many hours. The ac was not working properly so the pilot says close down your window shade and rest coz the temperatures are 107 degree outside. They didn't lower the ac temperatures. Bottomline is we are still waiting for our flight to take off as I am writing this review. Just now they announced that passengers should take another flight and they have no idea when they will fly. Attached are some pictures of passengers leaving the flight.

### "still have had no response"
We had a fight booked from San Jose to Denver on June 28, 2018, due to depart at 11.08am. On the morning of the flight we were sent a message that the flight was delayed by several hours. When we did arrive at the airport, we were then told the flight had been cancelled and that Frontier had no plans to fly that route now for 3 days. Counter staff were not very helpful, directing us to a 1800 number, where the menus offered did not match our circumstances. Eventually we were given a printed sheet that said the airline would offer us a refund or $400 per person towards the cost of an alternate flight with another airline for the same route within 24 hours. Eventually we were able to secure seats on SouthWest Airlines for a flight 5 hours later. I submitted the request for refund on 9 July, which was acknowledged by an Auto-response giving me a Reference number and promising a follow up email as well as a check for reimbursement to be mailed within 30 days. So far I have heard nothing by email or post. As it is very difficult to find a number to call, I posted a request on the FlyFrontier page on 15 August and still have had no response.

### "They canceled my flight"
Orlando to Las Vegas. Horrible airline! They canceled my flight without emailing us. We get to the airport and the next flight is in 48 hours. No help trying to reroute you because an employee told me they are a discounted airline so have no obligation to reroute or provide hotel stay. Supposedly The reason was not controllable because the crew timed out due to the cancellation of prior Colorado Springs flight due to weather. I honestly don’t know what weather could be end of July. Very unreliable. We had to get home so paid $2700. Frontier refunded our original $1000 but still out of pocket $1700. I heard this happens all the time. Try to save money and ends up costing you just as much as first class on a reliable airline

### "Worst airline I've had to fly with"
Not Verified |  Denver to Providence. Worst airline I've had to fly with. Prices are good but that's about it. The last three flights I've had with them, there has been some issue that warranted a delay. I understand that things happen, but it seems like it's more of the rule rather than the exception here. I'm really broke so I'll more than likely have to deal with their ineptitude another time. If you can afford a slightly more expensive ticket, do it. Avoid Frontier if at all possible.

### "one excuse after another"
Not Verified |  Raleigh to Houston. I will never fly Frontier again. I understand there can be difficulties but today was a disaster. Instead of leaving us sitting in the lobby they decided to board all of us onto the plane and leave us sitting for 2 hours. And gave us one excuse after another. Two hours later we arrive at our destination to delayed again. Never again

### "Do not fly Frontier"
We had a nonstop flight booked to leave Milwaukee on Aug 10th at 5:30 am and arrive in Denver by 7:07am. After arriving at the airport at least 1.5 hours prior to our departure time (as recommended by Frontier) we received an email alert that our flight was delayed until 8 am. As we slept at the airport, we received another email alerting us that we were awaiting the arrival of a plane from Denver and we would not be leaving until early afternoon. The airline gave each customer a $10 food voucher for 8 hours of our time! Wow! We remained optimistic that the airline was just having a bad day and chalked it up to “better safe than sorry”, and our return flight would be fine. NOT! We were scheduled to leave Denver in August 17th at 8:07 pm, arriving in Milwaukee at 11:28pm. We received the email alert that our flight was delayed after we had already returned our car rental, stranding us at the airport for 5 hours. This time we received a voucher for $15. Fellow passengers shared stories of missed weddings, needing to purchase rental cars as a result of the delay etc.., When we were finally called, the hostess told all of us that if we didn’t Board in 30 minutes, the flight staff would “time out” and the flight would be cancelled; inferring that it would be on us, if the flight got cancelled, adding to everyone’s, already high, stress. I pray that we take off and don’t get cancelled and want to warn everyone. Do not fly Frontier, this seems to be very typical business for them.

### "a joke of an airline"
Denver to Minneapolis. This airline is a joke. We were three hours late, had to switch planes and they lost my bag. I understand that things may not go smoothly and I was fine until they lost my bag. They cannot even contact MSP to get them to pick up the phone to see if it came in. I am not getting my bag back anytime soon. Going to a wedding and I have nothing. These things take time”. That is what I was told, a no wonder. Frontier cannot even call Frontier and get someone to answer the phone. What a joke of an airline. Never again!

### "it is not worth the trouble"
I was scheduled to depart from Memphis and arrive in Orlando, and Frontier made my experience hell on earth! I was already dissatisfied that I had to pay for my carry on and on top of that the plane was delayed. I sat at the airport for 3 hours before anyone at Frontier informed us why we were waiting. 2 hours later we were told the flight was canceled! They were completely unprofessional and disorganized. Before the flight was canceled there were Frontier employees walking around, laughing and not doing anything . Once the flight was canceled they all disappeared and only one lady stay to help the hundreds of upset passengers. They said the would send of a voucher which I never received. Lucky I got ahold of someone in corporate who was able to book me another flight with a different airline (Sign of relief). Never will I ever recommend or fly with frontier again. Yes it’s cheap but it is not worth the trouble! Especially if you are pregnant or traveling with small children.

### "horrible customer service"
Austin TX to Portland OR. Like other negative reviews, our flight was cancelled a few hours before departure on our return home. There was no assistance in helping us book another flight other than to tell us we can reschedule for four days later- but with no hotel or car rental fees even if we could manage to extent our stay. We received a letter at the counter that told us we would be reimbursed for $400 per ticket - we had three tickets- but since we’ve returned, we’ve spent several very frustrating hours on the phone with the airline and have gotten nowhere. We spent nearly$1,600 to get home on another airline. We did get $200 vouchers to flight their airline, but seriously, do they think after this experience and their horrible customer service and losing so much money that we’d actually use those vouchers? Their motto: “Low fares done right,” is completely laughable! Do not use this airline! It is the worst airline out there!

### "delayed then cancelled"
Providence to Missoula via Denver. I had high hopes flying Frontier for our vacation trips from the East Coast to Montana. Our first flight into Denver was uneventful and we were pleased with our decision. My next flight going from Denver to Missoula was 2 hours late due to a plane not arriving on time. My flight from Missoula back to RI was delayed then cancelled until 2 days later. Then, that next flight was delayed 4 hours and ultimately cancelled until the following morning. I received a $200 voucher (very nice) and I did fly out the next morning (again, mechanical issues). My family then had another trip planned west. Due to leave RI at 11:30am, we didn't leave until 6pm that night and we were delayed in Denver for almost 24 hours as our connection left about 4 hours before we arrived. We each received $200 vouchers again. Now I have $800 in vouchers, but our travel is over for the year and although customer service in Denver told me they were transferable, alas, they are not. Nice gesture, but totally unusable for us. Sadly, we will not be choosing to fly with Frontier again.

### "will never fly frontier again"
My experience with Frontier was far more than disappointing, unprofessional, distasteful, and uncompassionate. Both my departing and return flight had well over 6 hour delays that left ultimately my return flight to be cancelled. I was not provided enough time to properly identify another flight that would allow me to make work, pick up my children, or even save me from spending revenue I had no intentions on spending. The voucher provided to inconvenienced flyers did not cover airfare, travel by cab, parking compensation, and hotel which should have all been taken care of by frontier. My extensive delay for my departing flight lead me to not only have to stay out of town longer because I missed a business meeting but it also caused me to lose out on a major business deal - Which I was not efficiently compensated for. I spent almost 700 additional dollars in hotels and 300 extra in a car rental while Frontier only provided close to a $250 credit. Trying to get a hold of someone in customer service on the phone is a joke and the Frontier workers lack knowledge and are extremely unprofessional. I will never fly frontier again!

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  The original flight 982 to Orlando, Fl was to depart Memphis, TN at 1150am. Yet we are still here waiting to depart and it is 3:00pm. I received the following departure notification changes of 12:55 pm, 1:35pm, 2:10pm, 2:45pm and now 3:30pm. Not only is this an inconvenience to me but I'm also traveling with an infant. Everyone knows how fussy a child can be especially waiting all day. I have spoken with one customer service agent and was informed if the flight is delayed due to mechanical issues we (everyone) on the flight would be refunded and continue with the flight since we were already checked in. Now I speak with another agent and I was told that information isn't true. They all need to be on the same program of information and they should have another airplane available to put the passengers on. I will never fly Frontier again and I will not recommend this airline to anyone. This is totally unacceptable. No backup planes and the next flight to Orlando is tomorrow. I will pay the extra expenses to avoid this.

### "Horrible, horrible airline"
Horrible, horrible airline. I should've listened when friends told me not to fly with them. Will NOT be making that mistake again. My friend and I are flying to see another friend in CO. I paid for first class seating immediately next to each other. Then two hours before our flight (which is at midnight) they just decided to cancel. Either $500 in flight vouchers (like I'd ever want to fly with them again) or we had to get on a cheesy, slow website to book our own tickets out, and they will send us a check for up to $400 for the cost. Because so many people were trying to get their flights it was a scramble to get one before it booked out. Now my friend and I arent even on the same flight, and are arriving at completely different times. We didn't even get the worst of it. An elderly lady got stranded due to their apathy and selfishness, since she couldn't afford the $400 upfront and was thousands of miles away from home.

### "They were uncaring"
Not Verified |  Washington to Reno via Denver. They cancelled my flight a few hours prior to departure and would not protect me on another airline. Their next flight was 2 days later, so that wasn't an option. (They said they don't have an agreement with any other airline.) So my last minute booking on another airline cost me an extra $300 and I got home 6 hours later. Was travelling with a new puppy, which made it more difficult for me. My careful planning was for naught. They were uncaring to boot. Never again.

### "Do not fly Frontier!"
Denver to San Francisco. Do not fly Frontier!! I had a flight from Denver, CO to San Francisco, CA before heading to Thailand. My flight to San Francisco was delayed because of lack of cabin crew which they had to fly in  from another state. Because of this, I missed my flight to Thailand and had to purchase another ticket. First off, I called once and the woman said they could issue a voucher, but I had to go to the ticket counter. At this point I was going to security to go to my new flight abroad. Upon arriving to the ticket counter at SFO, the manager told me I needed to call again to get approval. On this call, she informed me I could only get a $50 travel voucher because my flight was only delayed a minute when it was really delayed an hour!! Don’t fly with them! It’s worth paying more to travel with more comfort and deal with nicer people who probably don’t hate their jobs.

### "seats have no padding"
Charleston to Trenton. First time flying with this airline and it will be our last. Our flight had a few delays - first was 30 minutes because the arriving flight was delayed then another 30 minutes because they wouldn’t allow a customer to fly with his medically supplied breathing machine (he flew to CHS from TTN via Frontier and now they are denying him). Once we were finally on board we sat on the plane for an hour and a half while they repaired a hinge on a water door. After complaining about the wait on the plane and most passengers were hungry they finally gave us one free granola bar to eat. This airline has no complimentary snacks or drinks. We finally arrived 2 hours late. I had to cancel my rental car because they closed before I could get there. Had to use a vehicle not roomy enough for a family of 5 for an eight drive the next morning. They only offered $25 off on my next flight. Also the seats have no padding compared to other airlines and they charge for carry on luggage. Also, our return flight home was delayed by 30 minutes. Never again will I use this airline.

### "By far the worst airline"
Washington to Phoenix. By far the worst airline, not only is the aircraft older but the flight attendants even though the uniform is very posh/professional they have bad attitudes. One customer asked for a blanket, the attendant was rude and answered very quickly "we don't have blankets" not unfortunately, I am sorry we don't have blankets-- mind you this is after a 2 hour boarding delay full of drama! The incoming flight that got off the plane had all kind of drama causing my flight boarding delay and the previous pilot got off that plane with a stressed out appearance! There was no order of conduct with boarding and the lady that announced the boarding detail was foreign and hard to understand. I was on a straight flight to Phoenix however the plane stopped in Denver to pick up more people and I stayed on the plane the attendants were rude and rushing; I could barely get to the restroom. This airline is outdated, no internet, no inflight entertainment, no snacks free of charge, unfriendly, uncomfortable, dirty. I would not recommend them, I would suggest spending a few more dollars for a piece of mind. This was also my children first experience flying I will never pay for tickets and fly with this airline again.

### "cancelled with no notice"
My flight from Savannah to Philadelphia was cancelled with no notice whatsoever and no stated ability to get me on another plane. The money involved in the flight was not the only loss. I'm missing a friend's departure completely. The manager was unsympathetic and unaccommodating. Frontier was the only airline to choose not to fly out due to weather on the east coast and they still refused to pay to transfer the passengers with immediate needs to Americans Airlines, which had seats available. Some of the other passengers had to be at work tomorrow, while one woman was hosting an entire conference tomorrow night. The soonest they offered to get us there was Wednesday, flying out from other states. Do not fly with this airline. They do not have the connections to help you get from one place to another when their airline falls short. I've cancelled all of my plans, some without refunds, and filled out this review, all while on hold with Frontier's customer service.

### "next flight was 4 days later"
Jacksonville to San Jose via Austin. Our flight from Jacksonville got delayed. We landed in Austin, TX 10 minutes after the scheduled departure time for the second leg of the flight (also with Frontier Airlines). We were 10 passengers. Frontier Airlines did not wait for us. The next available flight out of Austin to San Jose was four (4) days later. All the other flights were full so they could not confirm us for earlier flights. We had no choice but to but to spend night at Austin, Tx and buy tickets with other airline the next day. Frontier will not compensate us for the hotel or other airline and they expected us to stay in Austin at our expense for four days. If you are retired and have money to spend on hotel/motel then go with Frontier. They will depart from the "origin" but will there is no guarantee that you will reach your destination in time.

### "fly with another airline"
Sacramento to Denver. Worst airline ever -  avoid flying with Frontier, I have flown with a lot of airlines and Frontier has to be the worst, Spirit is even better than Frontier. On a recent trip Frontier managed to lose both our car seats on both flights from Denver to Sacramento and back again. How do you lose car seats I asked the baggage attendant" her response, "Well they are just another bag. You tell that to a 4 and 5 year old at 2:00 in the morning, when we should have had them 3 hours earlier. I know Frontier is cheaper, but you get what you pay for, fly with another airline.

### "Worst experience ever"
Austin to Reno. Would never recommend this airline to anyone! Such a terrible experience and horrible customer service. Stuff missing out of my bag, unzipped and stuff was falling out and broken luggage. To broke to afford to staff their beverage cart and the dirtiest plane I’ve ever seen. Worst experience ever.

### "the worst customer service"
Cedar Rapids to Denver. My flight was cancelled 3 hours before it was supposed to take off, due to mechanical problems. Although, the same airplane was still able to fly it’s later flight. After being on hold for an hour and half I was told that the next flight wasn’t going to be until Thursday (my flight was Monday). I then had to speak to a supervisor because the first agent didn’t help at all. I was put on another flight the next day and that flight was late. I got no reimbursement even though I was out of work for a day. Please do yourselves a favor and never expect that frontier will make it right when they screw you out of a flight home. They are unreliable and they have the worst customer service.

### "please avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Atlanta to Los Angeles. Frontier Airline is the most disgusting and unprofessional airline of them all I'm convinced. After having our flight delayed minutes before we were scheduled to board and after waiting 2 hours, we learned our flight has been canceled. Their refund policies are horrible and cover little to nothing when it comes to booking another flight. If I were you, I'd stay far away from Frontier as my family and I are not the only ones to have endured this. Also their staff is extremely unprofessional and don't even pretend to be interested in helping you figure out your issue. As I stated before, please avoid this airline. It'll save you a lot of time, money and energy.

### "attendants had awful attitudes"
Orlando to Philadelphia. Awful experience first our flight got delayed for more than 2 hours, when we finally got to board plane as soon as we got in the flight attendants had awful attitudes towards people asking questions, but what was really the worst part was the fact that every time the bathroom door was open a nasty smell would take over the whole plane. When we finally arrived 2 of the flight attendants were by the door covering their noses because they couldn’t handle the smell either.

### "waiting for the Pilot"
Orlando to Las Vegas. We were schedule to fly at 6:00 am and it’s 7:40 am and we were told we are waiting for the Pilot - really? We woke up at 2:45 am to be on time for our flight, have reservations and a driving trip in our destination and who cares, right? This is my second and last time booking a flight with Frontier Airlines. Pathetic airline.

### "definitely fly Frontier again"
Minneapolis to Trenton. Flying in and out of Trenton was a breeze! All of Frontier Airline staff were pleasant. We did have. 40 minutes weather delay on our return trip but time was made up in air and we landed within 10 minutes of our original arrival time. I would definitely fly Frontier again as well as recommend to family and friends.

### "missed the cut off to check bags"
Las Vegas to Atlanta. I don’t usually leave bad reviews, but this experience was so terrible and the customer service was so bad that I want people to know before making the mistake of booking a flight with Frontier. First, we arrived to airport and checked our bags in through the kiosk. No signs saying that if you check in at a certain time you can’t check in your bags, nothing on the kiosk saying that either. They just charge you for the check in and then tell you at the counter you missed the cut off to check bags on. The staff wont make note, even if you complain that the airline allowed you to pay the additional charge knowing you missed the cut off. Then when you call customer service they tell you they can’t refund your money for the charge because you checked them in at the kiosk and the attendant didn’t make note of it. Also, the staff on the plane was rude. It was an early flight but they all had attitudes and at this point we weren’t upset because we hadn’t realized our money would not be refunded for the bag check. We missed the cut off by 2 minutes waiting in line. The plane was freezing and the snacks that you pay for are less then adequate. The only reason we were booked on this flight was because we bought a package vacation and I figured I would give the airline a chance, even though I had not heard of it.

### "Do not recommend"
Chicago to Cancun. Service for this airline was horrible. Our flight was delayed 2 hours just for them to tell us it was cancelled. After that we had to wait over an hour and half just to retrieve our luggage. By far the worse airline I have ever taken. Do not recommend for anyone!

### "a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Kansas City to Denver. My wife and I were flying out to Vegas for my 29th birthday party, and we had flight vouchers through Frontier. We had these vouchers as the last time we fly Frontier our flight was canceled. Different day, same story. Our Friday night flight to Vegas (through Denver) was delayed to the point that our connection would be missed. At the terminal, the worker specifically told us we could receive a refund. This was a blatant lie as after the trip customer service would only allow us to receive another voucher (why would I ever want to use this). Due to the delayed flight, our options were to 1. Fly on the delayed flight, spend the night in Denver, and then fly out of Denver on Saturday at 10 pm. 2. Wait until Sunday to fly (uh, no), or receive a refund. None of these options worked as we already had hotels booked in Vegas. So, we had to purchase tickets for the next day through a new airline. Long story short, Frontiers horrible reliability and terrible customer service cost us $1,150 as we had to purchase tickets through a new airline. This is a terrible airline, a terrible company, and a terrible choice in travel.

### "the flight was canceled"
Tampa to Cincinnati. Started at Noon, waited 2 hrs for them to open the ticket area, once that was done, waited 45 min to be checked in, flight was suppose to get there 3:50 PM, was told it was a problem with the airplane, then we was told it will be 3 hrs until the piece came down from Orlando. Once the piece came they said the flight was canceled. We waited 2 more hrs for them to re book my flight. Worst airline ever.

### "Frontier is cheap for a reason"
Trenton to Raleigh Durham. My 16 year old daughter was flying alone to visit a friend. Flight delayed 4 hours because they didn’t have a crew? She was texting me while being stuck for a total of 6 hours in the airport that no one from Frontier really gave updates in a timely manner or seemed to care. They just had people sitting there for hours waiting! Also, why would they not have a crew? And if they knew they’d need a new crew, why weren’t they called in advance? Frontier is cheap for a reason! I wasn’t too happy that my 16 year old waited in an airport by herself for 6 hours! !

### "the hidden fees"
Not Verified |  Austin to Las Vegas. This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Lesson learned! Delayed getting there and delayed getting back. Sat in the plane for an extra hour after landing back in Austin and waited 1.5 hours to get my luggage. Don’t get me started about the hidden fees (want you’re seat to recline? $45 extra). I read the bad reviews before flying with them and thought “I want to experience it myself because the flight was a decent price”. Pay extra and fly else where! I there’s one review you take to heart, it’s this one.

### "a low class airline"
Orlando to Tulsa. Frontier definitely a low class airline. Dirty planes, bathrooms filthy if they are working. I had to clean my tray of dried food. Delays, delays, and you finally arrive and you have to wait on the runway because they can only afford one gate in Tulsa and that plane in gate is delayed, so we had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes. They don’t care. The steward just said “oh well call frontier”. Great way to treat your passengers!! !

### "cancelled the flight"
Cleveland to Denver. Frontier first delayed my flight by 5 hours, one hour before my flight was supposed to leave. I sat around and then they cancelled the flight. I was then put on this flight i attached and it was also delayed not due to weather frontier had overbooked they offered no apology. They then lost my luggage i then got a call that I needed To go to Denver to get my luggage and i live about an hour and a half away and was first told they could deliver. They refused i had to call cooperate where they decided to deliver the luggage at around 11:30pm at night.

### "First and last time ever"
Providence to Tampa. Flight out of Tampa was late leaving for providence. Smoke poured into cabin before takeoff. Flight attendant said it was because it was hot outside. Now flight is delayed leaving Providence. Equipment was downgraded and flight is now overbooked by 7. First and last time ever. Old saying: you get what you pay for. I will continue to travel Southwest moving forward.

### "truly a nightmare"
Las Vegas to Washington. What a nightmare! This was the first and last time I will ever fly on this airline. Four hour delay on my first flight and 2.5 hour delay on my return trip. I've been waiting over 30mins for my bags. Truly a nightmare. Never fly Frontier. Worst mistake you could ever make.

### formal complaint against Frontier"
This is a formal complaint against Frontier Airlines. We have never experienced such a disrespectful disregard as customers in all the years we have been traveling. On our return flight from Reno to Austin, our bag was lost. No one from Frontier seemed to care. The girl that does the baggage in the Austin airport was so ditzy that she ignored me when I asked her questions. The only breath of fresh air was a guy who at least took the time to call the Reno airport to find our bag as well as double check the plane. Anybody we talked to on the phone couldn't be bothered that our bag was lost. As of right now, our bag has been found but not with Frontier airlines. It was found with another airline. Our bag had no tags or stickers indicating that it was with Frontier, so the only assumption we have is that the ticket agent in the Reno airport never put a tag or sticker indicating where the bag needs to go. So because of his mistake, Frontier lost our bag. And to this today, right now, 08/06/2018 at 2:08 pm, no one from Frontier has bothered to call us about our missing bag, no one has bothered to check-in with us about our missing bag. Frontier has lost my husband and I as customers. We will never fly Frontier again. And I will make it a priority to shame Frontier airlines every chance I get.

### "My flight back was late"
San Antonio to Atlanta. Do not fly this airline. I flew from Atlanta to San Antonio on august 2nd 2018 and it was late. My flight back to Atlanta from San Antonio was late. I flew back on the 5th of August. I will pay extra to fly Delta, Southwest, American, or any known name airline

### "too much stress and headaches"
New York to Austin. Had to pay for 38 dollars for a carry on and a checked bag each plus to select seats was an additional 12 per person. Overall ended up paying about 90.00 more than the original fare. May have been cheaper initially but by the time you add on these items it would be best to check other options. In addition, we had to check our bags but when you arrive at the airport in La Guardia the counter does not open until 7am no matter what time your flight is in the morning. Makes no sense to arrive early to stand in line to check our bags for a min of 30 minutes then you still have to go to TSA. Will personally not fly Frontier ever again, too much stress and headaches associated with this airlines. Cheap fares but high cost of addons.

### "will not fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Trenton to Orlando. Unreliable! Booked my family’s vacation months in advance and only a couple weeks after, my return flight was canceled so it had to be rescheduled for a day earlier. Fine - I can deal with that. But then only a couple hours before we were to return that flight was also canceled! Frontier’s options were a full refund or take the next flight 3 days later. Well we don’t have a life of leisure and have an extra 3 days as we actually have to go to work. So, now we’re stuck paying hundreds of dollars in a rental car to drive from FL to NJ with 2 young children. I will definitely not fly with Frontier again.

### "flights were switched"
Not Verified |  My husband and I booked tickets online from Sacramento to Las Vegas and Vegas back to Sacramento however once we entered our payment information, the flights were switched from Vegas to Sacramento and Sacramento to Vegas! There was absolutely no error on our end. We immediately called Frontier and explained what happened and they wanted to charge us an additional $78! Fortunately I was able to cancel and request a full refund since I called within 24hrs. Refund can take up to 7 days.

### "I’m never flying Frontier again"
Something goes wrong every single time I fly Frontier Airlines. Every time, my flight is delayed. Last flight was delayed 5 hours. Currently sitting at the terminal as we should have boarded the flight 30 minutes ago. There are no updates from the staff. They couldn't care less. The interior of the plane has had so many shortcuts done to it: small, uncomfortable seat, trays that are so small, they’re completely pointless, snacks are skimp. The only good thing with Frontier is that they’re cheap. You get what you pay for. I’ll spend the extra money to have a decent flight. I’m never flying Frontier again.

### "I do not recommend it"
This is our second time flying Frontier and will not use it again. The seats are uncomfortable, and flights are always delay causing a big inconvenience in our travel plans. I do not recomend it specially if you have connecting flights (because of delays), they charge for absolutely everything (your seat, water and what not). Next time I'll choose another airline even if I have to pay a little bit more. We are not going to use vouchers the airline gave us because they are not reliable.

### "an absolute nightmare"
Portland to Denver. Our flight into Denver was an absolute nightmare. Their website was useless, we got charged a downgrade fee which seems absolutely absurd. Getting our bags checked in was impossible and the E boarding pass was a joke. Their inability to handle anything almost led to me missing my brothers wedding. I'll never fly Frontier again

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  I flew with Frontier several years ago and had a great experience. The flight prices were cheaper, but I don't remember feeling unsatisfied after my flights. Apparently the quality and customer assistance have gone way downhill in the past few years. My husband and I flew from Indianapolis to Las Vegas. The flight was fine, however, they nickel and dime you for every little thing, including water. The on-board flight staff were rude - one even yelling at a young child flying unaccompanied to "clean up her mess" and that "she does not operate as a maid service". The child had spilled some of her snack on the floor. She also had not parents to defend her. The flight attendant in question thought she was quite funny, making jokes the remainder of the flight, but I would like to say that her yelling at a young, unaccompanied minor was far from funny. The seats are uncomfortable and do not recline. There is no in-flight entertainment, which is fine. We were anticipating flying out the following week from Las Vegas, however, our flight was unexpectedly canceled only a couple hours before boarding time. No explanation was ever given as to why the flight was cancelled. Frontier left and entire plane full of people high and dry. The only 'help' offered was a refund of the flight plus travel vouchers OR up to $400 per person reimbursement for booking a new flight plus a small travel voucher. Sounds great, but honestly, the offer was trash. If you've never tried to book a flight the day of, flight prices are much higher than $400... especially when a plane full of people are all trying to book the same flights. Frontier so kindly offered to fly people out on Monday, but then mentioned that there was only 1 seat left (this occurred on a Saturday morning). At the time, when it became apparent that Frontier was not going to help anyone and people started to get angry, the staff members working the check in and baggages desks walked away and hid. They would not answer questions, they would not offer assistance. Eventually a couple came back out after the angry crowd died down and I was able to get some help. It was cowardly. I will never fly Frontier again, no matter how good the price or the flight times. It was an awful experience and I hope this review can save another person/couple/family from being stranded in an airport with no assistance offered by Frontier.

### "no one seems to care "
Philadelphia to Milwaukee. Absolutely horrendous on all accounts. Customer service is dismal and no one seems to care about us. I’ve been cancelled on my last 3 Frontier flights and ended up sleeping in the airport with no compensation other than a flight 3 days later. My flight is delayed again out of Philly and I have a feeling it will be cancelled as well. Do not fly Frontier, you will just be sad in the end and be left alone in the airport.

### "a horrible experience"
Our flight to Colorado was delayed an hour and a half. Seats uncompfy, no movies, had to pay for soda or water. I could live with this, but on our way back to orlando, the flight landed in Colorado springs and sat on the runway which we could see for an hour. Our flight was to leave at 7 it didn't board til 815ish. When we boarded we sat on the runway for 30 minutes only to turn back to the gate. We were given no explanation except that due to weather our flight was cxld. This was a lie. The pilot purposely sat on the runway to time himself out and blamed the weather so they don't have to compensate anyone. The next flight out of Colorado springs was 5 days later - it was a horrible experience. Do not fly on Frontier ever. I could say more but there isn't enough space for me to continue.

### "flight was canceled"
Indianapolis to Orlando via Washington. Wast of memory! It’s cheaper but in the end the most expensive! I got told at the check in my flight was canceled. I had to pay 500 for another airline. Then got a four hour delay I was stuck at the airport with no money. And frontier keep my money said they would reimburse me and I called and they will not! I’m a 20 year old girl I barely make enough to live I don’t have 500 just laying around Frontier I’m very disappointed! They gave me free vouchers? I wouldn’t trust them again.

### "cancelled with no flights for 3 days"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Las Vegas to Denver. Worst experience I had. Flight was on time, then flight was delayed, twice we were given to different excuses for why one of them being the plane was needing of parts being flown in from Los Angeles. However when the part arrived they said the part was incorrect part and our flight was cancelled with no flights for 3 days or choose another airline same day and pay more than my whole trip cost for one way tickets. Also major cause for concern plane never moves and we board same plane that supposedly had a defective part at 5am instead of 1.30am.

### "worst flying experiences"
Denver to Phoenix. Frontier continues to be the worst flying experiences I have ever had. The last 3 times I've flown with them, they delay the flights by 3-4 hours due to plane maintenance. Today I reached out to the airline customer "care" and after literally saying "there is nothing we are going to do for you" when I asked for a refund, she also decided to hang up on me when I told her I'd like to speak to a supervisor. The level of disrespect and lack of care for their customers is unacceptable and I will never be flying Frontier again and will share my experiences and warnings to everyone I know. If you dont want to lose customers, you shouldn't treat them like garbage.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Our first flight to Vegas was delayed for hours. We didn’t fly out of Tennessee until after 10:00 pm. We were supposed to take off at 8:45 pm. There was a loud and obnoxious woman that proceeded to get drunk and kept yelling loudly how upset she was and making vulgar comments. When we finally boarded the plane, they intended to let her fly. They ended up taken her off and she freaked out and caused more of a delay. When we were boarded I has paid a pretty penny to pick my seat, pay for my luggage, and to have priority in loading the plane. That didn’t matter, everyone boarded in front of me that was not with kids or needed help. The same thing happened on my flight back from Vegas to Memphis. Priority is a way for them to get more money and not keep their endof the bargain. There needs to be more flights offered from Frontier to go back and forth from Vegas. It’s one time in three days and an offer of one flight time is ridiculous. I will never fly with Frontier again nor will I share a good review.

### "everything is a charge"
Staff and Flight crew on way to Cancun were very nice. Seats terribly uncomfortable. Bring your own drinks and food as everything (except water) is a charge. On way home, from Cancun, we were told our personal bags would have to be paid for (Chicago did not make us do). We were told by Cancun personnel "you can pay or you can't bring back with you". I spoke to manager who reinforced this information. We were forced to pay $90. I contacted the company and was told "they do not offer refunds". Very disappointed. I had checked and measured bags prior to flight. I was hoping for resolution and a refund but it does not seem Frontier Airlines is interested in customer services and satisfaction.

### "Thank you Frontier"
This is all about compassion for medically/disabled folks and airline policy. Jennie is only 44, left the hospital against doctors orders and made it to the airport to fly home to Denver. Frontier customer service stepped up and helped her the entire way. They even reduced her bag fee, got me on the phone when her CC didn’t work to pay for it. I thought a positive review was needed. Kudos to the customer service/ticket person who compassionately helped her. Thank you Frontier ... Customer service is key!

### "not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Oklahoma City to Orlando. This airline is horrible they canceled my flight all day to Florida and then my flight back to OKC was delayed 3 hours. I sat and watched other flights go out but the one my family and I were going to be on. Will not fly with them again. They had us board in MCO and sat there for a while and then deplaned us for 45 mins.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Not Verified |  Denver to Providence. Our flight was delayed from 11:59 pm to 2:15 am without a reason, we boarded the plane at 2:05, they didn’t give the safety review until 2:45, and then at 2:53 am they announced that something was wrong with the computer and they had to call management. The seats are very uncomfortable, the staff has been nothing but rude and the lack of concern for the schedule people are on to catch other flights is despicable. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again.

### "nothing but false hope"
Not Verified |  Milwaukee to Las Vegas. I had a trip planned to Las Vegas and the airline cancelled the flight just hours before we were scheduled to leave. Their reason for cancellation was "Air Traffic Control" and they cannot do anything to fix that other than reschedule through their airline. After being on hold for over two hours to solve the problem, they were able to reschedule a flight for the next morning, which was not direct, like our original booking had been. This was still a pathetic "fix" to our problem. Upon leaving for the new flight, they cancelled it yet again. Their customer service is absolutely worthless. I will never fly with this airline again, nor will anyone I know. They have taken our money and have given us nothing but false hope, excuses and a lack of respect for the company.

### "simply unacceptable behavior"
My best friend and I traveled from Denver to Chicago to celebrate her birthday. To return, we booked our plane tickets from Chicago O’Hare to Denver International Airport, with a short layover in Las Vegas, at least three months prior to traveling, and chose Frontier Airlines because of the comparably cheaper flight tickets. But even their cheap tickets won’t ever, ever be enough for me to fly with Frontier again. The first flight from Chicago to Las Vegas was delayed by more than three hours, causing me and my friend traveling with me to miss our connecting flight. While in Chicago, we reached out to Frontier first via their support phone line and then in person at the airport, to ask Frontier what we should do given their delay. We were told that Frontier Airlines could not get us home to Denver for four days, which in itself is unacceptable for an airline to tell a customer trying to get home, and in addition Frontier did not offer us vouchers for hotels or food. Frontier told us to stay in a city away from home without any resources for four more days because they could not offer us any route home. That is simply unacceptable behavior towards paying customers. We ended up purchasing new plane tickets to go home from American Airlines, and an agent representing that airline stayed over an hour past when he got off his shift to help us and 20 other passengers find routes to travel. Oh, and an awful cup of coffee on Frontier is $2.99. Never again.

### "another terrible experience"
Buffalo to Tampa. It was another terrible experience with Frontier Airline. Last time when I flight from Las Vegas to Cleveland they delayed 10 hours but with notice in advanced and a $100 voucher. Then I decided to use that voucher for this flight from Buffalo to Tampa and it was terrible. The flight was 11:45am in the morning but it was delayed 3 times until 3pm. People were sitting in the airport doing nothing. Then, they surprising canceled the flight with a reason: there’s no cabin crew. They gave me a $10 food voucher and I was asked to go home and wait until 5am in the next morning to catch the flight. This is terrible and there’s no words I can describe it. Don’t ever fly with Frontier!

### "charge you for everything"
I was originally scheduled to fly on July 24 at 10:50 pm from Laguardia to Denver. The flight was delayed twice until passed midnight once we were on the plane within 5 minutes they told us that the flight was canceled and we needed to get off the plane. Once we were at the gate, the customer service representatives from Frontier in a very rudely manner explain to us the reasons why the flight was canceled and our options. They passed a letter around all the passengers saying that no hotel accommodation was available through Frontier therefore we need it to find our own hotels and they will reimburse us up to 150USD - but no transportation was going to be provided. If we were not able to find a hotel we needed to ask the Airport personnel to let us stay at the airport since they needed to "close the airport". We were aghast with their "options", it was 2 am and there was no way we can find a hotel nearby. We were transported back and forth from terminals until 4 am to check in again for our re-schedule flight. We were given a Voucher for food for $15 and a Voucher to flight again with them for 200.00 (which I am NOT planning to use). It is incredibly sad to see that the only thing Frontier cares for is to charge you for everything (even to choose your own seat) but the least of their worries are the customer.

### "extremely poor management"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Las Vegas. During the check in process we were informed that the flight was cancelled. We were notified via email and text approximately 1.5 hours prior to departure. The airline offered no reasonable alternative flight pursuant to FAA rule 240 to offer alternative transport to our destination within 24 hours. The customer service rep made some vague comments about purchasing tickets and trying for reimbursement. We were then offered a flight out of Tampa into Denver to connect on the morning of 7/24 to Boise, where we would rent a car and drive the remainder. After these tickets were booked, we were informed that the connecting flight was actually scheduled to depart the night of 7/24. Since this would not work we made arrangements to fly to Salt Lake City the morning of 7/24. This change cost us over a thousand dollars of unnecessary expenses and included spending the night on the floor at the Denver international airport with our three children. Upon boarding the flight on 7/24 we remained at the gate until approximately 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time. At that time we were deplaned due to maintenance issues. I feel that the extremely poor management of this airline is directly what led to these issues and left my family to spend large sums of time and money to make up for Frontiers obvious inability to run a functioning airline. The airport is literally full of people that have been left delayed and/or stranded by this airline. This sort of treatment is wholly unacceptable and needs to be addressed.

### "never fly them again"
Chicago to Phoenix. The worst airline ever, they canceled my flight and gave 2 options take money back or wait a week for next flight. Mind you this happened to quite a few of the cheer girls as we were in Chicago for cheer competition and left us stranded with no help. I will never fly them again nor will I recommend them to anyone

### "still no word of my refund"
My flight was cancelled and no way to reach the customer service. It has been six weeks and still no word of my refund. I don't have much to say than to advise people not to fly this Airline. I was told not to do it but i gave them a try and now I will never fly them again.

### "how terrible this experience"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Las Vegas. There are not even words for how terrible this experience has been. Our first flight got cancelled with no explanation. We were told the only option we had was to drive 2 hours to Tampa to catch another flight or wait 3 days for the next flight. Absolutely insane! They refused to refund us or put us on another airline or even give us food vouchers or a rental car. Got to Tampa, waited 6 hours for a flight. Got stuck in Denver for 11 hours with no accommodation. Got put on a flight to Salt Lake City (mind you we are traveling to California which means best case scenario they’re forcing us to make a 9 hour drive). Got on the plane and then they made everyone deboard and now we are delayed again. We’re going on 2 full days stuck in Denver with 3 kids. No food vouchers. No refunds. No explanations. Nothing. They have completely ruined our family vacation and we still have the return trip to worry about which I assume will be just as terrible. Somebody needs to do something about this airline. It’s absolutely not ok.

### "such a disappointment"
Frontier Airlines is such a disappointment. Let’s start off with how bad traffic was getting to LAX. Then arrived on time to check into my flight just to be told my flight was canceled. I was shocked and devastated! Frontier Airlines did not send notifications or emails out informing their travelers their flight was canceled. They offered three other options to accommodate for their letdown. I decided to take another flight couple days later. But going through the trouble of organizing my life & preparing for my trip just to be told it was canceled without any warning was pretty shitty. Now I understand why somany people complain about Frontier Airlines. Their fares maybe appealing, but their services are a huge catastrophe. Not to mention their airplanes lack WiFi service and the large carry-on fee they charge && lots of delays, which are long & also you find out at the last minute your flight will be delayed. If you can avoid flying with Frontier please do. I will certainly will.

### "delayed so much"
Atlanta to San Diego. I was just told that because my initial flight from Atlanta to San Diego was delayed so much that I wouldn’t make it in time for my connecting flight. My only two options were to fly to Denver and stay overnight or fly straight to LA which also is awful because it’s still a two hour drive and I paid for a stretch seat.

### "Never fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Phoenix. Never fly Frontier Airlines. (I am writing this on behalf of my granddaughter since she is a minor still stranded in Chicago) They canceled my granddaughter's flight home to Phoenix today from Chicago. She was going as an unaccompanied minor so they charge a lot to have someone make sure she gets on the flight safe and gets handed off to an approved person after landing. No phone call from Frontier to make arrangements to book her on a later flight, and there were open seats on flights later in the week. No one answered the customer service number for an entire day. Finally my oldest son drove to O'Hare to confront them. They refused to do anything other than reimburse 50% of her round trip ticket which they'll send in a week or two (maybe). Do you know how much it costs for a last minute ticket home which her parents now get stuck paying for since Frontier refused to get her home?! This is unprofessional, such poor customer service. Other airlines at least book you on a later flight and if they can't accommodate they book you on another airline with no extra charge. And this is not the first time this has happened to someone I know with Frontier. It's infuriating! How could Frontier Airlines strand a child and then say, oh well, your problem.

### "absolutely horrendous"
Cleveland to Tampa. I am extremely disappointed in Frontier today. My flight was cancelled the morning of departure. Leaving me with no options to fly home to work until Friday (4 days after my original flight). I was supposed to be back in Tampa 7/23 at 10:17am to make it to interpret for a client at a court hearing and meetings throughout the day. Instead, I was stuck in Frontier’s line for over an hour and on the phone for over another hour and forty-five minutes to try and remedy the issue. After a supervisor was put on the phone, my options were; (1) Rescheduled at no additional cost OR (2) Refund with no voucher. This feels like a slap in the face! Considering what I had gone through with Frontier all day and I am currently without a flight home. I am an elite member and almost always booked my flights with Frontier. I rely heavily on Frontier to get me to and from where I need to be if I’m giving Frontier my time, trust and money. I understand that while weather, mechanical and other situations may occur, I can’t wrap my mind around why it would take 4 days to get me home. My car is parked at the Tampa Airport and will be accruing charges. I am missing out on a full day of work today (and possibly 3 more days to come), can’t make money, incurring extra charges at the airport and paying extra for kennel/dog babysitting fees. This does not factor in the fact that I am now unreliable to my client and pets. After today, if Frontier truly wants my business and values their company - I hope they really pull through and let me and everyone who had to encounter what I went through today know how it’s reasonable that we’d have to wait 4 days for an available flight to get us home. I feel that Frontier does not value my time and business. This is absolutely horrendous.

### "this is unacceptable!"
My return flight from Orlando to Detroit was first delayed then it was cancelled without any explanation. I called customer service, they said the cancellation was due to unavailability of crew! I asked if they could book us on a different airline for the same day they said no. I asked if they could immediately refund us the funds so we could book another flight, they said no. I asked if they could give us food vouchers because at this point we had been at the airport for 5 hours. I asked if they could give us accommodation vouchers and yup, they said no! So now we are left scrambling to find a flight and accomodations. Frontier this is unacceptable! Never again will I fly with them.

### "worst customer service ever"
Phoenix to Austin. Our flight was cancelled from Phoenix to Austin due to “weather” despite ALL other airlines continuing to fly. They would not rebook us on another airline. They offered us a flight on Thursday (this was a Monday). No apologies to us. I haven’t seen my dad in 3 years and this time with him was priceless, not to mention the $3000 in hotel fees. They cancelled the flight the night before and NEVER notified us. We would have started driving if they had. Frontier completely ruined our trip! I will never ever fly with them. Not to mention they try to double charge you for the seats with $17-25 to preassign your seats and the extra bag charges including $60 charge for a carryon. The worst customer service ever! The desk person had such a poor attitude and was completely unhelpful.

### "airline is a complete joke"
Raleigh Durham to Denver. The worst airline I have been on. I have had really bad experiences with frontier before but figured it must have been a bad day until this trip. I realize they can’t get flights out on time they don’t communicate with customers and make excuses of why the are delayed 2 hours but don’t leave until 5 hours after the original flight time. The ticket counter and gate people just run away and don’t make eye contact when your trying to get answers and then they don’t even try to make it right. Then finally after boarding we sit on the ramp for over an hour with them saying computer problems. This airline is a complete joke

### "I can't fault them"
Indianapolis to Philadelphia. I use Frontier for niche seasonal flights and never have any issues. Ticket cost, carry on and seat selection I tally it all up. The extended leg room is good and is a help with longer flights. No Wi-Fi I can live with and the drink snacks selection is good. I don't compare them to other airlines all I ask is safe travels and good attempts to stay on schedule while keeping travel cost down. I can't fault them they aren't as horrible as some say IMO.

### "I am very disappointed"
San Jose to Las Vegas. I had a flight today and I got left out. I reached the gate when the status was "boarding" but the door was closed and I was not let in. I did not receive any phone calls or message despite coming to the airport before 2 hours. Also I was not booked an alternate ticket for tomorrow. I have been calling the customer support but no one responds. I was spoken to very rudely by staff at the gates. And not given alternate tickets when I asked for a feedback form to explain the whole situation. I am very disappointed by the whole incident. Now I have booked another ticket for 300$ and frontier won't refund me or book an alternate flight for me. Please help.

### "missed the flight"
Dallas Ft Worth to Cincinnati. Was doing a one way flight from Dallas to Cincinnati with Frontier Airlines. I work in the Aviation Profession. Got to airport early to get boarding passes printed. No ticket agent available to check in. Kiosk would not let me check in, it said to see the ticket agent. Had agent paged several times, no one came, not even after the flight had left. 8 Passengers missed the flight. Corporate hung the phone call up on one passenger said it was not there fault. One passenger was told that it would be a $100.00 fee to change to the next flight, by the way this is Sunday and that flight is Tuesday. One little print 8.5 x 11 printed paper behind one of the isle signs says that the ticket agent leaves 45 minutes prior to departure time, to check everyone in on the flight. This was not visible to the public till you walk away from the counter. This is a cheap airline that doesn't care about the customer at all. The CS airport people and other airline agents say they see this all the time at Dallas DFW. The Airline could at least refund the price of the tickets. Review the tv cameras!

### "Good for solo traveler"
I checked into my flight via the app with no issue and it had my boarding pass in the app so I could skip the ticket counter and kiosks at the airport. I also paid for a carry on bag in advance. Before leaving my house, the flight was delayed for 2 hours, although the aircraft that was going to be used for this flight was on time and en route in another flight, so that confused me. At the gate, we started the boarding process (I was zone 1 since I had a bag), and we were held on the jetway for a few min because they were not ready to let us into the plane yet. I found this odd we eventually got on. Seats were very uncomfortable and could not recline. Legroom was tight. Cabin staff was very friendly. The plane was further delayed for about 30 min due to a mechanical issue but that got fixed quickly. Eventually we got to Austin and then continued to Denver about two hours late. If you do the research online (bag fees, what’s included etc.) On their website BEFORE you book and head to the airport, you will know what you are in for. Most flyers do not plan ahead of time. Most people flying this airline are first time or occasional flyers expecting a first class experience. You still won’t experience this on main line carriers either. Being said, you get what you pay for, but frontier was upfront on their policies on their website. It got be from point A to B without any major issues. Good for solo traveler like myself. Also another tip, you have to pay for food and drinks from the beverage cart. It’s not too expensive but just bring your own food onboard and fill up a water bottle at a water fountain in the airport. Just do some simple planning ahead and suck up the no frills experience. Literary all of these complaints on this website are because you have to bring a bag and pay for seats. Go fly a mainline carrier then, they’re not much better.

### "I was not impressed"
Indianapolis to Orlando. This was my first experience with Frontier and I have to say that I was not impressed. My flight going to Indianapolis was fine, no hitches. Nothing spectacular happened, the kiosk to self-check in was unavailable and there were no snacks/drinks, and you have to pay for carry-ons. Sure, it's a cheap ticket. My problem is how they dealt with my returning flight to Orlando. In that it didn't happen. They ended up sending an email probably near an hour before the flight was set to board and we were all checked in. They apologize but flight's been cancelled. Okay, sometimes that happens (though not in such a discrete manner...with rumors about relocating our flight because of stranded individuals for Las Vegas that they cancelled the day before OR that everyone was alerted over the announcements from an employee who prefaced by saying "Don't no one come up to yell at me but...") and they'll accommodate for our inconvenience. Lo and behold, they will only reimburse max of $400 per ticket bought from another airline. Cheapest flights that day? $423. For flights that would take longer due to not being direct like the cancelled flight, and wouldn't go out until later that day. We have to pay for new tickets on the spot. Well fine, let's deal with the reimbursement online form. Oh, it doesn't work, it errors out twice for me on Chrome. Let's call customer service: No options for questions and concerns. Okay...let's ask the employee on site: "We gotta deal with getting this plane out first"  I didn't even ask yet, just came up but alright. The lady nearby that he was talking to turned to me. She was nice enough, gave me a number (same one) and said to do the Feedback option. Weird but okay. After a good bit of waiting on hold, I get someone who doesn't understand me clearly maybe because of the noise in the airport? Sure. Repeat myself and get put on hold a couple times, once because he thought I was cancelling my own flight and looking to rebook on Frontier. Can you wait two days? That's the next one we have. I'm sorry, no, we already got our new Delta tickets, I just want to get reimbursed and see if we can have the entire tickets reimbursed not just the 400 max. After awhile of re-clarifying, he realizes what I'm asking and confirms. I will get my tickets completely reimbursed? The entire 423 each? Yes, ma'am, yes" "And I'll get the 200 vouchers as well? Yes" "Good, thank you very much" He also let me know that I should try another browser instead of chrome to not error out. Cool. So I re-do my reimbursement application while also adding onto the pictures of papers I send that I spoke to an agent who told me that I will get reimbursed the full amount along with the vouchers. Get a confirmation email that it's gone through. Near two weeks later: checks for 400 each, no vouchers in sight. Boyfriend tries to deal with them (he's more of a principled hothead), goes up superiors, .but gets nowhere with all refusing to reimburse the tickets we had to purchase just to get home because of their cancelled flight. It's not like they refunded us the cancelled flight either because of us choosing the option for reimbursement(it was either/or). Finally, he calls them back, requests an American employee (I know, he's bad), and they will try to resend the vouchers. Guess that's the best we'll get, be further in the hole from this single round-trip through Frontier that we thought would be kind to our wallets.

### "stranded in Denver airport"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline I have ever experienced. I booked a flight from Reno to Providence with a layover in Denver. The flight from Reno was an estimated 3 hour delay, but ended up being 6 hours including the 3 hour spent on the run way. They estimated I would miss my connection and scheduled me for a different one later in the night. We arrived to Denver at 2 am and I didn't make the connection. 20 people were left stranded in Denver airport with no compensation for hotels!!! There response was simply that corporate said no. You can't do this to people!! Leave them stranded in a city at 2 am with no where to go. Most of us slept in the airport and my flight isn't until 12 am tonight.

### "inability to communicate properly"
Buffalo to Orlando. In all my travels I have never experienced a disaster of an airline. Starting at the gate in the airport. The amount of unorganized staff was something to be desired. The flight was to depart at 255pm, I arrived at the airport at 1200 to find that the flight was already on the board as delayed. And from what I’m being told, it’s a regular occurrence with this airline. The staff have the inability to communicate properly. That’s from the staff at the airport to the crew on the aircraft. After a delay of over 2 and a half hours, we finally get on our way. And at no point did the staff advise the reason for the delay, or other any of the passengers anything. Earlier in the week, the same flight was delayed over 5 hours and it wasn’t until 2 and a half hours did they advise the passengers would have to disembark due to mechanical issues that the mechanic didn’t have the proper tools to fix. After another 2 hours delay, they finally brought another plane in. Yes, the flights were cheap but if you have somewhere to be, or just plain don’t want to waste your precious time, do not. I repeat, do not fly Frontier

### "never fly with them again"
The first and the last time I will ever fly with them. My fiancé and I waited more than 45 min to check my bag. We arrived 2.5 hours before hand and have TSA pre check. I was still panicking prior to my departure. The airline boarded the flight 30-45 min late.. ok no big deal. We sat on the runway for 2 hours due to weather issues in the current area. Meanwhile, we’re looking out of the window, watching American Airlines and Southwest take off. Everyone was confused. The pilot comes over the intercom stating that our flight has been cancelled. The time that I sat on the runway due to delays is the same amount of time we would’ve spent in the air. We were redirected to the ticket counter for refunds. There were no other flights that frontier offered, that were headed to PHL that evening. American Airlines had a few options that were reasonably priced, as an alternative. I’m researching while waiting in line, with 200+ frustrated passengers. There was 1 desk attendant helping all of us. I waited in line for 4 hours for my refund, only for my fiancé to say “enough with this waiting, let’s bite the bullet and stay at a hotel”. I ended up not getting my refund. I guess American Airlines took advantage of the opportunity and marked the PHL flights up twice as much. Shame on me for not buying the tickets immediately, once I heard the flight had been cancelled. I ended up paying $1500 for the both of us because it was crucial we got home within the next 24hrs. What a joke. I called their 1-800 number . They instructed we had to waqit in line in order to get a full refund. Our flight tickets totaled to $425  + $1,500 American Airlines flight home + $120 hotel room, uber to and from hotel, food and stress. A very costly flight home. I was more than disappointed with frontier. I will never fly with them again. Please fly with caution and a credit card when choosing Frontier.

### "I missed this flight"
San Diego to Tulsa. Worst experience in all my years of travel. To start, I couldn't get the online app to work on my phone for mobile checkin. Next - get to the airport and this airline charges me $45 for a carry on bag. Just one normal bag that every other airline allows me to carry on for free. Next, get on the plane and seats don't recline, not even a little bit. Then - I get to the airport to for my return flight. I arrived in plenty of time to make the flight, probably 40-45 minutes before the scheduled take off time. Because I fly all the time, I was very confident that since the flight was 7.10am and there was no long security line, that I would have time. I arrived to the airport to find out that nobody was at the checkin desk - the checkin kiosk would NOT allow me to check in. I was not the only person standing there wondering why nobody was there to check people in to the flight. Ultimately, I missed this flight - and by the way people, they only have 1 direct flight a day to many destinations. I had to call my company to book another flight for me and luckily I didn't have to pay for it.

### "never fly Frontier again"
We flew from Washington DC to San Francisco via Denver. The first leg of the trip was fine but things really went awry on our evening connecting flight to SF: as we were getting ready to take off, a delay was announced due to a computer malfunction. After sitting on the plane for another hour or so, our flight was cancelled - at 11pm! The next Denver to SF flight on Frontier would not be for another 2 days. We had to to retrieve our bags from another terminal, arrange & pay for a flight on another carrier and slept overnight on the floor of the Denver airport as Frontier was unable to assist with any hotel accommodations. We travel 1-3 times a year but we will never fly Frontier again.

### "little to no customer service"
Denver to San Francisco. Frontier has little to no customer service. On both my departing and returning flights the people loading the plain were extremely rude. Not only were both flights delayed each way but when we asked what the problem was the frontier representatives told us to mind or own business. I couldn't believe the way these people treat their customers. They should be ashamed of themselves.

### "the seats were terrible"
Worst airline ever! Packed a carry on for my trip to avoid fees, ended up having to pay double the amount any other airlines would have charged. Carry on cost $52, the same to check a bag. Flight was slightly delayed in Cancun to Denver, which was fine. But the seats were terrible, they don’t recline, no complimentary beverages or snacks and spent 45 min on the tarmac waiting for a terminal to open up. Upon landing, I received an e-mail saying our connecting flight was delayed an hour and a half, well that time came and went. Our flight was then further delayed, totalling 2.5 hour delay, only because the airlines didn’t have the name of the flight attendants on a sheet of paper, therefore they were not allowed aboard. We now are taking a red eye back home and had to be up for work early, with no sleep and a terrible experience. I will forever stay true to Alaska Airlines! They get it right and so do many others, there is no reason they can’t figure It out. Get a clue. I’ve now researched Frontier Airlines and see that I’m just another millionth customer with the same experience.

### "Customer service was terrible"
I will never fly Frontier again. First of all it is not a savings because you end up paying more with your baggage so you might as well fly a professional flight like Delta or Southwest and forget all the hassle. Customer service was terrible they don't know how to treat people, they try to fool people with the baggage. So make sure you read all the fine print, it was awful. I flew Frontier for my company to find out should my company use their outline and I told them no never and my company fly out every week. The only thing nice about Frontier was the pilots and that was it.

### "will never fly Frontier again"
Customer service is awful and unapologetic. I get that flights are delayed for several reasons. My return flight from PWM to SEA (with layover in DEN) was delayed due to mechanical error. The flight was already delayed before we were even made aware of this. We then boarded the plane, wait some time, and then were told about the mechanical issue, and so had to de-board the plane. After an even longer wait time, they had to manually check us in and re-board, so that was slow and unorganized. Communication was so poor and customer service was rude. A lot of us missed our connecting flight. We were given the option to continue to DEN and figure out the rest there; or, get a refund and book thru another airline, with flights leaving the next day (I’ll breakdown prices later). Most of us opted for DEN bc the refund deal was terrible. Finally at DEN, we had to wait in the plane while they find a terminal, and then wait in line at customer service to figure out our connecting flights. There were >30 people in line and one person at customer service. When a few of us called customer service, we were told they couldn’t help us over the phone and that we had to deal with this in person. I finally get to the desk past midnight, and my options were to book the next flight to SEA (which was 24 hrs later. I got a hotel voucher for up to $150, but it being midnight, the hotels available were twice the cost. And I had to call around different concierge desks and find/book the hotel myself; no help from Frontier), get on an earlier plane to Portland, OR but figure out the rest of the way back to Seattle on my own and at my cost, or partial refund and book with another airline. Speaking of refunds, here were the options and prices given to me: My total round trip flight was $502.90, after added fees for carry-on, check-in, and seat selection. Partial refund for return flight from PWM to SEA (so this should be half the total): $180 Soonest flight from PWM to SEA on another airline: $415 cheapest, leaving next day Partial refund for return flight from DEN to SEA (so this should be a quarter of the total): per the lady at customer service, “You’d be lucky if you got $80” Soonest flight from DEN to SEA on another airline: $256 leaving the next morning w/ no layovers. $228 leaving the next evening w/ layovers As I stated earlier, I opted for booking the next flight and found a hotel. When I asked the customer service lady where I can retrieve my checked-in bag, she looked at my condescendingly and said, “why would you need that?” After explaining the obvious (by this point, it was 1:30AM and my flight was at 10PM), she said I could get someone to retrieve it, but that it’s be another hour and a half. This was an awful experience! I will never fly Frontier again.

### "they nickel and dime"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to San Diego. Initially, the price seems great, but they nickel and dime you on bags, drinks, and seat assignments. Our flight was delayed as was the other Frontier flight that was leaving our gate.These were the first two flights of the day! After we boarded, we were then told to that they had more work to do on the "placard," so we had to exit the plane. After my experience and reading the other reviews, this seems like the norm for this airline. Spend the extra, you get what you pay for.

### "you get what you pay for"
Orlando to Detroit. We were notified 4:00 a.m via text and email that our return flight home from Orlando had been cancelled. We received no explanation of why it was cancelled. We called the Frontier to get more information and was told that flight had been cancelled and we would have to book another flight, we attempted to do so to realize there were no other flights until tomorrow. This being unacceptable and not an option for us to stay another night we explained we could not do this, and was told if we had to book with another flight we would have to make sure we completed documentation for refund and what carrier we had to go through. We were truly upset that the only flight we could find that could accommodate was going to cost us more than the original full trip airfare we paid. We received an email about a voucher we could use for up to 90 days that simply said sorry for inconvenience. Why would we want to fly Frontier ever again, when you couldn't provide us with professional customer service to get us home? Then told we will not get reimbursed for 4 to 6 weeks. Horrible customer service even after asking to speak with a manager, they seemed so unaffected by the lives of our family members and we had kids. What if we didn't have the money to get back home, I guess we would have just been stranded until we did. Delta was friendly, but much higher cost. I guess you get what you pay for. Never Again and we better get our money refunded!

### "Inattentive staff, overbooked flights"
Chicago to Colorado Springs. Inattentive staff, overbooked flights, and inadequate compensation after being told they no longer have seats available. My wife and I flew out of Colorado Springs, arriving early and being the only people at the counter. We stood at the counter while the attendant worked on her computer for a solid 2 minutes, having looked briefly at us, but not acknowledging us in any other manner. At first I thought she was finishing something that couldn't wait, but she said nothing, shuffled papers around, and continue until I spoke up and said I like to check in. She looked to her right as if there was supposed to be someone that was going to come over to her counter and help us. Since the Frontier website wasn't letting me pre-check early that day we got the worst seats in the plane, which were at the back near the toilets and unable to recline. On the flight we sat two rows behind a group of women that talked loudly, laughing and carrying on long after the lights had gone out (this was a late night flight). People were irritated, and the couple in front of us asked the people to be quiet, and they quieted down for a bit before gradually getting louder. The staff made no attempt to remedy the situation. What really angered me, and will make this the first and last time I try to save a buck by flying Frontier, is on the on the way back to Colorado Springs from Chicago. This is a domestic flight, so we arrived an hour before our flight, and when checking in were told that we'd need to go the gate to get seats assigned. We went and got there about 15 minutes before boarding only to find out that we didn't have seats. We had an international flight the following morning and they attempted to get someone to switch with us, but no luck. We ended up getting reimbursed for the return flight, plus some cash, which was still $200 less than the cost of the tickets we had to buy in order to catch our flight the following day. Yes, we ended up paying more than original tickets due to their incompetence. The counter staff was polite and helpful in Chicago, and obviously as irritated with the situation as we were as they has to deal with other people in a similar situation. So in summation, terrible service at the counter in Colorado Springs, terrible in-flight service, and awful customer relations. When you pay for a product you expect to receive it. If you can't deliver your product then what good is your business? Frontier is the absolute worse airline I have ever flown and I will gladly pay an extra hundred on my next flight in order to not have to deal with them again. I can only give a 2 star for ground service because the Chicago staff was quite patient and apologetic. Everything else is a solid 1, and the overall would be zero if I could.

### "worst airline I've experienced"
Austin to Orlando. I want this to be a simple review and so this airline is by far the worst airline I've experienced. My flight was cancelled twice, and I was given a $200 voucher because of the inconvenience. Not only that, I'm flying away from TX because my husband deploys in 2 days and I've tried calling about 10 times (still trying to get in contact with a rep.) and still nothing. There's nothing but an automated lady given you options to choose or say and then nothing happens thereafter. My flight was booked incorrectly for the day after it was cancelled instead of the day after the day on the newly booked flight. I've spoken to the rep. who assisted me in the airport and he also booked my flight incorrectly which is the flight that got cancelled in the first place. I'm traveling with my 1 year old daughter, which already makes it a little harder, and then I have to deal with the inconvenience of this airlines' approach for their customer.

### "terrible service, not reliable"
I had a flight from San Diego to Austin which was delayed several times and then canceled. Once the flight was canceled we were all sent out of the gate to ticketing to get a "ticket" and discuss the refund/voucher process. When all 200 of us got to the ticketing counter no one was there to help us for 20 minutes. The manager was no help, I ended up booking a ticket on a different airline and paid 5x what I paid for this flight. They have terrible service, are not reliable and do not take care of their customers. Its worth an extra, $100 or $200 on any other airline to avoid this nightmare. Do not fly Frontier.

### "original flight cancelled"
Buffalo to Tampa. First of all original flight cancelled hours before time of departure. Told at the gate they will email me a e check for $400 per ticket and to book another flight with another airlines. Problem with that other flights $500 and up? Had to spend 2 more nights hotel 2 more nights car rental and was only compensated with $200 voucher only good for another flight with them, which will never happen. Customer service is terrible. No help at the gate when flight was cancelled. And to top it all off they charged me an extra $200 to check my bags!

### "never again use Frontier"
Denver to Phoenix. All the hidden fees for this airline will have you end up paying more than you'd do for some other airlines, so Frontier is NOT ever the cheapest option, unless you want to travel with just your handbag or man-purse, and with no food or beverage what so ever. However, the worst part is the tremendous issues they have with cancelled flights and enormous delays, as well as HUGE customer service issues. Our flight back from Phoenix Arizona to Denver Colorado (F9 758) on July 8th was supposed to leave 9.30 in the morning, it was in segments pushed forward until 5 p.m. so people ended up having to spend their whole day in or in the vicinity of the airport. Many had to cancel their ticket and try to get on other planes, costing them a lot of money (and delays). However, this can happen to any airline, but we did receive many messages saying that it is COMMON for Frontier to have these issues. Still, most can be forgiven, but not the awful attitude of Frontier staff. Me and my partner stayed at the airport, but chose to spend the day at the terminal that had all the restaurants and shops. We checked our phones for updates on flight changes (as Frontier chooses to send these updates via texts and that's how we'd know about the delays in the first place). An airline employee had told us to not check our one bat, but to instead show up between 3 and 4 p.m. for our flight estimated to now leave 5 p.m., only 7.5 hours late. We showed up at 3.30 sharp and were informed by an incredibly rude female employee that we had missed our flight. Shocked, we checked our phones for any updates of the flight being scheduled earlier, but not were sent, apparently Frontier wants you to camp by the gates for 7 hours, just in case. At the terminal with no food venues. The worst part was that the male employee who had told us to come in between 3 and 4 pm, was there right next to the woman, and did not want to admit that we had only followed his direct advice. Another jarring fact was that the plane was just finishing boarding, and we COULD have been allowed on board, except for the fact that the female employee wouldn't let us. When we directly asked if they had simply sold our tickets to somebody else, she became very defensive, so case in point. We will never again use Frontier, no matter how favorable the price looks. We ended up renting a car, having to drive the whole night, just to get home in reasonable time.

### "flight was actually cancelled"
Grand Rapids to Philadelphia. Flight cancelled the night before I was scheduled to fly out, via email. Used the app to check-in and get through security until I finally found out that my flight was actually cancelled. I went to the Frontier desk only to be given no help in finding another flight or booking with another airline to get a flight. Terrible customer service who only handed me a piece of paper as their way of communicating. The $200 flight voucher I received means literally nothing since my flight will probably be cancelled again if I book with them. Unreliable.

### "will never fly them again"
On July 8th 2018 I was to board my flight from Pittsburgh to Denver at 7:45 p.m. at 8:30 a.m. on July 8th I received a text message that my flight at 7:45 p.m. was delayed until 9:20 p.m. I then again received a text message at 6:40 p.m. that my again flight would be delayed till 9:45 p.m. After boarding the aircraft and arriving in Denver the last flight flying to Seattle had left 10 minutes prior to my Landing in Denver, after speaking with customer service I was told that they could get me home two days later it would leave July 9th at 10:45 p.m. going to Austin Texas via one other area I do not recall then to Seattle stating that it would take me 2 days to get home. There was no compensation no Hotel no food voucher no sorries. They just did not care. They were perfectly fine stating to me that they could get me home 48 hours later from my original flight pattern. I am disgusted with this company and how they handled my situation they did not even say sorry or state or show any remorse to the fact that they delayed a flight 12 hours prior to its actual departure time they just shrugged their shoulders and asked me if they would like me to rebook. I stated to them NO, to refund me and I will take another airline in which I took Alaska Airlines which got me out of Denver within 4 hours arriving to Seattle. Alaska Airlines stepped up where Frontier failed. I could have easily have been home if they would have had their flight wait for me as I departed the aircraft which is allowed on situations like this because I know for a fact since I used to be an Airline customer service gate agent this is not something new on delayed flights and they could have had this done for me and they failed to do so. I will never fly them again.

### "utterly unsatisfied"
Completely and utterly unsatisfied. We left Vegas heading to Portland maine with a layover in Denver. In Vegas, our flight was delayed by 2 hrs. I questioned the staff if this would cause any issues with our other flight and she told me that they are holding the plane for the passengers that are to board it. We finally left Vegas at 4 am and did not get off the plane until 615am. Upon arrival, I stopped and asked someone about the plane they were holding. She looked it up and informed us that it had already left and to go to customer service. No big deal! So we went and was informed that the next available flight was Thursday morning. That would leave us stranded at the airport for 2 full days. I questioned where our luggage was and was told it was going to Portland. I told them no one would be there and how were we supposed to get it. She said they will give us a call if we haven't picked it up in 24 hrs. So now we have no luggage for 2 days. I asked if they could provide lodging where they messed up or food vouchers. The lady kept repeating the same thing, "your options are you can refund the tickets and it will be back in your account in 7 to 10 business days or you can wait til Thursday". They would not provide any accommodations even though they messed up. We went back to the lady at customer service 3 times and she told us the same things over and over again and finally that they couldn't help us. There was another person who flew on the same plane and was going to the same destination. She informed us that they paid for her to take another plane to get home today. We asked again if they could do this and we still got nothing. So now, at this point, we are stranded with no lodging, no transportation, no food, no luggage and no money to get things. We decided to go to the baggage claim because it didn't make sense that our bags caught the flight to Maine if we didnt. We asked the check bag area and they informed us our bags should be here, but no one knew where they were. At this point, I was crying mad. I called corporate and was on the phone for 45 minutes between a customer service person and a supervisor before my call was disconnected. I called back and was on the phone for another 1.5 hours with a supervisor and them finally someone higher up. In the meantime, we are still in the baggage claim and just so happened to see bags that looked like ours. 4 hours later! Finally got through to a man named that stated he would fully reimburse us if we bought tickets with another airline. 5 hours of hassle. Now we wait and see if they reimburse us. Not happy and would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "seats are terribly uncomfortable"
Frontier Airlines is never on time. The seats are terribly uncomfortable. It’s not like the prices are dirt cheap. This is the problem with all domestic airlines in America. Every one of them messes their customers around. Why is there always a delay of at least an hour? Why do they ask customers to be two hours early. If there’s 200 people on the plane that’s a delay of 200 hours. Is there no respect for people’s time?

### "airline is horrible"
New Orleans to Raleigh Durham. This airline is horrible. Online it said my bag to check would be between $20 /25. When I got to the airport it was $45. Online it ended up being $38 (one way). The chairs were not comfortable at all and there was no room at all and I'm 5'7. I could imagine if my 6'4 boyfriend was with me. The plane looked outdated and needed major upgrades. All beverages and snacks had a fee. Even water. And the icing on the cake is when I had to wait almost an hour for my luggage when I got home because they said they were understaffed! I paid just a little less than American and delta but next time I will definitely pay an extra 150-200 for a better airline. Never again!

### "doesn't take care of customers"
Not Verified |  Little Rock to Salt Lake City. I planned to visit my boyfriend in Salt Lake City a month ahead of time and bought my ticket from Frontier Airlines, if I had known at the time all the trouble I would have to go through I would have went with another airline. The first problem I had was on the way out to Salt Lake City, it was a delay of 3 hours in the Denver airport. This was an inconvenience, however not the end of the world. The night before my flight back to Little Rock I received an email that said my flight was cancelled and it only gave me two options, to either get a refund on the unused part of my ticket plus travel miles with Frontier (obviously I don't want to fly with Frontier ever again) or to get a refund of up to $400 if I bought a ticket with another airline plus more travel miles with Frontier. The original round-trip ticket was only $375 and I would have only gotten half of that back. So in more simple terms I was being screwed out of money since their company policy is not to pay you back in full the cost of the new ticket. The night before my flight there is no way I could have found a ticket with another airline cheaper than $400. I ended up paying $600 for my one-way ticket back home since it was so last minute. I would think with any respectable airline there would have been another option (or a full refund for the new ticket in previous options would have sufficed), to offer another flight free of charge. Frontier Airlines clearly doesn't strive to serve customers to the customer's satisfaction. They left me stranded in a city hours from my home without even the option of giving me a full refund on the new ticket I had to buy because they cancelled my flight the night before. It is very disappointing that Frontier doesn't take care of its customers and works with them.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Houston to Denver. Standing in line to check bags in and there is no one else in lane. This is at 4.15am. I walk up to check bags in and there are three people behind the counter just talking. So I approach the counter and the staff member rudely tells me, "well since you are already here I guess I can help you. My daugher then says, "she was a little rude. Yep Frontier Airlines at its best. This is by far the worst airline! If you can avoid flying them please do.

### "will not fly Frontier again"
Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas. Today is my 2nd time flying and to say I'm highly disappointed in my experience thus far is an understatement. As I was sitting and enjoying an over priced ham and cheese sandwich email #1 comes in. Our 9:25pm flight was delayed until 11:25. Okay cool. 30 minutes later another email that our flight has been delayed again and will now arrive at 1am. So I'm paying for a room that I cannot stay in - money wasted, uncomfortable and tired. Next comes the announcement regarding mechanical issues and the flight crew needing to be changed and we will try to have everyone boarded by 1:30am. $400 plane ticket. Wheres the manager? Do I get a portion of the cost returned? Some credits to fly another airline? Safety is of upmost importance and with that in mind, I will not fly Frontier again.

### "Worst airline I have ever used"
Worst airline I have ever used. I have traveled throughout Asia and Africa, and this was by far the worst airline I’ve ever used. The hidden fees add up to the price of any other major airline. You are better off with any other option than this one. Our flight was canceled 4 hours before departure to Cancun and on the way back it was massively delayed. Then their system broke down and everyone waited 1 hour to check in. No free snacks offered. No free entertainment. We were offered a credit for Frontier but I honestly will never use this airline again.

### "communication is key"
Frontier customer service isn’t great, we had a 3 hour lay over, no information was given. We planned a trip to Orlando for a vacation with family, we had plans and we missed out on the activities that we paid for. The person on the intercom you could barely understand what he was saying, we asked to speak to manager and was told the manager was busy, then police came because there was so many people in the waiting area. It’s sad my first and last time flying Frontier and they have the nerve to charge for snacks and pop, we should have been given something for the inconvenience. Now I’m trying to return home and my gate was changed, I was not notified once again while we were in the waiting room and all you see is delayed flights. I hope I make it home today as plan I understand things happen but communication is key!

### "a travelers worst nightmare"
Not Verified |  Purchased round trip tickets for 90 yr old disabled vet, 11 yr old and two adults. We departed from San Antonio to Las Vegas, our return flight was a travelers worst nightmare. Two emails were received regarding delayed departure, got to the airport and we were informed that our flight was canceled! Frontier refused to provide us with any assistance. Such as, access to a wheelchair and certainly no help getting a return flight. We were told to "use the white courtesy phone to arrange for another flight with another airline. Do not use Frontier. They're not there to help you, they're all about taking your money and leaving you stranded.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Islip to Myrtle Beach. Was very nervous/skeptical to fly Frontier given the reviews I have read. I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth the trip actually went. Slight delays coming and going, but nothing that I would say is abnormal. The one negative is that you have to pay extra for everything (bags, snacks, drinks, etc) and there was no in plane entertainment. Other than those factors, the flight was great.

### "Horrible experience"
Cleveland to Denver. Horrible experience, they cancelled our flight at the last minute because of "crew availability" which cost us a lot of money since we had to find a same day flight. We spent over 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get us on another flight, worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Will not ever be flying with Frontier Airlines again no matter how much cheaper it is at the time because you will pay for it later.

### "cost me a huge amount of money"
Seattle to Grand Rapids via Denver. Absolutely abysmal. First and last time I’ve will be flying with them. I needed to get to a wedding in Grand Rapids and they cancelled the flight last minute. The options they gave me would only cost me more money and their representatives were unbelievably unhelpful. They have ruined a very important day for me and cost me a huge amount of money. They should be ashamed of themselves.

### "by far the worst airline"
Denver to Orlando. This is by far the worst airline I have used. They must receive hand down airplanes because 3 times, not once or twice but three times my flight was delayed or canceled. First flight was from colorado springs to Chicago and they delayed the flight for 2 hours and eventually canceled the flight. Again from Denver to Orlando it was delayed 2 hours. Then Orlando to Denver the flight was canceled for mechanical issues but when they knew about the cancellation a day ahead and didnt let anyone know until we were at the ticket counter with the rest of the people for the flight. They canceled it and we couldn't leave for another 2 days.

### "It was completely awful"
San Antonio to Las Vegas. The experience was an awful one from behind to end and we ended not ever even getting into the air! We boarded our flight on time to leave at 0940 & an announcement was made stating there was a “smudge” on the stabilizer & once it was looked at closer it would be signed off on & we would be in the air within 20 minutes. The 20 minutes turned into 35 then 45 then 90 minutes while being strung along by the crew with “it will be just a few more minutes before take off...” they finally allowed us to deboard the aircraft and told us to return at 1300 to board, we returned and were told there were no updates and that no accommodations would be made. After a frenzy the flight was finally declared cancel with no flights out to our destination for about 4 days! We then had to jump through hoops to track down our luggage so that we could change our plans. There was no level of empathy or apology offered by any team member at any point during the process. It was completely awful & I’ll pay extra just to avoid this airline in the future.

### "Unbelievably bad service"
Not Verified |  Unbelievably bad service. Stranded my wife and I in Grand Rapids after cancelling our tickets  without telling us. Customer service was not even close to apologetic. They cost us $1300 to get home. Never again. Extremely unprofessional. Spent hours on the phone with their careless customer service with no helpful resolution.

### "Awful customer service"
Orlando to Omaha. Awful customer service! Delayed 3 times then cancelled with no explanation. Spent hours in airport and all’s they can say is sorry about your luck. Don’t waste your money nor time with Frontier Airlines

### "stuck in Denver with no money"
Me and a friend spent the last of our money to fly from Denver to Grand Rapids back home. The flight was cancelled 8 hours before the flight so now we’re stuck in Denver with no money. The staff in Denver said the only available flight for us to get to Grand Rapids was in two days. They said they would refund us the money it cost us to get a flight from a different airline but we have no money to purchase tickets from another airline in order for them to reimburse us. The staff also said they couldn’t give us meal or a hotel voucher so we are stuck in Denver for two days with no money for food or a hotel. Terrible customer service and the staff was all clueless and rude.

### "Inconvenient and unprofessional"
Flight cancelled on 4th of July. Didn’t even send an email regarding the cancellation. Had to drive all the way to the airport and take a cab back home. Flight got delayed twice on 5th of July. Sent an email regarding the delay one hour prior to the delay. The email should be sent at least 2 hours prior to the delay so that the passengers don’t arrive early. The flight got delayed even while travelling from Minneapolis to Raleigh by two hours. Inconvenient and unprofessional.

### "All staff were pleasant"
I had no real issues at all flying here. The flight was delayed due to plane getting in late. I do not fault the airline because I don't know circumstances of delay, but know it happens on every airline. All staff were pleasant. Seats are very small with little legroom. But I'm 5'2", so no problem. If it were a long flight, I'd be bummed, but it wasn't. Plus they do indicate legroom restrictions on their site, so I knew in advance. I chose to fly no frills and was prepared. I only took a personal item, no didn't need to pay additional carry on charges. I see so many negative reviews, but they are up front on their site, so unsure why complaints of things they should have read. I would fly Frontier Airlines again for short distances.

### "best experience of customer service"
Not Verified |  San Diego to Chicago via Colorado Springs. My flight was delayed over 8 hours due to a maintenance issue and the staff was courteous and informative throughout. We were promptly given mean vouchers worth $15 each and free coffee on the flight as well. The staff kept up their good spirits the whole time. I was particularly pleased with how the delay was handled. $150 compensation vouchers were emailed without having to even ask and the customer care agents were very helpful. This was the best experience of customer service I’ve had in a long time and I would definitely rate it 5 stars. Kudos to Frontier airlines and it’s staff!

### "a delay or cancellation"
Austin to Las Vegas. Do not plan a trip with this airline! The price may seem appealing, but you will not get to your destination without experiencing a delay or cancellation! My flight to Vegas was cancelled and I wasn’t emailed about it until I spent $60 to Uber at the airport. When I went to ask about finding another flight, the soonest one was 3 days later. They said they would provide a $400 voucher to fly with another airline, but that didn’t cover half the cost of the inconvenience or flight with another airline. I had requested off of work and needless to say I didn’t end up going to Las Vegas.

### "barrage of hassles, upsells and add-ons"
Des Moines to Denver. It honestly makes me sad to see what has happened to Frontier. Denver used to have such pride in our hometown airline, but “short-sighted” is a kind way of describing the current management strategy. They’ve entered into the “low-cost” carrier race to the bottom, with enticing ticket prices before the barrage of hassles, upsells and add-ons make you wish you had never heard of them. It’s a terrible business model. Terrible customer experience. Leads to terrible employee morale. Just an awful shell of its former self at this point.

### "did absolutely nothing to help"
Not Verified | Denver to Salt Lake City. I will never fly with Frontier again. We booked a round trip flight and our returning flight was scheduled for Wednesday July 4th at 8:47 am. Once we arrived to check in they informed us the flight didn’t exist, even though we could pull that flight up on the website and we got multiple email confirmations. They did absolutely nothing to help or accommodate us other than say “well there’s a flight tomorrow for 8:47 am.” The worst customer service I have ever encountered. We then had to buy tickets through Delta to return home at a much higher cost and for a later time, inconveniencing us financially and time wise. I am extremely disappointed with this airline and if you read any reviews you will see that they are all 1 star for a reason. I don’t know how this airline stays in business but I can tell you for sure that I am usually a Delta flyer and I will never stray from them again. Frontier, I would reccomend hiring better employees and cleaning up your act. I’m a business owner myself and would never leave a review if i didn’t 100% mean it because I truly believe good customer service can change any bad experience. But this airline did nothing to even try to make up for this for horrible occurrence. Shame on you.

### "avoid Frontier Airlines at all costs"
Raleigh to Las Vegas. Worst airline experience ever! The inbound aircraft was delayed by over two hours with absolutely no information what so ever. I just received any email stating the new departure time. After waiting at the gate for over an hour past our new departure time we get notified that our flight is cancelled because of the “seven day rule” which does not allow flight attendants to work for more than seven consecutive days. I don’t understand how the airline or the flight attendant didn’t notify someone before the inbound flight was delayed. The issue could have been averted hours earlier. Then the entire plane was instructed to move to the ticketing counter to receive vouchers. We stood in line at the ticketing counter for almost an hour and a half with absolutely no one there to help or assist us. When we finally do get assistance we are told that the next available flight won’t be for another two days. They will not book us on another airline but we have the option to purchase a new ticket with a new airline with our own money and they will reimburse us up to $400 within thirty days. There are absolutely no other flights to get us to Las Vegas from North Carolina for $400 within the next week. Other passengers tried avoiding the line and calling customer service themselves but were on hold with the company for well over an hour. And the icing on the cake was finding out my checked bag had been missing because they forgot to place it on the conveyer belt. Bottom line is to avoid Frontier Airlines at all costs.

### "fly any other airline"
Philadelphia to Denver. My bestie and I have had this trip planned for months to see our other bestie in Denver. Loved the prices Frontier offered. If only we knew the headache it caused us. The flight was delayed twice and then was cancelled an hour later and there was no notification in the handy dandy app you have. After spending 20 minutes trying to find an information desk and helpful employee, we went back to get more information and hopefully find a way to start our vacation. The crew “timed out” so they had to cancel. The customer service representatives acted like it was an inconvenience to them for us being mad and confused why our flight was delayed. We were told we were going to get our money back and a $500 voucher each from Frontier to only be told via e-mail it would be $200 each. Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to fly any other airline. I wish I did that from the start. I would like the money I was promised in person. I would also recommend employing people with better customer service ability. Also, crew members to fly the plane you oh so generously offered us and cancelled 2 hours before the departure time.

### "several hour delays"
Denver to Salt Lake City. Does the CEO of Frontier care that this airline has done nothing but go straight downhill in the last 5 years? I will avoid this airline at all costs. This was their third chance and they did it again. They simply cannot be on time. Several hour delays lead to missed connections, lost luggage and entire vacations or business trips ruined. They are grossly understaffed and no one has time to help you. Good luck talking to anyone or getting any answers. They instilled zero confidence that our plane would depart on time but never changed rhe departure time online or within the posted flights at the airport. Lastly you get nothing without encountering additional fees. No seat assignment. No carry on. Not even water. What a joke this airline is. Sorry excuse for a business

### "seats are narrow with no leg room"
Denver to Pittsburgh. We will never fly Frontier again. This is the second time in a week our flight with Frontier is delayed more than 2 hours. No texts or communication so we arrived at the airport for our originally scheduled departure. No obvious reason for the delay, not weather related. Bag drop itself took 45 minutes, the line was ridiculous! Also I've never been on such an uncomfortable plane. Seats are narrow with no leg room. Cabin was incredibly warm.

### "7 hours without anything "
Cancun to St Louis. Our first return flight from Mexico was delayed for an hour and then cancelled with no explanation of why, after we waited for 6 hours in the airport. We were then transferred by bus to a hotel which left much to be desired. Our flight was rescheduled for the next day and it also was delayed for an hour. Then we were loaded onto buses and taken to our plane which had no terminal, we loaded by steps on the tarmac. Once in flight for 2.5 hours we were told that there was bad weather in St Louis and we didn't have enough fuel to circle until it passed. We were rerouted to Kansas City where we stayed for 45 minutes. We finally landed in St Louis at 8pm and we boarded the plane at 3pm. We then had to wait for another broken down plane to be moved from the terminal that we needed to unload into until 10pm, 7 hours on the plane. What should have been a 3 hour flight took us 7 hours. We were only offered refreshments at the beginning of the flight, but not again after that. 7 hours without anything is a bit ridiculous.

### "delayed 4 times then cancelled"
Not Verified | Worst airline experience of my life. We were flying from Las Vegas to Cleveland. Our flight was delayed 4 times in perfect weather only to be cancelled at midnight due to crew being timed out, something which an airline should be able to know about several hours before the flight. They were anything but helpful in booking hotels and new flights. You have to do that all on your own. Never have I had to do that when I’ve had canceled flights in similar situations. Also, Frontier could not get us to our destination for 2 full days. They only reimburse you a set amount, which we went over, and you have to front the cost. It cost me $2700 to fly and house my family, $800 which I will not be reimbursed. I spoke with customer service and they did not say anything that their generic form letter didn’t already say. They did not reimburse our difference and had no resolution to the situation. I will never be flying with this airline again. If you need to be someplace the day following your suggested flight time, I would book another airline, because even when the weather is fine, there’s no guarantee you will make it to your destination that day.

### "not recommend this airline"
New Orleans to Raleigh Durham. I was told that our plane needed a new tire. Well the tire has been fixed and now I'm told that we are waiting on paper work to be cleared to fly. I have sat on this plane for 2 hours without being offered a drink or snack, I'm on flight 1788. Now I'm told we need fuel. All of these things should have been done before I boarded the plane. This will be my last time flying Frontier and I will not recommend this airline to no one.

### "Terrible airline"
New Orleans to Denver. Terrible airline, have flown Frontier 4 times and each time there has been an issue. Plane arrived 3 hours late, they lost my bag, they overbooked the plane twice. Oh and we showed up early to check in and there was nobody at the desk to check my bags, there was a line out the door for our flight and nobody came to the desk until there was less than an hour and a half left until boarding. Seats are uncomfortable and you must pay extra for everything, seems cheap at first but after all the fees, and what not it ends up being the same price as other airlines. They even charge you for soda, I actually boarded this plane at 1:30 and we still have not taken off because they overbooked the plane by 5 people.

### "I would rather walk"
Providence to Orlando. There are no words to describe how horrible every interaction with this airline is. The staff are the rudest, most miserable people I’ve ever come in contact with and it seems like they go out of their way to inconvenience flyers. I would rather walk to another state then have to sit through another Frontier flight to get there. This review is based on multiple flights and customer service issues. Don’t put yourself through hell to save money on their cheap flights that still nickel and dime you for every little thing. Trust me, you’ll be happy you spent your money with a different airline that treats you humanely.

### "will never be flying Frontier again"
Flew Denver to Las Vegas. Everything was swell until an announcement of a delay, no big deal, just an extra 30 minutes. That turned into over an hour. When my party of two had found our seats (flight attendant was nice enough to help find our seats) we received an announcement requesting my name, in which I responded of course. Frontier had decided to move our seats (which was overpriced for our carry-one) no big deal, just different seats. Except, I had been split from my party without my acknowledgment nor my opinion of the decision, will never be flying Frontier again, or recommend the airline whatsoever.

### "waited at airport for 8.5 hours"
Not Verified |  Due to fly Denver to Houston. We waited at the airport for 8.5 hours and they kept on delaying the flight until finally at 1 am they canceled. I’m highly disappointed with this airline and will never fly Frontier Airlines ever again.

### "Avoid flying with Frontier"
Las Vegas to Miami. My flight was delayed for nearly 3 hours, as they said, because the plane had too much fuel and needed to defuel since it was not the plane for this route originally. Delay is okay as mishaps can happen unexpectedly. The crew was not nearly as friendly as Southwest. They don't provide internet and or giving an option to purchase. The worst part was not being offered any snacks or drinks unless you pay for them, and they were expensive. After the delay, there was barely time to get to the next flight which is also understandable. However, on another 4 hour flight, they offered nothing to drink as a courtesy especially to the delayed group unless asking for it and they'd give you a small cup of water with not so happy facial expression. If I'd compare to Southwest, they have a negative 10 points. Indeed, they didn't seem to care much for little kids needs which is such a shame because that is most important. And luggage claim, the longest wait ever as if they were looking for someone to load them up. To top it all off, they lost our luggage. Avoid flying with Frontier airline at all cost.

### "service isn't that great"
June 30, 2018. Flying from CA to MN and we had a layover in CO. The flight to CO was fine however our flight to MN from CO has been delayed, 3 times. The service isn't that great and even though flights are cheap, paying for check-in or even a carry-on is $45, each. Nothing is complimentary and they delay flights for hours with no explanation (and I assure you it is not due to weather). I've never had a problem flying Delta, United or American Airlines and this was my first experience flying Frontier, but I am never flying Frontier again. On the flight schedule board there were many Frontier flights delayed for other locations while other airlines were not delayed and I'm definitely going to paying more for a different flight next time.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Raleigh to Minneapolis. Desk agent made us miss the flight, no refund. We arrived at RDU two hours before the flight, checked our one bag, and verified boarding using their mobile service. Then when we got to the security gate, the boarding passes would not load and we ran to the check-in counter to ask them to immediately call to the gate and reprint the boarding passes. The woman (Friday June 29, 3pm) took so much time not listening to what we were saying that by the time she understood that we were asking for, the plane had just begun to board (this was now 25 minutes before departure). She still would not make that simple call! Instead she kept trying to look for new bookings and stall. Meanwhile, we lost the chance to board, we lost the chance to reclaim our luggage, and we were now stuck. I am traveling with a person with special needs who left his medication in the luggage, by the way. A different agent came up and said that since we were “locked down,” he would put a note in the file so that we could at least get a refund. And he would call later about holding the luggage in Minneapolis. No call, no note in the system, and no cooperation when calling the number he provided for Frontier assistance. This has been a nightmare that is now costing us $800 just to rebook with a different airline to get to our destination-a day and a half later. Frontier has horrible customer service and no integrity.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified | Philadelphia to Orlando. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. This is my first time flying frontier, and I am more than dissatisfied. I thought the cheaper airfare was a good deal, until you pay an arm and a leg for luggage including carry ons. My entire family of 5 was split up after picking and paying for preassigned seats so we could all sit together. I was stuck in a row next to a flight attended who very rudely slammed down his seat into my arm. And the entire flight I almost felt like I was harassed by flight attendants who just wouldn’t keep quiet. There’s comes a point where service is just annoying, and talking on the loud speaker 5min + multiple times, was the tip of the iceberg. It also took almost an hour after the plan landed to start retrieving luggage. Which I guess the handlers of my luggage just wanted to see how far they could launch it onto the conveyor belt, because my make up that was wrapped up was opened and destroyed. Seriously will never ever fly again. Horrible airline.

### "not really liking it so far"
Not Verified | Trenton  to Charleston. First time flying this airline and I’m not really liking it so far. Ground service, Seat Comfort, and Legroom was awful. TSA guys at Trenton were telling us where we are going to and why and that set me off a little. The crew were very good. Frontier Airlines  charge for food & Beverages.

### "done with this airline"
Seattle to Denver. I purchased a ticket through one of their "AH-MAZING" deals, turns out the this deal comes with all types of ridiculous issues and poor customer care. Their hidden fees for seat selections and crazy baggage rules for carry ins were the beginning of their demise in my opinion. However they now play this game when their aircraft are not at a certain capacity they delay and cancel flights on you, citing "mechanical" problems. I had a 7.35pm flight originally which started with a 2 hour delay at 10am that morning -  a delay that early? The next email I received came in at 2pm with your flight has been cancelled! I sat on hold for 48 minutes to try and find out what the heck was going only to be told the plane had mechanical problems. They then rebooked me without offering me any type of compensation or credit vouchers. I was rebooked on the next flight out at 1255am red eye to Denver, this plane is also delayed due to the flight crew was not in the building! We are now an overcrowded plane of passengers with tired children, cranky passengers and if we want a snack or drink forget it, because they charge you for everything and we get to sit in plastic seats that no one can fit in. I rather pay more on another airline than have my time wasted. I am done with this airline!

### "not be flying with Frontier again"
I purchased a round trip from Indianapolis to Orlando, this was my first time flying and Frontier provided a terrible experience. The flight to Orlando was delayed 7 hours and now my flight home is already delayed an hour. Not only is this inconvenient for me, but also for the people picking me up. They provided a credit, which is very much appreciated, but it’s terms stated I had to use it within 90 days and it’s not possible for me to use it within that window. I understand delays happen, but this has just been absolutely ridiculous. I will not be flying with Frontier again.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Washington to Colorado Springs. Killed my first vacation in 3 years. I was going to fly to a friends wedding and they canceled the flight. Now I understand that these things happen but it was how they handled the cancellation that has me so upset. First I received the text that the flight was delayed after I had already arrived at the airport and been told by the ticketing counter that it was canceled. Next the contractors at the counter were extremely rude, loudly letting me know that they were contractors not employed by Frontier and making it all too clear that they could care less about my frustrations. Normally in an instance such as this the airline would try to find you another flight to get you to your destination as close to your time as possible, but not Frontier. Frontier simply gives you a piece of paper and a phone number and tells you to figure it out on your own. That piece of paper that they handed me says that they will offer me $400 dollars to find a new flight, which is a joke. There were absolutely no flights that could get me to my destination on time for anything less then double that price. I again approached the frontier desk and was told that I was out of luck and anything over the 400 was my obligation, again letting me know that they were contractors and could care less about my problem. Next I call the number they gave me to let them know that their reimbursement was not satisfactory and they simply passed me from office to office. After 1 hour and 20 minutes of being on hold I gave up. Now I am out the costs associated with the trip that I could not cancel as I was within the 24 hr cancelation window totaling more then $1000 of which the customer service that I did get to speak to, before being put on hold, claimed was not their responsibility. I will never fly with Frontier again and will actively advise all I know to avoid as well. By far and away the worst experience I have ever had with an airline!

### "delayed an hour then cancelled"
Not Verified | Pensacola to Denver. Flight was delayed an hour, then was cancelled. Having nowhere to sleep for the night I asked for assistance and received a hotel voucher. Arrived the next day for the rebooked flight and it was also delayed and took off an hour after it was supposed to.

### "saved thousands of dollars "
Atlanta to New York. I traveled Frontier Airlines multiple Times and have always had a great experience. Overall, I’ve saved thousands of dollars traveling with this airline. Their representative was very patient and thoughtful while booking my four flights over the phone. Their app was convenient for listing the itinerary, checking in, and keeping me up to date. The staff is friendly, and the plane was clean. You pay a fraction of the cost in comparisons to other airlines, so don’t get upset if you have to pay a fee for baggage or snacks, watching tv, eating snacks, and having a reclining seat.

### "possibly the worst airline"
Tampa to Providence. This is quite possibly the worst airline you could choose to fly with. Today, 6/29/18, we got to the gate and were met with a clumsy and unsophisticated gate assistant who did not know how to vocalize in proper and concise English. The plane before us was delayed, and then they claimed there was a security issue. This resulted in a one hour delay. They then allowed us to board, and once we were completely boarded, they told us there was actually a slough of maintenance issues that needed to be fixed. This then resulted in an additional two hour delay with all of us on the plane, because their paperwork was apparently not being processed. They were about to let passengers leave the plane purely because of laws regarding delays, but would’ve forced us to take all of our luggage with us and then would leave if we weren’t right at the gate when they were ready. Additionally, all of the attendants and pilots on board were ill-spoken and clumsy as well. I will never fly on this airline again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy.

### "never fly Frontier again"
I will never fly Frontier again. Cheap flights because they charge you for everything else. There is NO service on flight unless you buy something. Flights delayed, charges for bags, charges for carry on, charges for water or pop. Unbelievably rude staff, especially in Vegas. They charged us $90 for 2 medium bags and wouldn't give us a receipt. When I asked for a receipt I was told "businesses don't give receipts anymore". I told them I needed a receipt for business travel so he put a receipt on my boarding pass. There was no receipt. Just a sticker with flight info. I went back to get a receipt and he said "Do you really need a receipt or do you just want to argue with me? Frontier obviously doesn't believe in, or train their employees about customer service. I have traveled for 30 years and never had a worse experience. Looking at the flight board and every Frontier flight is currently delayed. We've spent more time being delayed than it took to fly roundtrip. Awful airline and employees.

### "zero customer service"
Atlanta to Las Vegas. Nobody books with Frontier expecting the best or the frills but the treatment that we have received is inexcusable. After roughly 7 hours of delays and a complete lack of communication some of the customers ended up grabbing the intercom system and venting on there because there was no one at the front desk. Instead of responding to that appropriately they sent someone from the ground crew to guard the mic while everyone else hid in the plane. After about 2 hours of standing security showed up and then they cancelled the flight. Then we had to wait forever again at the ticket counter to receive a sheet of paper outlining what our options might be and we are still waiting for our baggage. There is zero communication, zero customer service, and to be honest their treatment is worse then nothing.

### "8 hour delay and then cancelled"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Columbus. Me and my wife had a early morning flight that was delayed by 8 hours. I was so upset because an 8 hour delay is absurd.To come to the realization that is was because of crew fatigue. I am more understanding than most so I thought. I don't want my pilot tired and not rested because I'd rather make it late and safe than not at all, but then following my 8 hour delay we were cancelled! Cancelled why? because you can't wake up the pilot? I have never used Frontier and I will never try again. Because of their mess me and my wife had to book 2 flights to Columbus a day later which was $460. After all the reviews read and 3 stars out of 10 I am surprised this company is able to continue to be in business after cancelling their flights!

### "would not accept us any more"
Not Verified |  Frontier at Islip NY airport is horrible we got their 5 minutes after their 45 min before flight checked bags policy, and they would not accept us any more. The lady was very rude and was using all types of excuses to not let us fly. I did all the early check ins even spent extra for the checked bag ahead of time, but it did not matter to this lady she even told us to just leave the bag and go. I had my wife crying next to me and the lady couldn't care less. I called customer service after she walked away from us and the could only give me credit for 90 days and at half the price i paid - and the flight was delayed 2 hours and they still couldn't board us.

### "never use Frontier Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Austin to Ontario. Got to the airport to return home and was waiting to board. Of the 200 passengers waiting someone heard the counter help talking about how this flight was cancelled which started a lot of people being upset. This caused the counter help to have to tell everyone and the reason given was there was bad weather in Atlanta. I checked weather in Atlanta and found it was 72 degrees with a slight wind. Flight cancelled, lied to and not even offered some sort of incentive for the trouble, just on your own. When asked for a refund they said that will come around seven days from now, we dont have that kind of money here. Last minute flights were 1000 dollars which was unacceptable, so we stayed another night which was a loss of work, rescheduling transportation and expense of a hotel room. Some were in tears and the employees could care less. I know some people did not have the money on them for another day but like I said the employees could care less. I will never use Frontier Airlines again, I might have have loss my trip home but Frontier lost a customer for good.

### "We had delays on both legs"
Not Verified |  Washington to Phoenix via Denver. I had heard that Frontier Airlines had a poor record for on-time flights, but was able to get a good discount on tickets for 5 people. Not worth it to save $750. We had delays on both legs of our trip, lies, different stories on reason for delay, 8 gate changes. An entirely frustrating experience, which caused us to arrive five hours late in PHX. My husband, my children and I were exhausted. We ended up easily spending the $750 that we saved on tickets on cabs, food and entertainment in airport, and most of all frustration. Do not go for the cheap flight, you WILL regret it. I spoke with at least seven different people who were flying Frontier for the first time last night, all said they will never use this airline again. They sent us a $25 discount each on any flight via email, but I will never use the discounts. You get what you pay for.

### "Terrible airline experience"
Phoenix to Cincinnati. Terrible airline experience. Arrived at airport at 0745, email at 0752 informed us that our flight was delayed over 5 hours. No reason given. Personnel sent to handle the questions were young, seemed inexperienced, and not helpful. Meal vouchers given out after mealtimes, I.e. Breakfast vouchers given at 10 am, lunch vouchers at 1:10 pm. Vouchers inadequate to buy a meal in the airport. Once flight left (over 5 hours late) personnel in the plane ignored the fact that the flight had been delayed over 5 hours and acted as if all were fine. Worst of all, when we got to Cincinnati the luggage was not on the belt for over 90 minutes. Over 100 people were waiting for luggage, and when passengers and airport personnel tried to find any employee from Frontier none could be found in the airport. Passengers became so angry police had to be called to quiet the scene. Unbelievable that with the delays no Frontier airline employee could be found. This airline stinks, not worth the savings.

### "Every flight has been delayed"
Not Verified |  Detroit to Orlando. This is the worst airline ever. Every flight I have ever taken with Frontier has been delayed for over 4 hours. Last November my family planned a trip to Miami, however before we could make it to Florida our flight was delayed 8 hours! I vowed to never fly Frontier again. We were given $150 voucher to fly with this airline again. We reluctantly purchased another ticket with our vouchers. What a mistake! We should have learned from the first experience. When we arrived to the airport, we received a text message stating, ‘Travel Alert!! Frontier flight 1669 leaving from Detroit is delayed. Departure now estimated at 15:21”. We were delayed 3 times for 3 hours! And now, as I sit waiting for my 2 hour delayed flight, I cross my fingers hoping I don’t have to spend the rest of the day being disappointed by this subpar airline.

### "never fly this airline again"
Orlando to Cleveland. This airline is unprofessional, incompetent, and really should be looked at closer by officials. Drove from Tallahassee, FL (4.5 hrs) to Orlando to catch a flight with my 14 yr old son. Flight was delayed 5.5 hours due to a broken part on the plane that needed to be fixed. Scheduled to land at 7:22 pm in Cleveland, but ended up landing at 12:30 am. Then, 4 days later, I drive from Cleveland to Columbus (1.5 hrs) to catch flight back to Orlando only to be told when I arrived that my flight was canceled and “sorry”. I was handed a piece of paper and was told good luck. I asked what I should do and the lady looked over at the other airlines and said “ go see if any of them have a flight for you”. Didn’t offer to help me, didn’t offer to look to see if there were any other flights available. Nothing. I call customer service to get refund, and the rep could’ve cared less about my dilemma. I usually do not take the time to write reviews unless it’s a stellar one, but In this case, I feel it is necessary to add to the rest of these unfortunate stories. Will never fly this airline again. I truly believe they should be shut down. For good. For everyone’s sake.

### "disappointed and disheartened"
Not Verified |  St Louis to Las Vegas. I had a trip planned to Vegas for my birthday, waited at the airport over 3 delays only for them to cancel the flight at 8:00 pm (we were supposed to board at 8:15). When I called customer service while waiting behind at least 200 people at the gate. I was offered no options to fly to Vegas for 2 More days (as we were told was the earliest flight available) despite my asking for any airport in a 5 hour drive radius so that I didn’t lose all the other money on shows, hotel, etc. They offered zero support through other airlines and literally repeatedly read from a script. I asked for a supervisor Restated the same phrase over again. It is completely unacceptable to make someone wait for 2 days to get to their destination and offer nothing but a refund (or the next available flight 2 days later - the day of our return! )- which doesn’t help because every other airlines quadrupled their prices to get a ticket the following day. Not at all a comparable consideration. I have never experienced such unacceptable treatment from any other airline I’ve ever used. Ultimately, after much discussion and begging, we were given flights at an airport 7.5 hours of a drive away so drove overnight, booked another hotel, to again try to leave tomorrow afternoon. Unfortunately, my Vegas hotel and show will not be refunded the night of due to No notice and we will also have to book an additional hotel room in Vegas as well. I have lost over $500 by trying to fly with this airline. I would think at minimum they could utilize other airlines to assist you to get to the destination sooner than 2 days! I’m so disappointed and disheartened.

### "Flights both ways were delayed"
Chicago to Orlando. Flights both ways were delayed over 2 hours. Frontier has the most uncomfortable seats I have  sat in as they are a piece of metal with cheap plastic over it. The tray tables are the size of my hand which means nothing can be fit on there. The flight attendants were more than rude the whole trip. To top it all off when I got my bag from bag claim it was covered in honey. Yes my bag was drenched in honey and the clothes on the inside were ruined as was the luggage. Frontier said just said “sorry” and they couldn’t do anything. My luggage was ruined because of someone else’s negligence. Cheap and horrible customer service. Do not ever take this airline.

### "do not care about customers"
Orlando to Seattle via Denver. I had a flight planned a week in advance. They changed my booking on me at the last second without me even realizing thankfully I checked a day before I was supposed to go because my original flight was at 7am from Orlando to Denver then my final destination Seattle. I got a new email without my consent or knowledge that my new route would take me out at 5:15pm and I would arrive at the same time as originally scheduled. Fine. If that was the case - it wasn’t. I now had another stop in new Mexico and every stop including the one leaving the airport from Orlando was delayed an hour or more. When I got to New Mexico first they weren’t able to get the machine that connects to the plane and allows you to get off or board to work so I was sitting in the plane for an hour waiting for that to be fixed before they finally said they couldn’t fix it and was just going to tow the plane to a new gate. When we got to the new gate they then said they had a mechanical issue and had to have a mechanic come and check it out. Took 3 hours to fix. When we finally were able to board the plane they weren’t able to just scan our passes and let us on after this huge inconvenience (probably because we were at a jetblue gate or the scanner was broken) no they had to speak with a Frontier representative over the phone and one by one call the name of the person and make sure they were allowed to be on the plane. Added another hour just to board. When we finally did board and everything was good to go, I got to Denver 2 hours behind schedule and missed my flight to Seattle. In New Mexico I addressed this issue and they couldn’t refund me the full amount for the ticket out there I would have to wait until I got to Denver and was only able to reschedule me for 2 days out when I had already payed for a hotel and a rental service out in Seattle. They Didn’t care was quite nasty with me and gave me a 10$ meal voucher and a 25$ voucher off my next flight. To make things worse after 30 mins of arguing back and forth I said screw it I’ll just buy another plane ticket don’t touch my reservation leave it how it is I’ll figure this out later. When I get to Denver and ask about my itinerary they changed my reservation for the second time and weren’t even able to give me my return flight back to Orlando because my seat had been filled because some idiot can’t understand blatant English so I had To return on a Friday instead of a Thursday and come back one day late From my trip. They do not care about their customers they are a cheap airline with cheap business practices you may have one or 2 good flights but I can promise paying an extra 100$ is worth not having to deal with the problems this airline will put you through when they mess up.

### "Poor service all around"
Grand Rapids to Denver. They don’t offer a reason or explanation for delays. I left my family to visit more family members, and would love to have spent more time with either, rather than wait for an indeterminate amount of time alone at the airport. Unless they have a symbiotic relationship with the airport snack vendors, there’s no excuse. Poor service all around.

### "can’t fly out till Friday"
Not Verified |  San Antonio to Washington Dulles. Will never recommend Frontier Airlines. Canceled on Monday can’t fly out till Friday. On hold over 1 hour on the 3rd call to change flights! Worst customer service and scheduling. No compensation for hotel, food or car and my husband can’t work for 4 days. Other airlines offer at least a meal and a hotel.

### "worst experience ever"
Atlanta to Salt Lake City. This has been the worst experience ever. My sister and I bought these tickets to fly back and see friends whom we had moved away from. My friends mom drove us two and half hours to the airport and when we got there, it was just delayed. Then, after two hours of waiting, they canceled the flight with no reason. My parents waited two and a half hours to talk to anyone and when they finally did talk to someone they were told the earlier flight they could get us was 5 days away. Then insurance (which we purchased) could only get us food and hotel stay. However, hotels would not let us stay since were are 15 and 13. My parents had to purchase same day tickets from Delta to get us home. It has been great with Delta, but we will never fly Frontier again.

### "Worst travel experience"
Philadelphia to Grand Rapids. Worst travel experience I've had in over 40 years of travel. Purchased round trip tickets. Both legs had huge delays which we not communicated in advance Customers service reps are poorly trained, surly and were of no help. Had to demand they check my bags so that I wasn't stuck waiting in the departure area that had limited seating and no amenities. Reason given for the delay both times was that they did not have a crew available. Isn't that how to run an airline? Schedule a flight and have a crew seems to be basic. Lost out on business both ways due to their delays and they could not care less.

### "urge you to bypass this airline"
Not Verified |  Columbus to Orlando. My husband and I are frequent travelers. We had never flown Frontier until recently - their prices were so good, why not give them a try? Our trip back home to Orlando from Columbus started off well enough. We checked in for our flight the day before, arrived 2.5 hours early, got to our gate and that's when it started. A supervisor walked up to the few of us that were at the gate and informed us that our flight had been canceled. They offered to put us on another flight - two days later (there seems to be a trend here, based on the other reviews). He handed us a piece of paper, instructed us to follow the directions in order to file a claim, and said, "Sorry.. I don't have any other information. We got to the Frontier ticket counter. There were two young ladies there, who instructed us to go get another ticket on another airline. Other airlines would try to help their customers secure alternate travel plans. After running from counter to counter (with options ranging as high as $800 per person), we secured two tickets for +$453 each. I would mention Frontier's poor customer service, only there wasn't any... zip! We will never, ever do business with this airline again. I urge you to bypass this airline.

### "do not care about their customers"
On Sat, June 16: My family had a 6:30AM flight for our long-awaited vacation. We arrived at the airport at 4:50AM, 20 min behind the recommended 2 hour window. We got in line at the Frontier Ticket area to check-in at 5:20AM (Still 1hr 10min before our flight). There were about 200 customers checking in & only two attendants. We got to the front of the line at 5:52AM (38 min before departure). Frontier stops accepting baggage 45 min before departure. We were 7 minutes late, even though we were in their line the whole time. Frontier had no available seats on any other flights from anywhere in TX until Monday. To maintain our vacation plans, we bought 1-way tickets on a different airline. I called Frontier's rep today (10 days later) to discuss a partial refund. The rep recited their policy, saying they are under no obligation to help us. Even if the flight we offer is a month later, if you refuse it, we offer no refunds. He also said he refused, because I was calling so later after the fact. (I explained that we did not call while on the vacation, and this was the first chance since our return.) He refused to refund the $76 in pre-purchased baggage fees, even though they never touched our bags. Bottom Line: Frontier strips their services to the bare bones to "save you money. They do not care about their customers and will do nothing to help. I highly recommend against any families or businesses using their services, because there will be no flexibility when life happens.

### "worst overall flying experience"
Portland to Louisville via Denver. First my flight was cancelled without notice prior to arrival at the airport. Then the ticket agents and the customer service agent were not helpful and somewhat rude. 3 hours after we were to take off I got the cancellation email after I already booked a flight on Delta (they had great customer service). Finally got to Denver just to find out when they were about to board we were being delayed up to 2 hours. Worst overall flying experience I have ever had.

### "still awaiting a response"
Philadelphia to San Juan. My son had to use the bathroom. The fasten seatbelt was on but very little turbulence if any was going on when I took my son to the restroom. Now I am afraid of heights and flying and I was just fine walking to the back of the plain. When I got back there the flight attendant was standing in front of the restroom. I said my son needs to use the bathroom. She said didn’t you see the fasten seatbelt is on and that he had to wait. I said he is autistic and also has irritable bowl syndrome he can’t wait. She chuckled at her coworker and said we needed to return to our seat. Not a laughing matter in my mind but I did return to my seat. 25 minutes went by my son in excruciating pain was yelling and screaming that he needed to use the bathroom. 35 min later the flight attendant approached me and said you can take him at your own risk. Well if she would’ve said that in the beginning it wouldn’t have been an issue but to put my son through this pain, think of his medical issues a laughing matter is definitely something that is a problem. I filed a complaint over two weeks ago and I am still awaiting a response from upper management.

### "No alerts, no announcements"
First and foremost I want to say that I will never fly with this airline again. Myself, along with 2 other adults, a 1 year old and 5 year old were supposed to board our plane to Cincinnati at 8.10pm. Around 3 or 4 we received a text message stating that our flight would be delayed until 1.00am. No information on why. Maybe a hour or so later, we received another text that said our flight was pushed back an extra 41 minutes. My family and I decided to go to the airport at 6.30pm, check our lungage in, and simply just wait until it was time to board our flight. After sitting there for about 3 and a half hours we looked up at the board and seen that the status of our flight had went from delayed to cancelled. No alerts, no announcements, and no words from anyone from Frontier on what we should do next. After finally speaking with two female representatives we were told that there would be no food or hotel accommodations and that the only thing they could offer us was up to a 400 dollar reimbursement if we booked another flight only. No mention of getting a refund on the flight that was cancelled. The next available flight to Cincinnati would be on Tuesday which is two days away. After complaining for quite sometime, we were finally offered one 15 dollar food voucher for 3 adults and two children. I am typing this as we load into a rental car at 4.00am, to make this 13 hour drive back home. I know things happen, but the customer service we experienced yesterday sucked. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "said flight was canceled"
Austin to Washington Dulles. Arrived at 10:30am for my 1245 flight. As soon as I got through security I got a text that my flight was delayed 1 hour. Went to the gate to board and we got on the plane, sat there for an hour and then were told we had to get off and the flight was delayed until 5pm. At 5 we all showed up at the gate and the airport screen said flight was canceled. The ladies at the desk said they didn't know and no one got email, or texts. After a while they confirmed it was canceled and they could rebook or refund the tickets. They did refund me the tickets but when I asked for my money back for my luggage they said they couldn't that I had to contact the airlines. I have been trying to contact the airlines and all I get is an automated system that doesn't give me the option for luggage refund. Next flight is in 5 days. My husband and I need to get back to work, They claimed this was due to weather. There were three other flights to the same location that took off from the airport that day. I also know that the airport I was going to was landing flights all day. It was not the weather. Also, because it was canceled due to weather we don't get any compensation. So we have to drive an hour to get back. Don't get fooled by the cheap prices it's better to pay more than go through all this pain.

### "For a short trip it's fine"
Not Verified | For a short trip like the one from Miami to Puerto Rico, it's fine. On a flight of less than three hours, with free water is enough. The seats do not lean back, but for a short trip this is ok. If you pay for the luggage when you are booking: the value of the suitcase is $35, if you pay one day later it is $38 and if you pay at the airport it is $40. If you make a mistake in the name and want to rectify it, it's $38. I recommend that you focus a lot on the size of the equipment and the weight, I did it, and it went well. The Frontier App is very good. The plane was clean, the flights back and forth was on time. It was my first experience with them..

### "I demanded a full refund"
Not Verified |  Actually, I never flew at all, was scheduled to, but Frontier airlines had a weather cancellation, again, so I am sitting in the Fort Myers airport, where I am awaiting Southwest, a real airline. I did actually get into the air last year with them, worst flight of my life, said I would never do it again. Next time I will listen to my own advice. You might get a low fare, but after fees and such, that is the end of savings. Truly bottom of the barrel. I demanded a full refund, and now I am in the process of canceling all my mileage and other membership. Horrible, horrible airline!

### "a gamble to fly Frontier"
Not Verified |  Denver to Savannah. It’s nice to save a little money but it’s such a gamble to fly Frontier and not worth the money you save. They cancelled our flight with zero notice or reason. Waited on hold for 1.5 hours and they said it would be 4 days until they could fly us out. Are you kidding me Frontier? Most pathetically ran airline in the United States who is full of nothing but excuses.

### "can't even get planes in the air"
Not Verified |  Planned a trip for my family from St Louis to Orlando. The flight was scheduled for 4 pm. at noon we got our first text stating the flight was delayed an hour. After 3 more texts the flight was finally set for 930 pm. We drive to the airport and wait the two hours only to find out from another passenger that they had already canceled the flight. Now at this point the poor woman at the desk states, she wasn't told about the cancellation, and she was just as upset that they refused to tell her. She then stated they only fly out of St Louis once per day, and the next two days had no seats available. She also said 7 other flights were canceled that same day. I can understand if it was an "act of god situation". But the weather across the us is clear to fly today. So now i have to cancel, disney world, the hotel, the car, the trip to nasa, and burned through a week of vacation time. All because this airline can't even get planes in the air. Please spend the money and go with a reputable airline. We only picked this horrible airline because g-ma wanted to take the family on a trip and pay for it. Now i get to make all these phone calls at 1130 at night. Never again with this joke of a company.

### "delayed several times"
Frontier Airlines, when absolutely don’t care if you get to your final destination. Sitting in Denver for 5 hours now with several more to go as my flight has been delayed several times. There are several other flights from Frontier that have also been delayed or canceled. These are not weather related. No info, no vouchers, no gate employees to speak with.

### "Delays. Cancellations"
Delays. Cancellations. No complimentary snacks. Asked the attendant twice for napkins, never got any. Went to the restroom myself to gather some. Just another company looking for money and not caring for the human race.

### "delays and cancellations"
I will never use this “bargain basement” of an airline again. All the delays and cancellations I’ve had with Frontier are npt worth the few dollars I’ve saved.

### "D"elayed the last 4 flights
Washington to Phoenix. Awful airline. Delayed the last 4 flights I've flown with them. The latest was delayed by over 3 hours with little to no communication as to what was going on or when we would be able to depart. Uncomfortable seats, zero hospitality with food/beverage, no outlets or in flight entertainment. Yes, it's simply just a ticket, but you get what you pay for and these flights aren't enough less than full-service airlines to merit this low quality.

### "Worst experience of my life"
Not Verified |  Don't fly this airline! I used to always fly Frontier Airlines and I loved it. Well I had a surprise wedding anniversary trip to Vegas planned, but Frontier had other plans. We flew from San Antonio to Colorado (where our layover was) and as we sat on the plane waiting to take off the crew got on the intercom to tell us the flight was cancelled because the pilot timed out. We get off the plane and they tell us there are no flights to Vegas and pretty much we are stuck here and we are on our own in Colorado Springs. Well, just our luck, there is a golf tournament going on here and there are no hotel rooms available. If you want to rent a car the car rental company is gonna charge you $700 to rent their cheapest car. So, I write this as I'm getting ready to sleep in the airport and wait for my flight back home tomorrow afternoon (which I had to pay for out of my pocket). Pay the extra cash and fly with another airline. Worst experience of my life.

### "we were told lies"
I paid for two tickets for direct flights from Cancun to Philadelphia for myself and my 11 year old son. We were supposed to board the plane at 2:07pm. We received notification of the first delay via email at 2:02pm, with a new boarding time of 4:26pm. Mind you, the airport board was never updated, and we relying on information that was coming through via email using cellular data. Since we arrived at the airport around noon, and anticipated arriving to Philadelphia for a late dinner, we decided to have a late lunch / early dinner at the airport ($35 for sandwiches and two soft drinks) prior to boarding. We received a new update via email at 2;57pm pushing our departure a little further to 4:59pm. At 3:37pm, we received another plane, via email (no announcement, not an update on the flight status board in the airport) that our direct flight was now pushed to 5:44pm. At this point, we began asking questions to the Frontier Airline EMPLOYEES at the airport, and they were not able to provide any information. One of the other passengers overheard that the plane needed to stop in Miami for water, but that was all we knew. At 4:27pm, we received another email that our flight was pushed to 6:44pm. This was getting a bit concerning because of the time that we would return to Philadelphia. We then received another update via email that the flight was further delayed with a 7:22pm departure time. At 5:25pm, we received an email notification apologizing for the inconvenience and to pick up a meal voucher at the Frontier departure gate. When we went to the gate, we were told that thy did not yet have vouchers. There was apparently a gate change which, again, was not updated on the board, and about an hour later, the vouchers were then available. $15 per person. I thought I could get my son chicken tenders, fries and a water, however, $15 was not enough for him and I paid an additional $10 for his dinner. Some restaurants at the airport refused to accept the voucher. Meanwhile, we received another email notification at 6:15pm that the flight was again delayed with a new departure time of 8pm. At this point, the flight board was updated, and our direct flight from Cancun to Philadelphia displayed as a flight from Cancun to Orlando. After myself, and several other passengers questioned this, we were told lies and told that the board was just a mistake, and we would arrive in Philadelphia a little after midnight. When finally boarding the plane, 5 hours later, we heard commotion ahead at the gate where one of the flight agents expressed that we were going to Orlando. This caused some additional confusion and commotion. Once seated, the captain came on the speaker to “clear up confusion” and told the passengers that we were in fact stopping in Orlando prior to going to Philadelphia, and if we didn’t like it, this was our chance to get off the plane and figure out other arrangements. Then this person continued to first say that the delays were first due to a medical issue. He then changed the story, stating that this was due to a mechanical issue, which really upset my son to the point he was now scared, crying, and very upset. Upon arriving in Orlando, we were told that they didn’t know whether or not we needed to deplane. We went through customs, and again through security, having to discard our drinks. We boarded the same plane, arriving in Phila after 3am.

### "absolutely ruined our trip"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Denver. We have had hands down the worst travel experience for what was meant to be a spectacular vacation to Denver. Please see below for a timeline of events. -Email and text notification of flight delay at 5:47am day of flight. Prompted an immediate call to Frontier 5:47am. Representative notes flight delayed until 5:45pm same day. They stated that they could not get us on another flight with any other airline as Frontier is not affiliated with any other airlines. Called Just Fly twice 6:00am, 7:41am, (where tickets were booked through) with no answer-hold time of over 40 minutes each call. Went to the airport for in person service. 7:09am Gate rep stated flight was being delayed due to mechanical issues until 5:45pm - that an email or text will go out of the flight will be moved up earlier in the day. Email received from Frontier as leaving airport w/flight voucher for "inconvenience", no mention of flight cancellation 7:47am - flight vouchers are both invalid. Call to Frontier made at 12:03pm to ask for update as we had not received any texts, calls, or emails on status update. Was told by rep flight has been cancelled until the following day. Rep noted that they could get us on a same day flight to Colorado Springs with a 1.5 hour drive to Denver which would depart MPLS at 6:10pm. Frontier rep took all of my information, puts me on hold, comes back to tell me that “unfortunately, that was only for one person. We cannot get you both on this flight. You will have to wait until tomorrow at 11:45am to depart.” We had planned this trip months in advance (in February), and were traveling to Red Rocks Amphitheater for 2 concerts, where we had purchased the VIP experience for. If we waited until the next day, we would miss the show. Called Just Fly 12:21pm to discuss option to book with another airline. They could not refund our flight. My friend called on her phone to Frontier to cancel our flight so we could get out on any other airline same day through. Just Fly with American Airlines. Her call was made at 12:35pm. Frontier offered us a refund for the flight that they cancelled with no mention of a cancellation fee. Frontier charged a cancellation fee via email at 12:45pm, and another at 1:35pm on a flight that Frontier cancelled. New flight with American Airlines was booked via phone through Just Fly via a frustrating phone call with a representative that could not speak English. The cost of the flight which now was departing at 6:21pm, arriving to Dallas Fort Worth at 8:59pm, with an hour and a half layover, had us departing from Dallas at 10:25pm and arriving in Denver at 11:29pm. We did not arrive to our hotel via an Uber until 1am. The cancelled flight also cancelled our car rental reservation, which we then had to rebook on Friday 6/15 through Hotwire.com, as every rental company in the area was sold out due to a hail storm in the area on Wednesday. The extremely long travel day, lack of communication and follow through with Frontier absolutely ruined our trip. We spent the next 2 days completely exhausted, sore, and jet lagged, not to mention unable to spend money saved for our vacation as it was spent to rebook through another airline.

### "it's better to pay more "
Not Verified |  Austin to Washington Dulles. Arrived at 10:30am for my 1245 flight. As soon as I got through security I got a text that my flight was delayed 1 hour. Went to the gate to board and we got on the plane, sat there for an hour and then were told we had to get off and the flight was delayed until 5pm. At 5 we all showed up at the gate and the airport screen said flight was canceled. The ladies at the desk said they didn't know and no one got email,or texts. After a while they confirmed it was canceled and they could rebook or refund the tickets. They did refund me the tickets but when I asked for my money back for my luggage they said they couldn't that I had to contact the airlines. I have been trying to contact the airlines and all I get is an automated system that doesn't give me the option for luggage refund. Next flight is in 5 days. My husband and I need to get back to work, They claimed this was due to weather. There were three other flights to the same location that took off from the airport that day. I also know that the airport I was going to was landing flights all day. It was not the weather. Also, because it was canceled due to weather we don't get any compensation. So we have to drive an hour to get back. Don't get fooled by there cheap prices it's better to pay more than go through all this pain.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Tulsa to San Jose. I pen this review as I sit on the floor trying to charge my phone in a waiting area where I must spend the night! My flight was canceled due to weather; oh well, that happens, I know. However, zero accommodations were provided. I no know one in Tulsa on whom I can call so I have to spend he night here. We haven't even been told when our new flight will be tomorrow - it could be as early as seven or as late as noon. Meanwhile this ridiculous airport closes at ten. As such, literally every concession closes at nine, right about the time we were notified of our flight cancellation. When I called Frontier to complain, I was told to get something from a vending machine! The airline has offered absolutely nothing for our inconvenience. They could have at least ordered pizza and had it delivered here so that we could have something decent to eat. There are people here with young children. And Frontier charges extra for everything -- checked bags, carry on, soda, snacks. I will never fly Frontier again!

### "what a terrible mistake"
I have always flown American Airlines. My friend referred Frontier Airlines and what a terrible mistake. I not only had to reprint my ticket at the gate, I had to wait about 20 minutes after everyone has boarded the plane to check in a bag. No courtesy bag? 60$ at that. Not to mention I did notice online that there was a charge for baggage but never did I think it would be a carry on/ personal bag. The staff was horrible. They kept bouncing me from gate to gate. This held up the plane from taking off after the fact. Once boarded the captain tells us that they can’t take off because the airplane had maintenance work done “preventative work” which God only knows what that means. Waiting to take off. Furious, irritated and well beyond my patience limit with that entire experience. At this point anything is better then frontier airlines.

### "Next flight is in 5 days"
Austin to Washington Dulles. Arrived at 11am for my 1245 flight. As soon as I got through security I got a text that my flight was delayed 1 hour. Went to the gate to board and we got on the plane, sat there for an hour and then were told we had to get off and the flight was delayed until 5pm. At 5 we all showed up at the gate and the airport screen said flight was canceled. The ladies at the desk said they didn't know and no one got email,or texts. After a while they confirmed it was canceled and they could rebook or refund the tickets. Next flight is in 5 days. I'm trying to get to a conference that will be concluding before I can get there. They claimed this was due to weather. There were three other flights to the same location that took off from the airport that day. I also know that the airport I was going to was landing flights all day. It was not the weather. Also, because it was canceled due to weather we don't get any compensation. So I'm paying for a hotel that I'm not at.

### "a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Austin. Our flight was canceled for no known reason, and there was zero notification. We arrived at the airport without knowledge of flight being canceled, and we ended up waiting in line for over an hour before being able to speak to any Frontier staff. To make matters worse, the staff did not apologize and told us the next available flight was in 3 days. Overall, it was a terrible experience! We recommend that you never fly Frontier Airlines. Don’t let the cheap fares fool you.

### "not flying Frontier again"
San Jose to Denver. We were delayed at the gate for departure and arrival with no communication regarding the details of the delays. We were not given any explanation as to why we were delayed and for the departure flight, there wasn't even an attendant at the gate to answer our questions. We were additionally delayed on the tarmac and during the flight, again with minimal communication from the attendants as to why we were delayed or when we would be departing/arriving. In the air, we circled the Denver airport for almost 30 minutes in extreme turbulence and was not notified why or when the flight would land. The attendants seemed agitated and were rude to several customers. I will not being flying Frontier ever again, it was the worst flight experience of my life.

### "truly terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Tampa Bay to Denver via Las Vegas. Since the day I booked the flight months in advance, they have been sending updates with delays. Get to LV and they immediately delay the flight 1 hour, 20 mins later they delay it again another hour, 2 mins before scheduled to leave they delay 2.5 hr, another 1.2 hour delay. Truly terrible experience.

### "upset and disgusted"
I have never experienced as horrible service & customer service from any company like we have from Frontier this week. First, our flight was changed and leaving earlier -  next, a second layover was added on our flight from CLE - SLC. We stopped in Minneapolis and then Denver. I had to get a babysitter for my 3 kids 4 and under due to this. Then, our flight was delayed twice the time was pushed later and later. My mom and I flew in for a conference in SLC. This caused so much stress and exhaustion when we had to be up extremely earlier the next morning for our business conference. Headed home- SLC- DENVER... our flight changed again. Delayed, we were at the gate to board at 4:00. Our flight was supposed to depart at 4:22 PM and he plane was there. It wasn’t u til 5 PM that we were told that our flight would be delayed again until 6 PM as an estimate. No communication to a whole plane of customers. I am extremely upset and disgusted with the lack of communication and poor service from this airline.

### "very horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to San Francisco. This airline is unprofessional and disorganized. I had to wait for 24hrs due to a delayed plane. And there are not even responsible staff who have a guts to handle the mess. There are more than 100 people trying to reach their destination but they have to stay in airport the whole night. When asked for hotel they said to find on our own. $200 compensation in voucher to travel in this mess next time. I will ask people to pay a bit more and use other airlines than to use this airline. Very horrible experience.

### "definitely will be back"
Orlando to Islip. The crew was amazing. They worked well together, had a smile on their face and were personable. Was my first time flying Frontier Airlines and I definitely will be back.

### "Least favorite flight experience"
Cincinnati to Minneapolis. Least favorite flight experience I've ever had. It took over an hour to check my bags, only reason I actually caught my flight was because I arrived over 2 hours early. I great number of individuals did not catch their flights. That was only the beginning. Once we all boarded the plane we were informed that it would be a half hour before we could depart since the baggage had not been delivered to the aircraft yet.. The captain was able to make up the lost time in the air, looked like our issues were solved and then as we are above Minneapolis we were informed that there was heavy air traffic. So we had to circle above minneapolis for an hour until we were given the go ahead. At last we landed and arrived at our gate. After sitting at the gate for 10 minutes the captain informed us that the gate is closed for maintenance and we need to find a gate, but nobody was picking up on the other end of the radio. No time phrame could be provided for a new gate. I am still waiting on the plane to find a gate, without any air conditioning. A tragic display of transportation through and through.

### "literal bait and switch"
Phoenix to Denver. Horrible airline, delayed and their website is a trap to pay more money out. By the time you check out you might as well be flying a nice airline that doesn't screw you on time and money. The price is a literal bait and switch.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew to UT for participation in a wedding. We were scheduled to leave SLC on 6-10-18 at 11:15am on Flight 578 to DEN. We were to then board Flight 638 to PEN. Upon arrival we were informed that our flight was delayed for mechanical issues. This delay meant that we missed our connecting flight in PEN and next available would be Wed. After alerts that our flight would not leave until 6.5 hrs after initial plan, we changed our return route. We had to rent a hotel for an extra night in SLC and arrive (via Uber) at airport early the next day. Boarded flight and notice the flight attendants discusses improper filing for an unaccompanied minor. A signature was not properly done, and the attendant shrugged it off with a look of “oh well” and signed her name. Landed in DEN and slept in the airport as best we could due to a long layover. Boarded and flew to AUS and had another long layover. Boarded our last flight and flew to MSY where we had to rent a vehicle and drive three hours to PEN where our personal vehicle was parked. Proceeded to have to drive an additional hour to get home. Terrible experience. Cheap flights (until they nickel and dime you for carry ons and sodas), no entertainment, first four rows recline, trays are tiny, and staff is negligent. Don’t expect anything that resembles customer service.

### "only fly on limited times and days"
This is the 4th time I have flown with Frontier from Austin to San Jose. The second flight delay and a $150 voucher was given to fly again with Frontier Airlines. The third time the flight was delayed 3 times in one day! Now they only fly on limited times and days.

### "My flight was cancelled"
This is the worst airline i have flown. My flight was cancelled out of Long Island to Atlanta. I was told that the next flight to Atlanta would be 3 days from now. I could not get a refund for 7-10 business days. When we asked so what do we do for 3 days the desk attendant told us to sleep in the airport. The police were called when some of the stranded passengers got loud because they were frustrated. When asked could they take us to another airport in NY (LGA OR JFK) they said they don’t do that.

### "you are the absolute worst"
I showed up two hours before my flight to drop off my bag, and there were no employees at the counter. For over half an hour. The entire plane was lined up out there, and the counter was empty. The flight to Denver (my only stop) was delayed two hours. Then three. Then five. Again, there was no employee at the gate, so we had no one to answer our questions or help us adjust our connections. Some superhero of a passenger tried every number on the website until she found a human, and that was the only way we knew that the delay was caused by mechanical problems with the plane in Denver. Since there was no employee at the gate and I would definitely be missing my connection to Montana, I, too, decided to call every number on the webpage. And waited on hold for an hour. When I finally reached a human, they told me that they couldn’t get me on a new flight to Bozeman until three days later (which would be the day after the wedding I was traveling to attend!) An employee finally appeared at the gate four hours into this ordeal. She told me that even though I had missed my connection and been stuck for hours in my home airport due to a mechanical issue with their plane, their company policy did not permit them to book me a new flight to Bozeman through another airline unless I paid the difference (which came to $400). I was the only person on this flight that was going to Bozeman, so they weren’t too concerned about making me happy. They told me that they would refund my one-way flight and give me a $100 Frontier voucher for my troubles, but the rest (car, hotel, and return flight) was my problem, as was the cost of a new flight if I decided to book with another airline. Again, due to an issue with their plane that was causing me to miss my trip. After ugly crying in the airport for an hour, I decided this trip was too important to miss, so I sucked it up and bought the expensive and inconveniently long next-day flight to my destination. A decent airline would never put their customer in this position. Thanks a lot, Frontier Airlines - you are the absolute worst.

### "regretting not paying a little extra"
Flew Dulles to Las Vegas. Terrible airline. Had to pay $80 for my carry on luggage this morning. Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour with no new updates on when we will leave. Now that I've taken the time to read reviews about this airline I am regretting not paying a little extra for an airline that is at least somewhat competent. I'll never fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "Travelers, stay away, don’t do it"
Never ever again will I fly Frontier Airlines. They need to sell their fleet of 76 planes and save all these travelers who have suffered due to this company being incompetent. I have had 2 back to back trips from San Jose to Texas and both have been delayed 5 hours plus. Then they hand you a “we are sorry for the inconvience so here’s a big $10 food voucher to use in airport” really, $10? What can you buy at a airport for $10? Nobody with this company cares about the customer. I only wish I would have read the reviews before booking. Pay attention, do something, it starts at the top! Employees spend all day apologizing to upset travelers, is that what they signed up for? Do you care about them? Travelers, stay away, don’t do it, spend a little more. This is where that good ole saying “you get what you pay for” ha! I seriously want a refund and not a $10 food voucher please!

### "Terrible service"
This is my first and certainly my last flight with Frontier Airlines. Yesterday flight from San Diego to Denver was delayed a few times, consequently I had 3 hours of sleep last night and am now sitting in Denver airport, flight back home is again delayed. No announcements being made as least to give updates except the short initial one with reference to "aircraft maintenance". Terrible service, praying that I arrive safe home.

### "1.5 hours late and waiting"
Not Verified |  Flew Frontier Airlines from Salt Lake City to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Rude. Boarded 35 mins late. Get on the plane, sit there 40 mins. Then they make us check a bag below when this very bag has been on 8 of their flights in the last 6 months. Further, they measured my bag and said it was fine size for a carry on. Then, they make the entire plane deboard. Now we are 1.5 hours late and waiting. This is unreal. The staff are so rude. They make you pay for a soda, after all the add ons you've paid double the ticket cost. They lost my business today. On the way to my moms funeral. Nice!

### "delayed over 5 hours"
San Jose to Austin. Flight was delayed over 5 hours. I was not notified. Multiple delays and still have not received any updates from frontier. Sent a facebook message and they said they are sorry lol!

### "never fly Frontier airlines again"
The first part of my trip was pretty smooth. Left an hour late from Denver which was my connecting flight location. No biggie since i was told it was for routine maintenance inspection. My flight home was a nightmare. Scheduled to leave at 11:15am to Denver then delayed 2 hrs, then another 2 hours, the next another 2 1/2 hrs final departure at 545pm. However during the first notifications of delays there was no one at the gate desk to provide food vouchers as indicated in the emails. Hours after our plane was to leave they showed up. I will give them credit that they were nice but not very knowledgeable. My flight from Denver to DFW was also delayed 3 hrs and that when I decided I wasn’t going to sit in an airport for 15 hrs and arrive home at 3am on a Monday morning. After waiting in line for an hour and half spoke to the gate agent who didn’t know my Denver flight had also been delayed and basically told her what I wanted and which flights for the next day (I didn’t my own research). She made that happen even tho one fligt showed booked. FYI my flight the following day was also delayed 35 min leaving salt lake. No compensation at all. I will never fly Frontier airlines again.

### "bag is still missing"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to Raleigh. Got to the airport 2 hours before flight for a 1:25pm flight. Got to the gate 1 hour prior to flight. Gate said flight was delayed. Checked Frontier app, app confirmed delayed and said 2:53pm right next that. Left gate to get some food and looked around the shop right next to the gate. Got back to the gate at 1:25 pm and the gate was empty and the airplane was backing up. Contact customer service immediately about my baggage that was on the flight. They told me that they would have it sent back to Cincinnati the following day. Even called and confirmed that the bag was on the flight. Went to pick up the bag at Cincinnati and they said they never received it. Now it’s been nearly a week and my bag is still missing. They can’t even get a hold of the airports Frontier baggage people to find out if it’s in Cincinnati or Raleigh.

### "no compensation whatsoever"
Terrible experience all the way around. Frontier Airlines are so dishonest. The seats are terrible and crowded, staff beyond rude. The cost of flight tickets doubled by the time I paid for carry on baggage (yes you have to pay to carry on anything), paid to sit next to my young children. Ridiculous. We were stuck sitting on the runway for hours, wouldn't let us off the plane, it was so awful. We lost an entire day of vacation, no compensation whatsoever. I will never fly Frontier again, and would tell anyone I know to do the same.

### "Frontier stopped this service"
I booked a ticket for October from Colorado Springs to San Diego. 3 weeks later I received an email saying my itinerary changed. I needed to rebook because Frontier stopped this service. My ticket was non and void. Now I have to go through Denver. Thank you frontier for the inconvenience of not servicing all the customers in Colorado springs. I was given a voucher for 100.00 that needs to be booked in 90 days. WOW! What happened to booking in a year With a voucher? Our city is big enough to support the service but this inconvenience is it really worth ticking off Colorado springs?

### "Very disappointed"
Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham. Very disappointed with the airline from the start. Departing flight was delayed and they gave me a $25 voucher to “make up” for it. Flight back home was cancelled! At first it kept getting delayed (twice) and then I received notification that it was cancelled and had to wait until the next day. They gave me a $200 voucher for that. Please be wary of scheduling this airline for your travels.

### "The worst airline"
Philadelphia to Phoenix. The worst airline and customer service ever. I bought my ticket since January for two people and it's suppose to be nonstop but they changed in the last minute to connect with Cincinnati. Because of connecting in short hours we get there on time but they board everyone early and close the door however the plane is still there. No one is willing to helping us in or rebook the flight. So me and my husband have to spend extra $1782 to go to phoenix because of their irresponsible service.

### "will not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I live 4 hours away from Denver and arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the flight was to leave. During check-in I was informed that the flight has been delayed 50 minutes, Okay. We went through security and stopped at the gate indicated. His flight was delayed again by two hours and then the flight was cancelled. We had to stand in line at the gate podium to receive food vouchers for Breakfast and Dinner for the following day, because the flight was rescheduled for 24 hours after the original flight. Once we received the voucher we were told to go to the information desk to receive our hotel voucher if we did not live in the area. After waiting in line I was told since I lived in the same state, I would not be receiving a voucher. I ended up purchasing a hotel room with my own money so I didn't have to drive eight hours to make sure my son caught his flight. The next morning I looked at the Departing flight for Denver and there were none to Tampa for Frontier. Throughout that day we had multiple gate changes, but the big kicker was that there were four flights that were suppose to be going out of the last gate at the same time. They did not change any of the visual aids so people thought that the either Boise or Bismark were leaving out of the gate. Since no one knew what was going on they ended up standing in line at the podium. Since I had an unaccompanied minor I am required to let the gate attendant know. I stood in line and when I was next up the attendant just left the podium and began doing pre-boarding tasks with a line still at the podium. When I saw two other unaccompanied minor being led onto the plane I ran to the gate to let him know that my kid also was one. He got angry at me because I didn't inform him earlier. I have had rude gate attendants every time I have flown with Frontier and I will not fly with them again.

### "Terrible customer service"
Flight was delayed,but airline did not update airport boards, provide email or text notification, or gate announcement, until after the flight was scheduled to depart. New departure time was 3.5 hours later and gate attendant admitted that they knew this a hour in advance. So they trap hundreds of passengers inside an expensive terminal for 3 hours plus. No apologies. Terrible customer service.

### "agents were edgy and rude"
Grand Rapids to Seattle. This is the first and absolute last time I would ever use this airline. It is truly amazing they are still running with all of the money they must lose through providing vouchers. 3 out of our 3 flights had delays or some other issue, then at the last destination our baggage was lost. They do not provide any sort of tracking for your baggage and also are unable to provide you with any solid information about where it is until they speak with another agent. I have dealt with poor airlines before and I understand you usually get what you pay for, but you don’t even get that with Frontier. Customer service agents were edgy and rude, treating us like we inconvenienced them. It was just unacceptable to see people treat their customers that way when they were just trying to figure out a plan. I am not someone to write reviews, but this was truly a shocking experience that this airline is still functioning this way. Also I wanted to share in hopes that someone who has never used this airline and is considering it due to the lower cost, I highly recommend you do not unless you have flexible travel dates and no checked bags. I absolutely understand things go wrong during travel but I was just so put off by the treatment of customers.

### "worst experience ever"
Denver to Chicago. Worst airline I've ever flown with. We were lied to all day about why our flight was delayed. After leaving an hour late they spent 30 minutes harassing us about their awful credit card. We landed and were not let off the plane. They told us we would land around 3pm, then they flew around in for an extra hour with out informing us what was going on. Once we landed they told us we would sit for an extra 15 minutes becaise they forgot to move a plane from our gate. Worst experience ever.

### "never again Frontier"
Minneapolis to Austin. My husband was set to fly from MSP and arrive in AUS around 1pm on Friday, June 1. They canceled his flight that morning with no explanation. Then when asked they said it was "environmental damage". I sat on the phone with Frontier customer service for 70 minutes. They could not explain what environmental damage was nor would they put him on another airline at their expense. The best they could do was offer a flight to arrive on Saturday (the following day) at 4pm. Unacceptable! He needed to be in Austin Friday night at the latest. So we ended up having to pay over 3x the cost to book on a different airline that day. They totally screwed us over and in trying to save money we ended up paying almost $500 to get him to and from AUS just for the weekend. Never again Frontier. (Management was supposedly going to call me but they never did. Worst service ever.) I wish I could give Frontier a 0/10.

### "Horrible customer service"
I flew from Pensacola to Denver yesterday 6/6 and we were hit by lightning on the way down to layover, Chicago. I understand there were mechanical issues, but you should not hold families at airports for 5 hours. No voucher for food, no hotel vouchers and no available flights for 3 days. I had to spend over $1800 to get my family home. Horrible customer service. I will no longer use their service.

### "I would avoid at all costs"
Austin to Minneapolis. Most airlines will let you cancel your flight within 24 hours of purchase. My ticket was $155. They tried to charge me $99 to cancel. Then give me $56 I’m flight credit. My fault for booking them. I would avoid at all costs.

### "it’s absolutely terrible"
Portland to Denver. Absolutely terrible. My flight was scheduled for 12:50am, but got delayed until 3:30am with no explanation. Then at the airport, myself and several others were sitting at a gate waiting for our flight, when a woman came and told us that there had been a gate change and we were sitting at the wrong gate. The ticketing agents did not announce the gate change until after we reached the correct gate. Then our plane arrived late. I then had a connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City. That flight also arrived late with no explanation. Honestly don’t know how this airline is still operating, it’s absolutely terrible!

### "do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Washington DC to Salt Lake City. This is the worst airlines I have ever been on. Check in lines were so long because there was never any representatives available to help myself and others. Had my baggage lost by their crew, had to go the following day to pick up my luggage and they had me wait 4 hours. The reps were mediocre and understaffed. If they actually had reps available and if they were better trained, this airline would be alright, but until than this airline is horrible! I do not recommend this airline.

### "you get what you pay for"
First and last time with Frontier Airlines. Over an hour delay, boarded and then sat on the plane for two hours to be told the mechanical issues could not be resolved and the flight was cancelled. Follow up customer service was absolutely horrible, the staff did not show a shred of compassion or any degree of descancey. Their phone support is definitely designed to make you want to hang up. This has been the absolute worst experience. The executive leadership and all staff should be ashamed of themselves. Moral of the story here is, you get what you pay for. If you relying on getting to your destination on time, this is not the airline for you. Never again.

### "every time it has been delayed"
Not Verified |  Colorado Springs to Las Vegas. This is the 4th time I have flown Frontier and every single time it has been delayed. I understand things happen but 4/4 times I’ve flown with them there has been some sort of issue and the flight had been delayed at least an hour. Not only are the delays infuriating but they charge you for everything! Checked bags, carry on’s, drinks and snacks. You have lost a customer Frontier. Fix your issues.

### "First and last time"
First and last time I will fly Frontier. I hesitantly booked a Frontier flight because it had an early, direct flight into Denver (was trying to get in as early as possible). 4 hrs before the flight early in the am I get a delay notification of 4 hrs (how are you planning on failure that far out? As soon as I get to the airport, another 2 hr delay. If you need to be somewhere on time, don’t use Frontier

### "never fly with them again"
Jacksonville to Chicago. Flight was delayed, left and came back and waited in line for 10-15 minutes at the check in counter. Was charged $90 dollars to check two bags, then they told us we could not board because it was under 45 minutes (42) till flight left and per TSA they cant accommodate us less than 45 minutes before flight. We had a family event to get home for and they would not budge. We went to Southwest and they were sympathetic and got us home but 5.5 hours later and we missed the event. Come to find out after checking with TSA, the requirement is only 30 minutes therefore we had plenty of time and were misled by the check in staff including the manager. I have disputed the baggage charge with my credit card and they will not refund the ticket price for my wife and I but gave us a credit toward future flights. Does not make any difference as we will never fly with them again. I thought when I got home and called their customer service that we would have gotten a refund but seems this type of customer service is rooted in the company.

### "vastly inferior service"
Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to New Orleans via Denver. Not only was the flight itself cramped and uncomfortable with no free drinks or snacks, but the bag check at the New Orleans airport was unattended for over half an hour. A huge line formed but still no one came to work the desk. If the airline is going to not only charge for checked bags but also overhead carry ons, at least provide basic services in a timely manner. Not worth a slightly lower price vastly inferior service.

### "never, never again"
Salt Lake City to Atlanta return flight from SLC to ATL delayed several times and finally cancelled on a Friday night 6/1/2018. No reason given for the cancellation. Next possible flight on Frontier to Atlanta was Monday 6/4. Only ticket available to get me home at a reasonable time was Southwest for $$357.80.and that would get me home 24 hours late. I booked this flight based on Frontier telling me there would be a $400 maximum allowance for my inconvenience. Today, June 5 I get notice of a $170.80 credit from Frontier. I call the customer service line and find out that I will only get the $170.80 because "I requested a refund". I did not request a refund. My focus was on getting home and deal with the expense later. The last time I flew Frontier, I swore never again, but the fare lured me in. This is it for me - never, never again. I will drive before I will ever get on a Frontier flight again. Everything about this entire trip was horrible.

### "have to pay for everything"
Orlando to Milwaukee. The staff was rude, unprofessional and badly dressed and staff representation of Frontier Airline was disgusting. The seats of the A321 were like sitting on bricks. There was no internet, no entertainment of any kind. You have to pay for everything including your carry-on baggage.

### "do not fly them!"
Every single time I fly with Frontier we are delayed. It is the worst airline in trying to get somewhere on time! They have good prices some of the time. But I have 2 kids under 3, Being delayed over 3 hours when we got here 2 hours before our flight is no good! They did this to us on our way to our destination as well as going back home. I have no other words than do not fly them! Pay the extra money knowing you'll get to where you need to go on time! This was my last time flying with Frontier. They have lost myself, my family and friends as a customer. Very disappointed.

### "was very disappointed"
Birmingham to Orlando. This was my first time using Frontier. Our flight was delayed twice and then cancelled which is a headache, but not a big deal since we were flying out of the city that we live in. However, the way it was handled was awful. When they cancelled the flight there was no information (text or email) sent out about the cancellation until after they already announced what they were going to do to fix it. When they announced over the intercom the flight was cancelled, they said that they would pay for another flight out from another airline. However, they waited so long to tell us, there were no other flights out. They said we could cancel the flight and get a refund. However, its $25 charge when canceling over the phone and we have been waiting for an hour and 30 mins to get a refund. I don't mind waiting, but they have announced 6 times what they are going to do and have yet to help one person at the counter. I will not be using this airline again and was very disappointed in how things were handled.

### "a kingdom of their own"
❌ Not Verified | Philadelphia to Miami. They are a kingdom of their own. They “bark” at customers rather than provide assistance. Did nothing to accommodate those traveling together. There was no organization whatsoever when checking in, signs for destination were chest high - obviously Frontier is unaware of technology like screens that are suspended from the ceiling that are visible to all. Paying for snacks and drinks. After the inconvenience of a delayed flight where Frontier repeatedly announced we would be boarding momentarily versus the text we received stating our flight was delayed an hour. Frontiers primary concern was to solicit their MasterCard - No Thanks!

### "never fly with them again"
❌ Not Verified |  Over 10 hour delay. I saw terrible reviews and ignored them. I am writing this as I am buying a $350 flight to get me from Houston to Denver 11 hours later than originally planned. I was scheduled to fly Frontier from Houston (IAH) at 5:11am. I received an email moments ago (4 hours before departure) completely cancelling my flight!! The careless email seems like they do it all the time, they just promised travel vouchers from their airline, as if I want to be stuck in the airport waiting on a flight to leave again. If Frontier is the only airline available to fly, rent a car and drive. I will never fly with them again this has been an extreme inconvenience and I am worried I will not even receive the refund that they claim they will issue.

### "my flight was canceled"
Minneapolis to Austin. Terrible! I was not notified my flight was canceled. After I got through security I checked my flight info via Google, I saw it was canceled. I went to the gate and found out the plane was still in Austin and couldn't fly since it was damaged - "something hit it. The agent said they could get me another flight on Sunday - today is Friday! So I had to scramble and pay $463 for an American Airlines flight instead. Terrible.

### "did not provide a food voucher"
Orlando to Utah. I have never flown with this airline before, when I did it was my first time and it will be my last. I had a flight set for 5:15pm to leave Orlando FL (which got delayed to 6:00 then 7:00), and return to Salt Lake City Utah, when I got to the airport they had to delay my flight due to weather conditions and the plane having to land for gas. I had to catch a connecting flight in Denver which I missed because of the delayed flight in Orlando. My issue with this airline is one When I got to Orlando they offered to partially refund me my money which was not ok because it was not a full refund. Two most hotels will give you a FREE overnight stay in a hotel, instead they gave me some voucher where I can get a hotel but I would have to pay for it myself the rate would just be lower because of the voucher. They did not provide me with a food voucher either. My checked back was $40 and it was not overweight I paid online, you have to pay for snacks on board using a debit or credit card their is no entertainment as far as a screen on the back of your seat. A can soda is $2.99 and so are the snacks. While I was in Denver they had me on standby and I had to sleep in the airport overnight. I took this vacation on May 24,2018 flying with delta and was supposed to return on May 29,2018 but came back May 30, 2018 due to Frontier and their complications.

### "Worst airline ever"
Columbus to Orlando. Worst airline ever. They don't know the meaning of customer service. Flight was originally delayed 2 hours, then cancelled at the last min. I had a check in representative act like I was responsible for the flight being cancelled when I inquired about re-booking. I was given the run around for 2 hours. I finally got information on how to book with another carrier, only to have that flight cancelled. This is not how I wanted my first day of vacation to begin.

### "one of many negative encounters"
Chicago to Salt Lake City. I have flown with Frontier for years, usually because it's the most affordable option, but I would not say that it is worth it. They overcharge for luggage, which often cancels out the money saved on fares. They are frequently considerably late with this instance being over two hours. Once my flight was cancelled and none of the passengers were notified until we were already at the gate. In that case, they were unable to get me out on a flight until over twenty-four hours later. I am currently sitting on a plane that was supposed to leave hours ago and there is some problem with the air, so the heat is running on an already very hot cabin. I understand that these things happen, but this is just one of many negative encounters. I would highly recommend against using their services.

### "customer is the last priority"
Islip to Orlando. The customer is the last priority. Worst airline, rude staff, painful rapid descent. We were scheduled to leave back home on 5/29, but arrived one minute late to check in time at the Orlando based Frontier ticketing kiosk. The woman at the ticketing desk, who informed us that we were too late to check our bag and would have to rebook another flight, was in no way willing to help us and delayed calling us until we were too late form the line. When she finally called us out of the line she said,"There was nothing she could do (or could have done, like calling us on the line one minute earlier)" and waved us out of the line with a smirk on her face, as if she had disdain for us. The woman offered no explanation, apology or sympathy of any kind. It was if she enjoyed telling us as we went and lost our flight and incurred roughly another thousand dollars of flight costs. Spirit Airlines, who flew us home after Frontier dumped us on the curb, top to bottom wonderful flight, service, friendly and helpful staff. Perhaps Frontier Airlines should just replace ground crew with robots because I would be better able to understand why I was treated in such a cold hearted way.

### "it had been charged twice"
❌ Not Verified |  Denver to Salt Lake City. This is the worst airline ever. On my departing flight, we were supposed to take off by 6:24pm. Everyone had just boarded and got settled in when the flight attendant came on the overhead speaker and told us that there was a situation and that we needed to grab our belongings and de-plane. Once everyone was off the plane, we found out that the pilot wasn’t even there. We had to wait 2 hours before we could get back on the plane to depart. I also wanted to stay in Salt Lake for one more day, so I got on the app to change my flight. It said that it would be $120 to do so. I hit the pay now and it came up as $222. It showed that it had been charged twice! So I freaked out not wanting to pay for a $222 ticket, so I tried to cancel it. Ended up having to call them to cancel it. That’s when they told me that I no longer had my first flight because “I had reserved that second flight, so there was nothing they could do.” In other words, they took away my flight that I had paid for and expected me to pay for the new ticket which I did not want. On top of that, they nickel and dime you for everything.

### "flight was delayed twice"
❌ Not Verified |  Charlotte to Providence. My flight was delayed twice, a total of 3.5 hours, but it was $17. What do you expect when you pay that kind of price? Seriously. You’re not gonna get the most comfortable seats or the best service or free snacks. Big deal. If you want prime service, pay for it. Simple as that.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Fort Myers to Denver. After flying on this airline I will never complain about any other. By far the worst airline I have flown. Cheapest quality seats, some kind of vinyl, plastic - hard, doesn't recline, awful posture and metal armrest. No inflight anything. Forget about entertainment, you don't even get water. They charge extra for every little thing. 17 hours layover. Horrible experience.

### "never been less impressed"
Denver to Tulsa. I’ve never been less impressed!! This was the first, and I promise the last time I ever fly this airline! I arrived at the airport just in time to find out my flight was delayed. At the time our delayed flight was scheduled to leave, I began to board with the first group. I stood on the ramp for 10 min without moving. Once I was seated, I overheard the flight attendant say this flight has been running late since yesterday!! How is that even possible? Once we finally arrived, 2 plus hours late, we had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes because there was a plane parked at our gate. What a joke!

### "trying to rip people off"
Denver to Salt Lake City. Our flight was canceled with no notification to us due to a payment not going through. It was confirmed to us that our only notification that our flight would be canceled was in small, light grey lettering at the very bottom of our email with the title confirmation saying “payment pending”. This was supposed to indicate that (although everything else looked like a normal confirmation with flight and seating information) our flight would be canceled with no further notification. They said “this happens all the time” - basically too bad so sad. After a lot of pushback and over an hour on the phone, they gave us our original price of $50. Glad we found an employee willing to help but this airline has serious issues and obviously trying to rip people off.

### "did not get on the plane"
❌ Not Verified |  St. Louis to Las Vegas. I did not actually get on the plane because unknown to me this flight that I was confirmed to be on was cancelled without my knowledge. I had my trip to Vegas booked and paid for five months prior to this and I was looking forward to it. I get to the airport and found it weird there was no one around at the Frontier counter, so I started to ask why? Come to find out the flight I paid for was cancelled for whatever reason and I was supposed to be on the 5:55 pm flight. I had no idea because they never let me know. Needless to say my entire trip was ruined because of this airline! The next flight they had going to Vegas was two days later, that was pointless because i was due to come back the next day. They wouldn't even put me up in a hotel. I can promise I will never book a flight with this airline.

### "one of the worst airlines"
❌ Not Verified |  Denver to Las Vegas. Frontier is one of the worst airlines to fly with. First time flying with them and my plane was delayed twice in 1 day. They gave me a 50 dollar voucher for the mistake, but when I asked to change the time on ticket they said it would be $300. I replied that never will I or my family fly with Frontier.

### "the agents were hiding"
San Juan to Washington Dulles via Orlando. Horrible service! Unbelievable that the agents at the counter disappeared when the flight had to be cancelled! The pilot took over because as he said and I quote "the agents were hiding". Completely unprofessional.

### "extremely disappointed in the airfare"
Flew Tampa to Philadelphia. I was very disappointed with the baggage fees. Website said it was $30 for a checked bag. I went to the counter and had to pay $45 for a bag and then the lady tried to charge me another $45 for a carry on that I wasn't allowed to have. Also plane was delayed by over 1/2 hour. When we finally boarded and left we had to turn around within 45 minutes in the air. We had someone get sick and then the captain also said we had to turn around because they needed to fuel the plane. We were on the plane for over 4 hours total when it was only supposed to 1 hour 50 minutes. They should have offered complimentary drinks but they didn't. I was extremely disappointed in the airfare. Will not travel on Frontier Airlines again.

### "cancelled at midnight."
❌ Not Verified |  Savannah to Philadelphia. They delayed the flight 3 hours and then told us that the flight was cancelled at midnight. They 'promised' a $200 voucher and a hotel room for the night and half of us didn't even get it. Then we were stuck sleeping in the airport. The next flight was 14 hours after the original flight should've left. The workers in the airport were rude and useless. I had to book a different flight with a different airline, which I should've just done in the first place. I guess this is what we do these days - give people the run around.

### "withheld miles I earned"
Buffalo to Fort Myers. Frontier is a horrible airline and would not recommend to anyone. Customer service is awful. At the end of a flight they pitch a rewards program to you through a credit card. I had to call 5 times for someone to even help, they then said they are not knowledgeable on the rewards program before telling me I must be confused regarding their promotion and then they even withheld miles I earned with my early returns number. Just a horrible airline and I would fly into an airport farther away just to avoid them in the future.

### "airline is a joke"
Albuquerque to Salt Lake City via Denver. Booked 2 leg flight to Salt Lake City a month ago. Three hours prior to departure, airline alerts me the first leg is delayed five hours. Call customer service and all flights the following day are booked so my options are to cancel flight or sleep in DIA from 3:30AM Friday until mid morning saturday. I cancel flight and abandon trip, losing my hotel accommodations. The moment I cancel my phone notifies me the flight is now only 37 minutes delayed. I call back and wait another 20 minutesnon hold and pay to get back on the flight. This time they charge me $40 dollars more and give me worse seats. I get to the gate in boarding group 1 per my new ticket, and I’m not on the manifest list. I am then the last to board the plane as they figure out their software error. I fly to DIA with the carry on I’ve used for the last 300 flights no issue on any airline. At the connecting gate to SLC, rude gate agent tells me it’s too big (first time ever). I show him it fits in the stupid sizing tester. He still says I must check it. This airline just exists to bulk low income people. It isn’t even cheaper than others once you pay the baggage and other fees for things that just come with service on other airlines. Worst seats and service, worst website. Impossible to check in without 9000 confusing up-selling pop ups in your way. I will make this mistake only once. This airline is a joke.

### "waste of my time"
Oklahoma City to Los Angeles. I will never fly Frontier again. And be very careful booking flights on Expedia or any other travel site. Customers are penalized for not booking directly thru Frontier. I had other airlines I could have chosen but I selected the Frontier flight because it was the “best” price. Turns out I had to pay substantially higher baggage fees because I booked with Expedia. So my great fare with Expedia will be around $100 more than the cost of the ticket. I have no choice since it is a non refundable ticket, so I’m screwed, thank goodness my return flight is with American Airlines, their baggage fees are much more reasonable and the same no matter where you book your flight. And good luck talking to anyone at Frontier, it took me almost an hour on the phone to get a human being and I’m very tech savvy. When I did get a human to speak with, all I got was an obviously scripted speech, waste of my time.

### "still don’t have our luggage"
Our flight from TTN to ORD (connection) was delayed for 4 hours. Once we got to ORD, we boarded the same exact plane to head to ELP. We arrived ELP at 2.30am MT. We only had 1 checked bag and it did not make it to ELP. So I called customer service to file a claim and they said they did not know where our luggage was and that I would have to wait 4-6hrs before someone called. So we waited. Nobody called. So I called again, and they said the same thing that they could not track our luggage and did not know where it was. They said they would reimburse us for anything we buy since we had no clothes, nothing. Further, they said someone will keep me updated in 24hrs. The next day, still nothing. I call again and the same thing happens. It is day 3 here in ELP and we still don’t have our luggage. Don’t fly Frontier.

### "delayed both ways"
First flight on Frontier from Savannah to Philadelphia. I paid next to nothing, but my trip has been delayed both ways by 1 hr 30 mins. Unbelievable! The plane was brand new and clean but the airline attendants were miserable. No hello or anything. If you are needing to get from point A to B quickly or at specific time do not fly Frontier.

### "terrible customer service"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Tampa to Islip, New York. Worst airline ever. They stopped my friend and I from boarding the flight before it was even supposed to board, terrible customer service. All the staff were rude and not helpful, wasted our money for nothing.

### "I will never fly Frontier again."
Chicago to Las Vegas. My original flight was to depart ORD at 9:50 PM and arrive LAS at 11:40 PM. I arrived 2 hours early, but shuffled around after the barcode would not populate on my phone and the agent was on a personal that caused me to miss my flight. Frontier waived the $99 fee to change my schedule and put me on the next flight at 11 AM with a 6 hour layover in Colorado and charged me an additional $45 for my duffle bag! When I got to LAS, they couldn’t find my luggage because it was still in Chicago! I have been calling them all night to tell them where to deliver my luggage but couldn’t get through until 4 hours later after I find a claim. FA said everyone left for the day after they called. My luggage is still at the airport and it’ll take up to 6 hours before it’s delivered. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "Never utilize Frontier"
Trenton to Nashville. Never utilize Frontier Airlines! Their round trip, nonstop, air fare appears deliciously affordable. I was charged over $100 for a small carry that contained two outfits. I literally just stepped off a flight utilizing this airline. I have made it a priority to ensure my first item following my arrival is to warn all those who may be hopelessly attracted to this airline having faith in its affordability. Beware the old adage, "if it's to good to be true, it is" holds true with this airline.

### "has been very poor"
Atlanta to Ontario via Austin. Flight was canceled at the connection point. (understandable and happens). However the manner that this has been dealt with has been very poor. They could not get us rebooked for 2 days latter so took refund to book on a different airline. Was told at the gate that refund would be for the entire ticket price and could book tickets on another carrier. Few days later refund comes in and the amount is for less than 1/5 of the total cost. Customer service informed us that there was no way she could fix and to try again latter.

### "First and last time"
Flew Portland Oregon to Minneapolis. Stewardess was very unprofessional and made rude comments. On the way back the flight was 3 hours late and so we missed our connecting flight. I will now have a 8 hour layover in Denver. Missing work, additional day of parking and dog boarding. I expressed my additional costs and all they said was sorry. The ticket agents would not check our bag free, corporate is strict about not doing that he said. I guess this happens a lot if it is now a policy. First and last time I fly Frontier Airlines.

### "Offered zero compensations"
❌ Not Verified |  Tulsa to Denver. The worst airline. Was so excited to have Frontier Airlines in Tulsa because of the cheap one way flights but you know what they say, you get what you pay for. Thursday night we had a 5 hour delay. Today, we had a 3 hour delay and when we finally got to our destination we had to sit on the airplane for at least 30 minutes because someone else was at our gate. Offered zero compensations. No vouchers, drinks, snacks.

### "will not fly Frontier again"
Denver to San Jose. Incredibly frustrating experience. I arrived two hours early to my domestic direct flight and miraculously my checked suitcase did not make it to California. The San Jose baggage attendant submitted a claim and assured me that the bag would arrive and be delivered by 2pm the following day. This was 10am. I was not offered any other information or advice on how to proceed with a reimbursement for temporary expenses. They did not know if my bag was still in Denver or flown elsewhere. I returned the following day after not hearing back and was told the bag had still not arrived and they had no way to track it as they are all manually loaded. I was given the direc baggage number for denver after being on hold for 45 minutes. The Denver attended “guessed” that my bag was flown to the wrong city, though there was no way of knowing where. Again, no remedy. I advised that I prefer the bag be shipped back to Denver as I would be leaving San Jose and could not intercept the bag. The following day, now three days after, I received a call at noon that my bag arrived in San Jose and they were delivering it to my friends address. The bag did not arrive. Nor did anyone answer the phone to provide an explanation. 100% will not fly Frontier again. Complete rip off to pay $40 each way for a checked bag that will never arrive.

### "the worst experience"
Pittsburgh to Seattle via Denver. I had the worst experience of my travel life on Frontier Airlines. They changed the aircraft the day of the flight, and therefore had to find over 35 people that they could deplane. I got on, but the flight was delayed over 1 hour. Our pilot promised us 2 times that we would all make our connections in Denver, but no, we all ended up at customer service. The next flight to Seattle on Frontier was 24 hours later; I asked to be put on an Alaska flight that was leaving in 9 hours, but Frontier refused to accommodate my request. I bought a ticket on Alaska, and used a voucher from Frontier for a hotel room. Frontier employee told me to come to baggage claim early in the AM to retrieve my bag, but no, in the AM they could not locate it in Denver and told me to go to Seattle and file a claim. I tried to use the Frontier $10 meal voucher for a cup of coffee in Denver but it did not work. Got to Seattle and went to baggage claim and Frontier does not have a station at the baggage claim area; asked the Delta people where to go, and they literally laughed when they found out I had been on a Frontier flight, and said "good luck! They told me to go to ticketing counter, but since there are no Frontier flights in the AM in Seattle, there was no one there. I went home and filed a lost bag claim online at 10:34 AM and got an e-mail that they would contact me within 6 hours; at 5:58pm I got a note that told me to call the Seattle ticket counter. Called Seattle, and they could find no record of my claim even though I had the confirmation number. Later that PM, they called back and said they found the bag, but they will not deliver it to me since I "voluntarily" separated from my bag in Denver. They can send it FedEx if I will pay. So can I go pick up the bag the next day after work? No, because they don't have any flights from about 4pm to 8pm, so no one will be there. I ended up driving to the airport 2 days later to retrieve my bag. I will not fly on Frontier again.

### "they offer terrible service"
Flew Dallas to Cincinnati. Frontier Airlines are simply the worst in every area. They provide cheap flights because they offer terrible service, seats, assistance and customer service! It's by far the worst flight I've ever had. I waited an hour to check 1 bag, my flight got delayed 2 times and the plane is terribly uncomfortable! There is such a lack of care. No one is concerned about the customer! Very sad!

### "flight was overbooked"
Orlando to Denver. I arrived to my departure gate on time, once there the attendent announced the flight was overbooked and they needed volunteers to wait for a later flight and offered an $800 voucher good for one year for future travel. I was not in a rush to get there and so I volunteered to take the later flight. Everything went smooth for my trip. However when I went to use my voucher 5 months later, it did not exist. I called the airline and talked to a representative who then said the voucher I received was only good for 3 months. I was nice and polite to the representative so he was kind and talked to a manager trying to help and fix the problem. The manager said Oh the voucher was only good for 3 months thats it, we can't do anything for you. So if they ask you to give up your seat for a voucher, don't trust them.

### "delayed 6 times and counting"
I'm writing my review even before I begin my trip. I flow Frontier Airlines from Seattle to Cleveland on May 9th 2018 and everything went fine; no delays or anything. However, on my return on May 19th 2018, my flight has already been delayed 6 times and counting. My flight was scheduled for 4.05pm and it has been delayed by 5 hours and 15 minutes. It may even be delayed further. So if you're thinking of flying frontier airlines, give it a second thought because you're surely going to be delayed. Myself, friends, or no member of my family will ever fly with frontier.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
Orlando to Seattle via Denver. I already had to pay for my tickets so a $38 luggage and a $38 carry on fee was so disappointing and it overpriced. No wifi, no tv screen, seats were small and uncomfortable, the table was too small for my laptop and the food or snacks if you wanna call it and drinks were so overpriced. $2.99 for one can of ginger ale ? I don't recommend this airline for anyone unless you dont have the extra money to fly with a better airline. Staff was ok but nothing exceptional.

### "Won’t fly Frontier again"
Knoxville to Denver. Won’t fly Frontier again. We were delayed a total of 5.5 hours after being notified on the half hour mark. No one could tell us why or give us any sort of reason. This includes the attendants at the gate and calling their customer service line. The man on the customer service line led us to believe we would receive a flight voucher of some kind a small we waited more than 3 hours. After waiting about 4.5 hours, a $15 meal voucher was given. Since we had already been waiting for a long time, obviously we had already eaten, and the voucher was meaningless to us. After calling the service line a second time, we were told there was nothing they can do. Maybe they save us some money on flights, but my time is worth more than a $15 meal voucher.

### "needs a lot of improvement"
Philadelphia to Charlotte. Although Frontier airlines offers cheap ticket prices, the service was beyond poor quality for the duration of my trip. All 5 of the self check in kiosks were broken and no one was helpful about directing the flow of travelers. The line to check baggage was long with only one person at the front desk but thankfully I was able to check in using their app. Our flight didn’t depart till 30 minutes after the scheduled departure time but after that everything went by pretty smooth. The seats were cloth over metal but that’s to be expected for a budget airline. For the a big international airport on a Friday morning, I think this airline needs a lot of improvement in their service department. Very disappointed.

### "airline will delay, delay"
Frontier Airlines sounds like a great deal when you look on line and see the prices. You can book a flight for $99.00! However, here is my story on this airline:  They hit you for a seat assignment, a bag charge, a NyQuil sized drink and a small snack. Before you're finished, you have paid hundreds. Seats do not recline. The airline will delay, delay, and delay flights until they have a plane that has every single seat filled. If not, they cancel. If you enjoy getting to the airport early and spending all day there, then take this airline.

### "delayed 3 times"
Tulsa to Denver. My boyfriend and I were very excited for our vacation to Denver Colorado. We have never flew with Frontier. So, long story short our flight was delayed not 1, not 2, but 3 times. Other guest that were flying with this airline were clueless. Its very unfortunate because I love the price they offered. I guess the saying you get what you paid for is very true.

### "customer service is the worst"
Philadelphia to Milwaukee. This is the worst airline ever and customer service is the worst. The employees at the Philadelphia airport are very rude - I was there 2 hours prior to board and the lady check me in kept passing people in front of me to rebook people long story short she made me late and was very rude. I had an infant with me i had to rebook with another airline and wait 12 hours at airport.

### "lack of communication"
Tampa to Philadelpia. Frontier is the absolute worst airline I have ever had his misfortune of flying with. While their prices are low their customer service and lack of communication are completely and utterly disgusting. Not only so their flight become delayed regularly.

### "never use this airline again"
Miami to Philadelphia. Truly honest opinion, I will never use this airline again. This was booked via my credit card points but next time, I will use more points. Countless delays, for fuel, then the ramp closed due to lightning but lightning happened 30 minutes prior to the ramp opening again. Lack of updates from the crew doesn’t help. Oh and the ramp was closed due to lightning but they could fuel the plane, seriously! I also will add, there was a flight attendants that smelled something burning then proceeded to ask another attendant 8-9’ away. The attendant that asked ignored when I stated at least twice that I also smelled something. There will not be a next time for this airline.

### "not be too scared to fly Frontier"
Ontario  to Philadelphia via Denver. Many people believe that flying Frontier is a bad idea. I do not quite agree with those people. During my trip, I flew both an A319 (oldest aircraft type in Frontier's fleet) and an almost brand new A320. On the first leg (ONT-DEN, a brand new route) I flew in Frontier's "Stretch Seat" product. It was pretty enjoyable, with great legroom, and a nice traytable. The second flight was in their regular seats. These were a bit less comfortable, but not too bad. They do not recline, and have a tiny tray table, not much bigger than an iPad mini. The Stretch seats are usually about 20 dollars more to reserve on your flight, and are a pretty good deal, however, the regular seats in the back are usually the cheapest, and they are still pretty comfortable if you want to give them a try. The flight from ONT-DEN was delayed for a few hours, and made for a very tight connection, Frontier claims there was snow in Denver, but when we landed, the ground looked very clear. The other flight was on time, and landed in PHL early. There was one big problem, the bags. My bags were checked, since it was cheaper than a carry-on. When the 2 bags were retrieved in ONT on the way there, one bag had clearly been broken into, with one zipper missing and the TSA lock gone. Frontier claims this is "normal wear and tear" and did not even apologize. On the way back, the other back was also clearly broken into, and another TSA lock was gone. No report was made, since they would just pull the same excuse. Frontier's staff are hit-or-miss. They will either be really friendly and glad to help, or very grumpy and offer no customer service. So would I fly them again? Yes, and no. While they were pretty cheap at about $950 for 2 people round trip and 3/4 flights booked for Stretch and with a checked bag, and about half the price of a comparable Southwest flight, they are no longer the cheapest option for me. jetBlue has just announced it will be flying JFK-ONT (yes, nonstop), and when I priced it out, it was half the price of my Frontier booking. Yeah. jetBlue is cheaper than Frontier to fly to Ontario. I think anyone would pick jetBlue, unless JFK is an issue, which it is not for me. So why would I fly them again? The answer is the miles. While I would not choose them to get to or from Ontario again, I would fly them on a shorter, nonstop flight. They have a pretty good mileage program, and a nice offer of 40,000 free bonus miles (they claim this is one round-trip international ticket or two domestic round-trip tickets) if you sign up for a credit card. So, overall, I would not be too scared to fly Frontier, as long as the price is right, and you are willing to give up a couple of things you might get on other airlines.

### "excellent service, reasonable rates"
Charleston to Trenton. Excellent service, reasonable rates. There are so many people who have moved to Charleston from NJ, NY and PA most flights you need to stop in Charlotte then onto another large airport. Going from Charleston (2 terminal airport) to Mercer Airport (1 terminal airport) is fantastic. I've been told this is only a temporary schedule I think you should consider having it all year. Charleston has great colleges and universities and it would make it much easier for families to commute. Plus Carnival Cruise leaves from Charleston with 4, 7 and 10 day cruises.

### "unreliable and unreasonable"
San Juan to Miami. Booked a returned flight with Frontier with a departing time of 5:00 a.m. The night before at 11:30, I received a text alert about a 1 hr delay. Then, at 12:57 a.m., another text for a 3 hrs delay (New departure time 9:00 a.m.). No other text alert was received. When I get to the airport on time, the monitors showed the flight as cancelled. After almost 25 to 30 mins on hold, the service rep asked if I wanted to rebook. When I asked about the next flight to Miami, she says on Thursday - 2 days later!! I asked for my money back including a $40 baggage checked fee and a voucher for the inconvenience, the service rep said that the cancellation was due to bad weather conditions. The other airlines flights to the same destination were departing with no delays. Their staff showed no sense of urgency. I had to book a one way flight with American Airlines leaving 1hr 45 mins later. I will never flight with Frontier Airlines nor recommend them. They are unreliable and unreasonable.

### "the worst experience"
Chicago to Trenton. I’ve never written a review but the experience with this airline is the worst experience of my life. They put us on a plane for 4 hours which is double than the duration of my flight then had everyone removed from the plane and back into the gate because it got cancelled due to rain. I couldn’t get a new flight until 2 days after, the lady at the gate told us we can pick up a hotel voucher and had us wait on a 2 hour line just to tell us there is no hotel voucher all they can do is issue a refund or give us a flight that’s 2 days away. They make you pay 50$ for each carry on that’s 10-15 pounds same price that a 50 pound checked luggage would cost, when we got to the flight that was 2 days after, after paying 400 to say In a hotel for 2 days they tell us our flights delayed 3 hours for no apparent reason when they should’ve texted us or we should’ve received some kind of notification. The workers nickel and dime you for anything and everything. You can’t even get a drink without them asking for your card. The seats are uncomfortable they do not move back, no entertainment, no outlet. You think you are saving money by buying tickets with Frontier but they’ll make you spend so much more with hidden fees. Just spend the extra 50$ to fly with delta or any other airline.

### "wait in the terminal for 8 hours"
Salt Lake City to Columbus via Austin. Horrible service, flight was cancelled, this happens which is fine, but they made us wait in the terminal for 8 hours before they gave us a hotel. The staff was very rude and actively ignored everyone's requests for updates information. The customer service number gets you nowhere and I'm now trading emails with an equally unhelpful representative. Would never fly frontier again and wish I checked the reviews before flying this sorry excuse for an airline

### "been the worst experience"
My husband and I were traveling to Las Vegas from Chicago via Frontier Airlines. It was most awaited trip but thanks to Frontier Airlines we have had a nightmare. Frontier Airlines sent us msgs of delays 4 hours before departure which was great. But then they kept on delaying. And a 9.45 pm flight was delayed till 2.30 am and we were told at 12am that the flight is cancelled And that they would book us on a different flight and give accommodation too. We realised Frontier Airlines cancelled 4 flights yesterday around the same time. We got to speak to their official at 2am and got none that was promised. They could book us on a flight after three days (which was the day of my arrival) - somehow we managed a refund but I had to cancel everything - hotel, trip to antelope canyon just because Frontier Airlines chose not to fly! The reason for cancellation is still not told, refund is on the way, I have no proof that they cancelled the flight. So we were stranded, hungry, exhausted at Chicago airport at 2 am with nowhere to go. It’s been the worst experience so far as a tourist anywhere in the world. I have not come across any airlines that are so shameless.

### "delayed and tough luck"
Denver to Houston. My flight was delayed 5 hours and counting. It will probably get delayed even more. And there is nothing that they are willing to do to fix it. When I asked about my flight the customer service just told me that it was delayed by 5 hours and tough luck. No apologies. No offers. No attempts to make it right. Terrible. Never fly with them.

### "wouldn’t admit there’s a delay"
We are flying home to Denver from San Diego. Our flight was supposed to leave at 11:30am. The now boarding sign was flashing for 30 minutes and there wasn’t a plane at the gate and the board status was “on time”. As I am writing this post it is 11:27am and we are still sitting in the terminal. My boyfriend spoke with the gate agent who wouldn’t admit there’s a delay and is unapologetic. I get it if there are delays - is it too late much to ask that we be told honestly when the plane is expected to depart.

### "recommend Frontier Airlines"
Tampa to Cleveland. I felt compelled to write this review of Frontier Airlines to show my support for a great company. There are many petty reviews out there complaining about trivial things and I wanted to reassure anyone on the fence about choosing Frontier to find some confidence in their decision. My family and I recently flew round trip for a vacation from Cleveland to Tampa. The entire process went very smoothly. Purchasing tickets and baggage fees was explained very well and easy to understand. I knew exactly what my fees were going to be before I purchased the tickets. The people at the checkin counter were helpful and polite. The people in Tampa were especially friendly. The stewardess were very nice and helpful. The seats on the airplane do not recline which I saw as a very good thing. No one can put their seat back on your legs and they were still comfortable. We also had very good pilots who did a great job getting us to our destinations safely. I would definitely recommend Frontier Airlines to anyone. If you want to get from point A to point B safely and without hassle, don’t hesitate to fly Frontier!

### "organization was nonexistent"
Cancun to Saint Louis. Frontier Airlines cancelled our flight on Tuesday and made us sit around at the airport for 8 hours. They sent us to a resort for the night. We returned to the airport on Wednesday morning to realize our flight was delayed. We had to sit at the airport for 6.5 hours. Their communication was extremely inconsistent and organization was nonexistent. Spending 2 full days at an airport with no WiFi or means of communication was unexplainable. I’ve never been so frustrated and bored in my entire life. Frontier Airlines said they won’t refund any money just a discount on my next flight.

### "definitely fly with Frontier again"
Orlando to Cincinnati. Airports and airline staff differ from city to city. The Frontier staff members at Orlando International were exceptional. The previous flight arrived on time and our flight passengers were boarded efficiently and were waiting to push off. The flight was smooth and touched down to arrive at the gate ahead of schedule. The flight deck kept us informed of the necessary information. The cabin staff were excellent and very helpful. Frontier is a no frills airline transporting passengers to their destination as cheaply costwise and efficiently as possible. If I had wanted more of an airline I would have booked another airline. I can't speak about other flight crews, but I have to give the crew on this flight 5 stars. I will definitely fly with Frontier again. No major accidents in their history of transportation means something.

### "ripoff of a company"
Austin to Detroit. This airline charges low flight rates but does not include bags or any other items to be carried onto or under the plane. They charge ridiculous fees for these services as add-ons. After booking with them and purchasing travelers insurance, the very next day I discovered that I will be on military orders and will not be able to fly on the days I had selected. So I filed a claim to try to reclaim my spent money. After almost a month of waiting, their claims department finally called me and told me that my policy does not cover military orders, and they charged me 99$ for canceling my flight, almost half the cost of the flight its self. The remainder of the money they did not reinberse me with, instead, they kept it on their website as a credit so I am stuck buying from this ripoff of a company or I lose my money.

### "it was a great experience"
I recently flew with my family to Miami from Cleveland, returning through Orlando, and it was a great experience all around. Everything went smooth and the staff was exceptional. We will definitely be flying with Frontier Airlines again in the future.

### "would totally use this airline again"
San Jose to Las Vegas. Would totally use this airline again. The flight crew was beyond friendly and even remembered my sons name on the return flight home 4 days later. Seats were assigned and extremely roomy for my 6’3” son and husband. We knew exactly how much the flight would be with baggage fees etc and found it to be very economical!

### "you will regret it"
Trenton to Chicago, we could not land so we returned back to Trenton due to mechanical problem . We were told that we were going to get help once we arrive back to trenton. When we got to Trenton there was not 1 person there to give us answers, all their gates were closed. Instead of fixing the issue and sending us back to our destination, most people had to spend the night at the airport. The ticket might be cheap but it so not worth it. Now i have to drive all the way to JFK to find a new ticket in the morning. Don't Fly Frontier, you will regret it for the rest of your life.

### "get stuck outside security"
Dallas to Denver. Do not fly Frontier through Dallas/Fort Worth, you get stuck outside security and can't even go to buy food. They have no warning or indicators. They were incredibly rude while I was getting my boarding pass, and wouldn't even help me get some help finding a wheel chair.

### "never fly this company again"
Buffalo to Orange County via Denver. To start, my flight was delayed from Buffalo to my connecting flight in Denver, they never specified what reason the flight was delayed. I finally arrive into Denver, and when the time comes to board my flight to Orange County, I show up to the doors closing in front of my face, I ask nicely and respectfully to please just let men sprint to the plane. Then after being led to deal with customer service, I realized how unprofessional this company is. They were very rude and uncaring, they couldn't get me on another flight for about 11 hours, so while i'm standing in line, i'm letting people in line behind me go since I knew I was going to be there all day, and in that time after letting every person go passed me, the desk agent tells me that my only other flight had booked up in that time and never bothered to say anything. I asked to speak to a manager who said there was nothing that she could do. This all ended up costing me about an extra 800 dollars to get to my destination. I will never fly with this company again, not worth saving a hundred dollars to deal with such poor customer service. On the other hand, my flight attendants were incredible and very helpful with whatever was needed, just a shame that they work for such an unprofessional company from every other aspect. I definitely suggest to fly with any other airline.

### "customer service was poor"
Miami to Sioux Falls. Will never fly Frontier again! We got to the Miami airport at 6:40am, their check in said they would open at 6:50. Two people finally showed up at 7:25 to start checking the 40 people that were now standing in line. Not to mention they charge $45 per bag! Absolutely ridiculous, luckily we didn’t have any carry ons or those would of been an additional $35. Customer service was poor. Very dissapointed with Frontier.

### "crew friendly and helpful"
Greensboro to Las Vegas via Denver. After reading some rough reviews about Frontier Airlines I was alittle nervous about trying them out but the fares was so much cheaper that my wife and I decided to flew to Las Vegas with them. I was really surprised the crew was awesome really friendly and helpful all my flights were on time and early. I didn’t like paying extra so my wife and I could sit together that’s the only con to our flight every thing else was great. We normally use American to fly but now we will switch to Frontier as long as the fares stay cheaper. The food and drinks you have to pay for but they have some nice bundles that make things cheaper.

### "disappointed and extremely upset"
Trenton to Detroit. Do not fly this airline. Was scheduled and confirmed for a 6 am flight and at 3:30 am, I receive an email stating they were sorry my travel did not go according to plan, and that they fell short this time. After calling customer service, I found out the flight was canceled due to crew availability - how do you cancel a flight less then 3 hours before takeoff? Obviously they had to know that they didn’t have enough people in the crew and failed to staff properly. It is severely poor management and communication on their part. I am very disappointed and extremely upset with how the situation was handled by frontier airlines.

### "This airline is a joke"
Denver to Minneapolis. Horrible. Never flying this airline again. There was a used napkin on my seat and dried blood on the seat next to me. They have hidden fees so you end up paying way more than you plan on paying. And to top it all off they lost my bag. So now I have to drive 5 hours to get home without my suitcase. This airline is a joke. Pay the extra couple bucks and fly Delta or anyone else.

### "luggage didn't arrive with us"
Atlanta to Colorado Springs. I used Frontier Airlines on 4/19/2018. My wife and i flew here for our anniversary and somehow our luggage didn't arrive with us (which we paid 45$ to enable it to be taken on). This is our second day here and they cant seem to locate my luggage so its causing a inconvenience considering i had all my items for my vacation. I asked for compensation but no response, this is worst I have  experienced!

### "Don’t fly Frontier"
Omaha to Portland via Denver. Lost money reserving seats. Lost days of vacation due to negligence of maintenance of aircraft. Had to sleep in a hotel lobby waiting for my rescheduled flight. Don’t fly Frontier, just drive.

### "done the worst way possible"
Austin to Phoenix. Low fares done the worst way possible! Unfortunately I had to put 1 star to be able to write this review. The flight was delayed 5 times which I arrived 3:00 AM instead of 9:45pm. My baggage was delayed along with 15 other passengers for my whole 2 day flight, which in turn made my whole trip useless because everything I need for the trip was in the bag. When I tried contacting their so called customer service for a refund they were so rude, they didn't even apologize about the incident.

### "another mechanical malfunction"
I flew Frontier on 4/16/18 from Trenton to Detroit for one day for an interview. My 6am flight was delayed by 4.5 hrs for a mechanical malfunction. I missed my interview. Then, the return flight that evening was delayed for 2 hrs due to another mechanical malfunction. I never got any text/email announcement regarding the delays. I now know why Frontier is so cheap — it’s not worth it even for rock bottom prices.

### "I missed my flight"
Las Vegas to Birmingham via Denver. This is the worse airline when it comes to missing your flight. I missed my flight due to military duty and they told me there’s nothing they can do about it. A customer service representative told me I couldn’t be comp for a flight back home I have to take my flight that I missed as a loss. I never received any early check in emails or my flight is coming up also.

### "get exactly what you pay for"
Providence to Charlotte. This was my first time using this airlines. And I've read hundreds of negative reviews, but you get exactly what you pay for. The flight attendants were nothing but wonderful. Very polite to me and my 4 year old daughter. The plane itself is on the bigger side, so if you get motion sick don't sit behind the wing in the middle. That's where we sat, and you could easily feel the drops in pressure there. We were fine, but if you do get motion sick it's not the spot for you . Overall good experience and I would recommend them to my family and friends

### "not fly Frontier again"
Milwaukee to Denver. Will not fly Frontier again. Every flight I have flown in the last 2 weeks has been delayed by hours. Missed a funeral because they were missing a pilot. They offered no compensation, didn't even show any concern “ wasn’t their problem”.

### "they made him get off the plane"
I'm writing this review in behalf of my son. He was flying from Salt Lake City to Providence via Denver. My son has Multiple Sclerosis. Which he has a hard time with his balance and he slurs when he is stressed. The airline took his carry-on when he boarded the plane in Salt Lake to Denver which had ll his medicine in it. When he tried to board in Denver, (he has tattoos and a man bun) they said he was intoxicated. The crew was afraid that he would become unruly since they assumed he was intoxicated they made him get off the plane. Mind you his MS meds were in the carry-on that they made him check at the gate. My son called me very upset. All Frontier Airlines told me all they could do was put him on the next flight to Providence which was Sunday night at 11:55pm which he was already been in Denver's airport since 10:30 Saturday night. They were no help at all.

### "they cancelled the flight"
Providence to Tampa. Flight was originally set for 10:00 in the morning, had bought the tickets 5 months in advance, the week before they delayed the flight until 12:00, the day of the flight the delayed the flight 3 more times until it wasn’t departing until 4:00. My family waited for 3 hours until they cancelled the flight. Customer service was terrible and they did not even apologize for the inconvenience, no benefits were given, nothing. Terrible airline.

### "a week to get my money back"
My husband and I were flying today from Raleigh Durham to San Antonio to attend our grand daughter's first birthday. There are only two flights per week out of Raleigh Durham, Fridays and Mondays, so Raleigh Durham isn't very important to Frontier. Our flight was delayed from 2pm to 5pm. After checking in at the airport, we were notified the flight had been delayed until 7:00. Thirty minutes later an update said the delay was 8pm, then 9pm. There was no other notification. When I went to the desk, I was informed the flight was cancelled. We could re-book for the next day, getting us in to SAT after our grand daughter's birthday party. We chose to take a refund, which will come in "five to seven business days". Funny, how Frontier Airlines takes my money immediately when booking, but it takes a week to get my money back.

### "never fly Frontier ever again"
San Antonio to Cincinnati. I arrived 2 hours early and the plane got delayed 5 hours due to two separate malfunctions. They did not inform us on what the problem was the first time. When the first issue was resolved we boarded the plane and then another issue developed and we got off the plane and waited again. The second issue was apparently a “light” problem that took another hour to resolve. We were set to leave at 3:20pm and after many text updates stating the delays in 30 minute intervals we will apparently not leave until 8:40pm. I will never fly nor recommend Frontier ever again.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Pittsburgh to Salt Lake City via Denver. This was the worst travel experience I have ever been through. I booked my flight months in advance. I was supposed to have a one hour layover. One month before my flight, Frontier emails me saying they changed my flight. So I then I was supposed to leave four hours earlier and have a four hour layover. Okay. I planned my flight around work and wouldn’t have chosen that flight had I known it would be leaving that early. Couldn’t ever get a hold of customer service. Sat on hold multiple times for 40+ minutes listening to them tell me “lines are busy”. So then, day of flight, the flight got delayed three times just in that day. I sat in the Denver airport for eight hours. Terrible experience and terrible customer service. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "do not care for the customer"
So far, the worst ever experience with an airline. My flights (Round Trip) were delayed by 3.5 hours from Oklahoma City to Las Vegas and from Las Vegas to Oklahoma City. The delay made me miss work time and a very important meeting. They do not care for the customer. The seats are terrible. Tiny and the cushion is so thin that your butt hurts! I will never travel again with Frontier Airlines nor recommend to anyone.

### "Worst travel experience of my life"
Booked to fly New Orleans to Raleigh with Frontier Airlines. Worst travel experience of my life, they have no check in kiosks so they bottleneck serval flights through one line. I arrived over an hour early for my flight and by the time I got through the line it was past my boarding cutoff. The rep did not care one bit I was stranded and told me straight face that the next available flight was not until Friday (it is Monday) and did not have a single suggestion on how I might arrive somewhere in my home state. I even looked up an alternate flight through their airline online for that night and he said he could not book it because it was connecting with another airline!

### "do not care for the customer"
First of all, I should have checked the reviews of Frontier Airlines first before using it. Flew Miami to New York. So far, the worst ever experience in an airline. I have never felt so insulted, ignored and badly treated. The airline staff at the gate are so rude and lazy. When you asked questions, they do not care to answer or they do not know. My flight was delayed when I traveled to NY and then delayed by 3 hours when heading back to Miami. I emailed the airline for compensation and they told me they couldn't do anything. The delay made me miss work time and a very important meeting. They do not care for the customer. I was about to apply for their credit card. The seats are terrible. Tiny and the cushion is so thin that your butt hurts! I will never travel again with Frontier nor recommend to anyone.

### "Multiple issues with this carrier"
Flew Frontier Airlines Orlando to San Francisco. Multiple issues with this carrier. First time flown, and the last time. Adding carry on during online check in is $40 instead of advertised $25. This wastes all the savings. Airplanes are bare bone. No TV, Wifi, Chargers, etc. The flight was over 1hr delayed. It was still a lucky situation unlike other flights e.g. to St Louis was delayed for 6 hrs. In-flight staff turn their heads and no greetings whatsoever. They're also the ones who do the cleaning. You can guess the quality of it.

### "worst airline experience"
Seattle to Cancun. Worst airline experience ever! You pay to carry on a bag, twice as much as to check one on any other airline. The seats are tiny, thin plastic with little padding. Staff are rude and no refreshments without purchase. You must pay extra for seats together. The worst airline experience I have had.

### "I will fly with them again"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Milwaukee to Las Vegas. Very reasonably priced tickets and flight time was good. No delays. Flew with 2 kids and we took backpacks as our free personal item and had no trouble with questioning from staff. Attendants friendly and I will fly with them again. I think for the price of a ticket a soda or juice in flight could be included, but still cheaper flights than other airlines.

### "Never even got on the plane"
Minneapolis to Denver. Never even got on the plane. As I write this the plane still hasn't taken off. Had a flight for early in the morning and the plane had sat overnight at the gate. When it can time to board the plane everyone lined up like normal and right before we are to start boarding we are all told their was a small issue and would be a few minutes. After 1 hour they finally came on and said that some lines on the plane had froze and were trying to warm them up. From that point the flight just got quietly delayed hour by hour never announce but only if asked at the ticket counter. Did nothing for the travelers. I was forced to buy another plane ticket to fly to my destination. Never again will I chose this cut rate airline.

### "never offered compensation"
Las Vegas to Milwaukee. Frontier double books seats, contiously. They gave another passenger my seat and noted I was a no show, while I was standing right there, Plus adding there own additional time of my arrival.They give me the number to corporate to call and he continuously tells me to get on the plane I still have 26 mins, after I was denied, and tried to find somewhere quiet to talk on the phone. My friends got on the plane first because they had child, said people were already in my seat. The plane is still sitting there another 45 mins after I got off the phone. I'm diabetic, my meter & medication we're in my luggage, lady at the gate, oh well it will be there when you get there. After they heartlessly resold my seat, they tell me I need to pay another $99 to take the next flight in 2 days. After going back and forth ,they said they will wave it this one time. For 2 days I have no meter, no medication, luggage and no where to go. I had to purchase 2 more days at at hotel, more clothes, toiletries and a bag at my expense. 2 days later we're waiting for our flight and yet again the plane is double booked by 7 and 7 people have tickets without seat numbers listed as NN. No compassion, no conscience about disrupting people lives. And I was never offered any compensation. They forged my arrival time, but I'm sure it documented with corporate, the time they were on the phone with me. They can't run there business like this, charging fee for double booking. There were other passengers on other flights, stuck saying the same thing. Where to we go for help?

### "such disregard and disrespect"
Original flight from Tampa Bay to Minneapolis was scheduled to depart at 7.17 pm on April 5 2018, we were never given any warning or notification other than it was late, is now 11.18 pm on April 5 2018. The airline announced no assistance or updates for the delay. There were three elderly people sitting in wheelchairs for at least an hour and a half before a few of us got up and talked to them and asked if they could use any assistance. Airline personnel have done nothing apart from to tell us that we were eligible for food vouchers, the airline never announced it over the public loudspeaker. I’ve never seen an airline treat passengers with such disregard and disrespect. I have flown all over the world. I spent 21 years of my life serving this country in the Army. The customer service from The Air Force flight crews exceeded anything Frontier has to offer. My wife and I tried this airline just once, this will be our last time.

### "avoid yourself a headache"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Houston to Las Vegas. Please avoid yourself a headache with this airline. The staff at the boarding gates are the rudest and laziest I’ve ever encountered with an airline. They are very vague with any questions you ask them. They also tried to make me pay for my carry-on without giving me a chance to prove that it was small enough.

### "was a rip off"
Providence to Orlando. The only thing that I was not happy with was the fact that I had to pay $45.00 for a carry on both ways. I never read that on the website or in any of the emails that were sent to me prior to departure. There were 4 people in my party so that was $360.00 and the flight was $210 each ticket. That was a rip off. I will never be flying with Frontier again. Just shameful.

### "first and last time"
Las Vegas to Orlando. My first and last time. Never will I recommend to friends unless it is the last plane on earth. Very expensive fees for bags, seats. No water offered, seat is the cheapest ever, no comfort at all. All in all, has standard plane fee but the lowest quality of service and inflight experience. One star out of 10 - that one star is for giving me free seat selection.

### "unfortunately they have gone downhill"
Denver to Orlanda. The seats were horribly uncomfortable and the food was  overpriced. I will not recommend this airline for overnight or long flight. I traveled with my 14 year old son and even he found the airline was substandard. Frontier used to be my favorite airline but unfortunately they have gone downhill.

### "disappointed in website functionality"
Atlanta to New York La Guardia. Very disappointed in Frontier’s website functionality and customer service. I checked in by Frontier’s website and it displayed my boarding pass. There was no option to print it or have it emailed to me. I took a screenshot of my brother’s ticket to send to him, however, once I got to the security gate the boarding pass was no longer available on my phone.I put my confirmation into the website several times and while it confirmed that I signed in and would resend the itinerary, my boarding pass was not available. Due to this I had to return to the front of the airport to print my boarding pass as a result I missed my flight. I had to go back and forth with a frontier customer service representative to even get a refund on my flight and even when I got that they still charged me a $100 fee. This is disappointing seeing as the reason I missed my flight was on Frontier’s account. Please disregard the cabin space and cabin staff review. I had to select something for my review to go through

### "will not be returning"
Orlando to Las Vegas. I recently used Frontier Airlines for the first time and the experience was not memorable. Prior to the departing and arriving flights, there was no proper clean up of the aircraft meaning there was visible trash everywhere like excessive amounts of food and trash on seats and floor. The workers prior to boarding improperly handled baggage, throwing them on the track and leaving them either damaged or dirty. Also, the prices this airline charges for the full flight and checked bag then extra for each carry on bag and extra for seating of choice is not acceptable when the experience and treatment of customer is not equivalent to "high value". I am very disappointed as a first timer with this airline and will not be returning.

### "What a terrible experience"
Choose this flight from Dallas to Seattle via Denver based on low price only to find out at check in that I need to pay $40 dollars for my carry on. The price would have been cheaper had I paid online but I saw no notice of this prior. Same goes for choosing a seat, they want to charge you $10 to $19 dollars to select a seat? What a terrible experience and I haven't even gotten on the plane yet. The "customer service" is a joke and was absolutely no help. And beware if you do call for help they charge more over the phone, so expect to pay an additional charge. I will never fly Frontier again. Hidden fees and hassle.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. As a Norwegian person that works in the service business myself that loves to travel the world I have seen a lot of airports, airlines and staff members! Upon finding this site and seeing all the hate for this low budget airline getting so many negative reviews that I felt I should add my experience this birthday trip in January for 2 weeks! Traveling from Stavanger (Home) to Miami - Orlando - Las Vegas and San Francisco! And 2 of 3 domestic flights was with Frontier Airlines and I was pleasantly surprised by experience despite what I have heard from people I met on my travels that Frontier provide poor service, bad and should be avoided at all cost! I had the completely opposite experience with the airline! The staff at the check in counter was super friendly and helpful and made me feel heard and seen! Cabin staff was also friendly and helpful! Only thing i found "strange" was the sales pitch about their bonus reward system they had during the flight as that is not something I have seen before. For the aircrafts themselves I must say to be low priced that the comfort was good for cheap flights! Much better then older Norwegian domestic flights! Soft seat made by cheap material but for short haul it's more then fine and enough leg space and I have long legs so that was super nice to have. There was a major delay on my flight from Orlando to Las Vegas and it made me nervous for missing the Cher concert I was going to that night but they hustled really hard to make up the delay and actually managed to shorten the delay by several hours so I was impressed even though I was annoyed and slightly stressed at the time! So all in all, I would fly again with Frontier when I am in the States and going to travel with domestic flights!

### "stuck in airport for five hours"
Our plane had mechanical issues and we were stuck in airport for five hours, causing us to get to Denver around 1am. No food establishments were open at Little Rock airport after 8pm. Frontier gave us food vouchers for our delay but we couldn’t use them. When we finally got on the plane and they were serving snacks we couldn’t use our food vouchers. Because we got to Denver 1am, car rental places were closed and we were forced to stay in a hotel in Denver. Our plan was to drive 1.5 hours and stay were we had reservations. Frontier refused to reimburse for hotel. They have us a voucher to redeem for a future flight. Have to use within 90 days - we are not planning to travel during that time frame. Not satisfied! The staff at the airport and on the plane were friendly and respectful - however their hands were tied. I called customer service the next day and didn’t get anywhere there either.

### "absolutely no update, nothing"
Flew Orlando to Grand Rapids. Haven’t even taken off yet, about 40 minutes after departure time. Told they were resetting a computer, well 40 minutes goes by, absolutely no update, nothing. Finally, “took a little longer to reset, but were just waiting for it to finish up, we will try our best to get you there at your arrival time.” Remind me never to fly Frontier Airlines again. Awful customer service and poor employees. Writing this while on the plane, that still has not taken off.

### "have zero empathy or compassion"
Flew Orlando to Denver. The Frontier staff are a joke with zero ability to communicate effectively. Every answer is an attempt to avoid giving a direct answer. They have zero empathy or compassion for customers as well. This is a dirt cheap airline with dirt cheap service. You get what you pay for.

### "didn't acknowledge my disability"
Denver to Salt Lake City. Worst flight experience. I have never booked Frontier before and used a site that searches multiple airlines. To save 10.00 on my fare, I chose Frontier over Delta. That savings cost me an additional 40.00 for my carry on!!! Then a 3 hour delay for mechanical problems. I could have practically driven home in the same time. Pay extra for a bag. No drinks in spite of sitting on board for 3 hours, or we could disembark and buy our own! I asked for accommodations for a deaf passenger, nothing. Why does this airline even have the option of selecting a disability if they do nothing? How does a deaf passenger know what kind of delays are taking place when there is zero communication? My ticket said special accommodation : DEAF. They didn't even acknowledge my disability. I really should report them for violating the Americans with Disability Act.

### "everything to avoid responsibility"
Las Vegas to Orlando. I went into this flight knowing it is bare bones: no free refreshments, uncomfortable seats, etc. And that's fine, you get what you pay for. My advice to pay the slight premium for a reputable airline, comes from their terrible customer service once problems do arise. My checked luggage was returned to me with the zipper mutilated (now it will not unzip) and the fabric ripped. Understandable, things happen in transportation and the expectation is that they will take responsibility for it and rectify the situation. Instead I have had a three week back and forth argument with customer service telling me that Frontier is not liable for normal wear and tear to baggage and I should have read the Contract of Carriage before flying with them, and me asking how my bag being mangled is normal wear and tear. If you request to be put in contact with a supervisor, they will ignore your request and continue to tell you that this is their resolution and they hope you will fly with them again. I even paid for the insurance and came to find out that it only covers lost luggage, not damage to luggage. So whatever problem arises (and there will be problems), Frontier will do everything in their power to avoid responsibility.

### "Staff were professional"
This is my first experience on a low cost airline flying from Islip to Miami. Frontier Airlines is like a Pre-paid Cell Phone Carrier. You only pay for the services you need as you go. Pre-paid Services with Low Fares Done Right". I never knew you can purchase a round trip to Florida under a $100 dollars and then if you book your checked baggage online at the time of booking it was only $25 dollars per bag. You get the best rates at the time of booking. We had the best flight experience during our trip. Staff were professional, you pay for what you want (snacks and drinks), and the flight experience was great. The only improvement I would recommend is to install an inflight information screen with a choice for Pre-Paid Entertainment and to offer Sandwiches on the airline. If they have these services, it would have been the best experience. You just have to bring your own device for that for now if needed especially when you have kids. I would definitely recommend this airline to everyone. Our family enjoyed our trip.

### "never fly this airline again"
New York to Atlanta. Ticket Agent customer Service was rude and don't care attitude. It was almost impossible getting through the airport itself which took me 45 mins just to get to the terminal where the ticket booth is located. Then when I tried to check my bags 1hr before the flight and they refused to check my bags. Then the agent argued with me for almost 30mins so I missed the flight all together and had to be rebooked on a flight the next day because they only have 1 flight per day. There is an escalator going up to the ticketing station but no escalator going down also the elevator is broken. None of the baggage handlers tried to assist with helping me with my bags back downstairs. I'm currently 5 1/2 months pregnant. When I tried I strained my stomach so i just broke down into tears. Underpriced tickets to be overcharged for bags. $45 per checked bag and $45 per carry on luggage. I fly for work frequently and will never fly this airline again.

### "forgotten how to treat customers"
Trenton to Ft Myers. My wife and 9 year old son arrived 2 hours prior to our flight, as required, but no one was there from the airline to check us in. It took 40 minutes for the front desk folks to arrive, and begin check-in. In the mean time, 200+ people on two separate flights are waiting in a line that wasn't moving. To add to the experience, the people in line enjoyed the 20 degree winter weather every time the front door of the main entrance way opened. When we arrived, we found out through other passengers (and not the airline) that the airport had only one push-back tug, and that it was broken. A second flight, heading to Tampa, had passengers there 3 hours before us. Ultimately both flights were cancelled. That means in 8-10 hours a problem couldn't be solved, leaving 300+ passengers to fend for themselves. Four times we received e-mails from the airline indicating that the flight was delayed, and that it would be taking off in an hour or so later. Based on what? Appeasement with no grounds in fact. What airport has only 1 pushback tug? Actually zero! What airline nev =er told us why the flight was cancelled? What airline/airport doesn't have a "Plan B? The airline rescheduled us arbitrarily, on flights from other airports, with no consideration of where passengers lived. They also didn't give us round trip transportation. We, for instance, were arbitrarily re-booked on a flight on a different airline leaving Philly, but they wouldn't re-book our return flight back to Philly. They wanted us to fly Frontier on the return trip. Talk about lip service customer support--who would leave their car in Philly, and then fly back to Trenton--where you have no car for transport home? What airline has you wait 5 hours, sends you through security, and then cancels your flight 10 minutes after everyone makes it through security? That's what happened, folks! When we asked who was in charge of the operation, we were told "I think a guy named Chris is in charge. Well where is he at so we can voice our concerns? We don't know" we were told. Our Frontier/Trenton Mercer airport experience ends with the passengers heading outside to get their checked luggage that was taken off the plane in a building 300 yards away. Did they check our luggage tags as we departed - not at all. Could they have brought our luggage a bit closer in 20 degree weather. Sure, but wouldn't that be true customer service? Actually, the night ended with a 1 1/2 hour wait in line to re-book a flight, which they wouldn't re-book. We can't do anything, corporate calls all the shots from Denver," we were told. If you get enough people angry, Frontier Airlines, the only people "on the frontier" will be the corporate suits that have forgotten how to treat their customers! 300+ people had a terrible experience last evening, and I'm sure will voice their disgust to others!

### "found it very disrespectful"
La Guardia to Miami. Upon arrival to the check in desk I was told that I needed to pay 45.00 dollars for each carry on or checked luggage, I ended up paying 90.00 for 2 carry on(mine and my friend's). The lady at the desk had that whatever attitude who does not care if you travel or not and tries to make you feel that she is doing a favor to you checking you while it should be the opposite. I would rate this lade zero. I do not have any bad or good review for the staff at the gate desk, I did not have any interaction longer than 1 minute with them, they were constantly announcing that carry on and check luggage would cost 60.00 dollars now if they were not paid prior at the check in desk. The plane now. All the seats were sold and as a consequence there were not enough overhead compartments for all carry on luggage(which is understandable), but the neither the gate desk staff nor flight attendants informed that issue and failed to propose checking the rest of the carry on, instead they were desperately removing luggage from one compartment to another to make room and secure them all five minutes before taking off. The plane floor was never vacuumed nor the back seat magazines' compartments( not sure if that the right name for it). In my magazine compartment and my friend's I found gum and candy wraps, I cannot really tell if it was the same case for all passengers. My friends suffers of motion disease and was looking for an emergency bag in case of vomiting but no bags were placed in any compartment. I asked the flight attendant to get me one (she was busy accommodating the carry on, but she answered that she will help me soon). Instead getting a real emergency bag I got a grey shopping bag and when I say" thank you", she replied "de nada" what means you're welcome in Spanish. Perhaps my Cuban look or my Miami accent made her think I needed a reply in Spanish to understand. I found it very disrespectful. In customer service you never switch languages unless the client does it first, plus the right answer was not de nada or you're welcome, it's my pleasure. The flight per se was very smooth. I would like to congratulate the captain. My overall experience with Frontier was bad.

### "go in and change my seat"
Phoenix to Chicago. Purchased my Ticket in December. Purchased seat 1c, I go to check in and my seat has been changed. Contact customer service and told it’s a glitch - no one has seat 1C it’s blocked - check at the gate. I check at the gate and they say 1C is blocked. They don’t know why but I will have to ask the flight attendant. So I can purchase a seat and Frontier someone can just go in and change my seat? I used to say Frontier weren’t bad to fly. Well no more.

### "the worst flying experience"
Orlando to Buffalo. This was the worst flying experience of my life. I'm 5'8" tall and could barely sit comfortably in the incredibly close seats. Seats are not at all comfortable. I never flew an airline that practically charges for the air you breathe. I can't believe $45 for a carry on! My flight was supposed to leave at 9:50am and land at 12:28pm. We boarded the plane and then had to deplane and wait for another plane to take its place. Obviously a mechanical issue although gate agents denied it. Finally left close to 2 hrs late. Totally frustrating day. Never again!

### "Worst experience ever!"
New Orleans to San Diego. Worst experience ever! Don't go cheap, go with who is reliable. I had to get on another flight home because the flight was canceled half way home. I could not get a flight out so had to stay in San Antonio for 1 night. The reason the Pilots gave was due to too many delays that day, caused them to exceed their "flying time".

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. Frontier managed to lose my baggage on a direct flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas. My baggage was however located in San Antonio, Tx more than 24 hours later. In addition to that, I’m being told that they are unable to get my luggage to me for another 48 hours. Terrible, horrible service. I was offered a chance for a free flight but why on earth would I deliberately put myself through such a horrible experience for a second time. This was my first and last time flying with Frontier and they should be ashamed.

### "the most obnoxious, unprofessional crew"
First, trip to Miami: Great Crew, prepared, welcoming, helpful, professional, great flight. Wednesday, February 28 7.00am. However, tonight’s return flight from Miami to Milwaukee: flight attendants poor. Not prepared for boarding, not welcoming - it was an evening flight and they left the overhead light on high for the full flight, poor lady placed coat over head to sleep and the crew were so loud dropping items, talking socially. Male attendant took out a book and sat almost immediately. The crew made faces when passengers spoke to them. Passengers asked about snacks and told they did not have any, however front staff were eating. Final straw was when they took out garbage bags and were making balloons with them and popping them. This was just the most obnoxious, unprofessional crew I have seen when traveling. On a final note when we landed one of the female flight attendants were so disorganized she could not even tell us the correct time. While waiting for luggage other passengers expressed they would be writing, calling and blogging over the experience.

### "2 months later and no refund"
Flew Long Island to Orlando with Frontier Airlines. Scamming airline, don't use even for free. We got there at 4am, flight was late. Around 8 they said was a problem with the plane, 2 hours later we got on the plane, however they sent us back because the plane still had problems. 3 hours later flight was cancelled. We were already exhausted and had to be spend 1 hour in line to figure out what to do. 2 months later and no refund.

### "48 hours since we were supposed to take off"
I am beyond upset with Frontier Airlines. I have used this airline many many times and have been a discount den member for 2 years now. I’ve never been so mad at an airline before. My 3 year old and myself were suppose to be on our way home yesterday flying from Minneapolis to Orlando, and after being bumped off the flight again today we were offered nothing but a small travel voucher for future use. If we are lucky enough to actually get on the plane tomorrow it will be 48 hours since we were supposed to take off. I am a young woman traveling by myself with a three-year-old and was offered zero help with finding a room, food, or transportation. I have already had to pay almost $600 out-of-pocket to stay these extra two days. I do have travel insurance on these flights and after talking to the girl at the ticket desk her manager and the customer service phone number that they gave us all I received was rude attitude and no help. I will be canceling my discount den membership and probably never flying with Frontier again.

### "understanding and helpful"
Orlando to Oklahoma city. Had to call customer service for my son on a previous flight (I booked the wrong time) they was very understanding and helpful fixed the problem with no problems. My family has flown 2 separate times in the past 2 weeks with Frontier and I have no complaints at all. flights were on time every time and staff from customer service to check in and flight attendants all was great.

### "dissatisfied with my service"
I made a reservation and cancelled it within 24 hours; in fact, I cancelled it within an hour. The agent would not offer me a refund and I had to be transferred to a supervisor just to obtain a credit. I was told that I’d have 6 months to use the credit. I used half of the credit in January and I called back in March to use the rest of the credit. A supervisor told me that it expired and that I was told I would have to use it in 90 days and it was also on my credit email. I could hardly understand the supervisor, so I asked for an American agent because of the bad reception, feedback, and language barriers. She informed me that Frontier has no American agents. After having to ask to speak to her superiors three times, she finally transferred me to an agent who also told me that despite me being told I’d have 60 days to use the credit, the policy is 90 days. I told him that $35 of it was a bag fee and it makes no sense that I have to forfeit a bag fee. He told me he will not reinstate any of the credit for me. I am appalled because I spend so much money with Frontier Airlines and even use their credit card that the airline would be so stingy over $67. Nonetheless I will now make formal complaints every time I am dissatisfied with my service. Frontier is the only airline that refuses to offer refunds for purchases made within 24 hours. I’ve made reservations on all airlines and was able to cancel them despite the dates of departure restrictions.

### "They’ve become a budget airline"
My wife and I had a 2:20pm flight on a Saturday from Denver to Minneapolis. At 1:40pm, Frontier Airlines cancelled our flight. No notification, I found out via checking the flight status on my phone. The gate sign simply switched over to Memphis. We went to talk with the Frontier customer service agent. We were about 100 people deep in the line and so an agent from a different gate said he could help us. He said the earliest flight back was Monday evening. I told the agent Monday would not work as I cannot miss work. He didn’t care. No vouchers. No negotiating. No sympathy. They wouldn’t put us on another Frontier flight, connecting or direct. I asked for a connecting flight to Chicago, Omaha, Nashville, Memphis, anywhere. Nothing. Many people around us were completely distraught. Four flights at the very same time left Denver and landed safely in Minneapolis. The airlines were Delta, American, Southwest, and Sun Country. Why would Frontier cancel our flight when everyone else was leaving? Finally, I asked for a refund and rented a car. Yes, I drove from Denver, Colorado, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, all through the night and made it home 15 hours later. Think twice before flying Frontier. Our experience was that they do not have any customer service standards and they have little care for their customers’ happiness. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable. They’ve become a budget airline.

### "the worst flight experience ever"
Despite an ice storm and an accident on the highway, I arrived for my flight one hour before departure. Curbside baggage would not accept my family's checked bag that I had already paid for. I was told to go inside. The line to drop off a bag was over an hour long. I was told to get in the need help line. I spoke to an agent who did not care that I had a boarding pass and 3 children under 6. Everyone absolutely refused to take my bag or allow me to board my flight with my family. My husband ended up flying home with the children and I was told that I should wait 24 hours to catch the next flight. There was no option to board the plane and have my bag follow. It was the worst flight experience ever. I ended up booking a ticket on Southwest and checking my bag (for free) and leaving an hour later.

### "I would not fly with them"
Cancun to Kansas City. Horrible, spent 24 hours in Cancun airport waiting for our flight to leave. No info was forthcoming from the employees and they were the rudest people I have encountered while traveling. Nothing was done in a timely or efficient manner. Food voucher were finally passed out but then the flight time was moved up so we were afraid to leave the area, then the flight was delayed again. The hotel they took us to had a buffet we had voucher for but it closed with 20 minutes of us getting there and we weren't told this would happen. The lack of information passed to the passengers , the rudeness, and the total lack of concern shown by the staff just astounds me. The airport had no wifi and there was no way to contact anyone at home to let them know what was going on. There was another Frontier flight that was delayed the same day and those passengers were treated even worst At least we were not put on the plane for 3 hours and not allowed to eat, drink or use the bathroom like they were. I wI'll never fly with frontier again. They cost me over 350 dollars and 24 hours of my life and want to give me a coupon for 200 dollars to make it right. The coupon is good for 3 months, but I can't afford to take a vacation again that soon and even if I could, I would not fly with them.

### "Do not fly with them!"
Ft Myers to Las Vegas. Do not fly with them! I’ve heard that they’re not the best, but couldn’t imagine if end up stranded during a lay over. I was told that I had an hour to go smoke a cigarette and then come back through security -  well coming back through security they wouldn’t accept my electronic boarding pass. I was told to go to the frontier desk to have them print a paper one for me. There were no frontier employees around that could help me. I spent 30 minutes trying to find a frontier employee to help me. Missed my flight. Finally found a frontier employee to help me out and when I told them what was happening their response was “well, we were here, but we were in our back office.” After talking to the frontier employees they were having trouble even switching me to another flight for the next day. Two of them stepped away and I could here them going “what do we do?” “They we’re supposed to have that issue with the electronic passes fixed.” Anyways they were of no help other than wishing me luck and trying to help me find a flight on another airline. Not only am I losing a day off of my planned trip, I had to book a $600 flight with another airline to get me out of here. Plus an extra night of hotel expenses in a city I’m not supposed to be in.

### "won't be flying Frontier again"
Phoenix to Orlando. The ticket was purchased online and separate arrangements were made for accessibility (wheelchair service) thru a representative. The representative assured me that I would be able to take a carry on bag a personal item and my medical supplies with me at no additional charge. When I attempted to check in, my carry on bag was charged at an additional $76 additional for the round trip, increasing my transportation costs by over 30%. At this late date, I have no other option but to pay the ransom and complete my trip. I have no doubt that this was the original intent. An honest company would not do this. I won't be flying Frontier again and will inform my friends and family of this practice. It's not quite bait-and-switch, but it's close.

### "I suggest spend a little more"
Miami to Denver. It is not the first time I travel with Frontier, and it is not the first time I am frustrated. Late flight, no explained reason, and no attendant in the airport desk, she comes and disappeares with no commitment nor interest in comforting the customers at all. For sure a airline that nneds to be re-evaluated, not from anyone else but from the people who buy the tickets. As customer, I suggest spend a little more and stop paying a cheap airline that doesn't care about anything besides profit.

### "trip started stressful and ended stressful"
Our trip started stressful and ended stressful. When we were leaving from Orlando to Vegas we had a 2hrs delay because the airplane computer wasn't working and the pilot kept saying we are trying to fix it over and over again till he figured out that he has been saying the same thing for more than 45 min, then he sent people to the wrong gate. A lot of miscommunication and rude employees. On our way back to Orlando we landed in Palm Beach instead of Orlando because it was foggy according to the pilot! Then the pilot suggested to leave our belongings on the plane as we will fly soon and to leave the plane to rest. Surprise, after 2 hrs of waiting they announced that the flight would be delayed an 8 extra hrs (it was 8am and said we would fly at 3pm). Didn't buy it as they didnt seem to be sure of anything. Airplane crew left the passengers after 1hr of landing (because they punched out), the person in charge at the desk was yelling at people but thank you Frontier for the 10$ voucher meal, not even enough to feed one person. To deal with the refund they tell you good luck with their customer service. People had missed their cruise, rented vehicles (extra expenses) just to get out of the way of this horrible airline.

### "never recommend this airline"
Philadelphia to Tampa. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. Customer support was unwilling to work with me on a technicality, and they rarely ever have time to even answer their customer support calls. If you want a cheap flight, with loads of risk and poor quality then fly frontier airlines. I  dislike the poor attitude of the workers, and the crew members.

### "Worst flight experience of my life"
The flight was about 2 hours late and there were no weather delays. At the airport in Orlando, when they finally started boarding, a few people walked to the gate and an employee yelled loudly “wheelchairs only, don’t crowd the gate!” Like we were a bunch of 2 year olds. The girl announcing barely spoke English and nobody could understand her. The on-board staff rudely rushed everyone to “expedite” boarding. Not our fault they were late. The one stewardess couldn’t smile at anyone and yelled at people. There were increased parking fees in Pittsburgh due to the late flight. Then they announced “free miles” for everyone. But only if we apply for a credit card. No thanks. Never again. Worst flight experience of my life.

### "Beware, don’t fly"
San Antonio to Miami. Will never fly or waste money on this airline again. Worst customer service and employs were extremely rude when we were delayed over 8 hours in the same airport. No refund was offered or help to make it easy for everyone who was in a jam due to their maintenance issue. Beware, don’t fly!

### "they sent me a meal voucher"
I got an email 30 minutes prior to boarding that my flight was cancelled, but luckily they sent me a meal voucher. Wow, thanks! I guess I'm going to need it considering I will be waiting 3 additional hours, my non-stop now has a 2 hour layover and I will be arriving to my destination 5 hours later via another airline. The reason I booked with them is because they messed up my first flight ever with them and they sent me a voucher, a voucher has now turned into a nightmare. I call customer service and am on hold for 45 minutes (due to high volume, I wonder why) get through and get put on hold again. Get to the supervisor who offers me a flight which is leaving from a city 4 hours away, and arriving even later which is supposed to be a better option? God forbid I took it, I'd arrive in Houston from Austin and they will have cancelled that one too. I am all for being cramped, limited baggage, even subpar service onboard -  you get what you pay for but I can't even get that!

### "never fly Frontier ever again! "
Denver to San Francisco. Absolute worst airline ever. First of all, don't let the cheaper fares fool you! You have to pay 45$ to check a bag and $30 for a carry on and $12 to select a seat. At this rate I should have gone with Southwest and gotten some decent service! The flight was scheduled as on time yet we took off 45 minutes after schedule with NO explanation why. The service inflight is terrible. The flight attendants spend most of the time talking over the intercom about a frontier credit card which is annoying and distracting for people trying to work/sleep! After landing we sat on the plane while at the gate for another 30 minutes. The flight was incredibly bumpy and uncomfortable! Where the heck did the tray tables go! Online check in via phone is also nearly impossible. I got off my flight so agitated. I will never fly Frontier ever again! Oh yea, and a cup of ice is $2.99.

### "can't spare a soda or juice"
❎ Not Verified |  Portland to Dallas, First off the added charges for seats and supposedly more leg room - didn't see a difference. $2.99 for beverages in flight. I spent $350 on a flight and they can't spare a soda or juice for customers. Cannot check in early as they don't have agents available until 2 hrs prior to departure. The agents are then recycled to boarding. Baggage claim was super slow. No cabin wifi, no in flight entertainment. No plugs. Never again.

### "now have to wait 5 unwanted hours"
Denver to Palm Springs. Only reason I am taking the time to write this is because I now have to wait 5 unwanted hours in the airport due to flight delays. This happened to me when I flew Frontier in May. Delays both flying to and from Mexico. This weekend (Feb 2018) we went to Palm Springs for a wedding (only there for two nights) I’ve spent the whole day Friday in the airport due to 5 hour flight delay. Now Sunday coming home guess what, a 5 hour delay! Woo! Except this time we can’t even check our bags in so we can’t grab a drink or food or anything just get to sit here. Oh guess what they offer...a $50 voucher for another frontier flight. So worth it to spend more money for any other airline just to avoid the delays (not even weather related). All to sit and wait to sit on an extremely uncomfortable terrible flight experience. Going to be so fun landing at 1am and be at work at 6am. f you fly Frontier just plan on showing up late to the airport.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
Denver to Washington. They are horrible. Never again. They Nickle and dime you to death. Seats are very uncomfortable and don't recline. Not padded with cushion just horrible. I would be surprised if they have repeat business. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy.

### "a non-reliable airline"
I purchased a trip from Omaha to San Juan via Orlando on December 2017 from Frontier Airline. I received a call from Travel One notifying me that Frontier cancel and the only option was to provide a refund. The only justification provided by the Frontier was that they decided not to flight to San Juan during July 2018 gave me no other option. I am not satisfied with their excuse. I purchased this e-tickets ahead of time to get the best deal and now I had to buy this portion of the trip and pay a lot more due to this cancelation. This is not acceptable, specially we made plans ahead to time. This is a non-reliable airline and will never use their services again.

### "They are not reliable"
Never again! I do not recommend Frontier Airlines under any circumstance. We first flew from San Francisco to Washington DC and the flight was very bumpy and shaky. The real problem, though, was when my flight from DC to Denver (to fly back to SF) was cancelled out of the blue on the day of departure. This left me with no other option than buying extremely expensive last minute tickets from another airline (of course!) for the next morning very early. The fact that Frontier cancelled my flight has endangered my other flight to Europe the next day which is from San Francisco. The only other flight they had to offer me was on February 13th (3 days after my scheduled flight that was cancelled). I was reimbursed the flight value and received a voucher to fly with them another time. They are not reliable, the flight is not pleasant. Please consider all of these when you wish to fly with Frontier.

### "This airline is ridiculous"
Flew Orlando to Denver from Frontier Airlines. First they charge you $38 for a carry on, then they charge you $13 extra per seat if you want to sit with your husband or wife, if you have a connecting flight it is an additional $6. The seats are akin to a park bench. They do not recline, they do not have any padding, basically a park bench. If you want padding and a seat that reclines it is $60 extra seat. Then if you want your watered down ginger ale and bag of almonds? $2.99! Oh and no cash accepted! There was a woman on our flight who vomited 10 mins prior to landing, she flipped on her call light. The flight attendants ignored her. They simply said over the PA system "If this is not a medical emergency turn off your call light". Who does that? The woman finally had to get up and go into the aisle and ask for paper towels. This airline is ridiculous! Their mobile app is miserable. Their registration process is miserable. Their flights are miserable!. Stay away!

### "never again will I use them"
Providence to Phoenix via Orlando. First time flying this airline and never again will I use them. My flight arrived over 5 hours late and then when I go to get my luggage it is not there. I then go to the counter and no one is working so I had to wait another 90 min to find an employee to help me. Long story short it’s three days later and I still don’t have my bag or any of my clothes and they said I still won’t be getting it for another 5 days minimum. Awful all around. No in flight entertainment and when I ordered a (overpriced) beer on board I was told they didn’t even have any left. So frustrating and stressful trip all around with this airline.

### "for paying customers this is unacceptable"
I've never flown Frontier or any discount airline before, and decided to give it the benefit of the doubt when I bought roundtrip nonstop tickets from Philadelphia to New Orleans, knowing that there was a $45 fee for carry-on, and that any frills typically complimentary on regular airlines would cost extra. I was completely aware of that, however, the morning of my flight at 12.30am, I received an email subject line "Travel Alert! stating that my flight was cancelled. For no reason. Upon calling customer service, they told me that it was weather related, however, like a human being with an ounce of a brain I checked New Orleans' airport conditions and there was no advisory whatsoever and 100% operational. Clearly, they cancelled the flight because it was underbooked and it would not be profitable to fly. Frontier is a group of lying cost minimizers to cheap people out on a daily basis, and for paying customers this is unacceptable. Additionally, their scam of an insurance provider was absolutely zero help, a waste of $10.95. Never buy travel insurance from Frontier if you're ever unfortunate enough to have to fly with them. My first and last time spending money on this "airline". Leaves a horrible taste in my mouth and gives a bad name to Denver.

### "absolutely is the worst"
San Juan to New Orleans via Philadelphia. Frontier absolutely is the worst. I will never give this airline my money again. They cancelled thw flight then tried to make me stay in Philly for 4 days. Then when i told them i could not possibly do that, they refused to give me a refund. So i basically just flew fron San Juan to Philadelphia sit here all day (literally like 15 hrs) and go back to San Juan all on my dollars. Thanks fot showing me what bad customers service is.

### "Never again Frontier"
Charlotte to Philadelphia. Never again Frontier! My flight was delayed by 6 hours & I was never notified. Checked in online to find out. Got to airport 2 hours before NEW flight time & on ‘departures’ board at airport it still just said, “Delayed”. No new departure time, no new gate info etc... went to original gate A8 & attendant was rude & acted like my questions were a pain to answer. Cost $45 for a carry on bag! Finally boarded to find rock-hard seats that don’t recline & are packed as tight as FAA will allow. Landed & received e-mail with ‘apology’ & a $150 voucher. You couldn’t pay me to fly Frontier again!

### "Loved the roomy seats"
Orlando to Pittsburgh. Loved the roomy seats, leg room was great and the crew was very nice. Flight was on time. Their web site was very clear the costs for extra bags but we travel light. Only complaint I had was the plane was very drafty and cold. It was the coldest flight I've ever been on. Not sure why it was kept so cold. The price was unbelievably low. Over all very happy. I'll dress in more layers next time to keep warm.

### "All flights canceled today"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Buffalo to Miami. Where do I start? All flights canceled today, so I'm stuck in Buffalo NY at the mercy of other airlines. My husband and I have two kids we have got to get back to in Miami. We are coming back from our anniversary and Frontier was just the icing on the cake. The audacity to tell me that the extra money I used to pay for good seats is going towards the payment of the new itinerary. So do I get special seats in the next airline since I paid for it? Nope! How can they not maintain their planes and make sure that all is well.

### "will never use them again"
Atlanta to San Francisco. Horrible. I got to the gate 9 minutes before take off time with 2 small children and they wouldn’t let me on. He had me go sit down until he was finished with what he was doing. Then he forgot about me. When I went back up he told me he couldn’t get me on a flight until 2 days later. Another representative told me that she documented that I was late due to security and they should give me a refund if I call. I called and they told me that I was just marked as no show. I asked about another flight which I had already looked up online and she quoted me a price that was 3 times the online price and was going to charge me $10 on top of that for booking on the phone. They were unwilling to even allow me to use the funds from the three tickets for one flight. Then when I finally got to California via Southwest (wonderful airline), I went to find my suitcase which had been on the flight they wouldn’t let me on. Well, there was no one at the airport for Frontier so I had to wait 4 hours until someone was back at work! I will never use them again.

### "refuse to fly on Frontier Airlines"
Miami to Austin via Atlanta. Frontier Airlines was a good airline years ago but now it is an ultra low cost scamming airline. I did not do my homework when I bought low priced airline tickets and got shocked when we had to pay $120 for one checking baggage and 2 carryons. That was no economy airline. My husband and I are members of the frequent flyer group and my husband has the Frontier Airlines credit card. The only benefits are being able to get frequent flyer miles which we will probably not wish to use. We flew on United and got a low cost but we got benefits as frequent flyers with United and since we have United credit cards. We will fly United more. Unless there is no other airline going to a desired location, we will refuse to fly on Frontier Airlines.

### "Horrible airline experience"
Los Angeles to Orlando. Horrible airline experience. Decent prices, but that’s the only plus. I paid $45 for a first class seat for an over night flight. The seat was the harder than economy on Allegiant, the seat would not recline a centemeter and they required me to place my purse in a bin because of the wall infront of the first row of first class. The flight attendants were not friendly, the aircraft was nothing special. If you are expecting not a single frill or element of luxury then fly frontier

### "very annoyed and displeased"
Los Angeles to Denver. I will never be flying with Frontier Airlines again. First of all, I had no idea they charge $45 just for a carry on! The reason I use a carry on is to avoid the fees of checking a bag, since it was the same price either way I decided to just check it. Then I discovered the flight was delayed by an hour, I wasn't told why or given any heads up so I could plan accordingly before I got to the airport. Now I'm standing here in LAX waiting and they just announced that since it's a full flight they are allowing passengers to check their bags free of charge. That would've been nice to know had I not already paid the fee, very annoyed and displeased.

### "All the reviews are dead on"
All the reviews are dead on. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6.00, we were informed via email 18 minutes prior to check in the flight would be delayed 6 hours and 45 minutes. After calling and speaking to a Frontier Representative (who was very difficult to understand) she said they were just made aware of the delay! The delays had been going on from the day (yesterday) before. It's obvious they are diverting flights for the super bowl to reep the monetary benefits and leaving others customers hanging. Our family of 6 was going to Disney & had prepaid for park passes ($500+/day) for everyday. We are losing 90% of the day. That was the whole reason we booked such an early flight. They were not willing to do anything but refund our tickets, we are still out $500 for the first day of park passes. Had they informed us an hour earlier we could have switched flights and flown out of Trenton, NJ and had the same departure and arrival. We didn't save any money it actually cost us $500 extra by flying Frontier. They were willing to do absolutely nothing other than refunding our flight. They will not offer reduced ticket prices or future tickets (not that I would use them at this point). They are completely complacent, show a lack of respect and appreciation for their customers.

### "worst customer service"
Washington to Denver. Horrific. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Frontier cancelled my flight because of its own equipment failure. I am having to return home by booking through another airline in order to get home today ( my original arrival date), my only other option to not spend extra money was to return 3-4 days from now. Spent 40 min on the phone to find out now refund. I will not be spending more money than I would have if I flew a decent airline. Would not wish this experience on my worst enemy.

### "experience was less than desirable"
Philadelphia to Orlando. My entire experience with Frontier was less than desirable. From having to pay in advance to ensure my young children and elderly mother were sitting with me to the astronomical baggage fees. Our pilot was an hour late getting to our flight. When asked why we were delayed and where the pilots were, the flight attendant was extremely rude and refused to answer our questions. Both departing and arriving flights had very rude attendants. Our pilot on our returning flight was very sarcastic in tone over the announcements. The check in lines at both airports (Philadelphia being the worst with only two check in attendants) were the longest lines by a landslide. Very disappointed is an understatement.

### "very upset about their fee"
Washington DC to Orange County via Denver. It is my first time using frontier and I am very upset about their fee! They changed $45 for my carry on bag it is very small luggage! I take this luggage to all other my trips with other airlines past 6 years and they never change carry on bag fees but today frontier changed this fee without any notice!!! I will never ever use this airline.

### "We have sat for over 7 hours"
Horrible experience! I will never fly with this airline again. First time flying with Frontier Airlines from Philadelphia to New Orleans and there will not be a next. Had a 6.30am flight and only an hour before take-off was I informed there was a 5 hour delay. We were given a mere $10 food voucher for inconvenience. The food vouchers were clearly printed at 3.00 am - 2.5 hours before I was noticed of the delay! After this delay - and as we were ready to board, we were notified of another hour delay and then another and then at last another. We have sat for over 7 hours for this flight. This has ultimately destroyed my weekend vacation. Never again!

### "lived up to its star rating of 1.5"
Frontier once again lived up to its star rating of 1.5. My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.00 pm, arrive Tampa 4.50 pm. The first delay came 3 hours prior to take off, then another delay, and then another, now we are at a departure time of 9.00 pm. The last delay posted had departure at 9.45 pm. Finally after sitting at the airport for 5 long uncomfortable hours the flight was cancelled. If I could curse and swear on this review, I surely would. No more cheap Frontier airfares out of Trenton for me ever again.

### "has no consideration for passengers"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Minneapolis to Seattle via Denver. Leaving from MSP the flight was delayed by 30 minutes for a single passenger stuck in security despite having everyone else boarded. It feels like this airline cares more about the cost of putting a passenger onto another flight than the time consideration for other passengers. Whoever controlled the thermostat liked the temperature to be 60 degrees Fahrenheit for a two hour flight, which is actually three hours if you count delays while on the plane. The airline also charges for food despite massive delays. Overall it feels like this airline has no consideration for passengers aside from making it a cheap flight.

### "Worst service and customer care"
Orlando to Buffalo. Today is My 2nd booked trip in under 1 month. Both were delayed. Today flight 1726 is delayed 3 times. Without any compensation from your airline. Never again! Worst service and customer care I've ever seen. After talking at the service desk to find why the delay I found mechanical damage to the jetway. I then contacted the airline through facebook to voice my displeasure with the service. Another rep lies telling my the delay is due to weather in the flight path. Then they block me from posting on their media pages.

### "they refused to reimburse us"
Orlando to Denver. We have flown Frontier Airlines for years so we have had to deal with numerous cancellations. Recently, upon arriving at the Orlando Airport at 6:00 am for an 8:00 flight to Denver, we were informed the flight was cancelled and were provided a letter that indicated we could book our own flight and be reimbursed up to $400 per person for an economy flight on another airline. Since it was critical that we get to Denver ASAP for a wedding, we followed our normal procedure and began searching for alternative flights online. Obviously, the remaining flights available were later in the day and very expensive. The cheapest we could find was $550 for each person on United that got us to Denver late that evening. Since this appeared to be our only viable option, we booked the flight with the understanding that Frontier would reimburse us $400 per ticket. After our trip, we provided the flight information and proof of cost to Frontier but they refused to reimburse us for the tickets. They said that they could only refund $165 which was the cost we paid for the cancelled flight. We have followed this procedure many times with positive results but apparently Frontier changed their policy without informing anyone so we are now out the entire $1,100 we spent on replacement tickets. Therefore, if you dare fly Frontier, don't expect to be reimbursed for any replacement tickets. They totally mislead us!

### "still would not cancel the flight"
Providence to Miami. Our flight was scheduled for 1:50pm. We arrived at the airport at least two hours earlier. At approximately 1:30 we began receiving messages that the flight was delayed because an exit sign cover plate was missing on the plane. At 4pm we were told someone was driving the part from Newark, NJ to Providence and was expected by 8pm. This was a Friday night and it was pouring torrentially. At 7:30 the flight crew's shift ended and they went to a hotel, baggage was removed from the plane and passengers were told to retrieve it. Frontier still would not cancel the flight. Finally, we were told we could get $15 food vouchers and hotel vouchers if needed. My husband and I drove home and booked another flight on JetBlue for the next day, since the Frontier flight the following day was full. Frontier reimbursed us for the flight, and sent us a $250 voucher to get us to try their airline again. They would not cover our airport parking or anything else. Besides that, they charged for everything else - beverages, snacks, carryon bag. JetBlue was much more friendly and accommodating on our rescheduled flight.

### "Lost customer for life"
San Jose to Las Vegas. Do not use. Worst first impression ever! Booking change within 24hrs cost $100 for a $80 flight. I literally booked a flight on one day, tried to change to a day later departure 24 hrs later only to find there was no flight. Cancellation fee of $99 was read as a credit toward future flights. No, I was wrong. It was a flat fee for spending 20 minutes on their website. Lost customer for life.

### "never fly with them again"
Las Vegas to Tampa. Worst airline I have ever flown on! The seats are smaller than any other plane and do not recline. For someone like myself who gets air sick reclining has been the one thing to help. They charge you for your seat I have never had that happen either. They have about 3 rows up front that do recline but they are taken ASAP and are twice as much as the seats the regular seats. They have the nerve to charge $50 for a seat in the exit row that does not even recline either. Would never fly with them again you think you are getting a good deal but by the time you are charged for seats and luggage it would have been cheaper to fly on a more comfortable airline just horrible!

### "their hidden fees will cost you"
Tampa to Denver. The cost of the flight doubled as we both had carry-ons. News to me the company charges for checked bags and carry-ons, they also charge you per flight. So even if you’ve paid once they’ll charge you again. $180 for two little bags. They literally charge you for breathing. Word to the wise, Southwest is where it’s at for flying. If you so choose to fly Frontier Airlines, read every detail you can as their hidden fees will cost you.

### "Should’ve done more research"
Miami to New York. Worst airline I have flown with. Will never fly Frontier airlines again. Flight got delayed, not even because of weather. Expect to pay $45 for your carryon and another $45 for your check in bag. Over priced for no reason and surprise charge. Should’ve done more research before I booked a ticket through them. Complete nightmare flying with frontier.

### "I should have booked on Southwest"
I booked a flight on Frontier Airlines from San Diego to Denver and back last weekend. I paid extra for a front row seat and a "Bundle" which supposedly gets you more services and a carryon. My flight to DEN on Friday, January 19, 2018 was fine. When I booked my reservation the Friday ticket was less expensive than the return on Sunday morning, so I paid extra from a front seat and $30 and a carryon $30 for both flights. The total for the ticket was $250. On Saturday afternoon, while I was at lunch with my parents, I got an email from Frontier, and the subject line was "info" all lower case, no big deal. Later on that evening, I looked at the email agin, and when I read it, it said that "Your upcoming flight has been cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience this has placed on your travel plans, due to very high call volume you may make changes to your reservation for up to 2 weeks. First of all, this is "info"? so I booked a flight on Southwest and flew home. 2 days later I called Frontier, and he said you have a refund coming of $140. Today I see that I was credited $75. When I called customer service, they didn't care. Do not spend extra on their bundling, it's expensive and it's not refundable, even if they cancel on you. The seat upgrade was fine, but again, when they cancelled my flight, it was my bad luck that I had purchased an upgrade. Long story short, I should have booked on Southwest. Won't make that mistake again.

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Las Vegas to Milwaukee. Imagine arriving at your home airport at midnight on a Sunday night only to have to wait an entire hour to get your luggage. Milwaukee Airport was completely quiet, no other travelers around except for a Southwest flight that came in 10 minutes after but they all got their luggage right away and left. After 15 minutes of sitting at baggage claim with nothing happening, a Public announcement was made that our luggage would come in 20 - 40 minutes. It actually turned out to be 50 minutes. So our whole plane of people had to sit around for an entire hour waiting to get our luggage. No explanation, No apology and Nothing more than one public service announcement. It sure didn't feel like they care about their customer. And it really seemed obvious that they forgot to staff for our flight coming in! Nice going Frontier! Not only is your pricing misleading...who buys a ticket thinking they will need to also pay for their seat? And your seats are so uncomfortable! And you charge way too much for your checked or carry ons that the price of my ticket ended up being more than it would of been on Southwest! Now that I know all this, I will never fly Frontier again!

### "plane was extremely uncomfortable"
Flew New York to Atlanta. This was my first and last time flying through Frontier. The plane was extremely uncomfortable, over charged for drop off or carry ons. They also charge you for beverages at ridiculous prices, no entertainment for the whole entire time you’re there which make you feel anxious to land. No wifi in 2018 and to top it off flight attendants have an attitude problem. Why is this airline in service.

### "no one could help with anything"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Chicago to Miami. OK, so the flight was at 6am. Every 2 hours they delayed the flight! Horrible! They don't give you any options for what do to. Some of us had to be at the place at a certain time. But no one could help with anything. The staff were awful, not helpful at all. Never taking this company again.

### "great service for a great price"
Atlanta to Las Vegas. I bought my tickets 3-4 months before flight due to price. ($200 for two one-way, round trip tickets, with one window seat and one middle seat, without luggage) When it was closer to fly I started reading reviews due to my girlfriends first time flying, and let’s just say some reviews are misleading. For one it was easier than ever to check in and turn in checked baggage. All of the staff was more than friendly. We boarded plan 30 minutes early. Baggage claim started coming before we even arrived! They charge 3.99 for drink/snack, but you’re welcome to bring whatever you need on plane. (Liquids after security check). I read countless times about how bad the seats are. I personally think they wasn’t the best but I definitely think it’s nothing to complain about. Great job providing a great service for a great price! (Will leave another review on return flight)

### "canceled my return flight"
Frontier Airlines canceled my return flight from SLC to Reagan National airport “due to weather in Denver” but, as I looked at my options I found that none of the other flights from SLC to Denver on other carriers were canceled or delayed. This includes a United flight that was leaving within 10 minutes of my canceled Frontier flight. Looking deeper into it, Frontier even had a flight from Houston to Denver that was scheduled to land within 15 min of my canceled flight. Adding to my frustration, the earliest Frontier could get me back to DCA, was 52 hours after my scheduled arrival time. If this weren’t frustrating enough, when I went to check in for the flight (18 hours before the flight) their website was giving me errors so I was forced to call. At that time, agent confirmed my flight and asked about seating. When I asked the agent about how full the flight was, he indicated that it was “wide open, lots of available seats”, thus I chose to not pay an additional fee for an assigned seat. At 4:00 PM the day before (13 hours before scheduled departure) I received an email telling me that my flight was canceled due to “Weather”. Calling back in the Agent first told me that all flights into both Denver and Colorado Sort nags were canceled - when I pointed out that even Frontier had flights still scheduled to land at the for same time, I was told that the other planes were bigger and could handle the weather. Of course I knew that most of the planes were all very similar in size with some smaller and pointed that fact out to her. She then proceeded to tell me that they were coming from different directions so the weather wouldn’t affect those flights. At this point in time I realized that Frontier would be telling me whatever they could to get me to capitulate and just accept that 1) It was a weather delay; and 2) as such they were not responsible for the FAA required compensation. Recognizing that the flight I was on was, as they put it, was “wide open”, I suspect that Frontier was simply canceling an unprofitable flight while using weather to further reduce their costs. My fear is that this is standard practice on this “Low Fare” carrier who appears to always put their bottom line above service to their customers. In the end, I requested a refund for my flight and, although they only provided 37% of my original fare, it was better getting on the United flight that took the same route through Denver that left SLC 9 minutes after my scheduled/canceled Frontier flight. Note: I’m taking off from Denver now, on time, having had no delays in Denver on United.

### "it was not too uncomfortable"
New Orleans  to Philadelphia. The flight was on time, actually a bit early and since the plane was half empty and the flight short it was not too uncomfortable. I would not want to fly Frontier for a longer or fuller flight. The seats do not recline. I'm really curious how this helps their bottom line. Also everything including soda and pretzels costs extra. I don't mind paying for carry on since some people need to be discouraged from taking too much onto the plane. But pretzels and an assigned seat?? A seat that is not hard, ridged and non-reclining? Since there were many empty seats I think their business plan is not working.

### "had the worst experience"
San Juan to Orlando. This is the worst airline in which I have tried to travel, I have not yet been able to leave and I have already had the worst experience. My flight is 24 hours late and they continue to make excuses. They do not offer you help to return from the airport or to look for a hotel. The service is terrible. Es la peor linea aérea en la que he intentado viajar, aún no he podido irme y ya he pasado la peor experiencia. Mi vuelo lleva 24 horas de retraso y siguen dando excusas. No te ofrecen ayuda para regresar del aeropuerto ni para buscar un hotel. El servicio es pésimo.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew Frontier Airlines from Salt Lake City to San Antonio. Terrible company. Never flying with them again. My ticket price nearly doubled by the time I had paid for a carry on, checked bag and my seat. I needed to switch my flight to next Sunday and it is cheaper for me to fly Delta and repay for baggage than to switch a flight. Absolutely ridiculous, they got this customer for one flight but will never have him fly with them again.

### "Waited 9 hours in airport"
Booked to fly Frontier from Milwaukee to Las Vegas. Waited 9 hours in airport. After 5-6 delays flight was cancelled at 2am. Pilots houred out and the airline knew the flight could not happen but let 150 passengers wait around until the end. Currently have an empty unused paid hotel room on the Vegas strip. Worst travel experience of my life.

### "a poor excuse for an airline"
Booked to fly Milwaukee to Las Vegas. After 5 delays our flight was cancelled. There were no mechanical or weather issues. We were promised after the 5th delay to board and get in the air promptly. Then the captain and airline crew literally ran off the plane. Minutes later the desk person told us the flight was cancelled. People were irate. So what does Frontier do? Call the Police. One man was taken by the police. Because of Frontier I missed my training event. We were given $200 vouchers and re-booked for a flight 10 hrs later. I had already missed my event so there was no point in taking the later flight. An absolute joke and a poor excuse for an airline! This was my first attempt at flying Frontier and my last. How are these people still in business?

### "the worst airline experience I've had"
This is the worst airline experience I've had in my life. This flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to book another airline at double the price to enjoy my vacation. The alternative was to switch to a flight two days later when I was set to return home. I then find out other flights are flying into the same location 4 hours later. Why cancel the flight for a 4 hour delay? On top of that, I requested the airline to pay the difference in ticket price due to their decision to cancel rather than delay and was told no. I will never be flying Frontier again. A completely poor company with no reassurance.

### "My trip on Frontier was great"
Miami to Milwaukee. My trip on Frontier was great even with the delays I had, but how can I say something about it if there was snow covering the airport. the truth is that my plane had an hour delay but arrived to destination just 5 minutes late. The pilot really found the shortcut if that is possible. about leg room. I am a 6 feet 200 pounds guy and felt comfortable. the size is the same as the one you will have when in the back seat of a sedan. The crew was amazing, yes we do not have a screen in every seat but that was easy to fix. I downloaded 3 movies in my cellphone and enjoyed top amenities thanks to Netflix downloads. Enjoy your traveling, make sure your vacations are fun and if you pay 67 dollars for a ticket as I did, do not cry for meals and entertainment in the plane, just ask for a 20 million dollar machine that will take you front point A to point B safe and fast (their airplanes are top of the line).

### "a terrible airline"
Atlanta to New York. Just a terrible airline. I will never fly frontier again they turned a 2hr trip into 6 hrs had us sitting on the plane at 608am still here at 8am. Next time I'll just pay the money this is a real inconvenience and they not even offering tea or coffee. They made us get off the plane after waiting an hour, now they put us back on the plane been sitting here for an hour.

### "The plane was very dirty"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Las Vegas to Cleveland. The plane was very dirty! Floor was a mess. Tray table very small and dirty. Back of the seats dirty. Seats very uncomfortable. No leg room. Everything came with an extra charge. To sit together it cost $13 a person. All baggage cost extra. No beverage or snack for 4 hr flight. Awful airline will not fly with them again. Also, broke the handle on luggage beyond repair.

### "Absolutely horrible communications"
One way, direct flight on Friday where they managed to lose one of our bags (4 checked bags in PHL at the same time). No baggage counter at the CLT Airport, had to find another airline employee to go into the back to find someone. Would not deliver bag to our hotel (too far, I have never heard an airline state this), didn't matter as it took until Sunday before they ever figured where our bag was and then it took until the following Friday before they returned the bag. Absolutely horrible communications with their baggage department, they do not track any conversations, mistyped the delivery address numerous times, did not deliver the bags as promised and then fault our claim on equipment bought to make it through the weekend. Airline is cheap and poorly managed. Will not fly them again.

### "Overall it was a 6 hour delay"
The passengers started to get concerned after waiting an hour without departing. Were hardly informed of what was going on until about 1.5 hours later. Flight attendants were nice but said they didn’t have a clue what was going on and couldn’t answer any questions about anyone’s connecting flight. We were told navigation wouldn’t turn on as it was a mechanical issue. We waited so long the plane had to go through 30 minute deicing a second time. Aircraft got in line only to turn around back to the gate because we ran out of gas and had to refuel. We were delayed on the tarmac for three hours, they wouldn’t let us off. Everyone missed their connecting flight. Not offered any snacks or water. We were then told to get off the plane and wait. Overall it was a 6 hour delay. Waited in line for two hours with only 1 representative working only to be told there’s nothing they can do and no refunds or connecting flights would be given. Called service line while waiting in line and told they wouldn’t refund the Frontier connecting flight ticket as well. Took no responsibility. Also told that if we get on the plane to Denver “all hotels are booked and full” with no connecting flights, so it was basically a huge gamble to go or not. Finally got to Denver told again I won’t make it to Reno for a critical doc appt. and I’m 8 months pregnant. I actually broke down crying and I told them it was unacceptable and eventually they got three of us on another airline that day but we only had 30 min to go get our luggage and go back through TSA. Baggage and our gate were at completely different ends of the airport. TSA line longer than hell. None of us had eaten all day because of Frontier and waiting in line. Again I’m 8 months pregnant running through the airport on no fuel or water. I am very physically fit with this pregnancy but after all the stress and no answers to any questions I became fatigued running through the Denver airport. One lady I was with had GI surgery and they made her run with us. We almost didn’t make it. It was the absolute worst experience I’ve ever been through. I will never fly again, ever, and letting everyone I know not to use this airline. It was appalling. Pay a little extra and make sure you get to your destination. Was offered a $200 voucher which I think is a joke.

### "I'm not afraid of them anymore"
Flew Nashville, TN to Denver, CO. I was pretty leery about my first flight on Frontier, they've got a serious PR issue when you see all the bad reviews online, but I couldn't pass up the great price they had for a trip I wanted to take. Yes, they can a la cart you to death, but you won't get billed for anything that you haven't agreed to, so you can't pick on them for that. You should just spend some time comparing prices to decide whether you will save money by flying on their airline. Anyway, on my flight out of town, we were delayed for 20 minutes and moved to the gate 20 feet away, but we arrived 1 minute early. On my return flight, we were fully loaded and left a couple of minutes early, then arrived about 20 minutes early. Thumbs up! The seating area is a little smaller than the last Southwest flight I flew, but my round trip flight was about $100 cheaper that the most affordable Southwest flight I could find. Also, the seats don't recline and since I'm 6' tall I was definitely wanting to stretch my legs before landing (2.5 hour flight). The flight attendants were cheerful and helpful. And most importantly, the takeoffs, flights & landings were picture perfect. Now, am I a committed devotee of Frontier after my flight? No, it's definitely a discount airline that will probably cost more than nicer flights if you have a lot of luggage, but I'm not afraid of them anymore. I'll still check Delta & Southwest first, but I tend to fly so that I can get someplace quickly & safely. They did that.

### "Don't be fooled by the cheap tickets"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Miami to Trenton. Horrible airline that I will never fly with again. Firstly they ripped my luggage on the way to Miami and on our way back to Trenton the flight was delayed for almost 2 hours due to the crew not being on time. Don't be fooled by the cheap tickets, I would rather pay a few hundred dollars more for a different airline rather than take this airline again.

### "they want to charge you for everything"
Terrible. This is the cheapest airline I’ve ever flown with and they want to charge you for everything and at an outrageous price! To check in one bag with Frontier was $45. We paid $90 for two bags. Delta only charges $25, plus most other flight companies as well. The flight attendants were very kind, but come on, it’s 2018. We know you can afford to give everyone a free drink and some crackers and no charge for it. I’ve never been on an airline where they charged for all items and was actually in shock. Lastly, the seats do not adjust at all. You want to lean back a little and take a nap? Not going to happen! I actually fell asleep sitting up and my head landed on the shoulder of the man sitting next to me so my fiancé had to move my head onto his shoulder. The seats were hard and covered by plastic/leather material and not cloth so that just added to the uncomfortable part, also made me cold! Frontier is an airline I will never fly on again. Our flight out to Mexico was with Delta and it went perfectly. Direct flight, enjoyed a coffee, leaned back to take a quick nap on a comfortable seat, and the stewards were very kind as well. I will definitely make sure Expedia doesn’t sign us up for different flight companies next trip!

### "The best service ever"
Philadelphia to San Juan. The best service ever for my wife, my service dog and myself. Lovely employees and with a great sense of excellent service experience. We flew on December 17 from San Juan to Phily, on flight 91041 and was one of the best experience with an airline. And back from Phily to San Juan on January 4, on flight 91042, was the same great experience. Also, the aircraft was clean and the attentions of the crew was outstanding. The treatment to my service dog was super excellent. Thank you Frontier you made our trip a magical one.

### "tickets were cheap"
Flew Frontier airlines from Ontario (California) to Detroit via Denver on the 15th of December, right in the heat of the Christmas rush. Tickets were cheap, with two one way tickets running us about $200 total. Baggage is a little expensive, around $35 for carry ons and checked, but backpacks count as personal items and are free to carry on. I arranged to bring my emotional support animal and they were amazing about it. After emailing them verification they got back to me within 2 days and updated my account to show accommodations. No issues at all at the airport or on the plane. I do have to say you get what you pay for in some aspects though. We had a 5 hour layover in Denver, there isn't free food or drinks on the plane ($2 per cash only), and the ticket counter before security only opened up 1.5 hours before our 11am flight. But if all that's okay you'll be happy here and save a lot of money flying with them!

### "Frontier is very unprofessional"
One of the worst flights I've ever been on, when the flight landed we didn't even have a lane open for the flight, we had to wait 10 mins before getting out which was very unprofessional. Then as we get out I find out my flight is delayed. A couple of hours later and I'm tired but couldn't sleep in case I missed my flight. As we landed in Denver, the same thing happened and we had to wait again for a lane to open for our plane again! I don't understand how that happens twice in a row but Frontier is very unprofessional, this isnt the first time this has happened to me with Frontier. I would not recommend Frontier to any of my friends or family, sometimes people have places to be for jobs and work, and delaying the flight could cost them their job not to mention the bad service.

### "consider all other options"
Orlando to Detroit. In short family 3 vacation booked months in advance bought rip off upgrade everything package. Flight changed upgraded seats did not,  customer service booked "wrong seats" for family of three. Mom and I in emergency row, son in front both ways and downgraded on plane after take off, as attendent said could not keep seating arrangement executed by customer service. So on Orlando back to Detroit called again to customer service talked to manager and basically called a liar in regard to downgrade on plan of first leg so changed seats on way back and got money on second leg which was booked same as first leg. I paid for a lot and got very little - do yourself and your family a favor and consider all other options before booking.

### "lack of operational readiness"
Orlando to Las Vegas, The most pathetic airline I’ve ever flown. My flight was delayed due to frost on the wings during a chilly morning. As we saw all other airlines take off because they were prepared and equipped with defrosters. Huge lack of professionalism and operational readiness. I’m sure we can all agree no one can control Mother Nature but this problem could’ve been fixed if there was a little more thought and effort put into it. Never again will I fly this airline.

### "not having enough ground crew"
Milwaukee to Las Vegas. The 9:30 Milwaukee flight was delayed an hour and a half which resulted in an arrival in Las Vegas at 3am (Milwaukee time) instead of 1:30am. I understand situations happen and appreciate a delay for safety reasons, so I didn't think much of the delay except I was tired. On the flight home, we departed Las Vegas on time, but when we arrived in Milwaukee early but we sat in the airplane for over an hour because the airline was short ground crew staff. I assumed this couldn't be a coincidence and found out later the flight leaving Milwaukee was also delayed because of not having enough ground crew. This is not acceptable. Frontier is putting their own profit ahead of their customers comfort. My daughter has a friend that works on a ground crew at Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee. Her friend said it is common place for Frontier to have too few people working on the ground crew to keep up with incoming and outgoing flights. The flight was cheap, and the pilot and flight crew were pleasant. To some it is worth the price to get delayed flights and being left on the plane for extended periods of time. It isn't to me.

### "the worst flight ever"
Grand Rapids to Orlando. Frontier Airlines has to be the worst airline I have flown with. On my flight into Grand Rapids the flight was delayed 3 hours and only thing we received was a $25 dollar voucher. No complimentary drinks offered. Today on my flight back to Orlando we boarded the plane late. Were supposed to depart at 1:30pm and didn’t begin leaving until 3:00pm . Ridiculous and the communication is horrible, at least let us know what’s going on not let us sit for hours not knowing anything. Overall the worst flight ever and I’d never fly with them again. Never will recommend.

### "I will never fly frontier again"
Minneapolis to Denver. I have flown frontier in the past with no issues. I really had wished that would be the case this time around when making a quick trip to Minneapolis for a New Year's concert. This was far from the case. After loading everyone onto the plane, nearly about to take off at 535 in the morning January first there was a maintenance issue which caused us to be delayed until 10 am, with no notification or updates. We had our flight cancelled around noon, after waiting in limbo. Not only that but the rep working was not trained, technically not even a frontier employee but rather from a third party service and she was incredibly rude. We had an emergency at home and needed to try to get there asap, we were exhausted and frustrated with the service and we had to spend about two hours trying to get rebooked and a hotel voucher. They didn't put us on a flight until two days out,and refused us a second day voucher. Instead of arguing further we cancelled our return flight for a refund and had to rent a car to drive home. I will never fly frontier again due to how we were treated in one of the most stressful situations possible.

### "customer service is the worst"
San Francisco to Las Vegas, flight was delayed few hours, I was charged $45.00 for a 10 lb bag which I wasn't notified of and when I tried to speak to manager the staff stepped in for one-unprofessional, and unqualified employee Who presented herself to be the person to speak to as a manager, then she turned out to be a supervisor, who insisted there was no manager. Besides the poor quality of the airline services, the customer service they provide is the worst. Didn't get any sincere apologies or accommodations.

### "delayed 9 hours for maintenance"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Tampa to Providence. Worst airline hands down. Thought I should try a “budget” airline and I totally regret it. Flight was delayed 9 hours for maintenance. This sucks but is understandable. Problem was all passengers were given no info as gate agent left as people started or get frustrated. Customer service on phone was out of country and confused. Even going to the extent to say the flight was leaving at 2.17 when it was 2.45. Very disappointing. Also plane was really hot and the seats were uncomfortable.

### "never recommend this airline"
Denver to San Francisco. The worst flight I ever travelled. I never experienced paying $45.00 for each carry-on bag, or paying up to $15.00 for seat preferences. They delayed the flight 10 minutes before it’s departure time. We were told that, a flight attendant “called in sick”. Don’t they know it ahead of time? Looks like, there is no policy in place for employee sick call. I will never recommend this airline for any one.

### "Delayed, then cancelled"
Phoenix to Des Moines. Delayed, then cancelled. No communication whatsoever. New flight the next day, delayed. Flight coming home, delayed. No one knows what is going on. Very unprofessional. We got vouchers for future flights, but we will never fly on this airline again. I do not recommend flying on this airline unless you want to spend days stranded at an airport not knowing when you’ll get out.

### "the flight from hell"
Milwaukee to Phoenix. First I will start off by stating the obvious. Hidden fees. I will take responsibility for this due to my own lack of research and assuming there were no carry on fees or seat assignment fees. In return I would like Frontier Airlines to take responsibility for the flight from hell that many of us encountered. There were 3 gate changes and a 5 hour delay including sitting at the gate for over an hour after we were boarded. Nothing was offered to us to make any of us more comfortable. Not even a drink of water. The air quality on the plane was horrible. It was hot, stuffy, and stale. The worst part were the bathrooms. They were filthy. The floors were covered in sticky wet urine that we were forced to step in if we needed to use the restroom. Instead of the flight attendant just standing around staring back at us she could tidy up the restrooms so they are suitable for us. I did pay for a service and do expect my money to count for something other than getting me from point A to point B. I thought possible included in the flight were clean facilities for the passengers and quality air to breathe. I did call customer service asking for some type of compensation other than a $25 voucher to fly with them again and was denied. I will never use that $25 voucher because I don't plan on flying with Frontier again. I expect some sort of standards when I fly and for the airline to take some pride in what they do. Because the flight arrived the next day, I also had to pay for additional parking. Frontier offered nothing. So disappointed in this airline.

### "extra baggage fees are crazy"
Austin to Las Vegas. Issues with their online booking system (not on my end) caused $400 in extra fees, making it more expensive than a full service airline. When I called to resolve the issue, the only other option given is to cancel with no refund. The extra baggage fees are crazy, and no one ever checked for a receipt to show I had paid. If you want to be sure your children can be next to you, they force you to pay for your seat assignment. My son was seated away from us by himself, even though he was booked with my family and has the same last name. They would only move us together if I paid an additional $60 each seat for my family of 4. The seats have no padding, are seriously uncomfortable, are even closer than normal, and do not lean back at all. Snacks and sodas are additional $5 or more each.

### "ruined my vacation"
Austin to Las Vegas. This is my first time using Frontier and it would be my last as well because: long delays, no one takes responsibility, no attempt to get customer satisfaction and no plan for the delay. This airline ruined my vacation. I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.

### "worst customer service"
Milwaukee to Phoenix. They have the worst customer service. The plane was delayed for over 3 hours with mechanical issues. They refused to help people or be clear about what was going on. They didn't give refunds or any compensation even though the delays were their fault. Do not fly this airline.

### "felt there was no professionalism"
Orlando to Minneapolis. So my trip to Minneapolis was not bad, pilot flew the plane great, flight attendant was great. What I didn't like is that I felt there was no professionalism, staff was on their phone chit chatting not paying attention. Anyway this was my first flight on Frontier and it will be the last, they charge you fees for everything, the luggage I could understand but what I don't get is why charge me for seat assignment. Isn't that why i bought my ticket. I was flying with my two younger daughters (8 and 2 year old) and I had to spend an extra $300 round trip and that's only for luggage and seat assignment, so in all I paid $900 for all three of us. I chose them because of how inexpensive their prices were, but I guess you pay for what you get. To top it off, they lost my baggage on a straight flight, that makes no sense what so ever. Anyways Frontier has lost me as a customer and I will pay the extra money for Delta or Jetblue that gives you free luggage, free seat selection, free snacks on board and excellent customer service. They deserve a -1 in my books.

### "This was the worst flight"
Denver to Salt Lake City. This was the worst flight I have ever been on. They boarded all passenger's 2.5 hours before we even took off. The flight attendants were terrible, didn't even apologize for the disaster of the delay in take off, the exhaust fumes during the wait caused me one of the worst headaches I have ever had. The one hour flight took three hours and they offered nothing to drink. Never again will I fly this airline.

### "my last flight with Frontier"
My third time with Frontier Airlines. This company is always late by at least an hour. Today (12/25/2017), the Houston to Denver flight was delayed about 1 hr, and another 2 hr 10 min delay for the Denver to SLC flight. I am supposed to be at SLC at around 11.30 pm, but now I am writing this review because my flight does not leave DEN until 12.15 am. The only thing I hope for now is “no more delays” on Christmas. I already received 4 texts regarding flight delays. Another thing I really hate about this company - they charge for seat assignment. If I don’t pick a seat (about $10-$25 per each flight), the company assign any available seat randomly. This is my last flight with Frontier.

### "Never flying Frontier again"
Austin to New Orleans. The flight was the cheapest of the other airlines. When it came time to check in online, it wouldn’t allow me the option to check my bags after several attempts. I got to the airport to check my bags and the fee was a whopping $45 for the first bag and $35 for the carryon and they don’t accept cash. The rates would have been slightly cheaper for checking in online, I explained to the clerk that I tried to check in several times online and it wouldn’t let me. She gave me a number to call. I got my boarding pass and I got to the gate and it didn’t have a seat assignment so I had to get out of line and wait to be issued and new boarding pass. So the flight was actually more expensive than the other flights after they charge high rates for your bags. Never flying Frontier again.

### "cramped seats and numerous hidden fees"
Overall terrible experience from Milwaukee to Salt Lake City via Denver. Our first flight was delayed 3 hours, 1 of which was spent sitting on the plane waiting to take off unable to use the bathroom. Our connecting flight was delayed even longer with terrible communication from the staff for both flights. This experience, on top of their already uncomfortable, cramped seats and numerous hidden fees means they will never again get my business.

### "my first and last time"
New Orleans to San Antonio. Christmas Day my return flight is 2 hr 53 min delayed. No issues with flight here last week. They can’t fly me out on another airline because they aren’t affiliated with any. The phone customer service people are those outsourced overseas help desk people. They have no stake in customer satisfaction because they aren’t invested in the company. This ticket was half the price of the Southwest Airlines one but you get what you pay for. This was my first and last time I am ever flying this airline. You can’t run a company like this. On the mobile app, no indication or information about flight delay. No customer service at the gate and no display at the gate to let folks know there is a delay or what to do. In flight - They sell you a credit card on the flight. You have to pay for everything, they won’t even bring you water. I paid $25 to upgrade my seat and it was comfortable.

### "this is by far the worst"
La Guardia to Atlanta. Seats are too small,  you have to buy any snacks or drinks, have to pay for carry on bags. That being said this was my first and last time using this airline. Plane was one hour late - once we did board there was a customer that would not comply and instead of removing him on the spot so the rest of us could get home on Christmas Eve they waited about 30 mins until 2 NYPD officers came on and took the person off. That put us basically 2 hours late from departing. Being in the Military I have used pretty much every airline there is and this is by far the worst. Traveling is expensive already but to charge for something that should be complimentary is absurd. Not a big review person but this was the most horrible flying experience in my life. Never again Frontier.

### Space tight, luggage very expensive"
Milwaukee to Denver. I don’t typically leave reviews, but as a first time Frontier customer, this will surely be my last. To elaborate a bit more, our flight was at 6:30 PM, in which we arrived at 4:00 PM (knowing it was be extremely busy for the holidays). At check in we came to find one employee working the desk, with a line that wrapped around the airport. Note, the other airlines had multiple employees, but only Frontier had an actual line. After waiting about 1 hour and 15 minutes, we were able to get through security (a breeze). The aircraft eventually arrived late, and we were boarded without any issues. Now as we speak, it is 7:39 PM and we have just been informed by the attendant that the employees “are short staffed” and it will be another 30 minutes until employees can actually help come load the luggage. It has now been over an hour and the aircraft is extremely warm. Many people have asked for water or ice due to the heat and the Frontier attendants are extremely unkind. A mother asked for water for her toodler and she was completely denied. I doubt we will be leaving anytime soon, as the employees are all busy chatting and laughing in the front of the aircraft while the passangers all suffer. Additionally, don’t be fooled by the low prices. Space is tight, luggage is very expensive and there are many hidden fees. I guess there’s a reason why frontier lands itself in last place for the quality rating. Quality is something that this airline seriously lacks!

### "never use this company again!"
New Orleans to Denver. While flying Frontier Airlines last February, the stewardess convinced me to sign up for their frequent flier program. She said it's the best program and miles don't expire. So I paid $80 to sign up for their credit card. To my surprise, I logged in my account the other day and saw that on December 14th, my miles had "expired!". When I demanded to know what happened, they said I could have them back if I paid them more money! I will never use this company again!

### "they would not replace my stroller"
Las Vegas to Atlanta. I flew Frontier Airlines to take my 4 month old daughter home for the first time. We arrived at our destination to find that our stroller was broken to the point we could no longer snap our car seat in. We had this stroller for 4 months and now it is ruin beyond use. Of course I called to let them know, they told me to file a claim which I did. Their response was that they would not replace my stroller but they hope we fly with them again. This is my first and last time flying with this airline. They don’t take into consideration their customers personal belongings. Plus the seats were hard and very uncomfortable. If you plan to fly this airline, good luck and I would just suggest you take another airline.

### "has more hidden fees"
Oklahoma to Salt Lake City via Denver. Frontier has more hidden fees than I have encountered flying. You book your ticket for a seemingly low price. When it's time to check in they charge you not only for your checked luggage (like every airline) but also your carry on. Not only that, they charge you per seat per flight to select a seat. With adding luggage, carry on and 4 seats later it's an additional 200 bucks minimum. I will never fly Frontier again. At least be upfront about your cost prior to booking.

### "I blame the Frontier rep"
Fort Myers to Providence. I arrived at the airport 1hr and 44 minutes prior to flight, the line to check bags was 1 hr 30 long with only two staff at the counter. A Frontier representative came through and asked all passengers on the Providence flight to go to the front of the line - so we did. When we got there other passengers were screaming and swearing at us, it was mayhem. I don't blame the other passengers for being angry. I blame the Frontier rep for not escorting us and taking control of the situation. The prices are very good but the logistics at check in are very slow.

### "she was stuck in traffic"
Long Island to Tampa. I booked a flight for my sister and her kids for December 18, and I called the airline and told them that she was stuck in traffic. I spoke to a young lady and she told me to call back and talk to an agent, which I did but I kept being placed on hold. So I called today and the agent told me that there's nothing they can do for me, I'm very unhappy and I will never book with Frontier Airlines again.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Cheap air fair, but the customer care is horrendous. I had a flight from Atlanta to Austin, $77 round trip. Seemed unbelievable (as I should have known, it was). Beyond just uncomfortable seating, they do not care about what is best for their customers. I had my flight scheduled but it was canceled due to snow hitting GA. If you know anything about the south, we don't get snow often. So when we do, everyone goes crazy, despite Atlanta only getting a few inches. Something I would assume these planes are equipped for since they fly to cities like Chicago and New York during the winter months. So, I had taken time off work but wound up rescheduling my flight for the following weekend, leaving me to take off even more time from work but I didn't see this as a major downfall if it meant visiting a close friend. Well, of course, this weekend happened to be the weekend Hartsfield Jackson had a power outage. So here I am again, dealing with another canceled flight from Frontier--despite the fact that the power returned Sunday night and my plane wasn't landing until 2pm on Monday. Other airlines were still flying in on Monday, yes maybe the power outage only affected certain airlines but I am still unsure as to why Frontier had to cancel on Monday when everything was fixed Sunday night. So, Frontier gives me the option of rebooking my flight for no additional costs. Awesome! Nope. The next flight they could offer me was on Friday with a connecting flight in Denver (sounds like too many hours on a Frontier plane already, right?). Plus it wasn't realistic for me to stay five additional days! Money is needed and I can only make money if I work but alas, I cannot work if I am not in Georgia. Frontier offers to give me a refund. For $33. If you travel frequently, you know $33 isn't going to do jack shit for a last minute flight home the week of Christmas. To fly out on Monday tickets were as "cheap" as $800. I wound up booking a flight for Tuesday for $280. Frontier then offered me a $50 voucher. As if I ever want to fly with them again. I called and spoke with a supervisor to see if they could give me a refund or compensate for my flight. He told me repeatedly that it "wasn't their fault," and I politely reminded him that the power outage was not my fault either, nor was the $280 ticket I had to buy home. He demeaned me by reminding me that a $50 voucher along with a $33 refund is more than what I spent in the first place--as if I could not do that math on my own. I understood that fully but that voucher still wasn't helping me with the extra $280 I had to pay out of pocket around the holidays. He refused to give me a full refund, despite me saying I would prefer that over the voucher, and continued to speak down to me as if I did not understand that the power outage wasn't their fault. Not only were they not willing to work with me, each person I spoke with treated me as if I were an idiot and didn't understand the circumstances. The man kept reiterating that this was a loss for Frontier too. Well, it's going to continue to be an even bigger loss for them if they continue to treat their customers like this. I will never fly with Frontier again. Spend the extra $100, fly with Delta. They seem to be handling the power outage with grace and dignity. Maybe Frontier could learn a thing or two from them if they really want a chance at being a big airline.

### "would not sit her with one of us"
Austin to Ontario. Tickets are inexpensive but the ticket we bought my granddaughter was purchased a week after us on the phone she is 3 years old. The lady on the phone said she was linked to me an adult on the plane. When we got to Austin they said it wasn’t linked to me but she put her with one of the adults in our party. On our way back from Ontario the airline would not sit her with one of us, they said it was a full flight! Then they said I could get a seat next to her but I had to pay for a preferred seatt! That they expect a 3 year old to be able to ride on a plane by themselves! The supervisor said her children minors fly by themselves. As a supervisor you need to use common sense. If you let your 3 year old fly by themselves I don’t only question your common sense but your parenting also.

### "a bad taste for this airline"
Denver to Austin. Bought a ticket to get to Austin at a specific time for an appointment, landed on time then had to wait to go to a gate for an hour and 15 mins. Missing my appointment. The seats had no padding on then and was like sitting in a metal bucket seat. The overall experience has left a bad taste for this airline. Not many airlines deserve for some to say this about them, but I hope they shut down, and do some work on their coordination. Unacceptable.

### "seats were hard as a rock"
Miami to La Guardia. It seems like a good deal until you get to the airport and find out all the hidden fees. From carrying on our bag $45 dollars, same price to place it under, to paying for a drink on the flight. Seats were hard as a rock can’t lean the seat back. In the end u end up paying the same as if u were going on a high end airplane.

### "Will never fly Frontier ever again"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Denver to Phoenix. Horrible service on the plane and waited for ever for it to arrive. Now I've been sitting here waiting for over 50 minutes on bags and everyone else from other flights have gotten there’s. Will never fly Frontier ever again. This was the worst experience I have ever had. Going to visit family and waiting a hour for my bags.

### "What a terrible experience"
Philadelphia to Fort Myers. The plane was late to arrive to pick us up which happens but then on top of that maintenance was done to the plane right before we took off- maybe it should been done before we got on and sat there for an hour. To top it all off once arrived to destination they made us sit for another hour because another plane was docked at our gate. What a terrible experience. I wish they would do things for customers and passengers instead of leaving a bad taste in there mouths.

### "never fly with them again"
Flew round trip from Denver to Tampa in December 2017. Very cramped seating with no amenities on the flight. I was overcharged for baggage and seat assignment without explanation of the charges and without any resolution from the airlines. Will never fly with them again.

### "absolutely no communication"
Nashville to Orlando. 15 minutes after departure time, there is no one at the desk, no plane at the gate, no indication on the board that the flight is delayed, absolutely no communication about when this flight might leave! The other airlines paged Frontier staff, they still aren’t here.

### "clean, spacious and comfortable"
Overall great experience and pleasantly surprised with all the negative reviews I’ve read. Booked online tickets, great value, printed off boarding pass at home as well as downloaded the app to have on mobile. Had no bags to check, just a personal item so was easy at the airport. Flight boarded on time, a little delay in take off for de icing, clean, spacious and comfortable. Flight attendant was excellent! Probably the best customer service I’ve had in a long time! Will definitely use frontier again.

### "won’t be flying Frontier again"
Flew Phoenix, Arizona to Orlando, Florida. During time of purchase of an upgrade and also during check in I tried to apply my KTN for pre-TSA, and it said that the front desk at the airport will be able to add my number for me. Getting to my flight 90 minutes before my flight, the front desk employees said they were “too busy” to put my KTN in. This wouldn’t be so frustrating if I didn’t register for pre-tsa to avoid having to go through the General Security line. Frontier reminded me of why customer service goes such a long way. I won’t be flying Frontier again and will tell others my experience.

### "flight crews were miserable"
Flew Washington DC Regan to Denver CO. Frontier is the worst airline in business. They charge you for the flight obviously, but then you have to pay $45 for your checked bag, $50 for the second, $25 for a carry on and so on. If you want a water or soda, have your credit card ready. Nothing is free. I'm surprised they don't charge you for oxygen, life vest, restroom use, etc. The flight crews were miserable from the Captain down to the flight attendants. It felt more like Con Air. They make it seem like a cost efficient way to travel, but I would rather walk without shoes in a snowstorm for 500 miles. The seats are like sitting on concrete and don't recline. We will never ever fly with them again. Not worth it! Flying Southwest or Delta would have been a better choice.

### "did everything she could do"
Memphis to Las Vegas. Distraught I booked the wrong day. I cancelled thinking I could just rebook but there is a 7 day rule that says anything within 7 days is non refundable. I called Frontier Airlines customer service and she did everything she could do and gave me a credit of what i paid toward a next flight. They didn't have to do that but did. Very grateful.

### "taxes and fees cost me nearly double"
Portland to Salt Lake City via Denver. I bought my tickets thinking I got a half decent deal. I was incorrect. Airfare cost $66 and change, which is great! But the taxes and carrier imposed fees cost me nearly double. if you include the $18 I had to pay for my seats it is even closer to double. Secondly, the airline charges you for literally everything. No refreshments and no nibbles. No Wi-Fi, and no leg room. The only reason I bought the tickets I did was for a last minute interview that was scheduled prior to relocation to Salt Lake City. Had I known about the financial fisting I would receive I would have went with an airline that at least offered me a snack and a drink before bending me over. At least the Flight Attendants were pleasant. You're fired forever Frontier; maybe one day I will have the pleasure of witnessing the airline going bankrupt.

### "the whole experience impressed"
New Orleans to Orlando. After a fun filled four days in New Orleans, my 74 year old mother was feeling worn out. She had hurt herself and hurt her knee. So, I checked us in with a wheelchair box marked to ensure Mom would not have to walk. We arrived to the airport almost 2 hr early and the agent greeted us with a cheery smile & checked our luggage. There wasn’t a line but a steady flow of customers. We watched him for a long time as after 40 minutes and 3 calls no wheelchair person had come. He was so cheerful & great in his customer interactions that every passenger walked away smiling. Since I had explained I couldn’t push Mom & take our coats etc. he took us himself when no one else ever came. He was reassuring & got us to the gate just in time for our flight. He is an asset to the staff at Frontier. In a strange twist, there was a medical emergency on our flight. While I can’t remember the attendants names, I must say, they were on it. I was a nurse on a medical surgical floor and this is the fast kind of response needed. Fortunately, there were two Dr’s on board but all in all the whole experience impressed. We’ve been to over 50 countries & fly all the time, this was one of the best airline experiences we have had. I paid $19.40 for these tickets. For all these low star reviews I say, don’t expect luxury for pennies and when it counted frontier staff acted just as they should and super professionally!

### "would never fly Frontier again"
Salt Lake City to Orlando via Las Vegas. Flying Frontier is the worst flying experience I have ever had! The flight attendants are rude and unprofessional. I was charged 3 times for my bags instead of 2 times but don't try to speak to a representative because they only see 2 charges, yet I look at my statement and there's 3. I would never fly Frontier again and would not recommend it to anyone! It's worth the extra $50 to fly a different airline!

### "Who wants to use them again"
First time using Frontier Airlines from Orlando to San Francisco. Very big mistake after an hour late departure from Orlando due to overloaded flight, one of the mechanics forgot to close the fuel cap panel so after just an hour of flight and after losing hundreds of gallons of fuel, the plane had to land in New Orleans where they left us for 4 hrs. Not having anybody from the airline to talk to, to at least find out what the problem was, 4 hrs later they showed up with a few pizzas, trying to buy you out, and still coming out with lies because apparently nobody knew what was going on. They started emailing $200 vouchers towards our next flight with them, are you kidding me? Who wants to use them again.

### "customer service was miserable"
Absolutely the worse flight of my life flying from Atlanta to Denver, Colorado! The seats were so uncomfortable and did not recline so you had no room for your legs. I am not tall by any means. The customer service was miserable of epic portions. There was zero entertainment provided. I am a mother of 8 who likes to save where I can, but the back pain I endured after the flight and the repulsive atmosphere that was given off by the employees made me decide that I will not ever fly with Frontier Airlines again.

### "very uncomfortable flight"
Las Vegas to Raleigh/Durham. Very uncomfortable flight, no leg space seats did not adjust and they were hard as bricks. Had to walk to front to ask the staff for a drink of water, and they had the nerve to get an attitude, long flight, I was hungry and thirsty and they offered nothing.

### "have not had one good experience"
These clowns can not be on time for the life of them. I have to fly with them because of where I live. We have been sitting on the plane for 25 min with nobody getting on the speaker saying why we are not leaving. The plane was already 30 min late. I travel back and forth from Colorado Springs to Los Angeles for meetings and they have cost me a lot of money not being on time. I’ve now missed my first very meeting which has messed up my whole day. Very disappointed in the way they charge as well. It’s all itemized, your charged for a carry on, checked bag and a purse. Crazy. I have flown with them a lot and have not had one good experience. Wish it was different. I have never left a review but felt I had to.

### "a king of hidden fees"
Austin to Atlanta. This is a king of hidden fees. Checked and carry on bags are all $40-60 each. To get a seat assignment you pay $11-25 per seat. Expect a long wait for checked bags. We waiting in Atlanta for 45 mins for our bags. No wifi, entertainment on the planes. This is my first and last time flying this airline. Avoid like the plague!

### "was such a bad experience"
Salt Lake City to Denver. This was my first and last experience with this airline. If you are smart (which I was not-- I booked thinking it would be fine for such a short flight), don't fly this airline. Nothing was good about this airline. You get what you pay for and in this case you think you are getting a good deal, but in the end with all their charges you are not getting a good deal. The website did not work--booking for the wrong date and trying to get you to book more expensive seats when I picked a cheaper one. I finally had to leave the website and book on another website. I actually wonder if the website purposely books the wrong day so you will have to pay more money. They charge for everything, even a back pack to carry on! There was not even an agent at the gate and people were just standing there waiting to check in (8:30am). The agents at the airport were rude although the reservation agents on the phone were more professional. I never complain about poor service, but this was such a bad experience, I wanted others to know what to expect. I am sure they will not change or improve their practices as a result of this review--they are not classy enough to do that. I just want warn others before they waste money! As others have said in these reviews (I wish I had read them), fly with a real airline. There motto is something like "Economy airline done right" - that is a huge joke. It is an example of just the opposite.

### "not going to fly Frontier anymore"
❎ Not Verified |  Denver to Los Angeles. So I’ve flown Frontier more than a couple times and I’m military so I come from Colorado Springs. Every single time we land in LAX we still end up waiting a full 40-60 mins to even dock. Never fails, always happens every single time. Can this airline not coordinate this better? Are they just lazy? Or are they just so cheap they can’t afford more docks for their own planes. Anyways, not going to fly Frontier anymore.

### "should be fired if not retrained"
Houston to Denver. Thanksgiving November 23, 2017 5am at the ticket counter. Got there 5 mins after 45 min cut off time for check bags but still plenty of time for the flight. Houston Intercontinental terminal A is relatively close to check in and gate. Frontier told us to take our checked bags through the TSA screening. Mins pass by as they consult if they can let the bag through. After viewing the x-ray back and forth they said I had to remove 5-10 items. By the time we got the ones that we needed to discard out our terminal gates closed right in front of our eyes. We were a family of 4 along with 8 other passengers were left stranded and all accounted for in front of the gate. Now tell me how does Frontier let this happen to 12 people on Thanksgiving Day? I called 801-401-9000 (frontier customer service) and customer service rep said “This May be a special day for you but it’s just another day for us at Frontier.” That really was the tipping point. We are all looking for a good deal but if the trade off is to be treated like you're non-existent is unacceptable. Their front counter staff to the customer service support number should be fired if not retrained. When you’re at the counter and the agent is more concerned with what’s going on in her Facebook and Snapchat to even look at you in the eye, you’re in trouble.

### "nickel and dime you for everything"
❎ Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas. The flight was not that bad. For the price I paid it was worth it. If I have anything to complain about is the cost of inflight drinks. A small bottle of water or a can of soda for $3.00? That is a bit too extreme, and, if you don’t have a debit/credit card you’re out of luck. Aside from the above issues, my biggest complaint is that the seats don’t recline and that the airline nickel and dime you for everything. I will not get used to paying for a carry on bag.

### "I'm done flying Frontier"
Omaha to San Francisco via Denver. Couldn't get a working boarding pass. After I checked in on your website using my laptop, I never got an email confirmation with a boarding pass as I do with all other airlines. So, I logged back in to your website and went to print the boarding pass, but since I didn't have a printer, I just took a screenshot and sent that to my phone. I arrived at the airport 45 minutes before the flight with just a laptop back. I thought I'd go to the check-in counter and get a proper boarding pass just in case, but the woman said that it was closed and she had no way to print a boarding pass. I checked my phone and it was exactly 45 minutes before the departure time. So, I went to security and tried to use my screen shot of the boarding pass and we couldn't make it work. I then went back to the website using my phone and I couldn't find any way pull up the boarding pass again. TSA said they couldn't let me in with a boarding pass that would scan. So, I went back down to the check-in counter and was told again that they had no way to print a boarding pass as they were completely locked out 45 minutes before the flight. And, the one self check-in kiosk was broken. The woman the check-in counter was absolutely unhelpful. Her only suggestion was that I buy a ticket for the United flight that was leaving 15 minutes later. I didn't even get a sincere apology. There was a guy standing around and I'm still not sure if he worked for Frontier or not as he didn't have a uniform, but he heard what was going on and suggested I install your app. After a few minutes getting that setup, I was finally able to get a boarding pass on my phone that worked and I made my flight just a couple of minutes before the doors closed. I've been flying 30 to 50 flights a year for the past 40 years and while I've had problems in the past, I've never seen such a complete breakdown of the check-in process as this. First, I should have received a boarding pass in my email (yes, you had the right email address and no it didn't go to my junk mail). Second, it's ridiculous that your agent can't print a boarding pass 45 minutes before a flight departs even when a customer is not checking a bag. Third, there should be at least one working kiosk that can print the pass. Fourth, there should be an obvious way to view the boarding pass on the website. I had been able to on my laptop by clicking the check-in button, but when I opened the browser on my phone, even though I had already checked in that button was disabled (I supposed again because of the 45 minute issue). I can't afford to miss flights because the airline can't figure out it's check-in system and I'm done flying Frontier.

### "Does any airline care?"
Houston to San Jose via Denver. We actually didn't fly. In Houston, we ran into a situation were all lanes of traffic were blocked. My husband had dropped his Driver's License in the San Jose International Airport, who'd sent us a picture and told us to arrive early for our return flight for extra screening on our return flight. Since the lanes were blocked, and there was no way around that, we pre-boarded while stuck on the road. After advising TSA that we would be late for our flight soon, they went into sloth-mode, calling a supervisor who didn't appear for 10 minutes. My husband provided the necessary alternative forms of ID listed on TSA's own requirements, and they proceeded to pat him down, etc. We ran, arriving at the Frontier gate to board 12 minutes before our flight was to depart. We were told the gate would close 10 min prior. There were no employees at the desk, and there was no way to reach them. We ran to the next gate and asked what to do. They told us to knock on the door to the gangway. We pounded on the door until we saw our plane take off. Then the employees came in, and we explained our situation. They offered to fly us out 2 days later. That was all they would offer. It took 2 minutes for them to make that decision, and they said they had no sister airline to accommodate us sooner. We offered to fly into San Francisco or Oakland. Still, they said, they had nothing. I called their call center at 5.40am, and spoke to another country who had nothing to offer, and didn't even check to see if there were earlier flights. This airline clearly wasn't trying to reschedule us, and did want to keep our money, which is what they did do. It doesn't behoove them to accommodate us, because they already have our money. We were forced to buy tickets on another airline for $700 in order to get home in time to meet our obligations of work and childcare in San Jose. Frontier doesn't care. TSA doesn't care. Does any airline care?

### "absolutely terrible experience"
❎ Not Verified |  Orlando to Colorado Springs. From the start of this flight it was an absolute mess. I got to the airport for my 6:30 flight over 2 hours early. The line for luggage checking was ridiculously long with only 3 people checking bags. We were told only certain lines were for certain flights, but nothing was labeled so new people coming had no clue what they were supposed to do. One line they later said wasn't a line. When we got to the counter they told us we were in the wrong line (after having waited an hour). The desk staff was extremely rude and unorganized for such a large airport. Then at our gate, 20 min after boarding should have started they tell us the plane just landed from Cancun and there was a security check that would last at least 20 min. (Except the fact the plane was already at the gate 30 mins,  or more before that) the flight was delayed over 45 min, for a 6:30am flight. What an absolutely terrible experience. I will never fly them again.

### "they get you there"
Washington to Las Vegas via Denver. I describe Frontier Airlines as "they get you there". I say this because the planes are uncomfortable and the flight plans are pretty rough, especially if you are buying tickets during a promotion. The promotional times generally cover weekdays, less Friday. And the flight plans during those days generally involve stopping in Denver, which could be 1 hour or up to 3 hours. Denver airport is very big, and comfortable, but it is a pain to stopover for west-bound travel. I do recommend the cheap $20 travel insurance. There seems to be a high incidence of delays with flights. My flight from Las Vegas was delayed by a half hour because of crew issues. My flight from San Francisco the week prior was cancelled because of the pilot thinking there was a huge maintenance issue. The cancellation resulted in my wife and I getting $200 vouchers, which I guess was a result of having the travel insurance. $400 free, great. But now we have to fly with Frontier again, and I have to use the vouchers within 3 months of issuance (ugh). Frontier is a budget airline, and I get what that involves - fees for everything. I just wish that they would be a bit more focused on their budget status. Budget airline implies they want to fly as many minutes possible and be on the ground as few minutes as possible. Meaning, the quicker it takes to load the plane the more money they make since they can fly more. I would like to know if European airlines do this, but Frontier should be different from all the standard airlines and load the plane from the back first instead of by zone, mostly front first. Yes, I understand that this may result in the people who pay for seat upgrades (which are in the first 5 rows of the plane) to possibly lose the ability to stow their carry-on because of limited bin space, but perhaps they should force people who take the cheap option (like me) to check their baggage. Already there is a $5 incentive to check baggage when you buy tickets. It is usually $30 to carry-on a bag and $25 to check it. I chose to save those $5 and checked one big bag for my wife and I. They should make the incentive bigger for the cheap-minded passengers, like $15 or something because there are still too many people carrying bags on, and carry-ons slow down the boarding process. Perhaps they should setup a system wherein they limit the number of carry-on purchases based on bin space, with priority given to those who pay for seat upgrades. Like other budget airlines, everything comes at a cost - $10 for not printing a boarding pass at home (rarely enforced), cost for food on-board, cost for upgraded seats, cost for selecting a seat at check-in (if you must select a seat for free, you need to do it early and you are limited to the center seat in the last 10 rows or so). Just select no seat and let the system do it for you. The worst part of frontier is the seat. The width and the leg room are pretty standard, and the seat base cushion is fine, but the seat back is horrible. It is a layer of plastic covered by a thin layer of padding and then a thin layer of leather. And the backs don't recline. It is super uncomfortable to try sleeping. The trays are small, so good luck putting your head down. The next time I fly Frontier (which will be the last time I fly, thanks to the vouchers) I will pay for the seat upgrade to the front 5 rows which are more like Delta's seats, comfortable and they recline.

### "thank them for the kindness"
I used Frontier Airlines  on a round trip from Miami to Long Island return. In both directions the attention was very good. I would like to thank them for the kindness they treated us both in flight and in their kiosks at the airports. They were impeccable flights. I recommend it totally.

### "Over $100 in extras"
Salt Lake City to Las Vegas. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on a real airline. Frontier may seem like a deal until you have to pay to carry on a bag or to know what seat you’ll have. Over $100 in extras. The flight was late and water costs $3 for a small bottle of water.

### "they separated my family"
I've flown countless times on what I've heard to be the worst airlines while in the marine corps, never really cared about comfort or TVs. Anyways I'm a veteran now flying with a car seat and a 7 month baby that I couldn't even comfort because they separated my family. This was the first and last time flying Frontier. Between last minute check-in bag fees and the treatment we received I felt I had to leave a review. Never flew on a plane that felt unsafe as soon as we took off. I stood awake my entire flight from California to Florida because the seats could not recline. The plane had no TVs for children, no free refreshments, small seats, barely any leg room, stiff hard chairs, rude staff and dirty bathrooms. We brought a car seat onto the plane and after 80% of people loaded we finally started to board and set up the car seat with two crying babies. Then we were told the car seat had to go in a window seat but I didn't have a window seat so it took them about 15 mins to find someone to move us to a seat with a window only to separate my family so the baby can be seated with his mom while I sat on another row. Last but not least out of all the airlines I've been to they always allow mothers or parents with car seats to get situated first so they can have time to set up the car seat but the rude flight attendant said "I understand but we need you to sit down and buckle your seatbelt".

### "flight is comfortable"
Las Vegas to San Jose. Newer A320  between San Jose and Las Vegas. The flight is comfortable. I paid extra $20 to seat at 2nd row, but my carry-on baggage can not be put on row 2 cabinets which is reserved for row 1 seats even though there are spaces available, and row 3 cabinets are all full because passengers boarded first, I was forced to put my carry-on bag under seat and couldn't stretch my legs, or put it far away from my seat. This is the first time I couldn't use cabinets on top of my seats on an airplane after more than 40 years traveling around world, and it's the first time I take Frontier airlines.

### "my experience was satisfactory"
This was my first time flying on Frontier from Miami to Las Vegas. They are a no frills, nothing included airline. My ticket cost was only $50, but I added the full upgrade package for another $99 which included being able to chose my seat (any seat) and free bags. Otherwise everything else is a secondary charge. They do not serve free refreshments on board and have no inflight entertainment. With that said, because I upgraded my ticket, I was able to chose one of the extra space seats in the first few rows. These are the only seats that recline on the plane, all other seats do not. Because of that, I was relatively comfortable. My flight left on time, and arrived as scheduled. The flight crew seemed friendly, although I did not need their services. Overall my experience was satisfactory. Had I been in any of the standard seats, that did not recline, I am sure my experience would have been not as pleasant. This would be the only way I fly Frontier again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Flight left Ft Myers to Cincinnati at 6:55 to land around 9:20 on November 5th. Was told couldn't land due to weather was staying in the air and would circle back around. About 30 to 40 minutes later we landed in Louisville without any notice of landing else where. When landed plane was swirving on the runway. When pulled up was no where near any gates or was not able to get to a gate because of where the plane landed. Was told had to refuel and that the plane lost its navigation system. No one could leave but if had to had to sign a waiver and no return. The plane had to be shut down to reboot the navigation system so had to sit on the plan for 15 to 20 minutes in the pitch dark. When finally leaving several hours later take off was horrible and the plane kept going up and dropping tremendously you were lifted out of your seat, the plane was making all kinds of noises. When landing 30 minutes later the pilot did no announcement of landing. So instead of landing at 9:30ish landed finally at 2:45am. As soon as landed and I turned my phone on there was an email with a $50 voucher. I called for a refund of the return flight, I explained the flight and how horrible and scary it was. But no refund and thought for all that and having to miss a days work that was more than the round trip a $50 voucher was enough. Needless to say it's useless to me, I will never fly with them again. I should have listened about what people said and regulations they'd been in trouble for. Worst experience ever. I'd rather pay more for a safer flight and better customer service.

### "Attendants were excellent"
After reading tons of reviews that were mostly negative and bashing Frontier Airlines I decided to give my input. My family and I traveled from D.C to Austin with absolutely no issues (first time for me and my 3 year old) we even arrived 30 minutes early! Attendants were excellent in responding to you, flight was smooth, and pilot kept us informed the entire way! This isn't top quality flying but if you want to get somewhere inexpensively and quick give them a shot! I'm glad we decided to take the trip even with the bad reviews.

### "seats super uncomfortable"
We started landing in Orlando and suddenly we accelerated and flew straight back up into the air for quite some time. No contact from the captain or crew at all and there were some scared people. Seats were super uncomfortable and it was very unorganized. Would not fly Frontier again.

### "treated with disrespect"
We will never be using Frontier again and we do not recommend this airline to anyone. Sparing long details we were treated with disrespect. We were lied to multiple times. We were to fly out of Orlando to Milwaukee. We arrived at MCO and checked our bag, then got in line for security. We had a very long wait and an hour and a half into standing in line it was apparent it would be close in catching our flight. We called the airline begging they wait, no help. We made it to gate at 12:30 and our flight that was supposed to leave at 12:40 was gone, not one attendant around to help. We had purchased travel insurance but this is of no use we are out the $800. We called because our checked bag went to Milwaukee on the flight we didn't make they told us that someone would be in Milwaukee at the baggage claim to get our checked bag to us. They don't even have a baggage claim window we had to wait by ticketing. Traveling with 2 children and all the waits and frustration they caused is beyond ok.

### "airline lies to their customer"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Colorado Springs to Los Angeles. Our flight was at 9.35, they boarded us and then we were informed that the flight would be delayed for 30 mins due to bad weather and LAX was not allowing any planes to land. After 40 mins they announced that we would not be leaving until 4 pm due to zero visibility at LAX, we deplaned. The crew finally showed up at gone 4 pm. We got to CA after a 7 hour wait and it was sunny and good weather so in short the crew and the airline lied to us about the bad weather. This airline lies to their customers and charges for everything.

### "value is at the very bottom"
Frontier Airlines is, in every applicable way, the very worst of what an already shaky industry has to offer. They manage to get it pitifully wrong both before and during flights. First, don't be fooled by Frontier's flights landing among the cheapest offered by aggregators such as KAYAK. These prices fail to take into account costs such as $45 for a single checked bag and no complementary food or beverage offerings except water. So overall, the value of a Frontier ticket is at the very bottom -- and that's with all else about the experience assumed to be equal. But in fact, their customer service is even worse than their duplicitous pricing. On a recent flight from Denver to Providence, the desk clerk gave me a receipt but no boarding pass, which I failed to notice because they look similar. As I result I was turned back at security. This might have been forgivable had the agent I dealt with back at check-in - a different employer than the one who had screwed up earlier - not been unaccountably scornful, as if I'd been the one who's screwed up. Given that I was close to missing my flight, I certainly didn't need the added stress of this person's contempt. On my return flight two weeks later, I experienced some sudden GI distress about halfway through the four-hour ride, so I got up to use the lavatory. As I approached the back of the plane, one of the flight attendants snapped, "Sir, the fasten seat belts sign is lit. As I gestured and started to plead my case, the flight attendant repeated herself, droid-like in her monotonic replies. I went back to my seat, but in all honesty I almost wish I'd had an "accident" right there in the aisle so that this cheerless automaton would have had to clean it up. (Soon afterward, the same flight attendant was very enthusiastic about trying to hector me into applying for a credit card.) There is also no Internet service, not even for the usual exorbitant rates. Did I mention that my previous experience with Frontier was almost as bad? Stay away from this outfit. Even when I despise something I'm generally too lazy to note my disappointment online, reserving my rare reviews for strong praise. But in this case, having discerned that this company's business model resembles that of low-end, worthless cellular carriers, I feel compelled to warn off as many travellers as possible. Frontier deserves to fail.

### "I was thoroughly disappointed"
Flew Orlando to Minneapolis. My experience was horrible. When we first checked in our bags we were told that we didn’t have seats. Which I still fathom to understand because I booked my tickets in July and paid for 2 seats. I don’t understand how at that time we didn’t have seats. We were told they overbooked the flight. The employees at the gate were horrible. Beyond not providing any information to us, and not keeping us informed they seemed to bot care less of what was going on. When they started boarding I again asked do we have tickets, and they said not at this time, so we continued to sit there, not going to the bathroom, not eating or getting water for fear they’d call our name and we wouldn’t be there. The flight was supposed to leave at 7.55am and didn’t leave until 8.15am because of us. Also when getting on the plane they told us my 9 year old daughter and I wouldn’t be sitting together. I truly have no respect for Frontier and will never fly with them again. I was thoroughly disappointed and have never been treated so poorly. Even when we were getting on the plane as my daughter was worried we weren’t sitting together I pulled out my wallet as I planned to offer money to someone for their seat. The flight attendant said it shouldn’t come to that, but I said well it shouldn’t have come to this since I paid for 2 tickets but you overbooked the flight. She proceeded to tell me, she didn’t overbook the flight. We were the last to board after they asked several times for people to volunteer to get off. I legitimately walked up to the counter while the flight attendants were laughing at the fact that the flight was overbooked. I interrupted the conversation by telling them that yes, we were some of those that don't currently have seats. The gate agent took my tickets and told me to have a seat.

### "they did not notify anyone"
It is unacceptable the flight to Orlando on Tuesday 17th (flight 1775) was delayed 4 hours. It is unacceptable that they did not notify anyone on that flight until after arrival at the Trenton airport, and then misinformed everyone as to the reason for the delay. Couple that with delay of our return trip from Orlando on the 21st (again misinforming everyone about the nature of the delay) is again unacceptable. The reality of the delay is that they had two flights scheduled to leave Orlando from the same terminal gate at the same time to different airports and chose to have the flight to Philadelphia (flight 1672) depart on time and delay fight 1776 to Trenton (for their own convenience) and apparently instructed their gate attendant to lie to your customers, again unacceptable. In the case of our return trip we were rebooked onto flight 1672 to Philadelphia causing us additional travel expense to drive to Trenton from Philadelphia to retrieve our car. Never again and I will tell everyone I know not to travel on Frontier airlines.

### "Frontier charges for everything"
Orlando to Milwaukee. Frontier charges for everything. I was charged an extra $300 just for my one checked bag, 2 carry ons, and then for my seat selection because I was scared I would be separated from my 10 year old. Then there weren’t any complimentary beverage or snacks, you had to pay $3+ for a soda and chips. Not to mention we couldn’t even get our bags checked until 2 hours exactly from when our flight takes off. With having kids you want to make sure you are at your gate in 2-3 hours of take off so you have that time frame. I will never be flying with them. My $430 ticket turned out to be $850.

### "a total of 4 delays"
Never again. A 3 hour delay which had no explanation. There were a total of 4 delays. Then when you get to the Orlando airport they drop you at the furthest part of the terminal. Had to take a bus and tram (tram is normal) but a bus? Additionally we gate checked a stroller and car seat. Now I’ve flown a lot - and on normal airlines as soon as you get off the plane the gate checked items are there waiting for you to pick them up. Well not on this airline. Practically the entire flight was deplaned before the gate checked items stated to appear. What was the hold up? Again no explanation. You get what you pay for with this airline. Never again

### "never use this airline again"
Tampa to Denver. Horrible customer service. They delayed my flight by 1.5 hours, notifying me by text. When I arrived at the new time, they told me the flight departed at the original time. After a 2 hour debate with very rude attendants, Frontier finally arranged another flight the next day with another airline. There were 14 customers (all unrelated) that were standing there at the counter in the same situation. We all received a text indicating the delayed time of departure. Security had to come to the counter because of all the unhappy customers. Frontier employees admitted it was a "glitch" in their system. I had to get a hotel for the night and pay for baggage with the other airline. I filed a dispute on-line with Frontier and they said they would give me a $50 voucher. I would never use this airline again, with the way they treat their customers. All the additional expenses occurred they will not compensate.

### "one frustration after another"
Columbus to Orlando. Never again. From the time I made my reservation to boarding, one frustration after another. Change of flight time. Outrageous “extra” fees. And waiting in airport for a delay caused by paperwork not filled out by crew.

### "not fly this airline again"
West Palm Beach to Long Island. This is our second round trip with this airline and both times we have been late. We are presently waiting for flt 1786 which was suppose to depart at 3:45 pm and now has a departure time of 5:48. Our departure from ISP was also late on October 12th. We will not fly this airline again. What a disappointment.

### "experience was great"
Pittsburgh to Orlando. This was my first time flying Frontier. I grew up as a pilot's kid and flew all over as a kid. I was happy to see what looked like a new A321 with the latest Frontier livery on the exterior along with the winglets. Online check-in was easy. Had boarding pass in hand. The ticket was around 25 dollars, and I paid another 95 dollars for a carry on and one checked bag. My carry on was a backpack for my laptop/wallet/phone misc items. Because I sat in 1F my book bag had to get stowed in the overhead compartment. I think this is an FAA rule, but for the life of my it makes no sense. Window seat with no emergency door, no one is going to trip over my book bag in an emergency. But not the airline's fault. The interior appeared very new, seats modern. Seat comfort was ok, only a little over 2 hours. Had this been a three hour or longer flight, this could be uncomfortable. Seats are pretty hard, despite how cool they look. I let everyone else board first, pretty much, and stretched out in the terminal for as long as possible. I declined any in flight purchases. Brought my own snacks. People complain about having to pay for bags, carry-on bag restrictions, having to pay for food in flight etc, but the ticket is only 25 bucks, go find somewhere else to complain. After climbing through 10,000 feet they did give me back my book bag. This experience was great. Unfortunately my return leg is with another airline due to my schedule. Flying back on a Sunday and need to be back as early as possible.

### "never fly Frontier again"
On a flight from Atlanta to Orlando on Oct 10 at 8pm, the plane boarded half an hour after the scheduled boarding time, with no update made to waiting passengers. I was refused to allow my check-in bag I paid for to be brought on the plane, though it fit in the overhead compartment, and I was verbatim told by another flight attendant there was "plenty of room" in the compartments after everyone had boarded. I had to take out my large iMac from my bag (forced to check the bag separately) and place my computer in the compartment with no protection. This is not a laptop - this is a large screen expensive desktop. The rude attendant who told me the bag is not coming on the flight even mentioned that she was chatting with another employee that they thought my bag was too big when we were waiting on board. Nothing was said to me during the extra ~30 min we were just sitting for the plane to open. I rode a Spirit flight earlier the same day, with the same exact baggage and had no problems. My four year old had to use the restroom after the plane had taxied to where we were going to take off (I had taken her immediately before boarding, but she is four... she had to go again.) As it looked like we would be sitting for a while and we were seated at the back of the plane, I asked an attendant if my daughter could use the bathroom. He audibly let out a frustrated sigh, agitatedly picked up the phone and exclaimed "We're going to have to stop the plane! I waved him off, and told him she would wait, in order to avoid holding the plane. My four year old is now crying in the seat, doing everything she could to not wet her pants. Everyone around us could hear how upset she was. The plane continued to sit in the same place long enough that she could have gone to the bathroom at least 3 times. It literally would not have taken that long at all, she is 4 years old, there was absolutely no compassion from this attendant, and I was met with irritation, when I was already in an unfortunate situation I had no control over. I will never fly Frontier again. Every single person I encountered on this flight that worked for Frontier was rude and had no concept of customer service.

### "A terrible attitude"
San Francisco to Orlando. A terrible attitude by flight attendants and agents and terrible seats! Upon booking the flight, we were told to arrive 3 hours prior to boarding. However, upon arrival, their ticketing desk didn't open until only 2 hours prior. Of course, their bargain-basement concourse had no food/services or available outside the security checkpoints, and no way to check baggage until their window opened. By the time they opened the ticketing 10 mins later than posted and we checked our baggage and waited in the security line, we were running with our 6 year old to make the gate on time. When I mentioned this to the surly attendant scowling at us for "pushing our luck" I was simply told "to get it together. Absolutely outrageous and unprofessional. To make things worse, the only non-stop flight available was an overnight/red eye, and we were more than dismayed to learn upon boarding that none of the seats reclined, unless you had paid additional in advance for the "Stretch Seating" option This should have been made more clear at the point of purchase (on their website.) This was the most uncomfortable flight my family of three has ever endured (and we like to travel.) Even worse, while we were in FL visiting the inlaws, our home neighborhood in Santa Rosa was evacuated due to wildfires. We attempted to alter our return date, since we had only a damaged house to return to and very unhealthy air quality. I would have preferred my daughter and wife to remain in FL with her parents while I went home to deal with our losses. Frontier was incredibly unsympathetic and unwilling to suspend any of their extravagant fees for altering our flight. A doctor's note for a simple illness would suffice, but a national disaster area does not. Heartless unyielding policies are exactly what brings public animosity upon these mega corps. I can understand paying differences in fares, but profiting off a natural disaster by charging "change fees" is absolutely heartless and cruel. In the end, it will be cheaper to keep our flights as scheduled, put my family in a motel room and purchase respiration filters to deal with the poor air, rather than remain safely with the inlaws for a few extra days. I can't wait to give their representative a piece of my mind at the counter tomorrow when we get there.

### "fly with a different airline"
Bad staff. Bad airline and just horrible. Flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas was delayed 3 times. Was suppose to leave at 8pm but didn’t leave until midnight. Leaving Vegas was worse! Flight was suppose to leave at 11:40 and got delayed twice. They finally got us boarded on the plane at 1:20 in the morning just to tell us the captain was sleepy and didn’t think he would be able to fly. They issued meal vouchers for $10 (mind you, we are at an airport where prices are much more expensive than normal and $10 was nothing). Wasn’t able to get us into a hotel until 4am in the morning and the next available flight they could get us on would be 1pm the next day. Missed work, had to pay extra for parking back home because I had to pay for an extra day. Extra money spent on food when I have food at home, running on only 3 hours of sleep. Pay the extra money and fly with a different airline!

### "gladly take my business elsewhere"
I bought a return flight from Chicago to San Diego about 3 months prior. I was attending a childhood friend's wedding and what should have been a nice weekend ended in such a headache. My returning flight was on a Sunday at 4.50 pm. Once I got to the airport they told me that I had missed my flight, that it was at 6.30 am. Turns out they rescheduled my flight for an early flight and said they could do nothing about it. I was in town for 2 days at a wedding I wasn't checking my email constantly. When I've had changes with other airlines they send me notification texts. Its not like Frontier didn't have my cell number. A 10 hour flight change is not a little inconvenience, its missing a whole day. And here I thought Spirit Airlines was the worst, well Frontier just took that seat. I will pay the extra money I have to pay for another airline and never fly Frontier again. I ended up paying for two one way tickets anyway, so in order to avoid another headache and hours at the airport, I will gladly take my business elsewhere.

### "everyone was friendly"
Las Vegas to Nashville. Before booking with Frontier I read the reviews. Most were negative. I decided to book anyway and I am glad I did. Our flight was not only on time but early arriving in Nashville. The check in was easy and everyone was friendly. Because I had researched I knew I needed to buy my seat, pay ahead for checked bags and bring my own snacks. Because of the great experience and the low prices I will be flying with Frontier again.

### "I was not impressed"
Flew Denver to Minneapolis. I normally never have a problem with flying Frontier but for this flight they changed the departure and return time by over 2 hours. We were supposed to leave Friday night at 6pm and they changed the flight to 8.30pm. The flight was late by an hour to boot. There was never any explanation or "sorry for any inconvenience". All employees acted as if this was completely normal. I was not impressed and will do my best not to deal with Frontier in the future.

### "thank you for making my trip a good experience"
Las Vegas to Memphis. I missed my flight on September 30 and was rebooked for the 2 October. My past experience with flying haven't always been great, but this one was amazing. Yes my flight was delayed a few times due to the massacre there but we were giving food vouchers twice, we were in the safest place in the city and keep informed. The crew both ways were wonderful and the pilots were amazing. Just wanted to say thank you for making my trip a good experience.

### "isn't holding themselves accountable "
Minneapolis to Cincinnati. I purchased a ticket for my father, a disabled veteran and the baggage scales admin at Minneapolis told my father his bag weighed too much and made him pay $20 cash. She was extremely rude to him and also didn't attach any baggage ticket to his suitcase right in front of him. His bag was lost for two days after landing in CVG so he had no clothes and no money when he arrived. All my dad had was his very small backpack, which under Frontier's website says is free and they refuse to refund us for the entire cost of the luggage and carryon, which wasn't used. They claim they have no record of my father being charged $20 for his "overweight" bag. I was told via email that we would receive a $25 dollar refund and a $100 voucher to fly again. We will definitely use Southwest or Delta instead on any future trips. Nobody should be treated the way that my father was. He was taken advantage of and Frontier isn't holding themselves accountable for their employees. Shame, because if their customer service was better and they weeded out these bad employees they could actually be a great airline.

### "Won't fly Frontier again"
Orlando to Milwaukee. Could not get checked in online. Frustrating. The check in at airport was quick and easy. However $45 per bag is ridiculous. Flew in on another airline and it was only $25 A bag. No free beverage or snack as on all other flights I have ever taken. Plus endless announcements and even marketing campaign for their credit cards over PA system. I just wanted to read and relax not have live commercials assaulting me. Then the longest wait on baggage ever. After walking to baggage area. Walk included restroom stop which had a line. We waited at the carousel for 28 minutes before bags even began to surface for anyone. People were annoyed. Ridiculous to take that long. Won't fly Frontier again.

### "don't fly this airline"
Atlanta to Denver. The flight was supposed to depart at 8:25 am. We boarded at 9:30. We sat on the plane for an hour and was told to get off the plane. Previous estimated time of departure was 11:45, now it's 1:30. Wonder what time they'll choose next and I wonder if we'll even make it to Colorado. Oh yeah and there have been no apologies. Just rudely distributed $10.00 meal vouchers. Do yourself a favor and don't fly this airline.

### "do anything to avoid this airline"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Denver to Washington Reagan. Terrible airline! I paid for the seat and the carry on bag. I ended up with a tiny tray that I couldn't work on. When I moved up one row to get a full sized tray, they charged me $50 right there on the plane. It was embarrassing. I will never use this airline again, especially for business travel. Pay more, take a layover, do anything to avoid this airline.

### "disappointed in the overall experience"
Milwaukee to Denver. The $120 round trip tickets seemed like a great deal which is the only reason I booked. But as date of flight came and I had to finalize plans, I was disappointed to find that you had to then pay additional $ to choose a seat and pay for carry-on and checked luggage. (Separate charges for departing and returning flight). It was $38 for each carry-on and checked item if you paid online, $60 a piece if you paid at check-in at the airport. So flights that I purchased as a gift to my fiance because I thought I could afford $248 ended up costing me more like $450. The seats were very uncomfortable with minimal arm space and cramped leg space. If you wanted a soda or snack - you had to pay for those items seperately as well. On the way back, they called to start boarding but didn't actually start boarding, but left us in the walkway. Just standing there for 10 minutes without one person from the airline explaining what was going on. I paid extra for my seats on the flight home just to get extra leg room, $25 a seat. There really was little difference between that seat and the one I flew out on. The air blowing out from my vent above smelled like the sewage from the bathroom. All in all, disappointed in the overall experience and probably won't fly Frontier again.

### "bad customer service"
2 hour delays with one hour waiting on them to do paperwork. 5 airplanes errors. Please spend the extra money not to ride. A slow crew of unprofessional people. They turned the computers on the airplane on and off two times. Sat in darkness with no AC for 15 min. Now waiting 20 or more mins for paperwork to clear them of their bad customer service. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "Service was subpar"
Philadelphia to Portland via Denver. My wife and son had the pleasure of flying back Frontier, I hadn't planned on coming back although I did originally purchase a roudtrip ticket that i canceled and they wanted me to pay for a new ticket when i wanted to add the return back onto it. First of all we were emailed 3 or 4 times prior to actually taking the flight that our flight times and dates were changed, we ended up losing over an entire day from our planned vacation. They offered us 50$ vouchers that could be used only (towards purchase of a future ticket in the same persons name) that had no cash value, and had to be redeemed within 90 days, so basically they were useless. We also had to pay extra money for checked bags and were not offered free carryons which was aggravating. They claim you can purchase the works for an extra 99$ per person, per way, which would have been like an extra 600$ for us. However it would have allowed us to get all baggage included and cover any elective changes to our itinerary - in hind sight it might have been better to bite the bullet - heres why : we paid over 100$ for baggage, then when we wanted to changed the name of the 3rd passanger they kept changing the price on us which went up every time we called. By the time we had decided to change the name they demanded we pay a 99$ itinerary change fee a 75$ name change fee, and the difference in price of ticket from original purchase to name change +$598. We were tried making changes online and the website was all buggy, declined our cards several times for no reason - it said we'd paid out over $5,000 for our tickets and would make the same addition multiple times or simply freeze on us. Customer service was terrible even after we obtained guarentee of price hold. I am 6'1" and my knees had room, backs of the seats were gutted and totally solid -  didnt have enough room to bend over and lay on the tray table. We were also forced to layover in Denver for 6 hours turning what should have been a short trip into an all day fiasco. Service was subpar, they offered nothing free except water and their was no option for wifi at all. There were meetings in the back between passengers and crew for one of the entire flights. Denver airport was excellent and being an Oregon native Id say it is better than PDX even though PDX was rated top airport in the US.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
I was to fly Cincinnati to Ft. Lauderdale on September 7th and return September 10th. On the September 7th folks were being told to evacuate Ft. Lauderdale due to Hurricane Irma. Needless to say, I did not fly there on that day, although the flight was not cancelled? Why would anyone fly to the area, when authorities were telling folks to leave. My flight home was cancelled. I was given a refund for the return flight, but not for the flight to Ft. Lauderdale. I am extremely disappointed, even though it isn't a whole lot of money. I will be flying to Lauderdale again soon, and will think twice about my carrier.

### "I lost all my money"
Phoenix to Detroit. I have no word to describe how bad I feel about this company. Terrible service and no focus on customer. The first time I flew with the was bad as well but I wrongly decided to give them another chance. My flight depart time was 6:25am. I got some traffic on the way to the airport and arrived at 5:50 to check a bag. I was informed that I could not because it would not make through TSA. I asked the lady what if I leave the bag (one of my friend was still around to keep it). The lady told me that I woul not make it through TSA and that the airplane would not wait for me (does it look like they double sold my seat?) Well, I decided to give a try. I open my backpack and got in the real essencial things from my to be checked bag, run run...by the way, I had my wife and son with me. We went through TSA in 5 min ran to the gate, got there at 6:14. The airplane was there but the Door was closed. I knock the door and no answer. Not a single Frontier employee around. Any other company would have somebody to help customers and let them in, even if it was 1 minute to depart. When I called the customer service they offered me another flight at 4:30pm but I would have to pay 99 dollars for each of us. I agree I was late for checking a bag, but I was at the gate on time to get in the plane. They do not refund the flight coming back, they give you credits to use in the next 3 months. As I do not plan to fly frontier ever again, it means I lost all my money and got nothing back in exchange, except trouble.

### "comfortably, safely and inexpensively"
Atlanta to Phoenix. Frontier is not luxury and does mean exactly what it says, no frills. However, it got me from Atlanta to Phoenix relatively comfortably, safely and inexpensively. The crew were courteous enough but did seem focused on selling something. Whether it be drinks, snacks or credit cards they were determined to make the extra dime. My backpack worked fine, I drank a cup of free water and got the aisles seat I wanted so I didn't spend an extra dime. Both flights were early and I arrived impressed and pleased with all the money I saved. Not a single issue to complain about!

### "the worst experience"
Cincinnati to LaGuardia. This was by far the worst experience. They charged me for a carry-on bag that was smaller than most purses. The flight home was an absolute disaster, Frontier was the only airline to cancel flights that night. The manager over the phone gave me a free hotel but the lady behind the counter refuse to honor it. And instead of resolving the issue, she continued to say no. After we slept in the airport, we finally got up the next morning and headed to our gate. Of course, everybody in the airport was apparently confused as to whether that would be at one gate or completely on the other side of the airport. I had to go through security three different times because we were mislead on which gate it would be at. After we made it home I realize that the airline broke my stroller. So I went to the lady that handles the disputes and she said that she could not do anything about it because I signed some slip saying they were not liable. Come to find out the lady behind the desk that checked my bags to begin with was the lady who initialed the slip.

### "the worst airline"
Spend $45 more and fly with Delta! This is the worst airline I have flown on in my 32 years of heavy traveling. The flight from DC to Austin was 4.5 hours delayed. I arrive to the airport and am informed by the most unprofessional, incompetent representative that my bag, which I've carried on literally every other airline costs $45. Then I was told that I could carry it on, but that would still cost $45. After this shakedown, I fly on what feels like the Wild West with the turbulence and have to wait an additional hour at the gate before we get off the plane.

### "utterly incompetent"
I selected Frontier because we've had a good experience with their customer service in the past. I have personally flown with them more times than I can count. They were by far not the most affordable flight I could have chosen, but I thought their customer service more than made up for it and happily paid extra for the tickets. On our first flight, they insisted on gate-checking our carry-on bags that would have easily fit in the overhead compartment. No big deal, we'd grab them planeside, as we were told upon boarding. After we landed, we waited planeside for our bags, even asking a flight attendant about them. He assured us they would be dropped planeside. Another ten minutes, and we asked another flight attendant, who informed us they would have been sent to baggage claim. This made little sense, considering we had a connecting flight to catch and this would send us out of security. The attendant who checked our luggage had apparently marked our final destination as Denver, not even bothering to ask if that was our final stop. We had to go out of security, collect our baggage, and then go through security again, where we were nitpicked by the TSA for things the TSA in Los Angeles hadn't even batted an eye at. 40 minutes and relieved of some slightly-above 3.5 ounce toiletries later, we re-entered past security. (By the way, the Denver TSA will paw through your luggage for 15+ minutes over a bottle of foot powder.) We were fortunate our layover was lengthy, or we'd have ended up missing our connecting flight. As we boarded the next flight, I walked by without the attendant even looking at my bag. However, she then stopped my husband and insisted his bag was too large to fit in the overhead, despite it being the exact same size as mine. She refused to let him on the plane unless he paid $45 for carry-on. When he said our last flight had done no such thing and that his wife's bag was the same size as his, the attendant smugly replied she could always call me back and charge me $45 for my bag, as well. What on Earth? As I waited on my husband in my seat, concerned, the attendants went by, trying to make a list of seats still available, I assume for people on standby. I had to inform them the seat had been purchased by my husband, who was currently being held at the gate unless he forked over $45 some woman randomly decided to charge him because she could "tell by looking" his bag simply wouldn't fit. They didn't seem the least bit concerned. Not that I'd expect them to be, at this point. Finally, $45 later and with minutes until the plane closed, my husband enters, with his bag in tow. It easily fits in the overhead without any struggle. We spent $45 for a bag that most certainly fit. An absolute rip-off. Our flights departed and landed on time, but the poor service we received soured it. Way to go, Frontier. Your rinky-dink airline just lost two faithful customers. I've already told this story to three of my friends and intend to tell everyone else when they ask how our trip was. Answer being, absolutely awesome until Frontier was utterly incompetent. They should leave air travel to the better-equipped and trained airlines. I'll be sticking with Delta from now on. Wish I could give less than one for a rating.

### "no info on when it will be heading out"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Denver to Greensboro. You get what you pay for: do not waste time trying to save money and waste your life in travel. Flight is delayed and no info on when it will be heading out. Flight from San Francisco was miserable no leg room, the attendant skipped over me for water, no place to rest your head, no recline. If you would like to waste a day of your life on horrible travel then I would recommend this airline.

### "give Frontier a thumbs up"
Orlando to Cleveland. My family was in Orlando during the hurricane warnings. We had originally had airlines to leave on Saturday the 9th. Frontier sent us an email offering a flight out on 9/7 at 7am. We went ahead and booked that as well. They offered these flights at $29 dollars. Very affordable and not gouging like other airlines at this time. Words cannot convey how blessed we are to have received this offer from Frontier. We called in and not only did they change our flight but credited back money from the flight on Saturday. They got us out and also took people on stand by. They waited to get as many people out as possible. The pilot, and flight attendants were all helpful and caring. The pilot said the crew was out of Maui and what an amazing crew!! We have flown with Frontier several times before and have never had any issues at those times . Only good things to say about them. Thank you Frontier for what you offered and got us out of Orlando in time. If we wouldn't have had the other offer Frontier gave to us and changed ticket dates we would of been stuck as they are closing the airport. We give Frontier a thumbs up and will use them often for other travel destinations. Thank you Frontier for helping us and making a way out.

### "a special thank you"
I would like to request a special thank you to the Frontier Check in staff from Miami International Airport. On September 5th at 7 pm, I was traveling to Las Vegas with my husband and due to Irma hurricane alert we decided to cancel out trip at the last moment unexpectedly. They were extremely helpful and we are very satisfied with the way they handle and understand our situation. It is people like this that make companies like Frontier take hospatality to the next level of customer service. Thank you again.

### "flight was delayed to midnight"
Flew Chicago to Phoenix. Our plane was at 7.55 but delayed to 10pm as they had to stop in Kansas to refuel. Our plane was switched with the New Jersey flight that had been waiting since 3pm. So our flight was delayed to midnight! Don't fly Frontier Airlines! I wish I had looked at the reviews!

### "rep went above and beyond"
Denver to San Francisco. Flying to San Francisco the trip is off to a rough start. Not making two separate flights (luggage complications) we were referred to the airlines dispute department? The customer service rep went above and beyond, while all flights were booked out of DEN, she put us on a flight out of Colorado Springs - with no flights left out of Denver she was able to get us on a flight out of a nearby city. I love it when customer service reps are solutions based. She stayed on the phone with us for 45 minute and found a way.

### "terrible customer service"
St. Louis to Orlando. Delayed 3 hours, no explanation. Finally board plane, get to runway and sit, and sit, and sit. Finally captain comes on and says "we have to do paperwork and if it's going to be longer than 5-10 minutes we will update you. That was 30 minutes ago and still no update! Will never fly with them again, terrible customer service, terrible information, terrible quality, just awful!

### "an amazing airline"
I have flown with Frontier Airlines for about 7 year so now. For the first few years I really disliked their customer service and everything else about them. Their cheap flights surely reflected in their services. However over the years I've grown to understand that if you are smart and take your time and understanding Frontier and how they operate, then your flight won't cost any more than the price reflected after taxes and fees. You don't have to pay for a seat. You don't have to pay for a personal item like a backpack or small item, that is smaller than a traditional carry on. Those are optional. Many people see the seat selection and bag selection and believe it's mandatory, but it isn't. Just press continue and you'll have your seat selected for you. As long as you are at the airport and are at the counter to check any baggage within 45 minutes of your flight, then you can check in and check your bag. Any sooner past 45 minutes til your flight, even at 44 minutes? And you will not be able to check you bag or check in. In all reality Frontier leaves your success up to you. They are an amazing airline as far as cost goes and they have many options that allow you to customize your experience. Anyone with any other opinion? isn't doing it right. I fly with Frontier now at least 3 times a month. And I wouldn't change it for anything. Because if I did? I couldn't afford to even fly 1 time a month, let alone 3.

### "it's not worth saving a couple of $"
From Orlando to Indianapolis with Frontier Airlines. Delay of 3 hours. We asked the staff at the desk to provide food or water at least, they said you get nothing. They told us to call customer services. I called them and after 26 min on the phone, they did nothing. They said "Go back to the desk". Basically, no one helped with anything. Stay away from this company, it's not worth saving a couple of $.

### "don't bother flying with them"
If you are thinking about flying with Frontier just look somewhere else! Do not recommend at all. For this flight from Denver to Miami, they charge for everything ($45 for your carry on bag) and seats do not recline and no entertainment. Never will I ever fly with this company again. I'd rather drive to my destination in the comfort of my own car if they were the last option available. So just don't even bother flying with them.

### "We will absolutely fly other airlines"
We were so excited to see Frontier come to TF Green, allowing another reasonable option for flights. However, when we assumed reasonable, we were wrong. If you buy the ticket and are unprepared for all of the additional nickle and diming that happens you will be shocked! They punish families with additional seating fees at check in. Clearly my 8 year old can't be scattered from her family during the flight. So I pay an additional $20+ per person to get our seats together. Drinks? Nope, an egregious fee for that too. As well as checked and/or carry on luggage. I could have easily flown comfortably with a movie and great customer service on JetBlue (with a better flight time) for the same amount. Also as far as Customer Service, Frontiers attendants may want to consider not screaming at each other in the back of the plane may cause some panic and discomfort among passengers. Especially since it was over a coffee pot. That same attendant may consider another round of training as she yelled at my husband to "not touch my things, do you hear me? as he attempted to move her bag (he didn't know it was an attendants) so he could fit his in the overhead. Or telling passengers, even though there were empty seats throughout the plane, that they must stay in their assigned seats due to load balancing concerns (you didn't ask my weight, not my luggages weight when I bought the seat? I'm assuming this is so people don't move to premium they didn't pay through the nose for instead?). We will absolutely fly other airlines.

### "Customer service non-existent"
Washington Dulles to Portland via Denver. Worst flight ever. Customer service is non-existent. No way you can get a hold of anybody prior to check-in. Ticket price was not much better than United, but there were a lot of hidden costs that were unreasonable (ie $45 for each carry-on!). Seats are uncomfortable for a long flight. Staff looked as unhappy as I was as a customer and it reflected in their service.

### "do not expect any compassion"
Denver to Orlando. When flying this airline do not expect any compassion or help. This airline may be inexpensive to start but once you make even the smallest mistake in your booking you will find the charges just keep compiling. We were new to this airline and decided to give them a try, first of all the website is confusing and once you start booking the flight if you are not paying close attention you will leave off anyone you are booking with. When we called to try and fix the issue they just said they would cancel the flight for $25 and then we can re-book at a much higher rate. Or we can just book my flight separate from my companion. We opted for the latter to avoid the huge cost change and then try and change at the service counter. Instead of getting a happy ending we got nope the flight your companion is on is booked, you can fly in later which was 7 hours later. When my companion got on his flight there were 8 seats still open including one next to him. I don't think i will be using this company again. My flight was empty but i was still forced to sit in my assigned seat and the seats are hard, the people are emotionless.

### "no one can give me a straight answer"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Houston to Atlanta. Before even boarding the plane I was met with unprofessional behavior by the young man who checked my bag. The flight itself was attended by women who looked like they had never seen a hair brush and couldn't be bothered to smile or even make eye contact with passengers. Upon arrival to my destination I found out my bag had not made it. My bag was the only bag that didn't arrive and it's now been 24 hours and I still don't have my bag. I've now spoken to several different employees and no one can give me a straight answer. I'm a very patient person but this is just beyond me.

### "airline messed up our whole trip"
Atlanta to Las Vegas. They moved our flight from 7:30pm to 11:57pm. We get a email saying "we're sorry for the inconvenience here's 200.00 voucher for your next flight. Never in that email did it say it was cancelled. We get there and the customer service was rude, they had no empathy that their airline messed up our whole trip. The next time to fly to Vegas was 24 hours later. So we had to rearrange our whole trip. Why would they only fly to Vegas once and at 8pm? I would give it 0 out of 5 stars!

### "I will never fly Frontier again"
Seattle to Orlando via Cleveland (should have been via Denver). I've flown Frontier before and it was very uncomfortable but at least the flights where on time. I thought I'd try it again - I shouldn't have done that. Flight out of Seattle was delayed 6 hours and put us on a different plane. Once we landed for our connection flight, should have been 1 hour wait, but once again delayed almost 4 hours to change a tire. The seats are uncomfortable, have to pay extra for everything, even a seat, but the flight was cheap. Totally not worth it, I will never fly Frontier again.

### "flight was terrible from start to end"
Flight 1539 (my return flight from ATL to PHX). This flight was terrible from start to end. We were delayed for close to three hours (due to "mechanical issues"), and Frontier always hesitated to make an announcement until 30 minutes prior to the departure time, which kept getting pushed back. Sometimes they said nothing at all and just quietly changed the departure time on the digital display. When I finally got on the plane, the flight attendants were rude. A young lady tried to use an outlet to charge her phone, and the flight attendant insisted that she not use it, explaining that "well we have ashtrays in the restrooms but you can't use those. To top it off the tray tables were the size of an envelope, literally. I placed an envelope on the table and it covered the entire thing.

### "I was incredibly impressed"
I recently flew a non-stop flight from Cleveland to San Diego to pick up my children after their summer break and back to Cleveland from San Diego. After all the bad reviews I was expecting the worst, after all I purchased the tickets for 50% off. I was incredibly impressed! The night before, I had to call Frontier to find out about my children receiving an escort to get them through security and meet me on the other side, their customer service was so helpful and patient giving me info about how to obtain a gate pass. I felt well informed of their carry on policy and that only a personal item was included but just to make sure at the gate, I asked. She gladly stepped out to take a look for me. I was expecting an old beat up plane that I'd have to be saying prayers the entire way that I'd make it there safely but instead I walked onto a very clean, new plane. The seats did not recline, but were comfortable enough to take a few naps. The plane wasn't too crowded, so staff informed us that we can change seats after take off. They do charge for snacks and drinks, but I packed some snacks for my kids for the flight home and they didn't have one complaint. Overall, I would definitely recommend, their staff are wonderful and seeing how I paid just about $300 for 4 tickets to fly across the country, you really can't beat that.

### "very definition of no frills
My Frontier flight from Philadelphia to Austin was delayed going out and then delayed again on way home. The issue I have is the utter lack of communication by the staff. Our plane has mechanical issues and they made zero announcements. People went to gate agent and they answered questions but didn't communicate to the larger group. Our plane was delayed nearly five hours with no effort made to try to get us on other flights. This airline is the very definition of "no frills". Be prepared.

### "will never book through Frontier again"
I booked tickets to fly Austin to Indianapolis via Denver for my brother in laws memorial service. Arrived in Denver from Indianapolis and instead of a 3 hour layover, had 5 hours. Now, I am trying to return home and will be at Denver airport for an 8 hour delay. This is ridiculous. I do not know if this is staffing issues or what, but people have jobs and lives and this should not be a frequent occurrance to be delayed. I will never book through Frontier Airlines again.

### "most embarrassing excuse for an airline"
Frontier Airlines is without a doubt the most embarrassing excuse for an airline I have ever seen. Our flight time from Las Vegas to Columbus was pushed back two and a half hours in total. Along with this, they offered next to no consolation because of our wait. Flight attendants were kind and attentive as one would hope. However, I will continue to believe Frontier Airlines is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. I will never be giving them my business again.

### "I was happy with my experience"
As a first time flyer I must say I was happy with my experience flying from Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Turbulence was little rough at times even at 36,000 feet but not the airlines fault. Flight arrived 25 minutes early at our destination. Crew were friendly and professional. Pilot greeted us as we boarded and was friendly. I would recommend Frontier to my friends and family and plan on using them again. Only thing I would add is personally I would have liked to hear the captain announce when we cross over state lines if possible. Not sure if that is something that is done on other flights or maybe I'm the only person who would care to know such things. Overall great experience for me as a first timer.

### "not enough planes, staff, or airport property"
Frontier Airlines was terrible from the extremely late start to our flight from Las Vegas to Cincinnati, to the extended wait for baggage at the end. We waited for an almost 2 hour delay just to sit for another hour on the tarmac. Then do it again upon landing. Then wait another 45 minutes for bags to arrive. They book too many flights with not enough planes, staff, or airport property. They essentially share everything and can't run the business. What was supposed to an easy 3.5 hour flight home took 6 hours. The flight before ours to Columbus got delayed from 4 pm to 8 pm then cancellled. Left tons of people stranded late at night after waiting for hours. Never ever again will I use this airline. Need to say this also. Their "cheap" flights end up costing more than everyone else. You have to pay for seats, baggage, carry on baggage, and a lot of other tiny additions. When I went online to confirm my information I accidentally backspaces over an "e" in my middle name and they charged my account 168.00 for "changing my information". They reluctantly put it back on my card but of course it takes 5-7 business days so I got to head out to vacation 168.00 less than expected. Such a joke of an "airline".

### "rude, unprofessional, and poorly trained"
I travel very frequently and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had flying from Las Vegas to St. Louis. Everything beginning with getting my boarding pass and paying for my carry-on has been awful. The attendants are extremely rude, unprofessional, and poorly trained. A passenger vomited prior to take off and the rest of us were expected to travel uncomfortably rather than the airline just doing a courtesy to the sick individual. The flight attendant who spoke to me was very rude and nasty in the way she handled the situation. I am extremely displeased. I will not be flying Frontier ever again and I do not recommend it to anyone else. After all the extra fees and inconveniences, I could pay the same price to travel a much better airline.

### "could give us no answers"
About 1 week to departure we got a wonderful email informing us our return flight went from a hour and a half layover to a 8 hour layover. When we called to ask why it was changed they could give us no answers and just gave us a 50$ voucher. So, you're going to give me a 50$ voucher for an 8 hour layover which I'd now need to get a hotel since we took red eyes in hopes of saving money. So now I was down 100$ for a hotel nearby without getting a taxi. That's just where it began to be fun. Our first flight was flying from PHX to DEN, take in mind we paid for better seating and upgraded our seats for more leg room. Upon entering the plane all of the seats were the same size and it was uncomfortably cramped (Arm rests didn't move). When I asked the flight attendant why our upgraded seats were not upgraded I was told that is because the plane "we chose" didn't offer it and then ignored me completely for the rest of the flight not offering me anything when walking by even while I continuously said mam. So we had a layover in DEN for an hour and a half, by the time I got on the next plane I was already a little upset with my service. So, next plane comes and we board. The seats were slightly larger towards the front but none of the arm rests went up. Who thought that was a good idea? Let's give economy moveable arm rests but upgraded seating to slightly larger, more cramped seating? During this flight I asked why the arm rests didn't go up and was completely ignored, so I dropped it, I then asked for a drink yet again on this flight. Three times I asked, the lady continued to stare at me while I stared back until 3 and a half hours went by and she had the courage to ask me "Would you like a soda? at this point I was annoyed and responded by "yes, I asked 3 times" and she just responded with "No need to yell sir". Then asked me again "So you're sure you'd like a drink?". I was just shocked, we were landing in 15 minutes and I just decided to move on and forget it. So our returning flights a week later went exactly how I suspected. It was ORL to DEN then to PHX. On our way to DEN we were consistently bugged by our flight attendant to move for this couple that had "air sickness" after waiting over 30 minutes for them to stop essentially blackmailing me I said alright move. So I moved to a non-premium seat so this couple could sit in our seats. The flight went on and they proceeded to watch movies, laugh and disturb everyone around them. Seems our seats cured their "air sickness". Not to mention I barely fit in their seats (6"10, 350 lbs). On our last flight to PHX I finally caught a break with the terrible service and finally got a beverage and some answers to why our flights had been so poor. They told me it was because they were receiving new planes. Then continued to talk about their credit card for the next 45 minutes of the flight while handing brochures to everyone including me which I made clear I did not want and never will want. So when I got back home I decided to call Frontier up because I was absolutely shocked by their service. I was told to calm down and that I needed proof and that all of their planes had premium seating and lifting arm rests and was completely disrespected and was told deal with it or pay the difference, 900$ more.

### "Avoid this scam of an airline"
Cancun to Salt Lake City via Denver. Our flight was delayed in Cancun for almost 2 hours. Hard plastic seats. No beverages or snacks. Unfriendly staff. They claim there was a dent in the plane and they had to wait for confirmation to fly. We missed our connecting flight in Denver. There was no pre-arrangements made for any of the passengers with connecting flights. It was "we got you part way there, figure out how to get home on your own". No apologies and the most horrendous customer service. Not a single employee was helpful. You literally have to get loud and obnoxious for them to take you seriously. I ended up booking a return flight with Delta for another $400 or else I would have been at the Denver airport for 2 days. This is not an airline. This is like a bad infomercial. Avoid this scam of an airline. The review's are justified.

### "additional few hours in delays"
Denver to San Diego. The money saved doesn't make up for the time wasted. At least I got this review out during the additional few hours in delays then another seeming endless delay before departing the plane after landing. And poor communication along the way. My boyfriend was equally frustrated waiting to go to then waiting again at the airport. I want to scream. Let me out of this plane and away from you!

### "never fly Frontier again"
Denver to Los Angeles. Will never fly Frontier again. 4 hour delay with a gate change 3 hours into the delay. The clerk at the counter was very, very rude to every person waiting. Stewardesses from another Fromtier flight were being very rude to customers. They thought it was funny that we had the delay and proceeded to joke with each other that they hope it's another 4 hours till we can board. Horrible customer service and they expect everyone to pay to check on bags! Frontier is a joke!

### "delaying for hours and hours"
I booked my flight from LaGaurdia NY to Cincinnati on August 3th at 5:59 pm but the flight kept delaying for hours and hours. They finally had to cancel and rebooked the same flight for next day that's today August 4th. When I got at the gate C10, no one is here. No information anywhere if the flight is on time or delayed. Finally I had to call the frontier customer service and I said what is the flights status. She said, it is delayed and departing at 9:05 pm. I finally asked at the gate from the Frontier Airlines staff how am I going to manage all this, staff said, you get nothing because the problem with the flight is due to bad weather. I showed her the weather radar map that shows no weather problem and the United and Southwest flights flew in the same region Indianapolis, Chicago, Cleveland.

### "You pay the same price"
Phoenix to Seattle . Unless you're flying with no luggage, it's not worth it. You pay the same price with all of the add ons. Luggage is extra, carry ons are extra, picking your seat is extra, snacks, water, even sitting in the emergency exit. And on a half empty flight, they still enforce the seating. Unfortunately, our stewardess was pretty rude, although that's probably not the case across the board. The flight happened to be on time though.

### "never will I fly Frontier again"
Never will I fly Frontier again. Currently sitting on the tarmac for two hours in San Francisco for my flight to Orlando because of a broken luggage scanner. Instead of moving plane and allowing us to get off they make us wait 2 hours while they fix a baggage scanner and then load all of the luggage onto another plane. No leg room, pay for sodas, cramped, seats don't recline, no in-flight entertainment, $35 dollars just for a carry on? Come on Frontier, this is the best you can do? Lame.

### "Never fly Frontier Airlines"
Austin to Las Vegas. Flight delays because of overbooking. I prearranged for wheel chair assistance. When I arrived at the airport at midnight there was no wheelchair, no Frontier employee. The gate was empty. Luckily some friends I made on the plane helped me. It is impossible to contact a real person at Frontier for any reason. A generic recording tells you to call back later! What good company does that? They overbook every flight which causes delays while they shuffle passengers around. Never fly Frontier Airlines.

### "will never fly with Frontier Airlines again"
Flew New York to Denver. They are equivalently priced to others, have shorter leg room, charge for carry-on's and don't provide drinks or snacks on my 4 hour flight. They also tried to tell us it was running late, then decided not to tell us when it was back on time again. If not for an early check in, we would have missed the flight. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again.

### "flight was delayed with no notice"
This was my first time flying with Frontier from Cleveland, Ohio to Orlando, Florida and it will definitely be my last. I was charged for a carry on bag which fit the dimensions of being placed under my seat which really was an inconvenience. Also our flight was delayed with no notice at all, boarding doors were switched at the last minute. This was possibly the worst flight I have ever taken with possibly the worst airline I have ever flown with.

### "delay was not clearly explained"
I had a simple non-stop flight from Orlando to Raleigh Durham. Knowing the baggage fees, I only took a backpack which fit under the seat in front of me. The only issue with the flight was about a 45 minute delay which was not clearly explained. From my observation it seemed to be first of all some delay in loading checked luggage and then also some issues with passengers who had carry on luggage and were not clear on the policy. Whether that was their own fault or a travel agents, I do not know. I feel as though you should be well informed of what you're signing up for on these budget airlines and if you plan accordingly you'll have no problems. The flight itself was ~85 minutes and there were no problems after take off. Very professional flight staff. Being such a short flight I had no need for food/beverage service or wifi. A round trip flight on this route with any of the primary carriers would cost twice as much and probably have a layover - I would opt for Frontier 10 times out of 10. With that said - if you have any carry on or checked luggage, taking a 2 hour + flight or have multiple connectors I can see how the problems could quickly arise and add up. If you have a trip that will fulfill any of those options, might want to go with a primary carrier.

### "unprepared / unprofessional employees"
Minneapolis to Denver. If you like delays and cancellations this is the airline for you. If I could get these guys a minus 1 star I would! I had a total of 5 flights to get to my destination and 3 of 5 were delayed while my last flight that was supposed to get me home was cancelled. I've never seen such a group of unprepared / unprofessional employees in my entire life. Then when I do finally get home they can't find my luggage. I don't want to see anyone else go through what I went through with these guys.

### "the same terrible service"
Denver to Austin. Showed up at the ticket counter to check in, the ticket agents come out, 10 min late and 2 were on their cell phones texting and never acknowledged any of us passengers! Their body language spoke for the type of service we got! They charge 60 bucks for a checked bag or even a carry on. As the plane is taxing to take off, the pilot pulls over turns the engines off and says he has to reroute the plane and we sit for an hour. On the way back, we got the same terrible service, very unfriendly, and the plane was delayed 2 hours. I ask the ticket agent why it was late, she said she didn't know.

### "still waiting and keep getting misinformation"
This is the first and last time we fly Frontier Airlines. We booked a flight from Nashville to Vegas and are still waiting for the flight to leave after waiting more than 2 hours. At first the attendant said would only be a 15 min delay. Then messages on my phone indicated erroneous updated times. When I talked to the attendant about the new updated departure time she said they automatically provide a new time without any real information. We are still waiting and keep getting misinformation. At this point, I'm just hoping I get to Vegas tonight. Never again on this airlines. I don't care how much money I can save. Not worth the aggravation.

### "seat reservation was a lie"
Denver to San Francisco. Two months ago I booked a round trip on Expedia heading out on Virgin America and returning on Frontier. I reserved window seats on both airlines’ websites. Just before my trip, I discovered Frontier had moved me to a middle seat. They wouldn’t let me move to the window or aisle without charging me. Their seat reservation was a lie. I was shocked that Frontier made me pay an extra $35 to carry on a small soft bag. (Virgin charged nothing.) Want a coffee a Sprite on a Frontier flight? You have to pay extra for anything besides water. (Soft drinks were free on Virgin.) Frontier’s avaricious surcharges destroyed the economy of the trip I specifically booked for price. There’s a reason this airline is always at the bottom of the customer ratings (which I didn’t know when I booked).

### "need to charge discount price"
Orlando to Charlotte. No one at check in desk in Charlotte when there was a very long line. They comvince you the prices are low and then charge the same amount as the flight or more to have luggage -- even carry ons! And then to get a specific seat assignment, they charge more. The flight to leave Charlotte was delayed because of storms (a fair reason) but no explanation was given for the two hour delay on the return flight, which we were only informed about when we were in line to check in for the flight from orlando. It appeared that our plane first thing in the AM, was coming from California. No food or drink is served without charge in the plane. Seats are harder than usual. Tray tables are teeny (not really a problem without food, I suppose.) No plane wifi. If they are going to present this as a discount flight, they need to charge an actual discount price. I could've paid the same to Southwest and carried more luggage and been much happier, and maybe one of my flights might have been on time. I will say the cabin staff was kind of great. Less formal and more likely to joke around and be pleasant in an honest way.

### "Delayed twice, 1.5 hours late"
Portland to Denver. Delayed twice, 1.5 hours late. And we're landed for an hour before getting off the plane because of another Frontier flight. No weather issues, this is in the middle of summer. Also, they charge for everything and the seats don't go down and the tray tables are smaller than my book - cheap and slow.

### "First and last time on Frontier"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Los Angeles to Chicago. The plane was cold, so cold I couldn't sleep and it was a red eye. No blankets and no heat. I had goose bumps for 3 hours. Then my mother finally fell asleep and was woken by the flight attendants being loud talking to each other. She went to use the bathroom and asked them to quieten it a little. They told her "it'll be quiet in the bathroom" and laughed. First and last time on Frontier.

### "marred by one flight attendant"
Cincinnati to San Diego. I often fly Frontier (4-6 times per year) and while there are negative reviews I have always appreciated this airline. I always pay extra for the "works" mostly to get the refundability on the tickets. I also have their credit card and use it often. Today's flight was a bit marred by one flight attendant. I was traveling with my 16 year old son, and my 5 year old daughter. Our first encounter with this attendant was asking my 16 year old, quite harshly to put his seatbelt on. He had it on but removed to assist his sister and forgot to re-clasp. Anyway, it was just her tone and demeanor. Next encounter was when my 5 year old had to use the restroom. We were in line when it was announced that we should sit and I was told to go sit down - again, tone and demeanor was not friendly, nor polite so I asked if we could quickly go in as an accident would be a mess and her response was, "a broken arm would be worse". Before my conversation or scolding from her she was talking to an attendant next to her and then went right back to it after her comment like we were just a nuisance and should shoo away. The comment wasn't even the problem as she had a point, however, it could have been delivered in a more polite and kind way. When we finally got into the restroom after minor turbulence I noticed that someone had a problem down the front of the toilet.. of course I noticed after the fact and was disgusted that my daughter probably brushed up against it. When I came out of the bathroom the rude attendant was right there and I showed it to her and asked if they had someone that could wipe it up. Her response," we don't have cleaning supplies". Earlier I noticed some gunk on the window shade and notified another flight attendant that was happy to get me a warm and wet cloth and I wiped it up - very pleasant exchange as she was happy I wiped that up and I was happy it was clean. I still appreciate Frontier, however, I hope they check employees attitudes and approach to customers. All the other attendants were friendly, fun and helpful. We didn't need much help but the male attendant entertained my daughter and many other people I saw as well. The flight was relatively pleasant but she definitely made it less so!

### "I was pleasantly treated"
Philadelphia to Charlotte. This my first time flying with Frontier Airlines. So many bad reviews regarding seats and having to pay for luggage. But I read all of the must do and don't. And I was pleasantly treated and was not given any problems with my bag, even though it didn't fit in the free carry on slot at Airport. Use American Tourister Weekend bag and was not given a problem. Everyone was very nice. Was a delay but due to weather. Will Fly again with Frontier.

### "the worst customer service"
Las Vegas to San Antonio. The customer service for Frontier has to be the worst customer service I have had to deal with. Almost a month after booking my flight I receive a email that my reservation has changed and my flight from a direct flight to one with a layover, and has been moved up 10 hours with no other option to change to that day. I would have to either move up my flight nearly a day or pos pone by a day. They are unable to compensate for the inconvenience and cost that I will incur for having to book another flight so last minute. I understand things change but I have never had a flight change 10 hours unless weather related. There was no explanation for this change besides flight paths have been adjusted. When trying to reach a customer service representative I waited on hold for 3 hours the first day and never got through, and 1 hour the next day to finally get ahold of someone who was simply reading a script and clicking prompts.

### "it was a horrible experience"
Salt Lake City to Miami via Denver. They delayed our first flight 2 hours, making us miss our connection, which was also a Frontier flight. We had the hotel and car reserved, and we had to go back home and wait 24 hours to get their first available flight. All they said was "Sorry for the inconvenience". They don't clean the planes in between flights. My seat floor was covered in food. You can't sit on the seats for more than an hour without having your legs or butt numb. No snacks. No wi-fi. There's no baggage included in the tickets so you end up paying up to $60 for each luggage less than 50 lbs. Sorry Frontier, I would gladly pay a little more for a more serious airline. I tried to save a little but ended up losing a lot of money with their service. I'll only give them 2 stars because the customer service and the airport employees were really nice and not rude at all even though they only apologised and couldn't do anything but give us some useless vouchers for food inside the airport and hotel in our hometown. Other than that, it was a horrible experience.

### "not pleased with my experience"
Cincinnati to Ft. Myers. In addition to our flights departure time being changed 3 times which made it go from 6am to 1:20pm, there was an issue and our flight has been delayed for who knows how long. There were not many updates and when there were, they were horrible and not very informing. They also kept mixing up the destination and confusing everyone. There was a flight for Philadelphia scheduled at 2:30pm behind ours and they planned to take our plane to the warehouse to fix it and give the Philadelphia passengers the new plane which is absolutely ridiculous considering we've been waiting longer. A similar scenario happened to my friend a couple weeks ago as well. I am not pleased with my experience at all and I will not be flying again.

### "is absolutely the worst"
Washington to Colorado Springs. Frontier cancelled my flight without any notification to me - no call, email, or update on their app. When I looked at my boarding pass and confirmation information on the app there was no update to the flight that said it had been cancelled. I drove 2 hours from Richmond, VA to Dulles in DC for my flight at 4:30am and went to the gate only to see that the flight was cancelled. I had to go back to the ticketing desk to talk to a servicing company (no one from the airline was there) and they said they could only refund my ticket or rebook me on a flight on Monday. This is absolutely the worst I have ever been treated by an airline. I missed my nephew's first birthday party because of this horrible airline. And to make matters worse, they make you wait 1+ hours to talk to anyone on the phone to get a refund and make you listen to advertisements about their airline while you wait. They will not refund you for the time or money spent to get to the airport only for your flight to be cancelled out of nowhere.

### "completely unacceptable"
. I booked a flight with Frontier Airlines. Direct flight from San Diego to Cleveland. 5 days later I received an email that said my reservation was changed, and now included a 12 hour overnight layover. There is no way to refuse this new itinerary besides calling. I have now been on hold for 1.5 hours with no one responding to my call. This is completely unacceptable. I will not be traveling with them again.

### "no interest in taking care of their customers"
My Frontier 6:45 pm flight from Washington to Denver was delayed 1.5 hours due to weather which turned into 6 hours (that's leaving at 1am for a 4 hour flight) because the crew timed out and their personnel management team couldn't find a crew anywhere in DC (with three airports) to get us out any sooner. The people on the ground gave conflicting answers, the people at the help desk couldn't help. We were told we couldn't rebook on a different flight, and then overheard them doing exactly that for other people, but when we got back up to the desk, the alternate flight was full. We were told our luggage wouldn't follow us if we changed flights, then told to contact someone in Denver who said that they would. No interest in taking care of their customers at all.

### "outrageous cost of baggage"
San Antonio to Las Vegas. I truly did not expect to encounter the rudest flight crew in my life. Aside from the outrageous cost of baggage, rude stewards, 7 times counting the passengers on a 1/2 filled flight, the late arrival because of the multiple counts, I can't think of any reason I would try to fly Frontier Airlines ever again nor will I recommend them. Sorry but that's how it was.

### "very good experience"
Charlotte to Cleveland. I have heard so many bad reviews about Frontier but was waiting to fly before I made any judgements. We were delayed about 40 minutes, but how can you hold a delay because of severe storms against the airlines. From the time I verified my flight through the help of a associate via phone because my internet was down, to the boarding of the plane, I had nothing but a very good experience. Thank-you Frontier Airline for making the ending of my vacation a lasting memory.

### "no service nor comfort included"
Frontier probably have the lowest fares on the market and you get what you pay for: a seat on a flight, nothing more. No service nor comfort included on this flight from Seattle to Pittsburgh via Denver. Any additional service must be paid for which can double or even triple the base fare. It starts with the carry-on for which they will charge you basically just to use their over-bin space since they won't carry it for you, insane! If you add up a carry-on and two checked luggages (which are in comparison included in all Southwest's fares for instance) and assuming you would pay online upon booking, then expect to pay an additional $105 this summer! and even more if you pay upon check-in and/or at the airport. Would still fly with them again if they offer the lowest fares considering all the services I need.

### "will not fly with them again"
Columbus to Portland via Denver. Terrible airline. After missing my flight due to car trouble they charged $100 to rebook, ok my fault I get it. After rebooking for the following day I arrived in Denver on time, they had rebooked me with a 9hr layover in Denver, however upon arrival I noticed they had another flight departing to Portland within 1 hour. I confirmed at the gate that the flight was not full and made my way to the service counter where they told me it would be another $100 to rebook again! Instead of simply putting me in an empty seat and potentially selling my seat on the later flight they wanted to charge another rebooking fee. I asked to speak to the superior who told me "that's how it goes here". I and many others will not fly with them again because of the service.

### "cheap prices and efficiency"
Austin to Philadelphia. I was nervous about flying with Frontier after reading so many horrible reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Frontier made it very clear to me on their website that they charge for bags, seats, and additional drinks. I made sure that even with all the additional charges, that my ticket would be cheaper than the other airlines. If you're going to be flying with additional family members, perhaps you should not fly with Frontier because of all the additional costs. The seats are going to be less comfy and no outlets or TVs on the aircraft. That's how Frontier keeps its tickets cheap. I flew direct from Austin to Philly and back with no delays or issues. The flight attendants and pilots were very accommodating. I did not pay for comfortable seats or sodas to drink on the plane. I would definitely fly with Frontier again for the amazingly cheap prices and efficiency!

### "biggest joke of an airline"
Denver to Seattle. The biggest joke of an airline I have ever flown with. If your favorite thing is to get hit with fees at any moment, this is the airline for you! After purchasing our tickets through Expedia we were required to pay for our seats once we reached the ticket counter and were required to pay $45 to carry on one bag each. We had to pay to carry on a piece of luggage that fit the standard size and weight.Do not expect any complimentary drinks, these all start at $2.99. What was also interesting is that in the premium seating, ~$21 per seat, the chairs do not recline. I assume that they do not recline throughout the entire plane.

### "airline offered no explanation"
My return flight from Orlando to San Diego, originaly scheduled at 8.56 pm, was "delayed" already at 3.30pm by 3h 30min, i.e. for 12.30 am the next morning! At 10.30pm the plane was cancelled without any verbal announcement (my son noticed it on a display board). The airline offered no explanation for a reason of their decision. At the counter the rep offered either rebooking for the same flight 21 hours later or a full refund. Without any hesitation I chose the latter, considering four of us (2 children including) would have a slim chance getting on board of the plane most likely already fully booked. This airline seems to be a notorious abuser of timely flights, having hidden and excessive fees (a piece of luggage $70, carry on $35), and equipping its planes with most uncomfortable seats. Too much trouble with little savings to ever consider in the future for me. I will stay away from this carrier.

### "I'll be using other airlines"
Arrived 3 hours late on my Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Atlanta on 22 June 2017. Flight attendants were very nice but the airline is pathetic. Had already purchased tickets for my wife and child for 27 June unfortunately. When picking them up in Denver, took hours after the flight arrived for 1 bag to come. They said they were understaffed. Why is that our fault? What did we pay an extra $45 for a checked bag for? Pathetic airline. Better to fly Southwest I expect. I'll be using other airlines for my business travel!

### "not fly this airline again"
Houston to Denver. Coffee or even a cup of water is $3.00 a cup? Not good! I paid the additional $152.00 for premium boarding which covered my second checked in bag. It did cover it on the way over there but not on the way back. I paid $50.00 for the second bag on the return trip. What a violation of ethics and honesty as I see it. Luggage took 45 minutes to get to the carousel. I have flown over 100 flights in the past 12 years on other airlines and this never happened. I will not fly this airline again.

### "seats are so uncomfortable"
Will never fly with Frontier again. While the fares might be low, they stick it to you with baggage fees. We had same amount of bags going to Cancun as we did flying back to the US but got charged different rates. On top of charging so much for baggage, they want to charge you for a drink and snack. I think that should be included when you purchase your ticket. Then, the seats are so uncomfortable and feel cramped up.

### "canceled due to curfew"
Frontier cancelled my Orlando to San Diego flight after boarding while trying to get to the runway. The airport has a 11:30 pm to 6:30 am curfew not allowing any departure flights during this time. The flight was on schedule to depart at 10:57 pm. At 11:32 pm, the plane only made it to some part of the runway only to announce the flight was canceled due to curfew and only a $10 breakfast voucher with no accommodation or compensation were to be offered. The next available flight would be at 1:30 pm. Most of us had to spend the night at the airport. There was no available rooms in the city. Staff was rude, inhumane and arrogant. On top of all, I had to spend $80 extra to check in my one piece of luggage and one carry on. Seats are very uncomfortable with no amenities for 5 hour long flight. Have never experienced this type of service anyware. Never again will I fly Frontier.

### "Poor customer service"
Austin to Denver. Poor customer service, my flights have been delayed more than on time, over priced bag policy, and dirty planes complete this mess of an airline. They are just not worth saving $20 a seat when they screw up your plans consistently. Never again. 1 star only because 0 is not an option.

### "ended up costing us more"
❎ Unverified |  Atlanta  to Las Vegas. After paying for luggage and seat assignments. Our tickets ended up costing us more than the airline that we usually fly with. On the day of our departure, Check in went smoothly. Then the problems began . Our flight was delayed three times and our departure gate was changed three times also. All total our flight was delayed for eight hours. We had no problems with the Frontier staff. But we witnessed numerous customers being talked to in a rude manner. This was our first time and last time to ever fly with Frontier. This airline did not save us any money .Nor did it get us to our destination on time. For future flights.

### "terrible experience"
After spending an incredible amount of money to pay for bags, our flight was delayed four times! Our original Frontier flight time was departing at 3:00 pm and arriving in Denver at 5:00 pm. Our flight got delayed from 3:00 to 5:55 to 6:28 to 7:30. We had a 5.5 hour drive from Denver and the Frontier employees did not seem to want to help anyone and their needs. I understand delays happen, but that is not the passengers fault and when an airline does not show any concern, it is the ultimate turn off from an airline. I will never fly this airline again and I would advise everyone to do the same. Terrible airline, scam you out of every cent you have and then don't show a sheet of concern when things go wrong when it's their fault! Terrible experience

### "for the price, an excellent experience"
I was very reluctant to fly on Frontier due to so many horrible reviews. I had an emergency family situation and Frontier had a non-stop from Portland to Cleveland with the lowest fare I've ever found ($104 base price before bags), so I decided to take a chance on a 'no-frills' carrier. (My usual airline is Alaska). My flights to and from Portland were exactly on time, and boarding was very efficient. The Airbus plane was very clean, the flight attendants were excellent - good-humored, friendly, helpful with special requests, and genuine real people, culturally diverse. I was particularly impressed when the person in front of me asked a flight attendant how to get a job at Frontier and the attendant took a really long time with her, coming back as she had time to answer more questions. She was entirely positive and encouraging about the benefits of working for Frontier and went way beyond what I would have expected. She gave a great 'face' to Frontier. The flight itself was very smooth, but the captain was very cautious when there was a chance of turbulence to warn us, get people back to seats, and lift the seatbelt sign as soon as possible. In most cases, I could tell there was a change in altitude or speed and turbulence was avoided. (I'm a nervous flyer so I appreciate that.) There is not much available in the way of food and beverages, but it seems to me that the 'happy hour' alcohol promotion 2 for 1 deals were over-promoted, and I watched people around me drink way too much and get annoyingly loud. I've certainly seen that on other airlines, but I've never seen happy hour price promotion like this. The aircraft itself was very clean and the attendants came regularly to pick up trash and remind people to get it out of the seat pocket. As to value, I wonder if making bags always paid for whether carry on or checked makes sense, since everyone staying more than one day is likely to have a bag, so why not include it in the fare? But for business there-and-back travel this could be an excellent deal. My one and only negative is that the seat was way too hard. Nice, cleanable vinyl, but almost no padding. I had to keep standing up to relieve the discomfort. I did see another flyer had brought his own inflatable seat cushion, so I might try that next time. For the price I paid, this was an excellent experience and I will absolutely attempt to find Frontier flights when my routes allow it. Glad I took the chance.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
Was set to fly out at 5:54pm from Milwaukee to Orlando and flight got delayed 3 hours. By the time we actually took off it was 3.5hrs. Never told why the flight was delayed but airport said we had to be on time for original flight in case, so we sat there for 5 hours. Frontier sent a voucher for next time which was nice but come Tuesday when we went to fly again to come back home flight was delayed 2 hours. Asked why it was delayed and they would not say. Every other flight at the airport was still taking off on time. Got on the plane and sat another 30+mins until it finally took off. Looking back now the $50 voucher we got is not worth it at all. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "Not worth the cheap tickets"
Flew from Cincinnati to Denver. Worst airline in the business. Always delayed, sitting in the plane as I write this because the gate wasn't ready, its been 30 minutes since we landed. The seats are cramped, I'm 6'4" and I do not fit into the seat, no leg room. Tried to go to the back where there were open rows but was yelled at to sit back in my assigned seat, so the 4 rows set empty the entire flight. Not worth the cheap tickets. Would highly not recommend flying Frontier.

### "never again will I fly with Frontier"
On my recent Frontier Airlines flight from Los Angeles back to Orlando the flight took off at 10 PM one hour into the flight it was announced we had to have to make an emergency landing in Phoenix and that they was going to dump all the fuel. As the plane came in to land the airport was littered with emergency vehicles. They then give us a $10 food voucher but nowhere was open in the airport to buy a drink or food at 3 AM. They finally found an old hotel and at 7AM we have to be back at the airport. I landed in Orlando at 5 PM - 11 hours late with no explanation of what I had happened and with a measly $200 compensation travel voucher. I lost a days pay at work which was far more than the $200 they gave me and an 11 hour delay treated like animals at the airport by there ground crew. I would never fly this airline again its the third time flying with them in the last year and all 3 delays. I can only say never again will I fly with Frontier Airlines - I would never recommend it to anybody

### "Don't fall for low fares"
Philadelphia to Raleigh/Durham. Don't fall for low fares of Frontier Airline. This is a trap. You end up paying many times more. The worst airline I ever flew in my entire life. Ground staff was rude. I paid $ 60 for a small carry on (roll on bag) while others were allowed much bigger duffel bags on their backs.

### "I was really disappointed"
Las Vegas to Austin. I had high hopes for this flight. Leaving Las Vegas I was able to check in and when I did online, it said that I would have to pay for my carry on online or it would be double at the airport. So $40 online and $80 at the airport. I paid online and got to the airport and the agent said that my bag could be a personal bag and I didn't have to pay, but they can't issue a refund. Then the flight was on time until 10 mins before boarding. Long story short, my flight was and hour late boarding and 30 minutes late getting to Austin. The flight attendant was speaking intangible on the intercom and didn't know where the flight was going all times she announced it over the intercom. To make the situation even worse, the lights completely turned off as we the passengers were exiting the airplane and it took the pilot 5 minutes to get them cackle on. Pay the extra money and get better service and communication. I was really disappointed.

### "have yet to be impressed"
I've flown Frontier a handful of times and have yet to be impressed. Today, was the piece de la resistance. I am writing this, while waiting for my baggage having flown from San Diego to Cincinnati. Because I have the time. I've had baggage delays at busy airports, not at airports that are empty, nor have I had them at airports where there is no other baggage to be loaded and sent to the claim. Yet here I stand, after having landed at the airport over an hour ago now, and having been waiting at baggage claim for an hour, to find out. They still have not dropped the baggage.

### "Spend a little more"
Seattle to Cincinnati via Denver. My first flight was delayed over an hour with no explanation and when we finally arrived in Denver, it took an hour for us to get let off the plane. The flight attendants, however, were really accommodating (offered me a better, open seat). Due to my flight path, I was left to sleep in the Denver airport all night (really uncomfortable, very little sleep). And finally when it was time to take my next flight, the gate changed within an hour of the flight departure and my back happened to be turned away from the gate (no announcement was made and I was already confused due to the time change) and I missed the flight I had slept on the ground all night for. Exasperated, I went to the service desk and the agent informed me that "Frontier doesn't page for missing passengers. And that it would be $99 to get the next flight out. The only saving grace were that my tears and genuinely exhausted appearance must have been enough for her to show some compassion and the fee was waived. If you're thinking about flying Frontier because "it's cheaper" don't. Spend a little more. Get an airline that actually cares if you're on your flight.

### "they gave us no updates"
I don't have the time or space to say everything I want to say, but I will say they are horrible and will never fly with them again. Our flight from Atlanta to Kansas was delayed. They gave us no updates as to where our plane was or when it was to be expected. They just laughed and joked around with their buddies about how "Frontier is never delayed". Obviously Frontier's staff do not have much respect for their company. Doesn't reflect well.

### "Excellent customer service"
Cleveland to Orlando. Excellent customer service! Not one single issue while flying, friendly staff, clean, comfortable, all around great experience. I recently booked again and had an issue with the website. After emailing customer service, the issue was resolved in under 30 minutes. I could not be more happy with the airline and will always recommend their incredible service and, of course, low fares!

### "mistake to choose this airline"
Flew from Los Angeles to Atlanta with Frontier Airlines. This ticket was $20 cheaper than Delta. Our mistake to choose this airline. For the price difference, Delta is worth it. It seems that they do not clean the airplane from previous flights. Super dirty. Also, my seat on the returning flight was detached - meaning, I move, it moves. Do not recommend.

### "impossible to be any worse"
Santa Ana to Denver. It would be impossible for a flight that lands back on the ground to be any worse. Frontier consistently, trip after trip, does a terrible job. Horrible website. Nickel and dime you for everything. Rude under trained staff. Bad flight times. I honestly think that they hate their customers. It would be impossible for them to design a worse travel experience. If there is ver an opportunity to take another airline I will.

### "What a joke this airline is"
Flew Frontier from Salt Lake City to Denver Colorado. Just when you think you're getting a break on your ticket they charged me $40.00 to check one bag. Then they totally forget my row for drinks. We landed at 10.47 pm and didn't get to a gate until 11.15pn and now we are still waiting for bags to start coming around the carousel and it is 12.05 am. What a joke this airline is and to think I have to go back home In 4 days in the same airline.

### "dissatisfied with Frontier"
❎ Unverified |  Sioux Falls to Denver. We had a 4 hour delay in SIoux Falls, SD which we could live with, but once boarded there were more computer issues and we sat there for another hour. On arrival in Denver we had another hour delay prior to getting off the airplane and another hour waiting for our checked bags. Due to these delays we were unable to pick up our rental car and had to find another one in the middle of the night in freezing rain and then drive 70 miles to our destination through a snow storm. If we wouldn't have been delayed it wouldn't have cost us $250 more for a car and $75 more for a shuttle for family that was meeting us. They sent us a lousy $50 voucher to use in the next six months which does us no good and I will not fly frontier again if I can help it. I sent a complaint to Frontier on their website and the CSR answered me with a "sorry for the inconvenience" and stated an entirely different flight and situation. I answered back with "you could at least get that right"! Very dissatisfied with Frontier and I feel sorry for the airline employees.

### "little difference between Frontier and Delta"
Indianapolis to Portland via Denver. Before flying Frontier Airlines, I was an exclusive Delta customer. I decided to try Frontier after seeing the outrageously overpriced of tickets from the Midwest (IND) to the Northwest (PDX or Seattle.) Now, after flying both airlines, I can say that there is little difference between my experiences with Frontier and Delta. There are a few differences which include more comfortable seats, a free carry-on bag and free snacks and beverages on Delta, but that is about it. It is so worth it to pack a backpack (as my "free personal item" for Frontier) and to buy snacks and a drink at the airport because I saved over $300 on my ticket!

### "the service is so bad"
Although the employees are human, I feel sympathy for them because the service is so bad and they have to deal with hundreds of angry customers. Long story short, Frontier used to be great, they were bought out, and now they are horrible. My last experience from NYC to Denver left me with a 3 taxi rides to and from the airport which far exceeded the price of my airline ticket. I will never buy a ticket from Frontier again just because they have cheeper prices. This was not my first bad experience with them as well.

### "boy have they gone downhill"
Seattle to Denver. Used to fly Frontier Airlines all the time but boy have they gone downhill. Nickle and dimed for every amenity. No complementary beverage service, chairs dont recline, trays the size of a small tablet. Rude agents, attendants who have no customer service skills. Nightmare

### "definitely fly again and recommend"
Denver to Nashville. Initially was worried about flying Frontier Airlines after reading some of the reviews. I was prepared for the worst, but the experience was great, flights on time even arriving early, staff friendly. Would definitely fly Frontier Airlines again and recommend.

### "would not fly Frontier again"
Denver to Salt Lake City. I will never ponder giving this airline a penny! I recommend flying with an airline that while more expensive treats you like you matter. I would not fly Frontier again even if it was free. Mostly rude employees who have the "I'm doing you a favor by helping You" attitude. I could write a story about my experience, however I just want people to be aware that the old adage 'you get what you pay for' couldn't be more true than with this airline.

### "Seats were not comfortable"
❎ Unverified |  Orlando to Las Vegas. Flight was initially cheap. If you are flying a short distance and don't need any luggage. Seats were not comfortable, thin cushions. Seat table size of a small tablet. Seats didn't adjust back. 6 hr flight! No wifi or entertainment. Needed more items for week long business trip, so had two pieces of luggage and one carry on, that cost me about $100 just for that. To get assigned seat that cost me extra also. The total cost I could of went on a different airline for that price and at least be comfortable and entertained. I won't be using this airline again.

### "The worst airline service"
San Francisco to Atlanta via Denver. The worst airline service in the industry! First, they charge super expensive fee for luggage or even for a small carry on bag which other airplane won't do. Second, I was late for work because of the 1.30 hour delayed on the plane after boarding, and they don't do anything about it such as giving us a complimentary drink or anything. The seat was horribly uncomfortable, I had leg cramps in the whole trip. They don't have wifi onboard. The  only good thing about this airline is their cheap fare, but they easily suck your money by charging your baggage fee and a small carry on fee which you're going to pay more eventually than other airline where you can get better service with other airline company.

### "both planes were very clean"
Flew Frontier Airlines. I had read the reviews prior to flying and was so worried, I am so thankful I didn't panic. We flew from Seattle to New Orleans connecting in Denver. Flight left on time and we even landed 15 minutes early, same with the flight from Denver to New Orleans! The cabin crew were excellent and both planes were very clean.

### "all bags arrived on time"
Flew Frontier from Chicago O'Hare to Orlando. I was a bit worried after reading the negative reviews, but all went well during our flights both there and back. Check-in was fast, all bags arrived on time there and back. I had a stroller and car seat which arrived safely without any damage. I would fly Frontier again.

### "delayed us over 5 hours"
Denver to Minneapolis. Horrid airline. They delayed us over 5 hours, had multiple mechanical issues and we had to board, get off, said issue was fixed, we had to get off again. Then it was two more hours they finally got a different plane. We did not land in Minneapolis until 3am, we were suppose to be there by 9. Over 170$ in hidden bag fees. They sent us a 100$ voucher, but how is that any savings when you pay through the nose for bags and have to pay for a carry on, plus, we were beyond exhausted and had to still drive 2 hours home. Not happy.

### "has been a horrible experience"
Orlando to Salt Lake City. We got to the airport with 1:30 minutes before the flight. Was in a long line. I thought I should go to the front and ask them if I needed to get in the front of the line to. The lady at the counter told me you will be fine. All the people are line are waiting for the same flight. Well when we got to the counter. They informed us we were to late to check in. We still had 43 minutes before our flight left. They said they did a final call for our flight. But they didn't. Had been in the line the entire time. And when I did go up and ask. The lady told me to get back in line. I would make my flight. I understand if I make the mistake. But the lady at counter told me I would make my flight and to get back in line. So we missed our flight do to horrible customer service. And the flight to Orlando was delayed by 4 hrs due to maintenance. Isn't there scheduled maintenance? This has been a horrible experience.

### "has gone downhill"
Orlando to Cleveland with Frontier Airlines. Seats are terrible. Like folding chairs. Don't recline. No ammeneties. Three+ hour delay and no comps. I was traveling with three small boys, and when two had to use the bathroom, the flight attendant sent us back to our seats because she was just about to start the snack tray up the aisle and couldn't wait 2 minutes. Always fly Frontier but haven't in about two years and it has gone downhill.

### "deserve an awesome review"
We were stranded in Los Angeles trying to go back to Charlotte with terrible delays on departure flights. We booked with Spirit Airlines going to Denver to pick up our Frontier Airlines flight connection. Spirit didn't do anything to help us and even said that it wasn't their responsibility. No help. Then Frontier stepped up and offered up a free tickets for me and my husband to go to Denver to pick up our connection. This is almost a miracle, we are boarding now happy to be able to return home as planned. Thanks only to Frontier Airlines. Thank you so much, you deserve an awesome review!

### "not care about their customers"
I was delayed​ at the airport for the Frontier Airlines flight from Orlando to Milwaukee for more than 3 hours, and then delayed on the return at the airport for the flight from Milwaukee to Orlando for more than 3 hours. Frontier Airlines does not care about their customers.

### "never use your airline again"
Austin to Denver. This ridiculous company is charging $40 for a checked bag and $45 for each carry on. Pretty sure nobody helped me with my carry on so what am I paying for? And why is it more expensive than a checked bag? The woman at the counter didn't print "CHECKED BAG" on my ticket, so I had to pay an additional $65 for my carry on. Either pay it or don't fly. Awesome Frontier. $110 for a bag I had to handle myself that is the size of a breadbox. I will never use your airline again.

### "the service is so horrible"
San Francisco to Washington via Denver. This would be my first and last time flying Frontier. No customer support, no announcements. You should put in your personal interest to check and keep the refreshing the flight status by yourself in your phone or on the screen. The flight was delayed for more than 7 hrs, didn't see a single attendee saying least a sorry for the inconvenience. Just left all the passengers. Nobody explained the cause for the delay. I missed my connection in to DC from Denver. When I called the customer care, waited for almost 40 mins in queue, finally when answered no empathy or understanding the concerns. The people over the phone doesn't even understands English. Totally the service is so horrible.

### "customer service is less than helpful"
Pittsburgh to Las Vegas. If I could rate this airlines as less than a full star I would. While the staff on the airplane and at the counter at the airport were more than helpful, their customer service is less than helpful. In fact they're quite the opposite than helpful. When I bought my luggage and seat with their perks program online, they charged my debit card double once for me and for the other person in my reservation. I called immediately and they said they would refund half back to my debit card. Well two to three weeks passed and I never got it. I called and was told that it was refunded to a card that didn't belong gimme or anyone on my trip. I called back after figuring this all out and they told me that it went to my travel agents corporate credit card. I spoke with my travel agent and she said that it did not go there. I called back again and was told it can take 1 to 2 statement cycles for it to post. I work in banking so I know it doesn't take this long. Especially since on the first call they told me 7-10 days. I ended up disputing this with my bank who I also work for and it is in process of being corrected. Frontiers customer service did nothing but pass the buck off to other people and offered nothing for an inconvenience. Not to mention that they're supposed to refunded the money back to the card charged as per the agreement with Visa and MasterCard. They never even apologized for any of this. And when I spoke with a supervisor they were also less than helpful and when I asked to go above them the supervisor said there was no one else which I find extremely hard to believe. While my flight was great, the inconvenience, the rudeness, and utter incompetence of their customer service makes me never wish to fly this airline ever again.

### "could not get anything right"
My first flight and last flight with Frontier Airlines flying from Orlando to San Francisco. This airline could not get anything right. Their check in system via the kiosk is misleading. They will charge you for a carry on despite the fact that it is free. My family was split during the flight and we had to kindly ask a passenger to switch so I could at least sit with my 6 year old while my wife sat with our 2 year old. Then they proceeded to lose the second half of our car seat. I will refrain from reviewing their non-reclining seats, lack of wifi or screens, and nickle and diming fir all other amenities. Do not fly this airline unless you have no other choice. There are no savings just inconveniences.

### "not interested in customer service"
Flying from Raleigh Durham to Trenton on 4/5/17 with the upgraded “the works” package, bag was not loaded onto flight. RDU confirmed the bag was still sitting in the baggage area, after the flight landed in Trenton. Not sure how this happened, as they only run one flight out of RDU per day. Called Frontier immediately and was told the bag would be delivered on 4/6. Called on 4/6 to confirm and was told it would be delivered on 4/7, since they realized they don’t fly out of RDU on 4/6. On 4/7, called to confirm and was told it was delivered to the Trenton airport and would be sent by courier that afternoon. Received a message 2 hours later that they didn’t have delivery address, even though it was given to 3 different people, 2 in Trenton and one in Denver. Also, they were calling the back-up number of a family member because they had put in the main cell number as a fax number. Tried to call back, but no answer. Bag did not arrive on 4/7. Called Frontier on 4/8 to confirm delivery and was told it would be delivered that day. Received a call an hour later saying they don’t deliver in that area and would send by Fed Ex, with arrival scheduled for 4/11, a week after the flight. Called back to say this was unacceptable, that since they were at fault for this situation, they should rectify the problem and have it delivered on 4/8, even if it would cost them extra to hire a courier. Was told they don’t do that and the bag would arrive on 4/11, unless we drive to the airport and pick it up ourselves, which is not possible because we don’t have a car there. No apologies, no empathy, and no other options pursued. Our family has been loyal to Frontier over the years, with minor issues that were tolerated. However, this lack of customer service shows Frontier’s true colors. This airline is not interested in quality of customer service, but rather quantity of flights that can be booked and profits to be made. You are better off paying a little more for better customer service. You certainly get what you pay for with Frontier!

### "disappointed in Frontier Airlines"
❎ Unverified |  St. Louis to Las Vegas. For the third time in a row, my husband and I have been extremely disappointed in Frontier Airlines. Last spring was the first time we flew with Frontier. On our way to Cancun we had no problems, however we sat on the plane for over 3 hours waiting for take off coming home, which made us late for our connecting flight. The second time we flew Frontier was to Denver, Colorado from Kansas City, MO. Once again, we had to wait over an hour after we boarded the plane because they failed to fuel the plane before passengers arrived. The third and final time we will ever fly with this airline was this previous week. Coming home from Las Vegas our flight was scheduled at 12:35 am, the airline boarded early, resulting in them refusing to let us get through security because we were "late" although we arrived over an hour before departure. Not only did we not get to board our flight, the next flight out was not until 10 am the next morning, with a 9 hour layover in Denver. Once we arrived in Denver we were informed that the take off time would be delayed 2 hours. I have NEVER been with an airline that consist of so many delayed/cancelled flights and mechanical problems than with Frontier airlines. In addition, it is absolutely insane that Frontier charges for a carry on bag, especially when they charge more for a carry on bag and a checked bag. Horrible airline and even worse customer service.

### "very good experience"
Pittsburgh to Las Vegas. I had a very good experience with Frontier Airlines. My flights were both early arrival time. The plane ride was smooth. The flight attendants were very nice. I bought my seats and paid for a carry on but my bill was still only $270 for both me and my daughter round trip. I am very pleased with Frontier.

### "lack of empathy and responsibility"
San Antonio to Portland via Denver with Frontier Airlines. This review might be different than others in the sense that I was unable to even go on my trip. I was supposed to fly out of San Antonio. I got to the airport an hour and a half prior to departure with my electronic boarding passes from the Frontier app, as instructed when check-in done last night. I followed the sign that said "drop bags," since I was pre-checked. I waited in line for approximately 25-30 mins, while realizing there was something wrong because only agent was taking at least 10-15 mins with each passenger. When my turn came (40 mins prior to departure) I was informed flight had been delayed to 3pm , and possibly 4pm since plane had not left Denver. I would lose my connection to Portland. I was told I would not make my connection in Denver today, so I could take their next flight, tomorrow afternoon. I was supposed to attend a national conference in Portland the next morning. They could not place me in Portland until the following evening. There was no assistance to place me on another airline's flight because as was told "we have no alliance with any other airline. My only option, get a refund and look for another flight myself. The "refund process" was started but I was not given a receipt because I was told, "the email was sent, and once they approve it they will send you an email with information. This is supposed to be within the next 7-10 days, I was informed. I was given a screenshot as receipt by the rep, who voiced being the manager on site, but who wasn't willing to give me his name, because of security reasons? I was unable to fly another airline because my other 2 options (late night flights) would cost me U$500 one-way. Needless to say, I went home extremely frustrated and sad at the lack of empathy, ethics, or responsibility from this airline. Not to mention the many other cancellations I had to do because of this irresponsibility. Do yourself a favor, pay a little more and fly an airline that will guarantee arrival at your destination, or who would graciously assist you to get on another flight, if need be.

### "avoid this airline"
Do yourself and your family a huge favor and avoid this airline. Seats are uncomfortable, checking bags at counter is a nightmare, and be prepared to wait up to an hour for luggage to come off plane. There were 100 plus people in line at Palm Beach and zero employees at the Frontier Counter less than two hours before our flight. You must check bags at counter to fly. People were running to make the flight because the line was so long. Chaos at baggage claim when we landed. Not enough handlers to remove bags. Horrible.

### "plane was late in both directions"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Orlando to San Francisco. The plane was late in both directions due to non-existent weather conditions. Many other customers and myself asked for a free drink - just water, juice or something - and were refused. Plane was cold and no blankets were available. I will never fly Frontier again after this experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew from Washington DC to Denver for a business trip with Frontier Airlines and the flight was great. I will agree with others that the seats are a bit uncomfortable however there was plenty of leg room. Sure you don't get inflight entertainment but bring a book. It's also not a big deal that you have to purchase soda. You do get water complimentary and if you need snacks make sure to buy them ahead of time in the airport. The thing I don't like is that you have to pay for carry on and seat assignment but otherwise it was a good, smooth flight on a clean plane. I had a direct flight and no issues with delays. I will fly them again.

### "worst airline I have been on"
Washington to San Diego. The worst airline I have been on. I have flown with them twice since their prices were somewhat better but I think I will pay more for for a better experience with another airline. I flew the same route (Dulles, to Orlando then to San Diego) and both times my bags did not show up. Not sure what goes on but bags from dulles apparently get left in dulles and make it on the next flight which is ridiculous. They charge 40 dollars for a checked bag also which I never got refunded even though they said they would. They charge for soft drinks which every airline I've been on its usually complimentary. The seats are uncomfortable and the space is extremely small. Again, terrible experience both times I've flown and will never fly with them again.

### "I will fly them again"
❎ Unverified |  Me and my three children took a flight from San Francisco to Washington through Denver. The process was perfect. When you book on Frontier, you need to understand the terms and conditions. Don't check a bag. Take a small carry on. Bring food and drinks, or be prepared to pay for them. Its really easy to be successful if you understand how this airline works, and that it is a discount airline. The planes were perfect, flight attendants were nice. Good experience and I will fly them again!

### "What a nightmare"
Denver to Los Angeles. What a nightmare this airline seems to be. The last two time I have used Frontier Airlines both March of 2016 and March of 2017 they have cancelled my flight and put us on a earlier flight without notifying us. In 2016 we were on a red eye flight and when I printed my boarding pass I seen they changed our flight to leave at 6pm instead of 1159pm I had one hr to get the 4 of us to the airport to catch my flight. Well this year or flight was delayed 2 hrs and we were forced to sit on the plane with no air or anything to drink. On the return flight we were on a 550pm flight returning to Denver. We got up in the morning to print boarding pass at the hotel. When we went in they again changed our flight from 550pm to 920am, we missed our flight and never had a notice it was changed. Well they could not get us on another flight into the next day, so missed work a day and had to pay for hotel for another night. We had paid for extended seating on the 550 flight but did not get it on the new flight and were told we could upgrade for 50 per seat in the same seats we already upgraded role 1 and 3. Frontiers seats are so close with no leg space so the person behind me had there legs under my seat and his boots were in the way so I could not even put my legs down without resting them on his boots! I have one more flight with Frontier coming up in May and will never fly with them again.

### "nothing good to say"
Milwaukee to Salt Lake City via Denver. I will never book another flight on Frontier Airlines again. The review asks for when was the last time you flew on this airline, but my son never even got to fly out. He was supposed to fly out at 6:30 this morning for SLC and they cancelled the second part of his trip at the last minute. While they did refund his money, they were of no help getting him on another flight, so his entire trip had to be cancelled. I've spoken with a number of friends regarding this and no one seems to have nothing good to say about this airline.

### "a very pleasurable flight"
Cancun to Cleveland. There was a mechanical problem that was dealt with as best they could. We were delayed but given vouchers to use for a flight in future. Yes, a delay, was inconvenient. But certainly better than having trouble in flight. Would certainly fly Frontier again. Overall a very pleasurable flight!

### "abysmal customer service"
Abysmal customer service. Frontier Airlines canceled our flight from Orlando to San Francisco after delaying it over and over again and all attendants disappeared. No one tried to get us accommodation or a new flight. Many passengers ended up having to pay out of pocket for a new flight and the airline is still dodging sending out reimbursement forms. Unreliable, unprofessional, and frankly uncomfortable flights. Spend the extra fifty bucks on an airline that won't leave you stranded.

### "Absolute worst flight"
Las Vegas to Austin. Absolute worst flight I've ever flown. My flight was delayed 2 hrs and we were not informed until 1 min before original planned take off. We were told their system didn't update them on time. What a lousy excuse.

### "worst airline I have ever been on"
Atlanta to Denver. Let me start by saying that if I could give a 0/10 I would- Frontier Arline is the worst airline I have ever been on. Plane was very uncomfortable , the flight attendance were VERY rude, and the wait for everything was unusual long! The flight attendance were rude when speaking to the passengers. The flight attendance sat in their seats for most of the flight (not a bumping flight) and were rude to passengers when they needed to use the restroom. While they were passsing out drinking my mother asked the flight attendant if she could give her a cup to throw away, the flight attendant replied "nope" and kept moving.

### "wowed by the in-flight service"
Chicago to Punta Cana. Normally I am not a type who would write reviews. But we were really wowed by the in-flight service we experienced. In February me, and my sister decided to take a trip to Punta Cana and meet up with our brother and his family who flew in from Europe. My sister was in-charge of booking the trip, and at first I was not happy with her choice to fly with Frontier Airlines. Frontier being a budget airline, and the reputation of nickel and dime'g by the budget airlines was kind a turn off for me specially flying international. From the moment we settled in the seat I was wrong about the perception I had of Frontier Airlines. The seats were very comfortable and one flight attendant was exceptionally friendly and kind. Hardly ever experienced the kind of friendliness and welcoming attitude from a flight attendant ever before. We constantly bugged him to buy more drinks and nuts and he was always there with a smile.

### "never fly Frontier again"
Denver to Seattle. I only chose 1/10 because I couldn't choose 0/10!! I booked a flight to Seattle for $165 round trip. When I went to check in online, I was charged an addition $116 for a checked bag, one carry on, and my seat (because apparently your seat isn't included in the purchase price), via "the perks" option. This charge stated it was my additional cost for my round trip flight. There was no in flight entertainment, they charged you for refreshments (that they only accepted debit or credit as payment for), and they passed out credit card applications to everyone on board. The seats are miserable and the plane lacked cleanliness. Next came my return flight. I flew out at 6:40 at night. I wrapped up work, and headed to the airport 4 hours early, to check my bag, so I wouldn't have to drag it around. Unlike United, they only show up two hours prior to departure to check bags for the flight, though none of this information is told to you when you purchase your ticket. They also refuse your bag 45 minutes before departure, leaving one hour to check everyone's bags, so the line was huge, and the ticket agent showed up 20 minutes late!! When I finally got to the counter to check my bag, I was charged another $60, and was told "the perks option only covers a checked bag and carry on on my initial flight, and only my checked bag on my returning flight. Unreal! The return flight was exactly the same as the one here. I basically paid a total of $350 for a crappy flight with poor customer service. I will never fly Frontier again.

### "lack of customer service"
This was my first and last experience with Frontier Airlines. My girlfriend and I booked a red eye from Salt Lake City to Tampa via Denver as it was the only flight that worked with our schedule. We pre-paid for our checked baggage, and arrived at the check-in counter 42 minutes prior to departure. The employee behind the desk informed us that they do not allow checked baggage later than 45 minutes to departure, and that no one was available to bring our bags to the gate. I asked if she could check with the luggage people, she would not. I asked if the other employee at the counter playing on her phone could help, she said they were not going to the gate and could not help. After realizing the lost cause we discarded $80 worth of toiletries to get through security. Upon arriving at the gate, the same employee was there (even though she said she wasn't going to be) and there were 2 luggage employees sitting at the top of the jetway playing on their phones. Apart from the lack of customer service, both the employee and her supervisor were incredibly rude and condescending. In addition the seats were cramped, the drink service was horrible, and they nickel and dime you for everything.

### "wait at the airport for 13 hours"
Washington, DC to Las Vegas via Denver. My initial flight was delayed I was never notified of a delay until I arrived at the airport. Due to my flight delay I was going to miss my connecting flight in Denver. I was offered no compensation or even a hotel although the earliest flight I could catch would be the next morning. I had a hotel booked in Vegas not only did they not agree to compensate me for that room they wouldn't get me a hotel room in Denver and expected me to wait at the airport for 13 hours. Once arriving in Denver I saw that my original connecting flight was delayed and had to jump through hoops to be put on that flight. The flight attendants were rude and customer service is horrible. I would recommend paying the extra money to flight with a decent airline like Delta or United. I only have one star because they wouldn't let me do zero.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew from Salt Lake to Phoenix. Overall this was the worst airline I have flown. Airplane so dirty. Seats so uncomfortable, my husband and I paid for extra room leg however there wasn't any room leg at all. I paid $30 and I didn't get anything, the seats don't even recline back. I pay $60 to check my bag. Nothing on the plane to entertain yourself with. To get a drink onboard was $2.99, but water was free. I will never recommend Frontier.

### "I am stuck at the airport"
Never again! Bought round trip tickets with Frontier Airlines for two from Columbus to Orlando Intl. Had a family medical emergency so had to return sooner. Stuck with buying 2 new tickets. Their web browser went down. Got to the ticket desk and was charged $30 for them to pick my seat. They said now you will be charged $45 for me to carry my own bag which was appropriate size or $40 for them to carry it. Now, my flight was to depart at 12.20. The plane broke down in Orlando and now, I am stuck at the airport with a 2yr old until 3.30. Still waiting to board 4 hours later! So, you are held hostage. Pay for extras which is up to them, or you don't get on your non refundable flight! Click on baggage fees and web link broken. How convenient.

### "the staff were rude beyond forgiveness"
Worst experience in all of my years of travel. Flew Frontier Airlines from Orlando to Seattle. The flight was delayed three times with no announcement. Stood in line for 45 min to get help, after I had already stood in line for ten minutes to be told first they weren't sure what was going on. Then moved the line for my connecting city letting people cut in front of those already waiting. The crowd was ready to lose it. I was told it would take two days to get home and my situation wasn't their problem. The staff were rude beyond forgiveness. The airline wasn't willing to pay for hotel or car or handle a flight with any other airline. The fares were not great, the baggage fees were double other airlines. No free snack drinks. No compensation for anyone's troubles. Delays out of control are one thing but poor customer service is another. I am so dumbfounded by the horrible staff. Has Frontier read any of their reviews? Astonished they haven't improved anything based on all the complaints. Never again!

### "Luggage cost an extra $80"
Columbus to Las Vegas. Stay away. Luggage cost us an extra $80, Seat Selection $24, all drinks cost $$. A 4 Hour flight and the flight attendants make one pass with the beverage cart. The seats could not be more uncomfortable - hard and no recline.

### "gouges customers for every possible penny"
Flew Frontier from Philadelphia to Orlando. I decided to give Frontier a try when Southwest had no convenient flights. What looked to be a reasonable fare turned out to be anything but. This airline gouges its customers for every possible penny. In order to get a seat to sit in and a space for my carry-on I had to pay another $94.00 (round trip). Once on board the gouging continued, with very expensive snacks/drinks - no free water from these guys. I ended up paying over $400.00 for a ticket originally quoted at around $260.00. I will never use this airline again. Even at a what I thought was a high price, SouthWest was a bargain. On a positive note, the crew were extremely courteous. Even though they had to push a hard sell on Frontier credit cards and a points offer that barely offset their outrageous prices. The cheap and uncomfortable plastic seats did nothing to enhance this sorry experience.

### "experience was a nightmare"
Philadelphia to New Orleans. My wife and I took our first Frontier flight earlier today. We purchased the tickets through Orbitz. Everything about the experience was a nightmare! First, the flight was delayed. Then upon entering the plane, we were taken out of line and charged $60 for a small carry-on which could have fit beneath the seat in front. The fee was not indicated at the time of ticket purchase. Therefore, we attempted to question the ethics of charging an unadvertised fee, and the representative at the gate was extremely rude. Specifically, she said to take our issue up with a representative of the company (which we mistakenly thought that she was). Once boarded, we discovered that the seats were primarily made of molded plastic with very little cushion. In fact, there was so little room that our knees were up against the seats in front. On top of that, during the flight, the staff was rude to the customers on the plane. They charged $2.95 for a small soft drink. There was no inflight entertainment. And they kept hawking their Frontier credit card for a charge of $69 annually. Never again will we fly this airline! !

### "never fly with them again"
Santa Ana to Philadelphia via Denver. Terrible customer service and dirty planes. Clicked the wrong box while booking a flight and hit checked bag instead of carry on. When I noticed this upon check in, I did not have time to rectify the situation over the phone and in order to avoid a problem at the gate I paid again for a carry-on bag. Upon calling customer service a couple of days after my flight to get refunded for the checked bag that I accidentally hit, I was told there was never a time I could be refunded unless the flight was canceled. Spoke with a supervisor and was told that if they made an exception for me they would have to do it for everyone and change the policy. I don't think anyone has said that to me since my 1st grade teacher. I indicated I was a frequent flyer with them and would not continue to fly if they were not able to accommodate a simple mistake and asked point blank if they were willing to lose a customer over $80 and they still said there wasn't anything they could do. I will never fly with them again. This was icing on the cake to all of their hidden fees and dirty airplanes with "pre-reclined" seats. The woman next to me had to get someone to wipe her seat before she sat down as there was a nasty, unknown brown stain.

### "Frontier was the worst"
Las Vegas to St. Louis via Denver. Will never fly Frontier Airlines again. I have used a lot of airlines in my lifetime, but Frontier was the worst, by far. Arriving at the airport they charged us for our luggage (40-45.00/per bag). That alone put us over the amount offered by competitors. Plus they charged us again on the way back! We were going to use the kiosk to check in, but they said we would still have to wait in the enormously long line (1 hr). We get on the flight and the seats are like lawn chairs, and they don't recline! The serving cart comes down the aisle and we find out that we have to pay for everything but a small cup of water. On our return flight there is a delay (2 hrs). We arrive at our stop-off in Denver to catch our connecting flight, but that flight leaves 15 mins before we arrive. We go to the customer service desk and they tell us that our flight from Las Vegas wasn't delayed and that we just missed the flight. I tell them it was delayed by two hours. Finally, after two hours of waiting at the desk till midnight, they admit that the flight we just took was delayed. They tell us that there isn't another flight until the following evening, but that was booked. Finally, the shift supervisor shows up and gets us on the flight the next evening and gives us a voucher for a room at a hotel. Of course the following day we have to be out of our room at 11am, so we have to find somewhere to hang out until that evening when the flight leaves. The food vouchers are only good at the airport and they are for 10 and 15 dollars which doesn't go far at an airport eatery. Plus we have to pay for cab fare from the hotel to the airport to use them, and that is about 15 miles away. We finally get on the flight the next evening and sit on the tarmac for an hour so that they can de-ice the plane (1 hr). Of course we arrive late in St. Louis and wait another hour for our luggage. This is the worst run airline I have ever used. The trays are the size of an iPad, the seats are about as uncomfortable as you can get. The pilots were good, despite the horrible weather coming into St. Louis, and the attendants were good too. That is the only good thing I can say.

### "treated us like we were kids"
Philadelphia to Cancun return. I like nothing about this airline. Extra charges for everything including water. Seat look like they off a bus. Uncomfortable, did not recline, tables about the size of an IPAD. Flight Attendants treated us like we were kids on a school bus. Insulting. Unfamiliar with custom procedures at PHL. Insisted we fill out a form that was not even used at PHL.

### "I would not take Frontier again"
Washington to Salt Lake City via Denver. I would not take Frontier again. Attendents are polite and the flights are nice not rough spots or anything. However, this airline will charge you a $40 fee for checked baggage or $45 for carry on, even if you have a lay over from another Frontier flight. I flew from Ronald Reagan Washington With Frontier to Denver and paid the $45 for carry on. I had a 3 hr layover in Denver to Salt lake. They wanted me to pay the $45 again before boarding for SLC. $90 for carry on baggage for a flight with layovers? We can't control that, I'm sure we would all appreciate direct flights at any given time. I do. You also better pack your bag with treats and snacks. They cost money on the flight too, besides water. That is free.

### "double the ticket price to check bags"
Flight from Atlanta to San Francisco with Frontier Airlines. Paid double the ticket price to check in bags. Flight was $75 and the baggage fee was $145. My son flew this flight. I flew 2 weeks later from San Francisco to Atlanta and charged a completely different baggage fee carrying the same exact item. Called customer service to ask "Why? they have no answer and said it's up to who ever checks you in. From SFO to ATL they misplaced 1 bag, they allowed a daily spending fee and dropped off the bag on a Sunday at 3am. The daily fee was minimal. The cheapness of the flight is made up in fees. No drink or food without being charged besides a small glass of water.

### "2 hrs 35 min to get to counter"
Orlando to Charlotte. Got to airport 2 hrs before flight time to check bag. Took us 2 hrs 35 min to get to counter. Several hundred people in line. Employees rude as hell. Self serve kiosks didn't work. Arrive at Charlotte and waited 42 minutes on tarmac to get to gate due to another aircraft occupying our gate.

### "Last Frontier trip ever"
❎ Unverified |  Orlando to Salt Lake City via Denver. What a joke. Downloaded my boarding pass and pre-paid for a checked bag (don't give you the first bag free). Got to the airport and still had to stand in a long line to drop off the checked bag. No curbside valet. Ended up standing in the regular check-in line, as the bag drop line was longer and crawling. Guy I will assume was the supervisor told me to stand in the bag drop line, but the one he directed me to was wrong. Employee behind a counter rudely told that only people on last call for their flight could immediately drop off their bag. Everyone else, regardless of how they paid or checked in, had to stand in line. Add to that Frontier charges for a carry-on beyond one personal bag and there isn't any reason to choose this airline over a more expensive option. Going to stick with customer-centric lines like Delta, United and Southwest. Last Frontier trip ever.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Philadelphia to Kansas City. Frontier Airline seemed a decent choice because it was relatively cheap but still had valid times for the trip we had planned in May this year (2017). However, as things happen, we had to cancel our flights due to unforeseen circumstances. It was only as I requested a refund that I realized we would be charged 100 dollars each for cancelling the flights almost 3 months in advance. This is absurd; while I fully admit that I didn't familiarize myself with the cancellation process, being charged almost full price anyway despite not even using the airline is outrageous and certainly unethical. I will be going out of my way to avoid using Frontier Airlines again, and they must be persuaded to more fully and faithfully advertise the costs associated with their booking process. I do not recommend this airline, especially if you're running on a tight budget and can't afford ridiculous charges in case of a change in plans.

### "Will not fly Frontier again"
San Diego to Orlando. Flight landed at 0540 am and had to sit on runway 40 minutes waiting for a plane with mechanical issues to move from gate. At that time in the morning would think another gate could be used instead of having an entire plane full of people sitting on runway. Pilots informed would be 3-4 minutes initially. Booked flight using Frontier site. Asked for additional fees every step of the way multiple times. Seats tiny, do not recline. Will not fly Frontier again regardless of how much can save by doing so - not worth it.

### "horrible customer service"
Miami to Salt Lake City. If you have an electric scooter stay away from Frontier. They told me that I could not pre check our bags because we had an electric scooter that needed to be checked at the counter. When we got to the counter they charged us the full baggage price for all of our bags. After fighting with them for 2 days after our flight they did refund the extra charges. This is a very poor company with horrible customer service.

### "Frontier Airlines is a joke"
Orlando to Cincinnati. Frontier Airlines is a joke. When I showed up for my flight Thursday I was informed I had not checked in on time. They overbooked the flight and did not have a seat available for me. I was only given the option of rebooking the next day, 24 hours later. I missed flying to my destination by a day. I also later found out they charged my credit card $99 for a "rebooking fee" when I tried to contact them about this I could not get in touch with anyone regarding the matter. They have no customer service, and they overbook flights.

### "given no information for 2 hours"
I have never left a review for anything, however I felt the need to write this review during my 5 hour delay. After my plane was hit by another aircraft before even taking off, we were taken off our plane and brought back to the terminal where we were given no information for 2 hours. Then I was given a re-routed ticket, 5 hours from my original departure, on a different airline. Unfortunately, my return ticket is through Frontier, but after that I will never fly with them again.

### "instead of saving money, I wasted more"
San Francisco to Orlando. Be careful with Frontier Airlines, by far the worst experience from flying out to the customer service. I'm from Sacramento and I took a flight from San Francisco because it was 100$ cheaper. I would much rather pay 100$ extra than to fly with Frontier in the future. No snacks or beverages - they charged for everything. They have no free carry on baggage - I had too pay 80$ there and back. I figured out now why it's so cheap and so uncomfortable. Instead of saving money I wasted more than I planned to. Spend a little more and have a better experience.

### "would highly recommend it"
❎ Unverified |  Tampa to Las Vegas. I was hesitant to travel thru Frontier after reading some of the reviews. However, it was the only Non stop flight available, so my wife and I decided to take it. I am glad we did, it was nothing like the reviews. We got the stretch seats, very affordable flight and arrived on time. Staff was great. I would highly recommend it and I would fly with them again.

### "not the best, but it's cheap"
Kansas City to Denver. I've flown with frontier a few times over the years and it's been average. Definitely not the best, but it's cheap so sometimes it's doable. However, the staff in Kansas City treated me horribly for no reason and it definitely put a bad taste in my mouth. Probably won't fly again with them.

### "They moved me 3 times"
❎ Unverified |  Frontier Airlines would not properly accomodate my service dog. Seats are so cramped and flight overbooked. Tried to make arrangements ahead, but said I had to do it at the gate. Squished me and my 66lb service dog in a window seat in the back of the plane for 3.5 hour flight. They moved me 3 times! Never use them if you have a service animal. What a nightmare!

### "Frontier do not care about you"
Washington to San Diego. I booked this flight to go on vacation to see my friend in California. My flight was delayed 2 hours leaving Washington DC area. I was to have a 48 hour layover in Orlando and then make the connecting flight to San Diego. My itinerary states that I would be on the same flight for both legs of the journey. When I arrive in Orlando, they tell me I missed my flight and the plane I just was on was not leaving the airport. The earliest they could get me a flight to my destination was literally 24 hours after I landed in Orlando. All of the hotels were booked so I had to sleep on the floor of the airport until my next flight. Frontier Airlines refused to compensate me in any manner for their mistake. Now I am waiting to get on my newly schedule flight when it is delayed 3 more hours. Mind you, this is like deja vu because the plane was coming from D.C. And is to be taking us to San Diego. So how is it that the plane today coming from D.C. Was taking me to San Diego but I missed the flight yesterday? Frontier did not acknowledge this. My trip was to be Thursday night to Monday morning. I literally lost over 1/3 of my trip because Frontier Airlines messed up. And they will not take responsibility. Everyone I have spoken with has been discourteous and rude and refuse to compensate me for spending over 27-28 hours stuck in the Orlando airport. Frontier Airlines do not care about you or any of their customers. I wish I would have known before I wasted so much money and time to hang out in an airport.

### "very nice and accommodating"
❎ Unverified |  Chicago to Palm Beach. We had a good flight. Upon reading others reviews, we were prepared for our trip. Here are the negative things I read about, and how I feel about it now. You are allowed one personal bag. We (7 of us) had no problems with this. We had everything we needed in one backpack. No food or drinks on the plane. We knew this as well, just make sure you eat before or buy snacks before you get on the plane. Uncomfortable seats. Our flight was short (under 3 hours) so it wasn't so bad. I wouldn't recommend using Frontier for international travel as that might get a little uncomfortable. Plane was clean. Everyone we encountered with Frontier Airlines was very nice and accommodating. Our flights were on time. We arrived 2 hours early just to make sure that we got checked in. (I read that some people were denied access because of a late arrival) Again, we each had one bag that fit under our seats so no lost luggage. If we lost it, it was on us. Hope this helps!

### "I have to say it was great"
Orlando to San Diego. The night before my flight I read the negative reviews about Frontier airlines and freaked out. I thought to myself wow this is going to be a disaster. However, I have to say from the beginning to the end, it was great. I got a great last minute deal and had no problems. I feel that the people that have a disaster flight tends to vent the negativity. My favorite part about the flight was their food and drink menu, it had a wonderful selection, happy hour deals! Must I say anymore. I've flown all airlines and never seen this. I wanted to speak out amongst all the negativity against them. I flew for half the price and "flew right" as they say.

### "never fly Frontier Airlines again"
Denver to Minneapolis. There can't possibly be an airline worse than Frontier Airlines. First we were forced to pay $100.00 per ticket to change our flights a month before flying. When booking we neglected to pay an additional $6.00 each to choose our seats. I didn't believe that meant they would separate our two seats that were booked together. Is this enticement for us to pay additional money to secure seats or enticement for us to never fly frontier again. We are electing to never fly Frontier Airlines again. I don't care if we have to pay more or encorporate layovers in our future travels. Frontier is an embarrassment to the airline industry.

### "will not be recommending Frontier to anyone"
Outbound my wife an I flew from Seattle to Denver on Delta. Nice seats, complimentary snacks and free carry-on bags. When we flew back to Seattle from Denver we flew Frontier as both flights came as a package deal using Travelocity. I wasn't aware that Frontier had a carry-on fee of $30. When we got to the gate a Frontier representative announced that if you have carry-on bags you should have a ticket with that annotated it on it. We did not have that annotation. We were forced to pay $60 per bag to take our carry-ons home. Then, while on the plane, I witnessed passenger 18C ask the attendant if he had to pay for his bag in the overhead stowage. To my disbelief she put his bag in the stowage and said don't worry about it. Lesson learned: act dumb and they'll not worry about the fee. To add insult to injury, the last 20 minutes of the flight we were bombarded with the flight attendant advertising their credit card and it's benefits. They went so far as to pass out applications and have passengers fill them out before they got off the plane. Besides that, the seats were uncomfortable on the A319 without the ability to retract and little to no leg room. Needless to say, I will not be riding or recommending Frontier to anyone ever.

### "first time with Frontier and we are not impressed"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Chicago O'Hare to Tampa. My husband approached the check-in counter and the employee there told him she was not working at the moment. He approached the counter a second time and there was a different employee that time. He asked her if she was working this flight - due to the response from the previous employee, and she replied very rudely - "Obviously! I'm standing here! This is our first time traveling with Frontier and we are not impressed! Customer service should be a priority when working a job in which you deal with people all day. I think we'll be taking our service elsewhere next time. First impressions are huge.

### "not fly again with Frontier"
My flight from Denver to San Francisco got cancelled 8 hours prior to departure. The email was three sentences long and did not give a reason. I was upset, but just tried to see if they could put me on their afternoon flight tomorrow instead. Was on the phone to re-book my flight for 45 minutes, and when the representative finally answered, he told me the next available flight would be in 4 days! I was already upset about this and my waiting time, so while I looked at different airlines for an earlier flight, asked the rep to wait for 2 minutes. After quickly finding a better flight with Southwest, I looked at my phone and the representative had hung up! Had to recall again and wait another 30 minutes just to ask for a refund. Had to book the flight with a different airline and spent about $100 more than I needed to. Not to mention my flight coming to Denver from San Francisco earlier (this was a round-trip flight) got delayed 4 hours! Frontier has rude and unreliable customer representatives, poor flight services, and always have delayed/canceled flights. Pledging to not fly again with Frontier in 2017. I hope anyone that reads this also will take the pledge with me.

### "terrible customer service"
Denver to Orlando return. Terrible regarding everything. Leaving Orlando they were completely unorganized and the bording passes wouldn't work. They made us go back and get new ones which caused us to almost miss our flight. They didn't care at all. Horrible customer service. They charge you for all carry ons. They also charge an additional "seat charge" on top of what you pay for your ticket. Which I was not aware of until check in. On the way back from Denver, they lost our luggage. They had know idea where it was or when they would find it. Again, they could care less. Zero compensation and once again, absolutely terrible customer service.

### "cancelled 18 hours before"
Denver to New Orleans. Our flight got cancelled 18 hours before we were suppose to fly out and the only thing customer service would help with was a refund or get us a flight two days later. I told them we had a cruise to be at by Saturday and I begged for help to get us on any flight, even a flight close to our destination. We were told there is nothing they can do and the rep told me she can't make "magic" happen and just argued with me. The agent was supposed to be the supervisor and she was rude, inconsistent and could really could care less about our concerns. We were offered no help and by the end of and hour and half call she refunded our money but only to be a different amount than what was originally told. We had to book a flight with another airline for Friday and pay $1000.

### "poor customer service"
Minneapolis to Phoenix via Denver. First off the appearance of the staff from this airline is not professional. My first flight out was from MSP airport with flight to Denver, that was delayed no real reason was given as to why the delay had occurred. Upon our late arrival to Denver my connecting flight to Phoenix was boarded therefore we were late and missed the flight. No fault of our own, so the attendant at the gate said to see the customer help desk. Which did not really provide any real relief besides saying she can get us on a flight out tomorrow granted it's barely 3:30pm Tuesday. I began to tell her that's not good enough why do I have to lose a whole day for a mistake that was made by Frontier. She than said I can put you on "stand by" which I proceeded to ask what that meant, she said I can maybe get you out on the flight for Phoenix at 9:32. I was not pleased with this either but I needed to get home Tuesday night not Wednesday. But this was just a maybe nothing was certain so that also caused my wife and I stress because we don't even know if we're getting home. So we began to wait what other option did we have, than as no surprise the flight is delayed once again now it departs at 9:50 so we continue to wait and than it happens again! Another delay this time it change to 10:50. Frontier has been the worst airline I have used and I do not recommend it. Failure in communication with customers, poor customer service, rude staff, and overall lack of professionalism throughout the company. Granted I only got to see what it is like in Minneapolis and Denver but that's all I need to say I will never fly with Frontier

### "one of the worst experiences "
Orlando to San Francisco. We made a family vacation to Florida, and was looking for a direct flight to come back to SFO. Only Frontier and United came in my search and looking through price difference and availability I preferred Frontier (given some of the better experiences we had 5 years ago flying Frontier). Going through the booking, with all the fees for each and every step, I somehow felt that my family will deserve a good trip back after a great vacation and so I took the first few row seats paying that 45$ fee/ seat. At MCO, when I came to check in the lack customer service bothered me but I was thinking it would improve once onboard. But everything went south and I should be thankful now for that agent in MCO because rest of those I met along the way are much worse. I don't know how they can employ and run a company which is pathetic. Seats are so hard you cannot sit for more than 2 hours, Pilots do not give any information during take off, mid flight or landing making this feel like sitting in a black hole for 6 hr flight. Once you land in SFO, to pick up the luggage it takes closer to an hour. We couldn't even find a ground crew to ask questions and the entire Frontier desk was deserted. So many families traveling with kids like me, by then are left helpless with even the number listed on airport call doesn't work. One of the worst experiences in my life and would never step my foot on this airline or recommend this to anyone.

### "person at counter was rude"
Austin to Minneapolis via Denver. Terrible experience. I had a connection and there was delay in landing after the first flight. When we got to our final destination my bag (and the bags of all passengers who flew using this connection) did not arrive. The person at the counter was rude, not helpful and gave us false information regarding the time of the arrival and the numbers we can use to contact her. When I insisted for the information, she threatened to call the police to escort me out.

### "Frontier are not reliable"
Frontier Airlines flight cancelled from San Antonio to Denver while we were on the way to the airport. Customer service would not answer the phone all day long. This was a planned ski trip for our family. tickets were bought and paid for in advanced to keep expenses down since this involved 6 people. We were left scrambling at last minute during the holidays trying to find flights to our destination. We found a flight out on a different airline and ended up paying more for the one way flight than we paid for the roundtrip to begin with. Our trip was shortened by one day and we had to make adjustments for the car rental and condo as well. Frontier was absolutely no help on anything. They could not even answer the phone. Don't fly this airline if you want to arrive at your destination. They are not reliable. Take your own food as it is $4 for water or a snack. They have gone down hill since last time we flew with them many years ago.

### "used to be a quality carrier"
Denver to Los Angeles. Frontier used to be a quality carrier. Have lived in the Denver area for 20+ years and they were always the "go to" airline for us. I now vow to never fly them again. First leg of our trip was 4.5 hours delayed with no weather issues on either end. Now we are sitting for our return flight home and have just been notified of at least a 1.5 hour delay and again there are no weather issues on either end. I feel sorry for the hardworkng employees who are finding themselves dealing with unhappy passengers due to poor management. Sorry Frontier but after this travel experience you have lost a faithful customer of many years.

### "some of the worst service"
On December 18th my new wife and I were traveling home from the Riviera Maya, Cancun where we spent our honeymoon. We arrived at the Cancun airport to a one hour delay. This is understandable. At the baggage check-in, I was informed I would have to pay 40 dollars to check my bag. On the way to Cancun this was no problem, and we traveled with one bag for the both of us. Why was I charged 40 dollars? Then the delay extended an additional hour. Once we boarded and took off I noticed some of the worst service. The flight attendant kept treating customers like children and conversing with the pilots at the front of the plane for several hours, meaning passengers had to use the latrine at the rear of the plane, creating a long wait. We arrive late to Denver, went through customs and arrived at the baggage re-check station. We waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, a fellow passenger dialed Frontier from their own phone for information. We were told to travel to the front of the airport and wait in line at the main check in station. Mind you, there were probably 400 people in that area. After waiting 2.5 hours for our now delayed flight 571 to Salt Lake City in a line with no direction or information, we arrived at the ticketing counter for baggage drop. The attendants acted like they didn’t know anything. They informed us that our flight had been canceled and we would have to take one of two options. Wait and fly out on Wednesday (mind you it’s Sunday night at about 1230) or take a refund, which could take 5-10 business days to receive. Frontier offered no other help, offered no condolence for their errors and simply pushed us along and said not our problem. After an hour of frustrated searching through other airlines to discover it was a hopeless venture to attempt to fly out of Denver, we decided to rent a car and drive the 8 hours from Denver to Salt Lake City.

### "the seats were old and tatty"
Flew with Freebird in July when we went on holiday to Fethiye and I would not fly with them again. The cabin was uncomfortably hot, as others have pointed out. I ended up with chapped lips and an awful cough because of it. The selection of food and drink available on board is poor. Mainly crisps and overpriced fuzzy drinks. Not good enough! The seats were old and tatty and mightily uncomfortable to sit on. Leg room was very poor as the seats were packed in like sardines causing severe discomfort. I know that plane toilets are never pleasant places but the ones on here were dreadful. Unflushable toilets, broken sinks, overflowing paper towel bins, yuck. The only good thing was that the hostesses (the same crew both ways) were kind. They deserve much better than this.

### "my first and last experience"
My son and I booked a round trip flight from Phoenix to St. Louis on Frontier Airlines. This was my first experience with Frontier and in regards to the flight out, I was quite impressed. The flight left on time and the aircraft was clean and new. I was considering getting the Frontier Airlines credit card as I envisioned taking Frontier on a regular basis based upon my initial flight impression. Well, that all changed. After driving 3 hours to the airport and arriving 2.5 hours before our flight I received a notice on my phone that the flight from St. Louis to Phoenix was cancelled. No reason given, just cancelled. I went to the gate to speak with a Frontier representative. This was about 6:30 pm and I heard the poor guy tell the the woman in front of me that he had been on since 2:30 am as he asked her to please not get on his case. I spoke with him to inquire what my options were now that Frontier had cancelled my flight. He suggested I try American Airlines if I wanted to get home. He explained the flight would not be rebooked and the only thing I could do was get a refund. No voucher, no hotel. This is unacceptable. I booked a flight on Southwest (great airline) but the two 1-way tickets now cost me more than the round trip tickets had cost me on Frontier - much more. I realize this is a budget airline but lets get real. If they cannot fulfill their obligation by pulling a plane in, even the next day, to complete my contract for travel they should not be in business. In a similar situation, Allegiant Air gave everyone a taxi voucher to a hotel, a night in a hotel, and brought an aircraft in the next morning to complete the travel. That is the example Frontier needs to follow. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. Hardly a budget airline if you have to purchase a ticket from another airline at a much higher price to get home because of this airlines lack of service.

### "epitome of incompetence"
Denver to Cleveland via Columbus. Frontier is the worst business I have had an interaction with. I don’t know how they spread so much rage and still stay in business. Our flight to Cleveland was one of hundreds canceled out of Denver the weekend before Christmas. They tried to claim it was weather related, even though it had been beautiful for days and no other airlines were having these problems. Lines were horrendously long to talk to customer service and remedy our canceled flight. We were lucky and only waited a little over an hour. The customer service agent seemed like she could care less. She was not helpful at all. She had no recommendations for us. We were told we couldn't fly into Cleveland until Friday (this occurred at 9am Monday). We finally got out of her that we could get tickets on a flight to Cincinnati. Upon asking about our luggage that had been checked to Cleveland, we were told that our checked bag would be taken off the canceled flight to Cleveland and we could pick it up at baggage claim, recheck it on the new flight to Cincinnati. When we arrived at baggage claim there were hundreds or suitcases strewn around the carousels. After waiting half an hour, I was told that our bag was still going to go to Cleveland. Meanwhile, my husband was told to wait there and the bags would come up on the carousel in about 45 minutes. It turned out our bags would indeed be showing up. From the time the flight was canceled to the time the luggage made it back to baggage claim was almost 3 hours. The flight to Cincinnati started getting delayed over and over. As hope that we would make it to Cincinnati that night and still be conscious enough to drive to Cleveland ebbed away, we started looking for other options. We ended up getting on a standby list for a flight to Columbus and getting on that plane. With all this bouncing around between flights, I was told we could fill out a form directing the airline to ship our bag to us in Cleveland when it landed in Cincinnati. When we landed in Columbus I asked a frontier agent where I could fill out the form. She didn’t know what I was talking about! She told me to call customer service. More conflicting information, imagine that. I called customer service and proceeded to wait on hold for 2.5 hours! Upon talking to a person, she told me my bag had actually been pulled off the Cincinnati flight when it was discovered we were no longer on it and was in Denver. She took the address for delivery and said the bag would be overnighted. Imagine my surprise when I got a voice mail the next afternoon saying I had to call Frontier baggage at Cincinnati and provide delivery information because our bag was actually in Cincinnati! Six hours and 20 phone calls later, I was finally able to talk to someone who said my bag did, in fact, make it to Cincinnati and I had to give them delivery information to ship it. Does no one know anything? Who spreads all this false information to so many employees? How is it that one company can have so much conflicting information? This fiasco is the absolute epitome of incompetence. And my story is better than some others. I made it home that day.

### "provides no customer service"
Los Angeles to Orlando . We were on 1:15am flight to Orlando. At first it was delayed. Then it was cancelled. The adjacent flight to Chicago was cancelled too because there was no flight crew. The passangers on this flight were deplaned. All were instructed to proceed to the ticketing desk. No explanation for cancellation. Later they claimed it was weather, and weather got blamed for both cancelled flights. As a result, hours of waiting in line to get a refund with the only option to get another flight on Sunday, or 6 days later. No compensation, no rerouting with a different company. We had to rebook tickets at a much higher holiday price for the next day and got stranded at the airport for the night. Frontier lacks in responsibility, ethics, and provides no customer service. This was our first and last booking through this company.

### "prepare for a multi-day layover"
La Guardia to Atlanta. They tell you to get to the airport 2 hours before your flight, but Frontier gives notice of a cancelled flight around 90 minutes before the flight time (at least they give notice, I suppose). You're instructed to call a number to reschedule. Make sure you have more than 2 hours for this. If you're crazy enough to still want to fly Frontier, prepare for a multi-day layover at the airport. They won't have any flights, can't give food vouchers, and won't cover a hotel. At least they'll refund you money, if you spend another hour on the phone. Fool me once, shame on me. But consumers shouldn't be fooled in the first place.

### "was a real slap at consumers"
I booked a flight in July 2016 to return to family for the Christmas holiday. The flight was out of Punta Gorda on 20th December returning out of Philly 3rd January. 10 hours before the flight I was sent an email cancelling the flight. Upon further inspection all flights out of Punta Gorda were cancelled. I was unable to contact a live human for over two hours on the phone and on the internet until I said that I wanted to book a new flight. When I explained to the agent what happened and wanted to know what were my options I was told that nothing was available until 25 December at 8:15 pm. This was the first time I booked with Frontier because of this new service between Philly and Punta Gorda - it will be the last. I understand that some tough business decisions sometimes have to be made but this was a real slap at consumers.

### "never recommend this airline"
I was supposed to be on flight 283 Orlando to St. Louis and the flight was cancled. I had the worst customer service I have ever had In my life. I never received a cancled flight notification until 30 min before my flight was supposed to leave. Thank God I was there 3 hours early, and the airport staff was going up and down the line asking if people were flying to st Louis. One of the staff members pulled me out of line and told me to go into a delayed or cancled flight line. I had been in that line for over an hour, and that line was just to check my bag. I than waited in line to see if my flight had been delayed or cancled (At this time I didnt know which) an additional hour to be told yes my flight was cancled and that there were no other flights going out until Thursday. I asked if there was anyway they could help me find a new flight to St. Louis anywhere and they told me no they couldn't help me because they had no access to any other airline because of the way Frontier Airlines system worked. I told them I didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel and asked them if they would be able to give me a voucher to put me in a hotel until Thursday. They again told me no and that Frontier Airlines doesn't do those things when flights are cancled because of weather. They told me all they could do for me was give me a refund on my flight. I than found out my refund would not be put back into my account for 10 days. So I had no additional money to find another flight with a different airline. I told them that I had found another flight to st Louis going out to a different airport that was 2 hours away and that I could afford the flight but not the taxi to get to the airport, and asked if they could give me a voucher for the taxi. They told me sorry we can't do that either because of how the flight was cancled. The people at the desk told me that they were sorry for the inconvenience, but there was nothing they could do to help me get home in any way. They than gave me a number to call to voice my complaint and the number was out of service. So, stranded in Orlando with only 100 dollars to my name and absolutely no help from Frontier Airlines I had to than call and ask my parents to find me a way home. They were able to get me on a flight with American Airlines that was over 400 dollars. So 14 hours later and 2 flights, I was able to make it home without any help from Frontier Airlines. I have never been treated so poorly, and have never seen an airline that genuinely didn't care about their passengers as much as Frontier Airlines. I have received nothing. Not my money back, or an explanation to why things happened the way they did, or even an apology. I would never fly with Frontier Airlines again, and would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "never even got to fly with them"
Denver to Charlotte with Frontier Airlines. I have never hated an airline so much. I never even got to fly with them because as I arriveded at airport to drop off my bags they informed me that it was cancelled. I got no email or prior notice. I drove 4 hours to airport to find this out. And better yet, there was no rescheduled flight! My only option was to receive a measly refund for a ticket I paid $280 for and is now over $1000 last minute the week of Christmas. There were tons of people in line screaming for managers and crying. It was a complete nightmare.

### "not a bargain when they strand you"
St Louis to Las Vegas. Third trip on Frontier this year - third disappointment. Okay, I am a slow learner. Never again. Cancelled my flight with no options, no communication other than your flight is cancelled. Holidays, no other flights available. Held on telephone for 2 hours with no answer to help resolve the issue. Rude staff. I have nothing good to say. It's not a bargain when they strand you.

### "we are stranded in New York"
Weather may have been the initial cause of the many delays and cancellations, but is now an excuse for Frontier's disorganization. Our flight from New York to Denver set at 10.45 pm was delayed to 11.45 then again to 1.00 am. We were told check in started at 8.00 and she refused to take our bags or check us in at 7.58. We then arrived at our gate, only to find out that our flight had been cancelled. They told us it was "weather" even though all other airlines are fine. An unaffiliated baggage checker told us they were actually shortstaffed, a flight attendant hadn't shown up. They use weather so they do not have to compensate or gift their customers anything. Just calling and asking for a refund was a hassle, after spending upwards of an hour on hold. Fly United or Southwest. Save yourself the headache. We are stranded in New York at 1.00 am and Frontier could not care less.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Atlanta to Denver. Delay notices were sent out for our flight from ATL to DEN starting at about 4:30 PM advising was delayed to 01:15 hours with a flight that was supposed to leave ATL at 10:10 PM. About 45 minutes later another notice came out. Then about another hour or so another notice. We checked in at the airport and went to the gate with the plan of waiting until four hours after we got there. It wasn't until another passenger advised us that the flight was cancelled. There was not a Frontier employee to be found at the gate or anywhere around. Shortly after we learned of the cancellation from another passenger, two Frontier Airlines employees showed up, and advised there was nothing they could do and instructed all of us to return to the ticket counter for instructions. Upon our arrival to the ticket counter we were advised the flight was cancelled due to weather in Denver. Not possible due to the fact we had another family member flying into Denver on another airline without any issue at all. Accordingly to several different sources, there were several ground crew for Frontier Airlines that walked off the job in Denver. Since the airline advised it was a weather delay their policies do not allow for concessions to stranded passengers, or so we were told. There was no offer to cover hotel expense, and the only option we were given was to re-book a flight for December 25th, which was the first available flight. Well let me say it is December 19th, and six days at our own expense in a hotel, and no other concession being offered, other than a refund, which would not be given for three days is not a good way to retain or gain new travelers. We had to book another flight on a different airline, spend $1100.00 for them, plus a $140.00 for a hotel room just to ensure we were home for the holidays.

### "lack of caring and willingness to assist us"
Flew from San Antonio to Denver with Frontier Airlines. They cancelled the flight at first due to mechanical issues, then after a call to corporate it became a weather issue, even though no other airlines cancelled to Denver because weather was clear. After getting nowhere with customer service a manager was requested. He was useless and said his hands were tied, so we requested corporate, but they too declined to help. The only thing we were told to do was get a refund which would take 7-10 business days to hit our accounts, then go to the other airlines to make new accommodations. They said they could rebook us a flight but it would be late Thursday, basically 3 days of waiting. Lack of caring and willingness to assist us find other flights is appalling. I will no longer be a customer, and others on that flight concur too.

### "never fly with them again"
Pittsburgh to Las Vegas. I was amazed at their terrible service. They cancelled my flight from Pittsburgh to Las Vegas and which was on Sunday and only offered a flight to replace it on Thursday. They were not willing to pay for hotel for the days I needed to wait for the later flight in Pittsburgh or pay for the Airbnb I got in Las Vegas for the days I missed. They took no responsibility for cancelling this flight. I ended up paying a lot to book another flight the next day with another company. Because it was last minute during the holidays all the flights were quite pricey. They only told us the flight was cancelled 20 minutes before it was supposed to departure. Saying they had no flight crew. Half an hour later they told us they don’t know if the flight is cancelled or not. Then an hour later they said the flight is cancelled and it’s because there was bad weather the day before. So because the flight cancellation is “due to weather” it is not their fault. This cheap flight ended up costing me a lot more than a regular flight. I would never fly with them again.

### "airline is deceptive"
Chicago to Miami. No customer service. Ridiculously long lines to check in luggage even after we checked in online and paid all baggage fees in advance. Website is unwieldy, not user friendly and a tool for the airline to nickel and dime for every conceivable service. Our flight was then cancelled and then all customers waited in two hour long lines serviced by one Frontier agent. There was no communication by the gate agent at all except to advise that the flight cancelled. This airline is deceptive - you seem to be getting a cut rate price, but after all of the hidden charges, you are better off with Delta, American or United. This would have been our first Frontier flight that never got off the ground. I will never ever book with it again, no matter what a deal it purports to have on flights.

### "worst airline I've experienced"
Chicago to Miami. Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I've ever experienced. Checked in in advance and still had to wait 2 hrs in line to get baggage tags! Kiosks did not print them. Woke up at 4:15 to get to 7 am flight. Gate employee said she'd make an announcement. Didn't hear anything until 9:00 - all they said was flight was canceled. No direction as to how to get refunds. Was unable to do it online. Had to wait an additional 2+hrs to get refund. Then booked with another airline. All the while my husband waited 2 hrs for someone to answer their phones. Never got them. Charged for everything imaginable.

### "no one to talk to"
Chicago to Denver. Our flight was canceled today. When we went to ticketing to rebook we were told they could not do anything and call the 800 number to get the refund. Frontier does not work with other airlines. So after calling the 800 number, I was greeted with the sound of "on-hold" music for 2 plus hours but no one responded to the call. It was brutally cold in Chicago with temperatures in minus. No reason was given as to why the flight was cancelled, there was no snow. Customers of Frontier are left with no options at all, no one to talk to at airport nor 800 number. There is no one you can speak to about your problem, stating 24/7 customer service agents are available. No, they aren't available.

### "Customer service was poor"
Milwaukee to Denver. The problems started even before I arrived at the airport. They delayed the flight online, then at 1am changed the flight back to on time, so I arrive on time. Just to find out that again the plane is delayed. The woman at the check in counter was stern, hostile and had no interest in accommodation. Customer service was not only poor at the ticket counter, but also on the aircraft. The pilot was the most friendly Frontier employee. And that says a lot since he's flying the plane and not even in the cabin. As the plane was about to descend a flight attendant was prodding people several times. I understand the need to follow regulations, but I wouldn't surprised if theres a bruise on my arm from this Frontier employee. Getting off of the plane was the next struggle. The same employee pulled 8 people up first, because they had connecting flights (the first positive thing thus far) and by doing this she sent people against the current to get their bags. I should never have to worry that someones bag is going to fall on my head. There were at least 8 people who couldn't get back to their bags. Come on Frontier, I've never in my life felt like such an inconvenience to a company.

### "the staff were rude, and didn't listen to anyone"
I understand delayed and canceled flights causing longer wait times - that's no problem. But when the check-in line is halfway down the airport there are bigger problems. It took over an hour just to do a bag drop. Then our gate was moved, without us being told. Then our flight was delayed due to "the plane not being there yet". When we kindly pointed out that the plane was sitting right there in plane sight, we were snuffed off. The phone was ringing off the hook and the attendants ignored it completely. All the while ignoring the line of people in front of them to go leave and get food/drink for themselves. We then were delayed because the pilot didn't show up. We were told it was because it was snowing in Cleveland - which it wasn't. The police were called because one woman slightly raised her voice. We then boarded our flight after a 4.5 hour delay, only to sit on the plane for another 2 hours. We were told they needed to calculate rest times. We finally took off, the staff were rude, and didn't listen to anyone. They didn't offer us anything after waiting for 10 hours. Waited in baggage claim for 30 minutes until luggage came. A horrible airline with zero customer service.

### "never fly Frontier Airlines again"
Denver to Las Vegas. Hands down worst customer service I have ever gotten anywhere. Nobody being helpful at all, not telling us the gate changed, and over an hour delayed with no heads up. I do not recommend Frontier Airlines to anyone and I will never fly with Frontier Airlines ever again.

### "never travel with Frontier again"
San Francisco to Orlando. When I booked it was not made obvious that we would have to pay for hand luggage. I only realised when looking at reviews three days before. When we arrived we were told there was a 35 minute delay. Then after going through check out it it became 90 minutes. Our flight was due to leave 1125pm. It then started to show that it wouldn't leave till 330am. So far this was on the board and nobody talking to us. When eventually the ground staff appeared the attitude of all the female staff absolutely stank. The only person who seemed to seemed to empathise was a male agent. Unfortunately it was not long before he went off duty. When we tried to ask the female staff they told us to sit down and be patient and that it was a mechanical problem. People were asking for food and water and they were refusing. The airport was hot and every cafe was closed and we were not allowed out. At one point all the rest rooms were closed too. To add insult to injury the staff kept disappearing and returning with hot drinks for themselves. At 6am they gave us a 10 dollar voucher which didn't even cover the price of a bun and bottle of water. The delays kept changing to later and later. They gave people option of refund but would not say when you get luggage back so we did not take that option. Also at that late stage another flight have cost 300 dollars extra per person. It would also have taken ten days for refund to process but we would have taken the option if they could have been more specific about us getting luggage back. At about 8am the staff disappeared and the police had to come to calm everybody down. Frontier does not work with other airlines and they only fly to Orlando once a day from San Francisco and would have kept us there for two days at least had that plane cancelled. Anytime anybody complained they threatened to throw them off the flight. The most frustrating thing was not being given any proper information. They said we would get compensation of a voucher to travel with them again. We would never in a million years travel with Frontier again. I advise everybody to read reviews before booking with any airline. I made the mistake of not and lost a day of my holiday. We eventually left at 1050am. The cabin crew were pleasant enough but there was no food to purchase. Only snacks. Ridiculous on a five hour flight even without what happened to us. We feel we should get a refund.

### "they are horrible"
I am currently at the Miami airport heading to New York La Guardia. When I checked Frontier reviews they were filled with negative reviews about terrible customer service and regular delays. I flew in on Delta, which by the way was comfortable and friendly, but the flight back would have been 8pm so i paid $10 extra on each ticket to book this earlier flight at 2:25pm so that I can get home and rest for work the next day. Well let me tell you what a mistake! I might as well have went with Delta at 8pm because Frontier had delayed our flight 4 times! Both for our flight and the one heading to Colorado. Apparently the plane headed to Colorado is in Cuba and hadnt left yet. And they are saying our flight attendants are on that plane and coming over to ours when they arrive. (As I type this we were delayed again to 4:30pm.) They have no Cordination. Believe the reviews! Also they charge $40 for baggage and $45 for each carry on that doesnt meet their measurements. They charge for drinks and snacks. When we checked in before this point we were given a huge attitude. One woman had given us wrong information about not being able to check us in, she also tried to immediately charge us for carry ons. We went to another lady and she checked us in and had us measure our bags which fit. So they are free. They still defended the first woman by claiming "she's following the rules. How? By ripping people off? They are horrible. Don't give them business.

### "some of the worst service I've experienced"
The entire experience flying with Frontier from Tampa to Philadelphia was pretty appalling. The flight to Florida had only one redeemable factor, that the flight attendant was an actual gentleman. The planes are outdated, dirty, have no wifi, do not have seats that recline and are poorly padded. They have no complimentary food or beverage either. Who charges for pretzels or coffee? The plane I am on right now is half empty and I am not allowed to move to the 3 adjacent aisles with the entire 6 seats empty in each row. Even though it's directly behind me. Not only was the attendant condescending and rude when I tried to move, he also went up to the intercom and made a speech about moving seats and looked at me with an eye roll. So unprofessional. I will never try to save the measley 20 bucks again. Some of the worst service I've experienced.

### "tacks on fees to anything possible"
Flew from MCO to RDU. Professes cheap flights but then tacks on fees to anything possible. Basically, when you book your Frontier flight plan on spending triple that when it comes time to check in 24 hours in advance. You have to pay to select your seat ($12-$45) and $40 for a carry on. I fly quite a bit and on every other airline I have flown (i.e. Southwest, Delta, American) a carry on is complimentary. When I purchased my Frontier flight a month ago I was so proud of myself. $86 round trip! I love Frontier. After all their extra fees I ended up spending $210 and that's with taking their "Perks Savings" option. Oh and then of course the flight was delayed by half an hour. No big deal, but they didn't even mention it. Not once did they apologize for that inconvenience. I almost forgot, they charge for water. It should be against aviation law not to provide a complimentary drink and snack on your flight. Maybe I'm just old school.

### "rude customer service rep"
Atlanta to Phoenix with Frontier Airlines. Made sure I was early and arrived 2 hours before the flight. Plane broke down with a 3 hour delay. Thank goodness for the airport bar. Rude customer service rep - been here since 9am and I haven't slept for 19 hours. They said they couldn't do anything for me or get my money back. Asked for a complimentary drink on the plane - they laughed at me.

### "never fly Frontier again"
We were flying from Salt Lake City to Detroit via Denver, got off the plane in Denver for an hour layover, then proceeded to board the same plane to continue to Detroit. After boarding the entire plane and making us sit there a good 45 minutes, they informed us that we had to deboard. They said there were mechanical issues and there was no time frame on the wait. Also the women working the counter were rude rather than helpful. Will never fly Frontier again.

### "Frontier is to be avoided by all means"
Flew from Las Vegas to San Francisco. The worst airline service I have experienced. My seat light did not work. The airline charges $40 for a piece of check-in luggage. If the luggage is over 50 lbs the company charges an extra $75. If you have a carry-on item to be stored in the overhead bin they charge $45. Any beverage other than plain water is charged for separately (juice, coffee, soda, anything). Frontier is to be avoided by all means.

### "I had missed my flight"
I decided to take a needed to trip to Michigan from Denver to see my family. I used my points because Frontier told me I was going to loose them. I had enough for a one way but not enough for a two way so I had to purchase the return flight. 20,000 points later plus $200 (flight back plus checked luggage plus paying for select seating as I am a big guy and need the stretch seating) later I had my flight. Leaving Denver when I finally got on the plane for my flight, because it seems that their flight crew is always late by a half hour, (except when you are running late then they are right on time) the seat I paid for was given away and I was forced to sit in the first row. I am 6'3" and I do not fit in the first row. Anyway the return flight was even worse. They had 2 people at the check in working, not enough by the time I was finally able to check my bags in. I had missed my flight. Charged yet another $100.00 to change it to the next day. Same time because well they only have one flight out and one flight in from Denver to Detroit and Detroit to Denver. Unless you like the feel of a race car seats, don't fly Frontier. I have to say that Frontier is not the worst airlines than any other by far. Fly Delta, heck fly Spirit, just stay away from Frontier.

### "horrible at resolving customer issues"
Atlanta to Denver with Frontier Airlines. Do not fly this airline. Horrible at resolving customer issues. Our flight was canceled, then the stanby flight was overbooked. We had to wait to leave the next day and pay for our own hotel and transportation to and from the airport. The offered flight vouchers to fly another time. When we tried to use the vouchers 5 months later they told us the vouchers expired and could not be extended on either voucher. So not only did they refuse to extend the vouchers they also would not give a refund from the earlier flights.

### "was cheaper flying on Delta"
This was the return leg of my trip to Las Vegas, and I was shocked by the $80 for my wife and myself to carry on a bag, $52 if I wanted to select an assigned seat. All of these came with the flight to Las Vegas with another airline. Including a drink of water. Apples to apples, it was cheaper flying on Delta. I'll remember that. I did look to cancel the flight before check in and re-book with another airline, but last minute booking is prohibitive. My conclusion: It is a decent experience if you travel without baggage, or carry-on, and you take something to drink with you. I began to wonder what else there would be an extra charge for? In the future I will add $62 to the cost of the ticket to compare to other airlines.

### "The Works package, well worth it"
Cincinnati to Denver. I've flown with Frontier several times, and every flight has been on time or early. They have the feel of "we're a growing airline, and we want to earn your business". I like their model of connecting medium / large cities, cheaper than the mainline airlines. I had to go to a funeral in Atlanta, which would have been well over $1000 on a mainline airline, but was $200 on Frontier. Without that fare, I would not have been able to go. That meant a lot to me. I bought a roundtrip ticket from CVG to Denver, and added The Works package. Well worth it, because I got a nice seat, checked luggage, changeable/refundable ticket, and it was still far cheaper than a mainline airline. Frontier's pun emails are hilarious. I honestly look forward to reading them. My favorite so far is, "Going on vacation? Alpaca my bags!

### "definitely go with a different airline"
Orlando to Denver. First time with Frontier and had nothing but bad comments from friends about this airline. I still decided to try because they were so much cheaper. Well, they're not. All our bags we were able to carry on as a personal item to Orlando. When we left Orlando with the same bags and same items in bag nothing less or nothing more in the bags, we were told the bags are not personal item and have to pay to bring them on the plane. $45 a piece x 4 bags. Next time I will definitely go with a different airline. No refreshments on planes unless you pay for them. Our flight it was $2.99 for a cup of soda.

### "no longer use that credit"
Milwaukee to Denver. Before flying with Frontier, I had heard some bad reviews from friends and family, but I'm always about giving the benefit of the doubt. When flying in July it was not my favorite flying experience, however, I'm an understanding person and let it go. When I had to cancel my flight, I was given a credit for my flight to use with Frontier. While I obviously would've just rather gotten the money back, I thought this would be a good opportunity to have an open mind and see how my flight in the future would be. There was very little communication about this and I was unclear of when this would expire. An exact date was not given, nor did it say which day that time frame started on. I have now been told that I can no longer use that credit. If I can't get my credit back, I do not plan on flying with Frontier again. I'm hoping that someone will pull through with some excellent customer service and offer me the chance to be able to book a flight through Frontier using my credit.

### "no problems with Frontier Airlines"
Philadelphia to Charlotte, and I had no problems flying with Frontier Airlines. Checking in was easy. The staff was courteous, informative and it was a smooth flight. Be sure to have a debit card because drinks and snacks cannot be purchased with cash. I will be flying with Frontier Airlines in the future.

### "flight was delayed 3 times"
By far the worst experience I have had at an airport. The customer service is incredibly bad. The line to check our bags was so long that it extended to another airlines station. Our flight was delayed 3 times but not one single employee could tell me why. I even called customer service after their staff told me that they don't know anything other than what's on their screen. After 25 minutes on the phone with customer service it was decided that they didn't know anything either. I am traveling with my wife and our 6 month old son. We were supposed to land in Chicago at 10 pm. We are now scheduled to be there at 3 am.

### "would rather have decent customer service"
Portland to Denver with Frontier Airlines. I was completely dissatisfied with the whole experience. In Denver, it took us 1.5 hours to just check our bag. There were only 6 customer service employees at baggage check. Then on our way back when we landed in Denver, we waited 1.5 hours again to pick up our bags. Nobody knew why our bags hadn't arrived at the carousel and they didn't seem to particularly care that we had waited so long. When I complained and asked for my money back for my bags, the woman I spoke with merely gave me the customer feedback phone number. I promptly called that number and wasted 10 minutes of my life trying to explain the situation to someone who hardly spoke English. She was completely unapologetic and said that there was nothing she could do and that Frontier only reimburses for lost baggage, not for 3 hours of my wasted life due to the incompetencies of Frontier and its employees. I will never fly Frontier again even though it tends to be the cheapest airline for me to fly. I would rather have decent customer service than a cheap flight.

### "there are no 'hidden' fees"
Milwaukee to Philadelphia with Frontier Airlines. Given all the extremely negative reviews I felt the need to share my experience. Frontier is a discount airline. There are no "hidden fees". They beat you over the head with all of their fees. Book your bags now for $25. If you book at airport it will be $50". How people are surprised by this I do not know. You can easily log into their website. Calculate the seat fees. Luggage Fees etc and then compare to other airlines. The plane was nice - I was shocked. Plane took off on time and landed early. Yay! So based on this one flight I would give them a 10/10. I would use them again if I ever needed to travel for cheap and wasn't on a strict timeline.

### "like gambling with a welcher"
Phoenix to Miami via Denver with Frontier Airlines (or at least that was the plan). I arrived at 5pm for my 7:40pm flight only to see that it was delayed to 11:45pm. Stood in line til 9:30pm to give them my baggage and get my boarding passes adjusted. I was informed that the flight from Denver to Miami was cancelled until the next day. There were around 100 people in line, getting extremely upset. They called over 4 police officers to ensure peace. After being told "nothing we can do", I was informed by another passenger that they were able to change their flight to Orlando instead of Denver and that Frontier was providing a shuttle from there to Miami. When asked why I wasn't informed of this option, the desk agent started making comments that no one told her that. I called home and informed my family that I was now going to Orlando and that I would be on a shuttle to Miami, they didn't trust that there would be a shuttle and that they would drive the 5 hours to Orlando to get me. Once I went thru security, headed to the gate, my ride went home to Tucson (a 2-hour drive). I sat at the gate till 11.30, until we we informed that we were now changing gates. We all moved to the new gate and waited. We were then told that the flight would now leave at 12:21. Since this change would mean I would possibly miss my flight to Orlando, I asked the representative if we would get there in time. He assured me that I would. The plane we were now assigned to landed and passengers got off. At approximately 12:25am, the same representative yelled out "this flight is now cancelled! He then had the nerve to say "You better hurry back downstairs so you arent last in line! Of course this caused a stampede of very unhappy customers. In between Frontier representatives at the gates and check in desks, we we given 4 different stories as to why the flights had all been cancelled, all geared to give Frontier plausible non-responsibility to its passengers! First, it was a "passenger was ill", then "the whole flight crew is sick", then "a passenger died" and finally "the pilot has flown too many hours". I called my family only to find out they were now 2 hours into a drive to Orlando to pick me up. Now they had a 2 hour drive back in a rainstorm, a 4 hour wasted drive in the middle of the night. My family in Tucson had just arrived back home when the flight was cancelled, but turned around and came back for me. By this time I had decided enough was enough and asked about a refund. I was forced to stand in yet another line for that since there was no way I would trust "just go online and put in a request". I was informed "it would take 5-7 days to get my refund". Another passenger said that all our luggage was piled up in several places in baggage claim. No representative informed us of this. When you got out of line to go search for your bag, you ended up back at end of the line again. I was still in line when my family returned from Tucson to get me. At 4:27am, everyone in line started getting emails from Frontier trying to bribe us with $200 credit for "our inconvenience". There were families with little babies, elderly people in wheelchairs etc, this was more than an inconvenience. I finally got my refund entered into their system. Ended up flying American Airlines, which cost me over $700 one way. Trying to fly Frontier is like gambling with a welcher. You have been warned.

### "money you save isn't worth it"
Detroit to San Francisco via Denver with Frontier Airlines. Held on the tarmac twice for over an hour, missed the last train because of that and had to take a $100 uber to get home. I will never fly Frontier again, save yourself the time and aggravation, the money you save isn't even remotely worth it.

### "we did not hear one announcement"
They seem to be extremely understaffed. I was flying from LA to Denver, boarding time originally was 10.35am, which was then delayed to 11.35, then 12.57. I understand that issues occur and flights need to be delayed sometimes, however we did not hear one announcement about our flight. We noticed on the departure board it had moved to 3.00pm, and then all of a sudden our flight was taken off the departure screen. Every single passenger was extremely confused, and nobody could find a Frontier employee in the terminal. Once 2pm rolled around, a large group of passengers had to go back to the check-in desk to find an employee. There were two employees who did not seem to care. When we demanded vouchers they did not provide them. I eventually demanded a refund and transfered to Southwest.

### "leave a lot to be desired"
I used to like flying frontier 4 years ago, used to fly into Denver quite often and the seats were comfortable. But my recent flight this month to Las Vegas was a nightmare. I blame the airline. Their new seats are nothing more than resin lawn chairs which won't recline with minimal padding. I upgraded on our return flight to reclineable seats but they were still uncomfortable. I will never fly them again. I have no problem paying for comfortable seats but even their upgrades leave a lot to be desired. They used to be good, but not anymore. I equate them with Ryanair over Europe who I will never fly. Sorry Frontier, but you have lost my business. The skimping on the seats have made them so uncomfortable that I would rather drive 24 hours to a destination than fly the hours on one of your flights.

### "they just don't care"
Charlotte to Philadelphia return. Frontier Airlines are a little cheaper but their customer service is terrible, both at the airports and on the phone. My flight to Charlotte was delayed 8 hours now my flight back to Philadelphia is delayed 4 hours. They will not put you on another carrier nor offer you any options. Worst part, they just don't care. The attitude is that there are other customers out there. Ask yourself what your time is worth and pay a little more for other airlines that reward your loyalty.

### "the flight time had changed"
Atlanta to Miami with Frontier Airlines. I booked this flight months ahead as part of a complex multi destination 3 week holiday in the USA. I arrived in Atlanta the night before the flight which was to connect me to my international flight to Madrid. I had allowed sufficient time in Miami to transfer terminals and complete the necessary security and passport clearances. When I went to check in online the night before the flight time had changed to an hour later, I had not been informed of this change. After an hour on the phone talking to two levels of management all that they offered was a credit note or to fly a day earlier. A credit note is useless to me as I live in France and departing a day earlier would mean an additional nights accomodation in Miami - they refused to refund my money despite not providing the service I had paid for.

### "nickle and dime you for every cent"
Las Vegas to Nashville with Frontier Airlines. My wife and I got tickets through Frontier because it was cheap. Well then we find out it cost $25 to check a bag and $30 to carry a bag on and prices double if you check bags at gate so you have to do it early online. As we are leaving I notice my bag fits in the personal bag category. I'm happy as can be and ask if I can get reimbursed my baggage fee. I was told no, Frontier makes you pay for everything and will not reimburse any fees already paid for baggage. They nickle and dime you for every cent. It's unreal. This is the one thing that set me off - I'm not even complaining about the fact that the people were rude and the plane was delayed on a perfectly sunny day with no weather anywhere in the continental US. We also had a 12 hour lay over which is fine. They are incredibly frustrating though. Don't fly with Frontier. The ticket may be cheap but by the time they are done with you you'll have paid more than if you just went with an airline that actually cares about you.

### "turn this vacation into a nightmare"
My husband and and I booked Frontier Airlines for our vacation trip. We did not know that Frontier would turn this vacation into a nightmare. We were supposed to fly out of Orlando at 10:45am when we arrived we found out it was delayed until 6pm that night. We decided to try and catch another flight out. After talking to several employees, we finally found someone who helped us get on another flight. She was probably the only good part of Frontier. Once we arrived to San Francisco we found out our bags were lost and they stated it should be with our original which arrived the next day at 2 in the morning. Well our bags never arrived. When we told the Frontier employee he filed a claim and stated that we would receive our bags by midnight and they would let us know when it arrived. We never heard from them so my husband called multiple Frontier employees and no one could tell us where our bags are. They refuse to refund our money or pay for our inconvenience.

### "refund outgoing flight but not return"
Minneapolis to Chicago with Frontier Airlines. My husband and I checked our flight on the way to the airport, signed up for notices and received none, and got to our flight gate to a cancelled flight, as did many other passengers. We were offered no other flight or transportation options, terrible customer service, no in-person representatives at all, and a refund on our outgoing flight but not the return flight. Awful experience.

### "no guarantee they will get you home"
Atlanta to Salt Lake City with Frontier Airlines. Customers should note that if you choose to accept the lower cost of flying with Frontier they do not make any guarantee they will get you home in a reasonable fashion. We boarded the plane in Atlanta, taxied, sat on the runway for about an hour and then returned to the gate. As soon as we were unloaded from the plane I began calling the Frontier customer service line (a outsourced call center) to try to make it known that my husband was expected to work the following day. I also spoke to the manager at the desk in Atlanta who told me that she would make a note on my account but that nothing could be done until the flight was canceled. By 7pm that night it was determined that the fuel gauge was not working and that the replacement part would not be in that night. Thus following, the flight was canceled. We were the first ones back in line at the reservation desk where we waited for another 45 minutes. We knew that there was a flight out on Delta that night around 10:30pm that we could get my husband on unfortunately, after waiting to speak to someone at the desk regarding rescheduling, we were simply handed a piece of paper with the options of canceling for a refund (leaving us stranded in Atlanta), calling a "customer service" line to reschedule (also a call center with limited authority) with a $400 voucher or wait for a Frontier flight to get home. As we spent the next 2 hours working through these options with the hundreds of other stranded customers, we found that through the Frontier customer service line, the flight on Delta that was advertised through Delta as a $687 would actually be jacked up in price and almost $1000/ticket. For our family of 6, this option would have cost us about $3600 out of pocket. Booking a flight out through another airline the next day would have still cost us about $2000 out of pocket (after already paying $1100 to Frontier) for a one way flight. As this was just not a reasonable thing to ask any family to do, we inquired about when Frontier could get us home. The soonest flight they could get us home on was Thursday - 4 days after the time we were scheduled to be home, resume work and schedules for our children. This would not be a reasonable solution for anyone. We spent the evening trying to be calm and work with what we have been given. We talked to the manager who called corporate and were once again told there was nothing to be done. I am shocked that Frontier is able to employ people to be the punching bag at the airports for all of the stranded passengers. I am shocked that when tensions rose 7 hours after we were scheduled to depart, airport police were called to be used as Frontiers "bouncers". I am shocked that the only customer service available to passengers is a call center with very limited authority. I am shocked that as you sit on endless hold with the customer service line, the hold message is prerecorded with static followed by a pause to make the caller think they have lost the signal and thus hang up.

### "service left much to be desired"
Denver to Atlanta and Atlanta to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Worst flying experience so far. Nearly all of my flights including connecting flights were delayed. My last flight arrived on time but there was a 2 hour delay due to them them not knowing which gate we would depart from and "cleaning the lavatories. Airport announcers were unprofessional, often laughing during their announcements concerning the delay. The seating was very uncomfortable. It would definitely be worth taking another airline in the future. The customer service left much to be desired.

### "lots of hidden charges"
Las Vegas to Salt Lake City with Frontier Airlines. I booked Frontier and nothing was mentioned about the carry on luggage fee. So here I'll warn you guys before taking this airline. Carry on is USD 40 and check in is USD 30. We were forced to pay and they told us to book direct since all other websites would not mention about the hidden charges. Staff are rude. Lots of hidden charges. Buyers beware.

### "this was a much different airline"
Cincinnati to San Diego. Get ready to pay extra for everything and deal with terrible customer service. My impression of Frontier went from 8/10 to 2/10 just from two separate flights. They were both the same - horrible. I was a huge Frontier fan and flew with them exclusively from the Cincinnati area to the west coast. Somewhere around 10 flights, but I haven't flown with them for 5 years. I was delighted to buy a cheap Frontier ticket. I used to love their chocolate chip cookies and personal TV in the headrest infront of you. I was looking forward to it. To my disappointment, this was a much different airline from 5 years ago. They replaced all the seats with uncomfortable and small seats (no TV). They charge extra for everything. You pay extra for carry on baggage ($30 at time of this review, and $60 if you forget and pay at the gate - price recently went up too). Extra for soda, snacks, coffee, and juice. Only water is complimentary. Oh and the ice. These à la carte type airlines really make you feel like they nickel and dime you. Plus we had really bad interactions with the stewardesses on both flights. One woman was rude to us on the first flight, and on the second flight two women were very rude to us. I would have looked past the poor customer service after the first flight, maybe she had a bad day. But both flights? Frontier should be ashamed.

### "a nickel and dime charge policy"
Denver to San Francisco. This was the last leg of a SFO-DEN return trip. The booking was for a 6:50pm departure. We left after 12AM. I explained that because they left so late, I would miss my airporter and could not catch another until 8:AM when the airporter resumes service. The airline reply was that since they did not cancel the flight I would get nothing but a $15 food voucher. I find this inexcusable and will not use Frontier again. Also as a tip, even though I gave myself 3 hours to catch my airporter, it wasn't enough to compensate for an inept organization. And lastly, they charged me $45 each way for a carry on luggage. Poor customer service and a nickel and dime charge policy.

### "rude customer service"
Rude customer service, from gate check to steward's to pilots. Returning home from Denver to NY, after delaying flight 4 hours and sitting in the airport for 6, they boarded the flight, left the gate and then cancelled the flight due to non-existent weather conditions. Wouldn't acknowledge that no other flight going to NY was even delayed due to weather, but they use the weather excuse so they don't have to accomodate people in hotels. At customer service, employees (and I use that term loosely) told most that the next flight out was in 4 days. When asked what one should do, sleep, food etc, customer service rep told them to stay at the airport. After receiving a partial refund and booking 3 one way tickets the next day on JetBlue, my tickets, taxis, food expenses were an additional $500. Airlines should be forced to show proof that delays/cancellation due to weather. Ran into someone the next day who had opted for a flight to Philadelphia, desperately looking for seats on another airline. He told me that Frontier was about to cancel the Philly flight as well and he needed to get home.

### "it was a fantastic experience"
Orlando to Atlanta. After reading the negative comments about Frontier, I was pretty nervous to give them a chance. I had to be in Atlanta last minute and they by far had the best fares. I'm a very nervous flyer and always choose airlines with the best ratings so this was definitely a first. Well needless to say, it was a fantastic experience and I will definitely fly them again. As long as you are prepared (as you should be) with extra fees, it's not a big deal. Also, you are allowed a pretty decent size purse for free. The seats are not bad. Granted my flight was not super long but they are in a semi reclined position and I dozed just fine. In my opinion, the seats are actually similar to some on AA and United flights as far as size and recline position. Yes, they don't cover the back of the seats with fabric and the trays are small but who really cares? I expected no legroom as I didn't upgrade and that was actually not a problem either. My legroom was the same as on my last AA flight. The flight attendants were just as nice as the ones on EVERY other airline I've flown, I didn't deal with the desk attendants directly. They came on at the same time as on every other airline clerk desk (a little prior to boarding). They seemed helpful and got a few last minute people on our flight who missed their last flight. You can bring snacks and drinks so you don't have to pay for them. I don't think the savings is worth complaining about pretzels and a small cup of soda. The pilots were great and more talkative during flight then I've ever experienced (which is fantastic when you are a nervous flyer). And finally, our flight was early arriving both going and returning.

### "did not do TSA pre check"
I travel round trip from Chicago to Denver 2 times a month and normally fly Southwest but last minute had to book a return trip and went with Frontier. Found out they did not do TSA pre check. I have always had a pleasureable experience with them especially their rates. But, I will not fly with them any more until they get TSA pre check. Both of these airports have long waiting lines through security and will book other airlines until they change their policy. What a shame.

### "the seats are poor"
San Fransisco to Denver with Frontier Airlines. I've flown Frontier 6 times this summer and every one of my flights have been delayed. When you finally arrive I have had to wait at least an hour for my bags. The seats are poor, they don't even recline. You are jammed up in a plane. The flight attendants are rude. This airline is the worst and I would choose Southwest or Delta in the future.

### "you get what you pay for"
Las Vegas to Columbus with Frontier Airlines. This was me and my husband's first time using Frontier. The savings will definitely lure you in however you will pay for it in other ways such as carry-on bags or drinks onboard. My biggest complaint is the delay we had due to them not having sufficient staff. They wouldn't give the full story but they were scrambling to find a replacement. This caused a domino effect and caused us to be delayed in the airport from 10pm until 1am. Secondly, the seats are so uncomfortable. I could usually do a 3 hour flight with no issues but you can't relax, the chairs are so stiff, the tray table is so tiny and the seats don't recline. You get what you pay for I suppose.

### "will never fly you again"
Worst airline by far and by comparison. The cheap flight ads are nothing more than bait. Frontier rarely departs on time. Claims weather. Fair weather in Austin - could the weather be any more perfect here in Denver. No, it cannot. Every 30 min flight boarding changes. On the hook, no options to rejoin family or friends. In three hours my departure time has changed 4 times. And Frontier Airlines asked me to be at airport 3 hrs early for domestic flight. Checked in within 7 min at counter and thru TSA  in 12. I will never fly you again.

### "lost all respect for this airline"
Denver to Indianapolis. For starters, this airline has the most inconvenient flight times. From Bozeman, Montana to Denver, there was only one flight all day, and it was at 8:59 in the evening, and the only flight to Indianapolis out of Denver was at 11:59 pm the next day. So we had to get a hotel in Denver ($200) just to wait for the flight back to IND. After killing time all day in Denver, while en route to the airport, only about 5 hours prior to our flight, I get a text notification stating that my flight had been cancelled and gave me a number to call to rebook, with no explanation as to why my flight was cancelled. I called the number, and after being on hold for 15 mins, I am told that the only other flight available was 2 days out, which was unacceptable. I had to go to work the next day, and am not able to sit and wait around for two days. I elected to cancel the flight, to which I was only offered a credit, not a full refund. We then had no choice but to book another Flight for the next day through another airline. This cost us $850! Not only that, but we had to get yet another hotel for the night, which was $130. We went to the Frontier service desk to see if we could get any sort of reimbursement. The line was super long and slow, and took us about half an hour of waiting. Once we spoke to the woman behind the counter, she told us she could book us for the next flight two days from now, and that she could give us a hotel voucher. Not wanting to wait until the last minute to book a hote on a Friday night and take the chance of being sold out, we had already booked a hotel. We informed her we had already booked one, and she basically said there was nothing she could do. I asked if I could get my money back instead of a credit, and i was told no. After this experience, I really hate to go back and use that $340 credit with this airline, yet I hate to waste $340, especially by just handing it over to this company. Any other legitimate airline company would have done more to work with those who had been stranded. This was extremely inconvenient, and I have lost all respect for this airline. Despite all the bad review, I gave them a shot. Guess I should've listened to the reviews. This "cheap" vacation ended up being over a thousand dollars more expensive than it intended to be just so we could get home on time!

### "not worth the savings"
Absolute joke of an airline. Flight from Houston to Denver, captain comes on and says we are third in line for take off. After about 15 minutes on the runway he comes on again and says there was some missing paperwork and we have to return to the gate. Then there isn't a gate open so we sit again. Then mysteriously he says the paperwork has been cleared up and we can go. Return flight from Denver to Houston. Once boarded we sat at the gate for over 30 minutes waiting on passengers from a connecting flight. I have never heard of a plane being held due to waiting on other passengers. I had a previous bad experience with them years ago and knew better. It's not worth the savings and it's not that cheaper to begin with!

### "seats are so uncomfortable"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Denver to Columbus. I an not a frequent flyer, so I eneded up paying $50 for a seat selection only to find out I could have let them assign my seat for free. (Did the online check-in) and then to charge $40 for my carry on I was not happy. This wasn't disclosed when I purchased my ticket. The seats are so uncomfortable and wouldn't recline, my back was hurting by the end of the flight. I will never book a flight on Frontier again.

### "sat on the taxiway for 40 minutes"
Los Angeles to Denver with Frontier Airlines. This is one of the worst flights I have been on. The flight had a delayed departure of about 40 minutes and then when we landed in Denver we sat on the taxiway for another 40 minutes because another plane in our gate was having maintenance issues. This wouldn't be such a problem if this was the first time this happened. When I flew to Denver from Dallas again the plane landed in Denver we sat on the taxiway for another 50 minutes. And to top it off the flight attendants on the flight from California were rude and terrible. They were sassy and unprofessional to multiple guests. This is absolutely unacceptable and I will probably never fly Frontier again. I will never recommend to a family member or friend. I would rather pay more money than be stuck on a Frontier airplane for an unreasonable time.

### "would not recommend this airline"
On my flight from Denver to Knoxville was delayed by almost 3 hours. Which is not my problem with this airline They lost my luggage on Saturday, July 30, 2016. After two hours of trying to to find someone to assist me and about 9 others, they said there was nothing they could do and we would not be able to get our luggage back until Monday and refused to send the bags on another airline. Monday night I received a call saying they would deliver my luggage to my house. By Tuesday morning it still was not there. I tried calling the number they gave me when I filed my lost luggage claim multiple times with no answer. Finally, got a hold of the lady that had called me monday night and she said she would have to get back to within an hour. 3 hours past and she never called back and would not answer my calls. Finally got my luggage back, but I would not recommend this airline to anyone. There is no customer support and terrible customer service. I'm usually pretty understanding, but this was absolute absurd. There was no effort on their part to help me or even try and reassure me that they would be willing to fix the issue at hand.

### "the worst airline I've flown"
Denver to Santa Ana. This is by far the worst airline I've flown! You are tricked into thinking you are getting a cheap flight but after you purchase you have to pay for your baggage to carry on or to check in and you have to pay for your seats otherwise they will split up your party. We flew out for the weekend for a wedding, on the way back we didn't add anything to our bag and yet we were over weight - for 3 lbs the girl at the counter was rude and snappy. On the way here they said they overbooked the flight and someone would have to stay back - who does that, don't overbook your flight in the hopes that someone will all of a sudden want to take a later flight and get a voucher to fly again.

### "worst airline you could fly"
Orlando to San Francisco. This is the worst airline you could fly! You will find nothing but terrible reviews as they hide their trashed system with cheap flights. There is not a single time you can board this plane without a flight being delayed for hours. The service is terrible and no one will give you a straight answer on why this happens every time. The seats are very uncomfortable and they will find a way to charge you for absolutley anything, even if you ask for a small cup of water they'll give you a bottle and then charge you $4 for it.

### "worst airline experience ever"
Chicago to Nashville. Will never fly Frontier again. $60 to carry on luggage to Nashville. $45 to carry on to Chicago. The cost of luggage ended up costing as much as my flight. There was absolutely no benefit to flying Frontier. The staff on and off the plane were very rude. They did not answer questions about flight delay. Just told me to wait and watch the board. Cannot find any flight updates on line. Worst airline experience ever. This airline does not even deserve a 1 star.

### "from good to bad to worst"
San Francisco to Denver. Each experience with Frontier Airlines is worse than the one before it. On the last route, my flight was delayed (for no apparent reason such as weather or airport conditions) for over four hours. I tried to call customer service, but their phone tree is obviously designed to discourage an interpersonal interaction. While waiting at the gate, there were further delays and no communication offered as to when we could count on flying. A decade ago, I flew Frontier almost exclusively. Now, they have become THE airline to avoid. With pricing that isn't even undercutting the competition, uncomfortable cabins, useless points, no beverages, and ridiculously expensive fees for even carry-ons, I'm sad to see this Colorado business turn from good to bad to worst (no typo there).

### "bad customer service"
Minneapolis to Denver with Frontier Airlines. Waited 2 hours for my luggage. Along with the rest of the plane. And they charge us to travel with luggage. Terrible experience. Missing two hours of time I could have been visiting my daughter. They had no answers other than some people have been waiting days for their luggage. Bad customer service.

### "great experience"
Great experience flying on Frontier from Cincinnati to Las Vegas. I paid the extra for the roomier seats and knew the carry on was more expensive than checked bag, so I put everything in checked and saved money by not taking a carry-on. The check in personnel were very polite as were the gate crew and flight crew. Flight was on time both ways. I bought my own drink and snacks so didn't have to worry about buying food on the plane. All prices are disclosed when you book, so plan accordingly. I do miss the TV's that they used to have. And all seats have shrunk on all transportation anymore, unfortunately. Will definitely fly with them again.

### "big mistake to fly Frontier"
It was a big mistake to fly Frontier Airlines from Chicago to Seattle. Not only do you not save money after paying all the extra charges. No free bags, not even a carry-on - they cost $40, or $60 at the ticket counter if not prepaid. $35 for checked bag prepaid, plus extra to sit together and not even a free beverage or snack, the seats don't recline. And it was too close to the seat in front to put your head down if you're even if of average height. It was extremely uncomfortable. Never again will we fly Frontier Airlines.

### "an additional $40 for my carry on"
Chicago to0 Salt Lake City. It is ridiculous to be charged for a carry on bag. I paid to check my large bag and had to pay an additional $40 for my carry on. I have never been charged for a carry on before. I didn't have a personal item and my carry on was too large to be considered a personal item. The woman who checked me in at the counter was nice but the woman next to her was very rude and refused to help us. We were next in line so we approached the counter and she refused to help anyone from our line. She took a different customer from a separate line with no explanation. The third woman at the counter helped the people who were behind me in line. It was very obvious that we were next but could not get help. I have flown with frontier several times in the past and have not had any problems. I would prefer to pay a little more and not have any surprises when I check in and be treated with respect.

### "the worst customer service"
My flight from Missoula, MT to Denver, CO was delayed by 2.5 hours on July 22nd which would have made me miss my connecting flight to Raleigh, NC. I rebooked for the 23rd and the same thing happened. When I called to figure out my options, customer service told me to go to the airport and discuss it with the agent at the check in desk. The agent at the desk told me flat out I had no options but to wait for the next available flight out of Denver (which was 24 hours later) and was completely unhelpful in helping me find another city out of Denver that could maybe connect me to Raleigh. I was told I was not eligible for food or hotel vouchers in Denver because the delay was weather related. The agent then told me to call customer service so they just gave me the complete run around and each passed the buck on to the other. No one at Frontier actually had the power or interest in helping me. The soonest I could get to Raleigh was July 25th - four days after my initial departure/arrival date. They could not book me another ticket on another airline because they don't partner with anyone. Frontier exhibited the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. I will never fly Frontier again. Thankfully I bought insurance so I was fully refunded for my flight and I rebooked on Delta, though at a very high cost. These delays cost me and my loved ones hundreds of dollars and days of wasted time.

### "there was no information"
Flew from Salt Lake City to Denver This is the worst airline I have ever flown on and will never do it again. They airplane was extremely late to the gate, which is understandable at times, however, there was 0 transparency about what was happening and why. The staff member at the front gate lied about when the airplane was going to be leaving to tempararily calm the crowd. There was no information about tentative departure time at the gate and continued to say "on time," while 4 hours late. I usually will save money and go with the cheapest flight even with bad reviews but I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "a wonderful experience"
Nashville to San Diego via Denver with Frontier. After reading the number of negative reviews prior to my flight, I was concerned about my booking. The reality, I had a wonderful experience. It is true that you pay for baggage and seat assignment, but that is advertised upfront prior to purchase of ticket, so a traveler should not hold that against the company, because it was not a hidden cost. The only negative I saw was that they did not have a representative to check baggage before 2 hours of the flight, but again, to lower the cost of airfare, they cut the cost of staffing during those times. I like getting to airports early, but that again is not a fault of the airline. Once the line opened to check baggage, it was quick. My flights were on time for the most part. Departure was a little late leaving Nashville, but was not the fault of Frontier. We arrived on time in Denver and my connecting flight to San Diego was also on time.

### "cheap and their flights are on-time"
I will give Frontier two things based on my recent flight. First, they are cheap and their flights are on-time. Outside of that, everything is downhill from there. I was traveling with my two small children. If I wanted to sit with them, I had to pay extra per seat to select my seat. When dropping off your bags, the staff were rude. Even though you are paying to check bags, they treat you like you are an inconvenience for them. The thing is, it's actually cheaper to check bags than it is to carry bags on the plane! I understand giving really cheap seats and charging people for everything; however, it doesn't make sense to make it cheaper to check bags. Once on the plane, their prices are reasonable for food and drinks. You can get alcohol for cheaper than most domestic flights. The seats don't recline, they have almost no padding, the armrest is tiny, and the tray is about the size of an adult hand. The flight itself was okay. The ride was smooth and the staff on the plane was friendly enough. I feel that maybe Frontier doesn't get gate priority from airports and you should be ready to wait for a gate when you land. When returning home, we waited on the runway nearly an hour. Getting my luggage was pretty easy and fast once I was off the plane. If looking for a cheap flight where you get charged for everything, go with this option. If you want comfort, then don't. I did find out though that it's better to book your flight with Frontier directly and pay for the "Everything" package. I guess you get first shot at seats in the front of the plan and everything is included at only $50 more per ticket. These seats are more like actual airplane seats, not really first class.

### "pay to take a small carry on"
Cincinnati to Las Vegas and my first and last time with Frontier Airlines. I had to pay to take a small carry on with me. When you travel for 10 days and have a small kid, of course you need clothes. I had to pay $40 to go and $40 to come back. That was almost more than my ticket. Then when you go into the airplane the seats are uncomfortable. Then for a 4 hour flight they don't give you anything. Well if you ask for water they will give it to you. Everything has become money. Pay to fly, pay to take clothes, pay to eat or drink.

### "no more Frontier for me"
Flew from Las Vegas to St Louis. I must admit Frontier had the best prices, but after paying for luggage even a carry on and the extremely uncomfortable seats I will fly another carrier. I am average size and also a runner in great shape and if the seats are miserable to me I can't imagine the average Joe liking them either. Whoever designed those seats has surely never sat in them. I guess the only positive is those plastic hard seats breed less germs than fabric but after trying to sleep in a non reclining plastic chair on a red eye flight I'd rather have a few germs on a comfy fabric seat. Unless the flight is an hour or less no more Frontier for me.

### "gate staff were very abrasive"
Philadelphia to New Orleans with Frontier Airlines. Arrived to the airport, under the impression that I'd be allowed to carry on an item as a personal bag. This was not the case. I was charged a fee, which I paid online to avoid the gate cost. The attendant at baggage check told me that any bags (except a purse) must be checked in or registered as a carry on, both of which require a fee. Sitting in the terminal, the gate staff were very abrasive to those at the gate waiting (no one in particular), demanding that we all "be quiet while she made announcements. The plane has been sitting at the gate since I arrived two hours early, yet the flight is now delayed an hour (as far as we know at the moment) for maintenance, despite us being informed that we'd be allowed to board. We were informed at the time of the flights scheduled departure that we would be delayed and "that we should stay in the general gate area because anything can happen at anytime. Except for my return flight home, never again with this airline.

### "never on time for anything"
Denver to Memphis with Frontier Airlines. Terrible experience - not only was our flight delayed there was no scheduled time of arrival so I could not inform my pick-up when I would arrive. Very frustrating considering we had to arrive at the airport 2-3 hours prior for TSA delays. Even my returning flight was ridiculous. We left on time but we arrived 30 min prior to our landing time. The plane ahead of us was still at the gate but didn't leave for another 1.5 hours. So sitting on the plane for that long is just absurd. No explanation once again to the passengers and the pilot just kept saying 5 more minutes. My only compensation was some water. This airline is consistently terrible. Always delayed, never on time for anything.

### "is the pits of the pits"
Frontier Airlines is the pits of the pits. First flight from Charlotte to Denver was the first disaster. Boarded and ready to go and told 4 times we had to wait because proper paperwork couldn't be found. Finally they just told us to get off. 90 minutes later the paperwork was found and we were told to reboard. Nearly everyone missed their connections. Then Denver to Portland was late departure and late arrival. As I type I'm sitting on the return flight from Portland to Denver. The fare went from $385 to $520 with all the nickel and diming. Bag fees, and seat fees.

### "professional, courteous and fun"
Return leg of my journey. Austin to Chicago flight boarded early, efficient boarding and loaded with in 15 minutes. Flight was full, discount fares do help. Departed the gate early. Flight crew was very professional, courteous and fun. Offerings were at a cost, but that is expected. Flight arrived Chicago about 35 mins early. Always a bonus. Seat comfortable and leg room great. If you have the time and might have to leave the next day, give them a shot. If not, you might want to stick with a legacy carrier, at a higher cost.

### "it was what they advertised"
We are all aware that Frontier is a no-frills airline offering discounted travel to many US destinations. In a recent search of flights between Chicago and Austin, TX, Frontier's fare blew away the competition. However, with that said, Frontier has a lot of add-ons. Bag on board $30+, Seat Selection $20+, Checked Bag $30+, Drinks on board $1.99 + (even Water and Coffee). Alas this is their mantra. With knowing that I still purchased the fare, added on their "Works" option - Free Carry On, Free Checked Bag, Choice of extra leg room seat, Zone 1 Boarding and ability to change or ask for a refund without penalty! Why not. Flight was full, boarding was quick and easy and the flight left the gate early, as well as arrived early in Austin by 1/2 hour. Seat was comfortable, attendants were very warm and nice and if you wanted anything to consume or eat, you had to pay. All in all, it was what they advertised.

### "When did we start tipping flight attendants?"
San Francisco to Denver with Frontier Airlines. We arrived at San Francisco airport at 2:50PM for a 5:20PM flight wanting to relax after a few days of touring colleges. My son and I had to wait in line until employees showed up at 3:40pm to check us in. That was only the beginning. When we arrived in Denver 7 minutes early, we proceeded to baggage claim for the 1 small bag we checked. We had to wait for 1 hour and 5 minutes. I walked into the baggage loss dept of Frontier to find 4 women sitting behind computers all on there personal phones, not one of them looked up when I asked what was the hold up on bags? While ordering some snacks and a drink, the flight attendant asked me to tip her with what I felt comfortable with. Well that was easy, I had to walk to the back of plane to get my order as the 2 staff were in a lengthy discussion. When did we start tipping flight attendants for doing their job? I hit the no tipping button and this will conclude my future flights with this airlines. They nickel and dime you to death and are proud of it.

### "refused to compensate me"
Seattle, WA to Milwaukie via Denver. Frontier cancelled the flight, and offered the next available flight which was two days later. I had to purchase a ticket on a different carrier and Frontier refused to compensate me for the extra dollar amount I had to pay. Frontier never gave me notice that the flight was canceled. Frontier Airlines' lack of quality customer service and their failure to notify me of the cancellation resulted in me having to spend an extra $344.60 out of pocket and having to spend the night in the Seattle airport, as well as arrive late to an important family function.

### "courteous and attentive"
I would definitely fly Frontier again, our flight from Raleigh Durham to Philadelphia departed on time. I paid extra for the front seats with extra legroom which was worth it and pretty comfortable. The aircraft was very clean and new, the staff were courteous and attentive, that goes for counter staff and flight attendants. I did look into other carriers and with paying for upgrades Frontier still came in cheaper. I understand that they are an ultra low cost carrier and paying for extras and upgrades is to be expected. If people would just do some simple research before they book they would understand how their booking process works.

### "still here after 12 hours"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Orlando to Las Vegas. The worst airline I have been on. We got to the gate on time, boarded, and then were told to get off because there was a flight to Minnesota that had to go out, this was at 10am when the flight was supposed to leave. So we got off and were told that it was going to be a while because they were waiting on a part to fix the plane, 7 hours later and we board again and started to taxi, then were told that we had to get off and our flight was canceled. I am still here after 12 hours with no flight.

### "waited over an hour to get off the plane"
Chicago to Denver with Frontier Airlines. We waited over an hour to get off the plane in Denver on the first flight. We just flew back to Chicago and have sat for an hour again. Will never fly Frontier again. They blame it on being short staffed. Both flights delayed - supposed to be 1:55pm but both have been closer to 3:30pm.

### "subpar customer service"
The booking process was horrible. I checked in for my flight opting into the "text" option for notifications. I reached the airport believing my flight was still on time. Reached the gate, told it was delayed by 8 hours. Additionally, the agents could do nothing and offered me a photocopied, rough cut square of paper with a number on it I could call. I was flying out for a wedding and now I was going to spend one of my hard-earned days in MCO airport. I paid almost $500 for this flight, then found out it would be almost $80 to take anything other than a "personal item" i.e. purse and another $16 if I wanted to be able to not sit in a middle seat. I waited on hold for the number given for 15 minutes only to be disconnected. Called back and waited another 20 before I reached a human being. Said human being then told me that they were not even sure if that flight would go out and that it could fly earlier or later, just depended. They overbooked the other flight by 6 people and standby was not an option. Then they offered me a refund to get another flight but said refund would take up to 48 hours. Next, "well we could get you to St. Louis and catch the connector there but we already overbooked that one by three people so you would probably just be stuck in St. Louis. I waited for another 30 minutes at the ticket line to be told that they were [half-heartedly] sorry and there was just really nothing they could do. Perhaps a $100 voucher? Calculating what I had paid for hotels, lost in work pay, in canceled appointments at my destination and a round-trip cab fare and they offered me a $100 voucher and subpar customer service, makes this easily the word travel experience I have had.

### "they are awful"
Flew Frontier Airlines from Los Angeles to Cleveland. After having to pay for a seat and to check my baggage, I prefer carry on but checked was less expensive and figured it would be fine. Anyway, checked in at hotel then arrived at LAX 2.25 hours before the flight, no one was at the ticket counter to check baggage or check customers in. Others in line called customer service and as the sign said the counter opens 2 hours before boarding. I don't like checking my baggage because I don't like dealing with any additional line, TSA is enough. Then we get to the gate the same counter attendants are the gate attendants. We could not hear them over the at all during the boarding process. It was terrible. I had experienced the seats etc on my flight out. Just plain unbelievable as in the picture unless you pay for a 'real' tray table you don't even get one of those seriously. In the end I think I paid more for this budget flight then I would have for an airline I usually travel. Don't get sucked in, they are awful you will pay for extras and it will cost $100 more than their advertised fare.

### "you get what you pay for"
I flew from Las Vegas to Austin, Texas on April 23 of this year with Frontier Airlines. The initial fare was quite low, however with the add-ons the total cost came out about the same as American, but I would have to stop and or change planes in either Phoenix or Dallas Fort Worth as well as leaving early in the morning. The timing was what I liked about this flight and it was also cheaper than Southwest. The fare, the charge for a carry on and a checked bag and the additional fee to choose a nicer seat was all fine with me. The cabin was clean and looked fairly new and the inflight service was fine. The lead flight attendant was snappish at first but she settled down after a while and asked if I would move to the bulkhead so that an ill passenger in the back could move to my seat and have a row of three so he could lay down. This same passenger passed out at the boarding gate and EMT's came to the gate, sorted him out and allowed him to fly. I purchased 2 vodkas, a can of Bloody Mary mix, a tube of Pringles chips and I think water which was totaled on the flight attendant's tablet and when I went to sign was surprised to notice a box asking if I wanted to leave a tip for the attendant-this was a surprise to me and I declined. All in all it was what it was-air travel in the 21st century-and the old adage "You get what you pay for" applied to this flight.

### "they are awful"
Flew from Cincinnati to San Francisco. My regret is that I purchased Frontier tickets for yet another trip this fall before we had experienced Frontier's new seats. They are awful. There is no way to sleep in them, and the annoying tray tables all keep falling down anytime the plane jerks with the most annoying "chung-a-chung-a-chung" noise. I will pay more to a different airline for better seats (I will not pay Frontier an upcharge to sit in the two rows that have reclining seats - by the time you pay for those on all legs of a flight - if they are even available - I could have paid for seats on a "full-service" airline).﻿

### "first and last trip"
This was my first and last trip with Frontier Airlines from Orlando to Charlotte. The add-ons were annoying but the price was a few dollars less than the same flight on Allegiant. With the add-ons the price approached the cost of a premium airline for the same route. Although the seats are not very comfortable on the plane, in fact, downright thin, I thought that since it was a non-stop, short flight I would be okay. The flight was not bad. What I did not know before departure was that the airline does not record or use Pre-Check or Global Entry. I have both but I had to go through the regular security process on boarding at both very busy airlines. Is it worth the extra $15-20. to fly a premier airline? For me it is. Never again will I fly Frontier.

### "still sitting at the airport"
My boyfriend was scheduled to fly out this morning from Houston to San Francisco with Frontier Airlines. The flight was scheduled to take off at 7:30am and he arrived 2 hours ahead of time. It is now 6.30pm and he is still sitting at the airport in Houston. After sitting, waiting and boarding, he was told that there would be a delay and everyone had to deboard the aircraft. The passengers were then told that the pilot had to do an inspection of aircraft's exterior. Hours later they were told that it would be after 5pm before a "part" would be flown in from Denver. At this point, they were offered vouchers for a free trip. Hours later they they had fixed the problem and everyone boarded - again. Plane prepared for take off and the next thing you know, they are deboarding the passengers again. No flight out to San Francisco until Thursday. We will not be flying with this airline ever again.

### "horrible flight conditions"
Orlando to Minneapolis with Frontier Airlines. Good customer service, mediocre mobile site navigation, horrible flight conditions. Small, hard seats, temp in cabin frigid for all 3 hrs of flight (in spite of attendant turning it up). They have mastered cheap, and nickel and dime the passenger to death. I will have to be desperate if I ever have to choose to fly with this awful airline again. The announcing attendant really should know where we're landing, too. She said "Welcome to Dulles National Airport," and corrected it to "Minneapolis -St. Paul", after a co-worker clued her in. And charging for carryon bags is poor, but I believe Frontier isn't the only one that does it.

### "very friendly staff"
Milwaukee to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Very friendly staff, very personal, quick boarding. The extended seating fit my husband who is 6'4". Both trips back and forth to Las Vegas were quiet and relaxing, no issues at all. The flight was actually early to both destinations which was amazing to us.

### "will recommend Frontier"
Salt Lake City to Denver. I had an amazing experience with Frontier Airlines. I am military and was able to change my flight at last minute notice and the supervisor, check in attendants, and flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. I will recommend Frontier to friends and family.

### "disappointing customer service"
I don't have any qualms about the flight or Frontier Airlines itself. It's inexpensive and you get what you pay for. I only had an issue with the customer service. I left my iPad on the plane. I know that's on me. But I realized it while I was still in the airport. I was on a shuttle to the rental car and tried to contact a Frontier Rep to check the plane. I was diverted over and over to their lost and found form. I filled it out hoping they'd find it and I'd get it back, but I never heard from them again. I'd expect an email saying "we're looking" at least. I never recovered my iPad, which is frustrating, but I don't put that on the airlines. Perhaps the stewardess didn't see it sitting on my seat and another passenger snatched it up. I'm just really disappointed with the customer service.

### "worst customer service"
Milwaukee to Orlando. I will say that the crew on the aircraft was wonderful. Unfortunately, I can say the exact opposite about the frontier person that came to get me from the plane with the wheelchair. First there was no wheelchair waiting when I was told there would be one for me. Second, the woman took me down the tunnel and left me sitting at the frontier counter. She was complaining about her job under her breath. She had told me she would get someone to help me. After about five minutes, my traveling companion with her arms full of baggage, asked three employees standing or sitting at the desk doing absolutely nothing, ask them for help. They said oh she's over there. We can't leave the desk. Even though none of them look like they knew what work even was, they were too busy to help. After almost 15 minutes, I asked my friend to get my Walker. I was in severe pain from walking an extended period of time which was not recommended by my doctor. This company does not care about their passengers, only the bottom line. I called to talk to customer service. They were willing to upgrade my ticket to First Class, but not my safety traveling companion. If I were to have a seizure or other medical emergency, no one In First Class would know how to help. The supervisor at Frontier customer service did not care. Even though my friend was inconvenienced by being stranded with me in a wheelchair. Worst customer service ever!

### "no flight available for three days"
I was on the same Frontier Airlines flight as J Cramer on 26th March 2016. Here are some of my reactions to what happened: The airline already had cancelled the flight per several websites, but not their own, before we boarded the plane. Why passengers were made to sit on a plane for over an hour was a waste of time that could have been used to start rebooking a way home. We were told as passengers by an agent on the plane that we would get $200 flight vouchers and they would be sent to our emails automatically. When I didn't get one after a few days, I emailed Frontier, who replied that due to 'weather cancellation', I was entitled to no credit. Most frustrating part is the plane we were on, and removed from, had to be sent someplace else. No flight was available for three days, yet the airline had an empty place just sitting there. Customer service agents are very young and poorly trained. They showed no concern that their company's action would cause people to be out of town for Easter weekend. I have seen comments from people saying that they had no problems with Frontier and for that I am glad. It is not a good company to deal with when there are problems.

### "seats are extremely uncomfortable"
Booked a vacation through Cheap Caribbean and it included round trip flights with Frontier Airlines from Philadelphia, PA to Montego Bay, Jamaica. Checking in online the day before was horrible. Cheap Caribbean did not give me a "reservation code" for the flight. Even though I had booked months prior, Frontier's site showed the available seats for the flight with a price on each one, starting at an extra $16 per seat. The website explained that by paying additional money to choose seats was the only way they could guarantee seats together. What a scam and rip-off. I opted to not pay additional money and on the next screen it showed I had two seats together. Next I had to choose if I was bringing carry-on or checked luggage, all of which had ridiculous fees. Ended up paying $70 for two checked bags for the flight there and $60 for two checked bags on the return flight. In addition to all the extra fees and hassles with checking in, the flights and service continued to get worse. The seats do not recline at all. The seat base and seat back are molded together as one piece. They are rock hard, and looked like a cheap plastic resin chair and then it was covered only on the top side with a pleather like material. These seats are extremely uncomfortable, especially since my flights were over three hours each way. Once in the air, they offer their "beverage service for purchase", another lousy service. Yes, even for a can of soda they charge you $1.99 What a lousy airline. On my return flight, there were some open seats. They announced that if anyone wanted to move to a slightly larger seat at the exits over the wings, they would move them for a $50 fee. I will never fly with them again.

### "I will not fly Frontier again"
Las Vegas to Lambert St Louis. My experience with Frontier was displeasing from the moment I started my check in process. The machine my boyfriend and I checked in on told us that we would have to pay $16 per seat in order to get seats next to each other so we paid $32 total to sit together. We were traveling with two friends who decided not to pay $16 and be assigned random seats. However, they were seated right next to each other anyways. So we paid $32 for something that our friends got for free. The next screen told us that we would be charged $30 for each checked bag (which we expected) and $40 for each carry-on bag - $40 for a carry on. I have never flown on an airline where I am charged for a carry on bag and certainly not one where it is more expensive to carry a bag on than check one. After we paid for this I went to the counter to ask the employee if all of those charges were valid. Not only was she unsure of the cost of a carry on bag but she was trying very hard to avoid all of my questions and check my bag and get me out of the line. She then told me that I could have just combined my purse and my backpack to make one personal item and I could have avoided the carry on fee all together. So I said OK and asked her to refund me for the $40 I had just paid for the carry on, to which she replied that she couldn't do refunds and gave me an 800 number to call. She told me to call before I boarded my flight and that she was making a note in my reservation. I called the number and chose the "baggage" option which routed me to an office that closes at 4 and immediately hung up on me as I was calling at 4:15. I called another number that was on the sheet and they informed me that the office never closes and I needed to just keep calling. (Ridiculous). I called again and just chose a random option so that I could be routed to a representative. This representative told me that I could not call about this before my flight and that I would have to call the next day, directly contradicting the employee at the airport. So I called again today and got another representative who said that they would not be able to offer me a refund as the employee at the airport did not make a note in my reservation. I told him that the employee specifically told me that she was making a note on my reservation. At this point he asked me for my call-back number in case my call got disconnected and then put me on hold for 10 minutes to "check my reservation". Finally he came back and said that he would process my $40 refund which is about the only good thing that came out of the whole situation. Not only was I infuriated at all of the extra charges but the flight was extremely turbulent and the lights on the plane kept turning on and off which is very frightening and not once did the flight attendants or the pilot make any kind of reassuring announcements to inform us of the situation other than to "ensure we had our seat belts on". There was no explanation. I did however get a good laugh when we started to descend as the flight attendant said over the intercom "please make sure you seats are in an upright and locked position" because our seats didn't even have an option to recline. I do understand that Frontier offers cheaper flights and that is the sole reason why my friends and I decided to book this flight. However, we ended up paying about as much as any other airline after all the baggage fees and seating fees that are charged when you check in. I will not fly Frontier again.

### "I got the best deal around"
I have flown Frontier Airlines 4 times this winter between Cleveland, Ohio and Tampa, Florida. Every time it has left on time and arrived early. In January, I actually flew for 15 dollars each way non stop! I have high regards for this airline so far! I did not check any bags or pick a seat so I got the best deal around!

### "I will fly Frontier again"
I was concerned about flying Frontier when I read all the negative reviews, but I had no issues with them at all. My first flight arrived 50 minutes early, and my flight home was on time. I got to pick my own seats so I chose expanded leg room and I was very comfortable. Face it, no airlines offer much more room than the others. I had to pay to check my bag and for snacks on the plane but I have to say my experience was great and I will fly Frontier again.

### "I would rather drive"
Philadelphia to Fort Myers. I would rather drive to Florida next year then use Frontier! My plane was delayed 5 hours for no reason other then the crew was tired. Really? Have a back up crew! And don't tell people that! I knew everything was extra, which is annoying but it is what it is. However what was even more annoying was that the ticket counter was not open until 3pm (when I had a 5:30 flight) I had gotten to the airport early thinking I could check in get through security, eat, do some work and relax. But nope you have to just stand there waiting until someone comes to the ticket counter and then run up to security and just feel used. Please, pay more and fly with someone else!

### "never fly again with Frontier"
I was traveling from San Francisco to Washington DC to attend my cousins wedding. Flight was delayed originally for 1 hour that ended up being a 3.5 hours delay, that caused 25 people including me to miss their connecting flight in Denver. The flight in Denver didn't wait for 30 minutes for 25 people, yet Frontier delayed the flight in San Francisco for 3.5 hours due to bad weather! Upon arrival in Denver with the connecting flight gone, the Frontier airlines customer service desk was crowded by 100's of other travelers who had a similar issue or cancelled flights. Their customer service people were the rudest and clueless as ever. People were told to wait at the Denver airport for 3-4 days until next confirmed seats on a flight is available again. Long story short I had to ask for a refund for the missed flight since it was their fault, and ended up purchasing a one way ticket to DC with United airlines for a ridiculous $520; since Frontier Airlines was only offering a "Partial Refund", or, "We can put you on a flight back to your original departure destination". Horrible and miserable experience in my case and I'm sure other fellow travelers won't disagree. I've promised myself to never fly again with Frontier Airlines; and will urge other fellow travelers to do the same.

### "unprofessional customer service"
Philadelphia to Montego Bay. Frontier Airlines in Philadelphia was the only airline with lines outside, complete chaos. No directions from anyone. We stood in line for Montego Bay but somehow ended up at the Cancun counter. Rude, offensive, and unprofessional customer service makes the start to your vacation experience awful. They should never be allowed to serve people. We had to stand in line again and almost missed the flight because (according to them) we stood in the wrong line for 45 min and they would not check us in. From what they said there were signs for different flights but outside, where we started, there was only one long line and nobody knew where to go. Awful - pay little more and keep your dignity when you go on vacation.

### "nickel and dime you to death"
Started off their terrible customer service by informing us that our Tampa to Cleveland flight would be delayed for 5 hours due to "Mechanical Problems" and then proceeded to delay hourly for another 2.5 hours until they announced that despite our flight being 8 hours delayed, they didn't have the foresight to plan ahead for a crew member who had gone past their hours or "timed out". They then tell us that a flight attendant is on their way (lie) and then finally tell us that a new plane and crew would not arrive until 8:30 pm. We choose Frontier thinking it would be cost effective but they nickel and dime you to death.

### "spend extra, fly someone else"
Frontier Airlines has the worst customer service I have had with an airline! We we delayed an hour from Orlando to Omaha and once we boarded the plane we waited another hour for them to tell us it was cancelled. The crew told us we would be refunded, and give us hotel vouchers. Once we got off the plane and stood in line for another hour for them to tell us "sorry there is nothing we can do. Call this 800 number. On the phone for over an hour with their customer service, to be told they weren't gonna refund me but give me $200 credit back to fly them again. We ended up buying tickets with Delta to fly home the next day at $320 each and Frontier "won't cover that. Lost a lot of money and a whole lot of time. Spend the extra money and fly someone else!

### "tired and ripped off by end of it"
Frontier Airlines from Seattle to Miami via Denver. Second time flying. The first time had 12+ hour overnight layovers in Denver, and after messing up my return date on paper (causing me to have to buy another bus ticket) they refused to reimburse me for the price of my bus ticket (I live in Canada and have to take a bus to Seattle) the flights were on time the first time around, however buying the tickets you have to dodge charges left and right (even for carry on or picking your seat!). The seats are small cramped and do not recline. There's not even first class. They charge for all snacks and beverages. The second experience (right now) I had to spend the night in Seattle so I could catch my flight in the morning, arrived in Denver at 3pm (late) and my flight was supposed to leave at 11:15 but now it's leaving at 2:45am because the flight staff is flying in from Orlando. It's a horrid inconvenient mess. On top of that the Frontier Airlines flight to can in next to our gate was announced to be cancelled twice (ouch) just to be not cancelled because the staff misread the paper and was looking at an earlier flight. Overall very unprofessional and you just feel awful and tired and ripped off by the end of it.

### "Horrible customer service"
My Orlando to Trenton flight with Frontier Airlines got canceled and I received no type of notification besides an email. Luckily I check my email every morning or else I would have went to the airport in preparation for my flight. For an issue this drastic, such as a flight cancelation, I should receive a text or a call notifying that I need to get a new flight. I called the morning of and was on hold for almost 2 hours waiting to talk to an agent about what I should do about my flight cancelation. Horrible customer service.

### "fees add up so not so cheap"
You get what you pay for! First time on this budget airline from Vegas to Orlando, and apart from the return, never again. Only took it as it was the only direct flight. Looks cheap but fees add up so not so cheap. Took the stretch option with bags. Limited check in staff, long lines. Gates and baggage claim are at the extremities. No TSA Pre check, apparently not approved. Seats are hard and don't recline, even in row 2 stretch. 4 hour flight and no inflight entertainment or wifi. 2 points for on-time.

### "absolutely never again"
My ratings below are from previous flights with Frontier Airlines. I used to be one of their premier customers, but when all their extra fees hit, I went back to United. However, when a company hired me and paid for a ticket with Frontier in March 2016, I was happy to try them again. After trying to check in at a kiosk, I was told I needed to see an agent. After an hour in line, the agent said I might be denied boarding. I waited another hour in the security line. At the gate, I was told to wait, so I waited another 45 minutes. The flight was oversold, and I was bumped. I went to customer service with two others who were "involuntarily denied boarding," and I learned the airline is required to offer a stipend to anyone would would like to give up his or her seat ("No one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing"). I heard no announcements. Subsequently, I missed a presentation that meant a great deal to me. I was told I would be "automatically reimbursed" for my ticket - which was not true as reimbursement required an hour on the phone with an agent in the Philippines, and I was paid what a friend calls a "kiss-off fee. The others bumped from the flight received a lunch voucher and found seats on a United flight that night at a higher cost. I went home. Never again. Absolutely never again.

### "seats are fine for small people"
Denver to Cancun. This was my first time flying Frontier with their new high tech seats. I can see now why the airline is promoting these new seats as eco friendly. Just an aluminum frame with a hard shell and about 1/4" of padding in the back, a little more in the seat cushion. No more TV monitors in the seat back, no more reclining mechanism to add weight, head rest no way. The tray table will now hold 2 plastic drink glasses and that is it. These seats are fine for small people, every man sitting near me was complaining about how uncomfortable they were. If you are 5'11" or taller and weigh 180lbs or more be pro active don't let your wife book your flight on Frontier, find an airline who still uses foam rubber! !

### "knees hit the back of the seat"
If by chance you get to the airport three hours early (as suggested) you can't drop your bags off, as noted in their FAQs. The desk agent spoke in such broken English hard to tell. Anyway if you happen to be at an airport like O'Hare, earlier than the point Frontier can arrange to track your bag, there are no shops or food/drink options available to you. So for a 300.00 ticket from Denver to Chicago and back I've gotten shoved into a non reclining seat that my knees hit the back of the seat in front of me, and left sitting in baggage claim for 3 hours thru no fault of our own. I'll be taking extra time in the future to book elsewhere.

### "I have yet to fly with Frontier"
I have yet to fly with Frontier but we do have a flight booked in April. Many of these complaints about extra charges and carryon fees are ridiculous. Do you not read the rules as you're booking? It tells you every step of the way about how baggage fees work. Now, I'm hoping there are no delays or bad experiences, but many complaints are due to the passengers' inability to read and pay attention.

### "charge for everything"
Frontier Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Omaha via Denver. Flights late, which makes connecting flights hard. Did not know anything about the charge for carry on until I went online to check in. Just like some other airlines that I will not fly with again, just tell me what it is going to cost, don't bait and switch. The people at the desks were rude, but I'm sure the get the brunt of mad people. The flight crews were very good. Don't expect to get a free glass of soda or a bag of nuts, they charge for everything. There are other airlines and I will use them instead.

### "in the airport for over 18 hours"
Our flight from Houston to Denver was delayed by 3 hours. This made us miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. The next available flight to Salt Lake wasn't until the next night, leaving us in the Denver airport for over 18 hours. They were unwilling to give any other alternatives. They don't have any partnerships with other airlines so no other flights were available. They got us a 'discount' on a hotel room, but they should have paid for that and given us a food voucher. 18 hours + the original 3 hour delay is completely ridiculous. The employees in the airport were completely unhelpful.

### "won't book with them again"
Tried to check in the night before using the reservation code, and Frontier Airlines website kept giving errors that the code does not exist. Check in at the airport 1 hour before flight time, using the same code, and it works. Choosing any isle seat is considered premium, and have to pay an extra $11 for an isle seat all the way to the back of the airplane. Carry-on is an extra $49 charge. The lady at the counter is just unfriendly. 5 minutes before boarding, that announced that the crew will not arrive from Denver until another 4 hours, and as the result, the flight is delay 5 hours! How the heck they don't know that until 5 minutes before boarding is just beyond me. Canceled the flight, and that was supposed to be my first flight with Frontier, and I am sure I won't ever book with them again.

### "staff was all friendly"
Salt Lake City to Cancun via Denver. Booked with a package deal but the deal was not a deal after booking the trip and found out they charge or each checked bag and carry on. Also unless you pay for the seats you want, your family won't sit together. So in all, for flights there and back for only three of us, it cost an additional $498.00 -plus another $500.00 in taxes. But the worst part as the seats. They were to most uncomfortable seats ever and if you want a snack or drink plan on paying for that too. Star ratings below should be in the negative - except the staff was all friendly and helpful.

### "nothing to try to help you"
Hands down the most uncomfortable flight of my life. What ultimately made my decision to never fly with Frontier Airlines again, however, was their complete lack of customer service. I had a flight from Seattle to Miami with a layover in Denver. There was a staffing issue which caused the flight to be delayed 2 hours. Upon arriving in Denver, they announced that all passengers with connecting flights had already missed their connection and needed talk to customer service to find a new flight. The customer service desk had two individuals who had no idea what they were doing and a manager, who basically working both desks. I was 5th in line and it took almost 2 hours to be helped. They explained that the customer service agent in Seattle was instructed to put most of us on different flights so we could get to our destination faster and she’s not sure why that didn’t happen, she also said that there is no way they would hold flights for 45+ minutes and “the customer service agent [at SEATAC] knows that.” She then explained that I had two options:  Get on the next flight to Miami, departing the following evening at 11:55pm, or they could refund the cost of my ticket ($234) and I could fly with a different carrier. That doesn’t sound too bad! I pulled out my laptop and found a flight for $219 with United that departed at 8:27am the next morning. I showed them and said I’d just take the refund but was informed me that they can’t issue refunds at the airport and that I had to call some number to get my refund during regular business hours. At least I wasn’t trying to fly to Orlando. Two of the other passengers were put on flights that departed on Thursday and it was Monday. The following morning I call the number given to me and explained the situation but was told they can only process refunds that are submitted by a customer service agent at the airport and ultimately wasn’t able/willing to help me. I go back to the airport and talk to the manager at the ticketing counter who explained to me that Frontier was actually being very generous offering a partial refund and they were only doing it because Frontier messed something up with the staffing which caused the delay, they said “the delay was totally preventable.” He then explained that he did have the ability to give me a full refund, and I felt so relieved for that brief moment before he told me that he wasn’t going to give me the refund, because “I already used part of the service.” Ultimately, while I paid for service from Seattle to Miami, and Frontier only provided service from Seattle to Denver, that because some service was provided, even though it wasn’t what I paid for or what I wanted, that the transaction was perfectly fair. I had to burn another vacation day for work, sit in an airport for almost 24 hours, and Frontier could have prevented this entirely. At the end of the day, if there is anything I am sure of, it’s that if something does go wrong, you can be sure Frontier will do absolutely nothing to try to help you - even if it was 100% their fault.

### "polite and friendly"
My husband booked a flight on Frontier Airlines for our vacation. We left Atlanta to fly to Las Vegas. I had never flown with Frontier so went online to look at the reviews, all were negative. I was concerned about what my flight was to be and how I was to be treated. When we got there, we were received by a very polite and friendly employee at the desk. The plane was on time both ways. The airline employee's were polite and friendly. We received only top treatment. However, just be prepared that you do not receive free drinks like the other airlines, but must pay for them. Other than this, Frontier was no trouble.

### "become like every other airline"
Denver to San Diego. I have been flying Frontier Airlines for many years, until now. Frontier use to be the most efficient and easy airline to work with. Unfortunately, they have become just like every other airline. They have reservation people who barely speak English, the frequent flyer program is a grand rip off - it's next to impossible to use miles, and it takes 20,000 miles for a one way domestic ticket. The new website is a nightmare. I have spent over an hour this morning trying to navigate it. I attempted to reset my password over six times, because apparently every time Frontier updates the website, frequent flyers have to change their password. Really? I am hugely disappointed with this "new" Frontier Airlines. You have joined the ranks of all the other airlines who don't give one lick how customers feel.

### "recommend this airline"
My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the service on Frontier Airlines when we flew from Chicago to Los Angeles and back. The ground personnel and aircraft crew were polite and professional at both airports and on both flights. Both flights left on time, and arrived early. The seats did not recline, but they were set at a comfortable angle, and were newer and made of a comfortable padded synthetic leather upholstery (not cloth). We were allowed one smaller carry on bag for free, and we were charged $35 each way for each carry on bag in the overhead compartments. But that fee got us Zone 1 priority boarding, no matter where our seats were located. The price of the tickets even including the carry on baggage fee was still far lower than most other airlines. Overall a great trip and I recommend this airline for future travel.

### "flight crew nice enough"
Ticket agent said out digital boarding passes were sufficient for security. Guess what, they are the only ones the TSA scanners can't read at thw Ft Myers airport. Had to go through a completely full security line twice with two screaming toddlers. Only tiny snack bags available on a 4.5 hour flight. Seats now sturdier and compant, but do not recline and only have a tablet stand about 6 inches deep instead of a tray table. Impossible to reach the floor to retrieve lost crayons, but who cares, cause there's not enough tray space for even an A5 sized coloring book. Flight crew nice enough. Frontier is fine for single travelers on short flights for short trips, but will never try to take my family on this airline again. After the baggage fees etc, you wind up paying more than flying with one of the big boys.

### "lack of customer service"
Frontier cancelled our flight we bought one month ago. After 3 days of trying to get in touch with their "re-booking hotline", they offered us to fly out of Tampa or come back a day earlier. The only flight the same day on Spirit airlines was 8 hours later than the one we booked. We had booked the outbound on United, which at this point is useless unless we purchase another flight back to replace the one Frontier cancelled. They don't care that we will have to now pay hundreds of dollars more or that if we cancel the outbound, incur $150. cancel fees. Each conversation was repeated apologies with no solutions, except we will call you tomorrow - stay by your phone. After the third day, it is clear they will do nothing except refund our money, they don't care and have lost us as customers and we will not recommend them to anyone we know. Totally frustrating experience and their lack of any type of customer service makes us glad we are not going on their airplanes if this is how they operate.

### "way beyond inconvenience"
Yesterday was my first and last experience with Frontier Airlines. Our flight from Miami to Philadelphia was delayed from 9.40 pm until 11pm. No big deal - it happens but what does not happen with any other airline is Frontier waited until 11.09pm to inform passengers that this flight was cancelled until Wednesday or Thursday (2 or 3 days later) with barely an explanation other than it's just cancelled. With the choice you can wait or you can have a one-way refund in 5-7 business days. I'm traveling with my daughters and we have work and school. A refund one-way but in the meantime I have to book another flight which cost double and a ride to Ft Lauderdale airport. My new flight is going to a nearby airport and my car is parked at Philadelphia so I'm paying for parking and I don't know when I'll be able to pick up my car. Missing a day of work, no hotel offered, paying for extra food. We have layers of clothes on in the freezing airport trying to sleep for 9 hours on hard chairs with arm rests so you can not even lay down. This is the worse thing any business has ever done to me and others involved and it's out of our control. I saw people at the counter have no options - they did not have the means to purchase additional tickets or food or hotels and found myself doing what I could to help while Frontier did nothing accept threaten to call security on a woman that was extremely frustrated. Way beyond inconvenience.

### "I do not recommend"
Denver to Nashville. Frequent delays and when Frontier Airlines cancelled my flight, they do not fully refund your money. I got back 25 cents on the dollar and still had to book an alternative flight. I ended up out $700 because Frontier cancelled its own flight. Customer service is not interested in making customers happy. The phone call I made was answered by a snippy, angry customer service representative. When I asked for her supervisor, I got another snippy angry person. I do not recommend this airline.

### "won't book Frontier again"
We had to add a stop in Denver to a previously booked trip on Alaska to accommodate a funeral. Originally we were on Alaska both ways. Alaska was very helpful and waived the change fee for both of us. We just had to find airfare from Denver to Salt Lake, as Alaska doesn't fly that route. Frontier was the cheapest so we booked it. We had a ski boot bag to check, which was free on Alaska. Reasons I won't ever book Frontier again:  $45 to carry on a bag,  $40 to check first bag, $45 for the second. The final straw they don't let you book with a TSA precheck number, so we had to wait in a 45min line instead of a 5min line. At this point, the service on the flight doesn't even matter.

### "great budget airline"
Frontier is a budget airline. If you're flying with lots of baggage you will want to price check with other airlines that include baggage. I've flown Frontier from Houston to Denver and Houston to Las Vegas. I've flown friends and family out to visit me from those locations as well. It's great for a weekend or 3-4 day visit. Seating is not incredibly comfy, but as someone who is 5'8" and 140lbs the seat fits me well enough and was fine for the less than 3 hour journey. My father is 6'1" and he fits the seat as well. He preferred an aisle for the room to stretch out. The tray table is small, but I was able to prop my Kindle Fire 8.9" table up on it to watch using the stand on the cover. Food and drink : not tried any of the snacks (I brought my own). The first trip I was on crutches and didn't want to walk back to a vending machine in the airport so I bought a soda on the flight : cost $1.99 for a can. A little pricey but with $38 roundtrip for the flight, that put me at exactly $40 for a round trip to Denver. Boarding and staff: all the flights I've taken have boarded within 10 minutes of listed boarding time, no delays, and have arrived early. One flight had a medical emergency on the flight, but still landed in a timely manner. The staff has always been friendly or at the very least non-cranky. Some people just don't have bubbly personalities but were still polite. When on crutches everyone was insanely nice, giving me extra time for boarding, helping me stow my crutches in the overhead and getting them out for me at the end. Prices - subscribe to their e-mails! I cannot stress this enough! I find that they cycle some amazing promos every month or so and you can get incredibly discounted trips as long as you're flexible on your dates and are booking 1-2 months out. I've flown Denver for $38 and Vegas for $75. That's round trip, non-stop. I can't even drive there for that price! Get the e-mails. Be flexible. Understand what counts as a free personal item: a backpack. I recommend the Motherlode Weekender JR if you're flying them often. It's a good investment that meets the dimensions. I also used a dell laptop backpack I have that meets them as well. Use the app for your boarding pass! No fee and it's super easy. Who travels without their phone these days? Great budget airline if you shop the promos and pack light.

### "giving me courage to fly again"
Orlando to Washington with Frontier Airlines. My first flight in 3 years and a fear of flying. Checkin was simple and fast. Staff friendly and nice. Could not have had better experience on both flights. Thank you Frontier for giving me the courage to fly again and the little reminder from flight attendants that I was safe - will fly Frontier whenever possible.

### "poorly managed business"
Frontier Airlines appears to be the most poorly managed business, I've had the displeasure of dealing with. Their website is not user friendly, they charge for every little thing so when you think you're getting a good rate on your ticket, think again! I chose the car rental offered on the website but later changed my mind. Tried to cancel the reservation but cannot on Frontier's website. They provide a phone number to call to cancel car reservations, but the phone number is to one specific car rental company, not necessarily the company you made reservations at. Our flight has been delayed now for seven hours - not due to weather problems though. We've heard several different stories from the Frontier staff on why the delay from mechanical issues, to changing out planes, to bringing in another plane from another state. Seven hours later, here we still sit, really? Keep in mind, we were not notified of this delay until it was almost time to board. We are told there is nothing they they can do, not another flight to get on, and cannot move us to another airline. We are told maybe we'll get a voucher in compensation for the delay to use on future Frontier flights. Useless when you will never fly with Frontier again. I suspect they are stringing us along only to cancel the flight altogether, then we will have really wasted our time and money. This is a business trip with four of us traveling together. We have invested a great deal of money on a trip that depends on an on-time arrival to our destination. This is not merely an inconvenience, it is a big deal.

### "never fly Frontier again"
This is my first time flying Frontier. I flew from Denver to Seattle with no problems but on my way home I encountered and huge in convenience. I had checked one of my suitcases at the check in thinking I take my carry on, on my flight. When I get to my gate there's an announcement made that if your boarding pass doesn't state carry-on you have to pay $60 there to put it in the overhead bin. I have a backpack, and my boyfriend and I each have a carry on suitcase. If I had known that I was going to be charged at the gate I would have checked it at check in. So I am forced to check my bag here. I am beyond mad. I tell the lady at the gate that I've never heard of being charged for my carry on before and she tells me the price is usually built in to the ticket price but to keep prices low they tack it on at the airport last minute. Even so someone should have informed me of this before I get to my gate. This is ridiculous, I've never been charged for a carry-on right before my flight. Not only that but my carry-one would have fit on the floor in front of my seat. Knowing this I will never fly Frontier again.

### "not one good thing to say"
Houston to Denver was my first and last time flying Frontier Airlines. I really have not one good thing to say. Getting checked in took forever and wasn't done correctly. We had to wait at the gate while they re checked us in. Once on the plane we sat for almost an hour in the most uncomfortable seat without explanation, we had to attempt to keep a 2 yr old happy during this time and were lectured by a flight attendant for letting the child move. The the attendants were rude. We had to return a day early because our 2 yr old was ill and the change fees were criminal! A drink of any sort will cost you and you'd better have a credit card handy. The flight attendants on the way back were more friendly but could not make up for all the minuses. Warning the miserable seats are so small and leg room does not exist so if you are any bigger than I am You will really be cramped. I am a 5 ft 3' 100 lb person. Hopes this helps someone avoid what could be a miserable experience.

### "hidden fees everywhere"
They lure you in with low fares, but then nickel and dime you for everything. Guaranteed you will end up paying the same amount as other airlines with all of their surprise fees. The cabins are extremely uncomfortable - thin seats pressed together as closely as possible, and tiny little tray tables. I've flown with Frontier a couple of times, and each time the flights have been severely delayed without explanation. In November 2015, I was trying to get from SLC to ATL. My flight out of SLC was delayed and there was no gate agent to help anyone for the first two hours of the delay. In the meantime, people were already missing their connections and there was no representative from Frontier to help people. I ended up calling Customer Service because I was going to miss my connection in Denver, and the woman on the line told me that she couldn't help me and that I should just wait for a gate agent. Finally a gate agent showed up and she was grumpy and rude to everyone she interacted with. I told her I was going to miss my connection in Denver and that I would rather stay in SLC where I had family and friends than fly to Denver only to miss the connection and be stranded there for god knows how long. She said she could not re-book me from SLC, and the only way to get help with a new connection was to fly to Denver and they would sort it out there. This was during Thanksgiving week when it is extremely difficult to re-book. Terrible customer service, terrible accommodations, hidden fees everywhere.

### "costs everywhere for everything"
Denver to Orlando with Frontier, I used to love flying this airline but standards seem to have fallen. Expect costs everywhere for everything. I thought Spirit was bad but shockingly, Frontier is worse. Their new seats are uncomfortable. Then waiting for the costly beverage service - we got passed twice and the staff started collecting trash before we were even asked if we wanted anything. I am now sitting at baggage claim over an hour after I landed and there are 2 Frontier flights ahead of us still waiting on their bags. One of the flights landed an hour before ours did. Do not waste your money with this company as they clearly do not value their customers at all.

### "you pay for everything"
Frontier used to be Denver hometown airline, not at all anymore. Whoever took them over last year has stripped the cabins bare. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable, narrow and packed together. I am a small person, 5", 110 lbs. We flew from Denver to DC January 2016, 2.5 hour flight. I sat on my jacket the whole way for some cushion. I recommend bringing a seat cushion, like you would if you were sitting on bench for a game. There is no plugins for devices, coffee is $2 - really? You pay for everything. Pack your own water and your own healthy food, because all they have is junk food to purchase. Leg room, unless you pay extra, is non- existent. They charge for checked and carry-on luggage. By the time you add everything you need to a basic ticket you are paying more than most other airlines. They also make you buy a subscription to get the lowest basic prices. I always flew Frontier in the past, not anymore. Southwest is looking really good to me. Finally, getting the luggage out in a timely manner has somehow escaped them in all these changes, too few staff? At both ends we waited about 45 minutes for the luggage to surface from the bowels of the airports.

### "staff was friendly"
Detroit to Orlando return, and Frontier Airlines was great, staff was friendly, plane was clean, price was right. Flights were on time with no trouble at all. I read reviews before we flew with them and were expecting terrible service but it was fine. For the price I am not sure what they expect.

### "sub par at best"
Every time I've ever flown on Frontier the experience has been sub par at best. This last time my wife had a horrible experience with them that made me never want to fly them again. She booked a flight from Los Angeles to Denver. I've found their website to be horrible, and every time we put in our credit card it says that confirmation code is declined. After multiple tries it will finally accept our card. To make a long story short they had two transactions pending on our card and never informed us that the transactions where in fact declined on their end. The night my wife goes to check in they say she did not actually purchase a ticket. We had to fight the manager on the phone to get the price of the ticket close to what we purchased it at. There is a reason why this airline has such low ratings. For a 300 dollar flight from LA to DEN I get small rows, no carry on, no bag.

### "airline was terrible"
Frontier Airlines promote it as "you get the basics" from our low fares and then "customize" from there. Apparently the basics does not include luggage, beverages, or comfortable seating. It was by far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever used. What is worse is that we received an email that our flight was cancelled. My husband called to see if that was correct, spoke to a incompetent individual who not only answered the question if our flight was cancelled incorrectly (which it was not), but then proceeded to put us on hold and hang up on us. When we called back, they said that he had moved the flight (we traveled from DC to Denver and he placed us on another flight from DC to Denver!). The airline was terrible, saying that our seats had already been taken and that they could not get us on a new flight until three days later.

### "enjoyed everything"
Philadelphia to Kingston, Jamaica, and we enjoyed everything about our experience with Frontier Airlines. Polite and helpful staff, great take off and landing. Flights were on time and at great prices. Didn't expect any frills for the price and none were needed. We'll fly them again. We have flown many other airlines and Frontier Airlines compares equally in most catagories.

### "no problems with airline "
Pleasant experience. Had no problems with the airline or either of these Frontier Airlines flights. I really like that they have a separate "bag drop" line from the "check-in" line. It allows those that check in ahead of time to get through faster. The staff at check in was very friendly and helpful telling us where to go after dropping bags. Orlando TSA is horrific, but obviously that doesn't count against Frontier. The actual flight was just the same as any other airline. Okay, you didn't get free peanuts and a drink! For this flight, I paid $340 for two people and two checked bags. I would have paid upwards of $600 for the same on Delta or United. It was also nice that flight attendants announced what baggage claim you can find your bags on before exiting the aircraft. That's a nice touch. My only complaint is that the A321 seats are rather hard and the tray tables are about 6 inches deep.

### "never recommend Frontier"
I was scheduled to fly Frontier Airlines from Philadelphia to Chicago on 28th December 2015 at 4:55 PM. When I reached the Philadelphia airport 2 hours prior to the flight time, I got to know that the flight was delayed till 6:30 PM. After sitting and waiting at the terminal for another hour and a half, we were told that now the flight was delayed till 8:30 PM. After another hour, finally we were informed that the flight was cancelled. For the earlier delay, the reason cited was that the airplane was coming from an international flight so was checked by authorities. For the cancellation, they said that it is due to weather conditions. We could either get our refund, which was really low since I had booked 2 months in advance, or re-book the flight. The next available flight was on 4 days later. There was no advanced info about delay/cancellation and the customer service was very rude and said due to weather related reasons they won't listen to our concerns. When I finally did fly on the 1st January, the flight was again delayed by half an hour, the seats were highly uncomfortable and the less I speak about customer service, the better. I would never recommend Frontier to anyone.

### "Frontier does a nice job"
Cincinnati to Denver on Frontier Airlines. There were several agents to assist with check in and they were friendly and efficient. The flight was on time, even arriving early. No problem with baggage. The plane was clean and the temperature onboard was comfortable. The seats do not recline which is a plus in some ways as I didn't have anyone coming back into my space. The seats could have been more comfortable but seats on most airlines are not very comfortable. Frontier does a nice job of offering a discount trip. Other than having to pay for drinks, there is little distinction between them and the other carriers.

### "very pleased with Frontier"
Before making our trip from Atlanta to Denver we had read horror stories about flying with Frontier Airlines, however, I wish to report that we were very pleased with Frontier. When you fly with Frontier you know up front what you are getting and what you are paying, so why complain about things that are saving you a great deal of money on your flight. I thought the seat comfort and room were comparable to other airlines. If you want more room, buy a set with more space. If you want a particular seat location, pay for it rather than complaining about your assigned seat. If you do not want to pay for snacks, bring your own, and they will give you water. If you do not want to pay for carry on luggage, purchase checked luggage. Our flights to and from Denver were on time or earlier. The only problem we had was in getting our checked bags at DIA. Things happen. We will use Frontier in the future, if the rate is better.

### "numerous extra charges"
I was extremely disappointed that Frontier Airlines charged extra for just about everything on our trip to and from Philadelphia to Cancun. They charge extra for your seat at check-in, even those at the back of the plane that do not recline even an inch. Frontier not only charges for checked luggage, they also charge you for carry-on luggage. With luggage and seat costs, it cost my family of three approximately $300 extra. Frontier also charges you for a soda and juice. You can get water for free. In addition to the numerous extra charges, I checked in and was billed. I received a call about three hours later asking me to check in again because the system was not working properly. I am waiting to see if I get charged twice on my credit card for the two check ins.

### "lot of room for your legs"
I would only recommend Frontier Airlines for short trips and if you have your own entertainment (computer, Tablet etc) and you bring your own drinks and food. Only water is for free and we only got on the flight from Phoenix to SFO not on the way back. The flight attendants were nice. Our flight back was 3 hours delayed and nobody told us about that or the reason. Even the crew didn't know what was going on. Its more expensive to pay for a carry on than a checked bag. The nice thing is, that even in the normal Economy Class you have a lot of room for your legs. Not again if I don't have to.

### "don't recommend using Frontier"
This airline does not take care of its elderly passengers. Further it does not acknowledge poor service. Our 86 year old Mother with rheumatoid arthritis was not accommodated with a wheelchair upon arrival in Denver, she was told there would be one coming to get her, she waited at the gate for more than an hour, along with another elderly lady needing assistance. After asking multiple of times for assistance, knowing their families were waiting, they proceeded to walk the entire airport assisting each other. We called the airline the following day to report the poor service and requesting we be contacted to acknowledge our concerns for the lack of care for their Elderly passengers - that was nearly 3 weeks ago and we have not heard anything from them. We fly our mother to Austin yearly and sometimes multiple times yearly, this was our first and last time to use Frontier. I don't recommend using Frontier for elderly flying alone or children flying alone. They have the worst customer service I've ever encountered flying.

### "wouldn't fly this airline again"
If I could give Frontier Airlines a 0 out of 10 in every category I would. Denver to San Francisco, and delayed over 6 hours when all other airlines are on time. They charge for everything except water. Baggage fees cost more than other airlines. Employees don't care about their costumers. I wouldn't fly this airline again if they gave me free tickets. And I'm cheap that's how bad it is.

### "cold and heartless"
I took my daughter home for the holidays as I have done for the past 11 years. After she turned 14 on most airlines I don't pay an unaccompanied minor fee, however I have always been able to get a gate pass as a courtesy. They let me know it is a courtesy and when she is 18 that will stop and that is fine with me. During her first portion of her trip her father got a gate pass and was able to take her to the plane. On the flight back, I asked for a pass when I came to drop off her bags; I let them know that she was 17, the response of the agent was that she was sorry but children over 14 were adults and they should know enough to get to a plane. In LV casinos have enough sense to prevent minors from being alone after 10 pm. However, Frontier airlines have no shame in letting a child walk to a gate alone at 12am in the morning. I went back to the desk and tried to explain and another agent told me to ask TSA because there was heavy volume. I went back to the Agent at TSA and they told me there wasn't heavy volume. By this time I was very upset because I had no choice at this point. I work in customer service and the cold and heartlessness of these counter agents and the concern of my child's safety made me upset. I really didn't expect the lack of concern and caring about this situation.

### "counter crew worst I have seen"
Flight was good both from Houston to Orlando and from Orlando to Houston. Planes are clean, but seating was narrow and uncomfortable (what airline isn't now a days). Flight crew friendly and professional, but counter crew worst I have ever seen. Slow, rude, unprofessional. Saw a ticket agent make faces at a customer who waited 45 minutes to check in while she let late passenger by. He said he had been waiting, but she just got mad. Saw similar behavior with others.

### "disgraceful, terrible business"
Frontier Airlines will sell you tickets months in advance, confirm your flights a night before yet when you go to the airport you are lucky if they get you to your destination they will cancel your flight and will offer you no reasonable solution or alternative! This happened to our family off four during the holidays. Our flight from SFO to RDU was delayed for 7 hours. After 7 hours of waiting at the airport, we were told that "unfortunately you will miss your connection in Denver and we won't be able to take you to North Carolina tonight". When we asked what our options were, he suggested if we really wanted to be home for Christmas we should ask for a refund and walk to another airline's ticket counter and try to find tickets! Sure, it is the week of Christmas and all other airlines had tons of affordable tickets - all we had to do was just try! When we told the rep that was not really an option, he said "well, I can take you to Denver tonight. Then from Denver every night we will try to fly one of you to RDU and by Christmas Day, you should all make it home". Again, we did not think living at Denver Airport 4 nights and waiting for our family to be flown home separately a day apart each over 4 days was a serious alternative. There were dozens of angry, stranded Frontier customers were in line behind us waiting to get their chance to talk to the only agent there who had nothing to offer. We called  got 4 Delta tickets from Denver to Raleigh portion and flew back home. When we tried to call Frontier to request a refund, they argued with us about how much of a refund we should be getting. The refund they offered was 1/4 of our total purchase price, plus with new on the spot tickets we had to purchase out of our pocket, this trip cost us double the amount and of course, Frontier Airlines did not offer to accept any responsibility. Customer Service agents apologized saying they cannot offer any thing above this amount of refund which is predetermined by their airline and we should go to their website, look for a form to fill and send our request to their corporate offices. We will never fly Frontier again. We had the financial means to purchase new tickets from a different airline, what about the planeload of others whose flights were cancelled too and were told they needed to wait "days" to make it home? I still feel so terrible about an older lady trying to go to Phoenix to be with her grandchildren and agent telling her next possible flight will be in 48h - she kept asking us (she was behind us in the line) "Can they legally do that ? Can they really keep you waiting at the airport 48 hours? I had no good answers for her. Frontier Airlines, you are supposed to be in transportation business and reading the previous reviews, it is my understanding that this kind of thing is common for you. It is disgraceful, terrible business.

### "flight was cancelled"
Chicago to Fort Myers. Our flight was cancelled due to weather. We knew that weather could be a factor so we checked in several times prior to driving an hour to Chicago O'Hare airport. Upon arrival they even let us pay for all of our bags with all the additional fees for carry ons, full luggage etc. We asked if the flight was on time etc before we proceeded to purchase bags and try to get through security. We were just over an hour away from the flight taking off. They assured us we were fine before we paid. As soon as we walked up to our gate the flight was cancelled. We waited in line to see how they were going to accommodate us with another airline or a flight tomorrow. They offered us nothing except that they could get us on a flight 4 days later. We were told they couldn't do anything but here is a piece of paper with a number on it that we could call and see what they could do. Well what about our checked bags? They were on the carousel two downstairs we were told. We went down to the carousel and there were all the passengers one and not one representative was there at the carousel nor was anyone's luggage. The luggage was never even loaded on to the plane because there was no plane. It took over an hour and a half to finally track down an employee who finally took our baggage receipt. After 30 minutes they showed up with our luggage. I had never used Frontier Airlines before but did so as this was an economical fare and the only flight that worked with the timetable I had to travel back home to Florida.

### "fly someone else"
San Francisco to Houston. Awful experience all around. Rude crew, not accommodating and they charge you for everything even soft drinks. There is no inflight entertainment and row 4 doesn't recline for some weird reason. They were rude to my husband for carrying my carry-on because I was pregnant and went on the plane before him. They made him step out of line and threaten to charge him. You end up paying over $100 on bags and drinks/snacks, you might as well fly someone else.

### "no complimentary anything"
Awful - a 5 hour delay departing from Denver. No complimentary anything during the Frontier Airlines flight. $45 carry on fee. Showed up for my return flight home Christmas day exactly 45 minutes prior to take off and the check in desk was already closed, no Frontier assistant in sight. Only had one flight Christmas day. The next one wasn't until the 27th. So my mother resorted to driving 8 hours to Denver herself. I did receive a $70 credit for a future flight through Frontier, but I'd rather eat the wasted money than fly with them again.

### "absolutely no entertainment"
Frontier Airlines is hands down the worst airline. Flew from Chicago O'Hare to Punta Cana. The seats were as comfortable as a folding chair, no padding, they didn't recline. The tray table was about 3 in deep and 6 in wide. Ridiculously small. No movie, tv, music, absolutely no entertainment. No wifi. Beverages were $2. Snacks were even more. We witnessed a flight attendant shout at an elderly man to sit down when he was waiting for his elderly wife (who was seated in the middle seat) to walk back from the lavatory. The flight attendant made him sit down for max of 15 seconds and then he struggled to stand back up so his wife could pass him back to her seat.

### "I was so angry"
My family was booked for a direct flight from St Louis to Cancun with a 6:15am departure on Frontier Airlines. They noticed that a warning light went off for no reason so we returned to the gate and waited for 6 hours. Once they finally told us what was going on and that they had cancelled the flight and would be giving us a free flight the next day. I was so angry we called the hotel we were supposed to be staying at to push the reservation back a day. I suggest that you don't fly on this airline.

### "worst  customer service"
I had a 5 hour delay with Frontier Airlines from Kansas City to Denver. They said mechanical difficulty. I would like to know how you don't send another plane within 5 hours. I will never fly this airline again, no matter what the price is. Worst airline I have seen in customer service. It took over 20 mins after a 5 hour flight to get our lugguage.

### "ignorant and uncaring"
I wrote a great review on my first flight and unfortunately I have to write one the the worst reviews. My flight was delayed for three hours, so I called the customer service and was told that I had to go to the airport to make any changes. When I got to the airport, the ticket counter said since I was already checked in, I would have to go to the gate. When I got to the gate, no one was there until 30 minutes prior to boarding. Called the customer service number and all I got was an apology. I am going to miss a dinner that I paid a lot of money to attend, and an "I'm sorry" doesn't cut it. If you have the option, stay far away from Frontier. Their only solution which they stated a dozen times was to book me on the next flight four hours later. Unbelievably ignorant and uncaring.

### "should not lie to customers"
When I arrived at the airport, 2 hours early, they told me that the flight that was supposed to leave at 5:45pm, was delayed till 11:30pm due to weather. I went and asked Southwest Airlines and they said their flight was on time at scheduled departure time of 5:40pm. I went back to Frontier and the rep told me that it changed to only 6:40pm. So I decided to wait with my 78 year old mom with Parkinson's in a wheelchair. But then at about 6:10pm they said it was delayed till 11:45pm. I wouldn't recmmend anyone fly this airline. They should have backup planes and not lie to their customers.

### "never again with Frontier"
Flying out of Denver to Atlanta our Frontier Airlines flight was originally scheduled for 4.10pm, we were delayed the first time for an hour, then it was 2 hrs, then the flight was completely taken off the board with no communication from the airline. After the 2 hour disappearance it reappeared with a new flight time of 10.40pm, just as we are about to board the the plane at 10.45 the airline personnel actually made people disboard because of the lack of flight personnel. We were informed that the crew member was on the premises and it would take another 15 min before they got to the plane, after an hours wait, another captain from another flight made the crew board the passengers to get the process going. After an 8.5 hour delay we finally left for Atlanta. Got to our rental car company in just enough time to get the car drive to my sons graduation from army bootcamp without any sleep. Barely made it there because of this airline. No voucher, not even a free bag of peanuts. Never again with Frontier. Another delay on the way back from Atlanta to Denver, 6 hrs because of maintenance issues in another city.

### "commend this employee"
Denver to Santa Ana. I witnessed a Frontier Airlines employee assist a blind passenger this morning and I have to say it is rare to see such compassion and empathy these days. She went outbid her way to reassign a seat closer to the front even though the flight was full. I commend this employee on her present personality and willingness to go out of her way to take care of customers. Way to go Frontier!

### "believe the bad reviews"
Cleveland to Salt Lake City via Denver. Plane delayed 3 hours out of Cleveland due to mechanical issues. Cleveland agents would not confirm a new connecting flight because they said we would make our connection, which we didn't. We were told we were on standby for another flight, we weren't. Confirmed on a 6:30pm flight. Our original flight was supposed to leave at 5:30am. The employees have been totally unhelpful and so rude it is stunning! Even after a 3 hour delay of our flight they charged for drinks and food on our flight to Denver. We were emailed a $100 certificate for our next flight. No Thank You! This was our first time flying Frontier Airlines and it will be our last! Believe all the bad reviews and ratings you read. Fly someone else. There are plenty of discount airlines that will at least be helpful and considerate.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I think it absolutely ridiculous that Frontier Airlines now charges for carry-on luggage. Flew DFW to DEN. This fee was not well enough highlighted during the booking process, or I would have most certainly not booked the ticket-would have paid an extra $20 to fly with another airline that includes carry-on luggage instead of a total of $80 roundtrip with Frontier. I am a frequent flyer (although not with Frontier, to be fair) and hence well familiar with booking flights online, but this fee did not even cross my radar during the booking. Or if it did, I must have thought it so ludicrous that it was referring to something else. These extra airline charges are getting to be absolutely absurd. Who flies with only a purse? This has certainly influenced me to not choose Frontier in the future.

### "never fly with Frontier again"
We booked a nonstop flight from SFO to Chicago OHare. It is required to pay for luggage and only a purse size personal item. On our return flight we were delayed 2 times. Scheduled to leave at 7:55 and departure scheduled for 2:00 pm. Hopefully the last delay. Their other flights left on time. I would think they would try to get us a different plane. That didn't happen. Needless to say the low fares are not low after paying luggage fees and delays. No free snacks not even drinks. I will never fly with Frontier again.

### "seats  very uncomfortable"
The seats on Frontier were very uncomfortable, they no longer have cushions and will not push back. So your left setting up in a prone position with a very small arm rest. Even worse the fold down utility tray is now only 5 inch deep, so because the space between you and the seat in front of you are so close now you can no longer use a ipad or laptop. No inflight entertainment anymore either, the seats are not big enough to hold a small 6 inch monitor. You pay $30 dollars for a carry on and for normal luggage. Onboard I felt like a I was strapped into a child's car seat in the floorboard of a compact car. Never again!

### "decline in service and quality"
I had been a long time supporter of Frontier Airlines for many years. Having flown on the airline likely over 50+ times in the past 10 years. Over the past few years I have experienced the steady decline in both service and quality, nonetheless continued to utilize the airline for both business and personal travel. My recent flight from Tampa to Denver represents one of the most disgraceful flying experiences. The seats on this airplane are not only poorly designed and uncomfortable, they are unsafe. These seats represent what happens when an airline crosses the line in an effort to cut costs. I will never book another ticket on Frontier Airlines.

### "avoid flying this airline"
Las Vegas to Denver via Memphis. This is the worst airline ever! I thought Spirit was bad, but nothing compares to Frontier. I traveled with Frontier Airlines on 11/24/15, going to visit my family for the thanksgiving holiday and I boarded from Las Vegas to Denver where I had a seven hour layover before reaching my destination. When I checked in at the ticket counter in Vegas I did not have any checking luggage but I did have a carry on bag but was never told by the agent that I had to pay for my carry on, neither was I told anything before boarding the plane. However, when I got ready to board in Denver, I was told by the lady who was taking the boarding passes that I had to step out of the line and go to the next counter because my bag needed to have a ticket associated with it. When I went to the counter the lady that I approached told me that I had to pay USD60.00 for my carry on. Of course I questioned that since I was not told that initially, I asked to speak to a supervisor but got no satisfaction from him. Said they were doing their job and the people in Vegas did not do theirs. This is my second time flying with Frontier and both times were bad experiences. The only reason I flew with them again was because I had a voucher from the first bad experience and was compensated for what my fiancé and I went through. I know they try to entice people with their low fares but they get you with their outrageous fees for baggage and carry on, which when you look at it you really is not getting a deal at all! If you could avoid flying with this airline, please do and save yourself the headache. I would not recommend this airline to anyone! Frontier Airlines put you through all that and their seats are not comfortable and nothing is free except water.

### "be very careful with this airline"
I received a text from Frontier Airlines stating my flight was delayed by 2 hours which would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. So I called Frontier and they had no reason for delay and no other flights available that day so I cancelled the flight with refund agreed by agent on the phone. I then booked flight with Delta to fly on that date. I was told I'd receive refund from Frontier within 10 business days. Three weeks went by and I called them. I was told no refund and no record of my call. Be very careful with this airline!

### "seats were most uncomfortable"
Greensboro to San Francisco via Denver. This was the worst airline I have flown and I love to fly. The seats on Frontier were most uncomfortable, you pay $30 dollars for a cary on, $25 for normal luggage,from SFO back to Denver there was no place to put my carry on so I had to place it under the seat. Onboard the plane I felt like a sardine in a can.

### "fly with them again"
Indianapolis to Orlando, and we arrived 2hrs early per their recommendation and had no issues boarding. The seats weren't the most comfortable but really weren't uncomfortable either. Staff was friendly and courteous and more importantly the flight was smooth. We flew through storms most the way there and still it wasn't bad. I will definitely fly with them again.

### "never fly with them again"
Colorado had a major snow storm night before I was due to depart. My flight was 1159 pm and we left Colorado Springs at 4 pm so we could take our time. Well we hit icey roads and ended up totaling daughters car. Thank God we were not hurt. I called Frontier to see if I could change flight to next night since I wasn't about to ask someone else to drive dangerous roads to get me there, I explained the situation with the accident and road conditions and rep said sure we have room on next nights flight, it will cost $547 total. That is ridiculous! I can get last minute round trip flights for less than that. Anyway, I no longer care how cheap their flights may be, due to their lack of compassion and nickel and dining tactics, I will never fly with them again. I would rate them a zero if possible.

### "charging for everything"
Frontier went from my favorite airline to the worst in one trip. In addition to charging for everything (including the seat, checked and carry on luggage and in flight drinks) they changed planes again and the seats are small with no leg room. My flight back from Detroit to Las Vegas included a 8 hour layover in Denver, overnight, when the entire airport closes down. Can't even get a drink of water for 6 hours. The inflight staff is just about the rudest I've ever seen. They are annoyed with you before you even board, and don't need anything. The scoffs and eye rolling are free if you do.

### "extra fees for carry-on"
Milwaukee to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Terrible seats were like sitting on a sheet of hard plastic. The seats do not recline. There were extra fees for carry-on and seat fees. We have flown to Las Vegas for over twenty years and this was one of the worst trips. Not worth the savings flying with Frontier Airlines.

### "doesn't deserve one star"
Frontier Airlines doesn't even deserve one star. On my way to a funeral from DC to Detroit, they lost my luggage on a direct flight. Minutes after the luggage was distributed, you can't find anyone at the airport from Frontier to help you out. The two adjacent airlines tried their best to help me but to no avail. I spent over 15 hours from the airport and at my destination trying to reach a person who can help me and no one knew what they were doing. I was giving alternate contacts that had nothing to do with lost luggage. I spent hours trying to reach a live person and 90 percent of the time I was disconnected. Although I gave everyone I spoke with my number to call me back after being disconnected, they promised to call back and no one ever did. Left numerous messages at the Detroit airport but I was called back Monday morning to let me know that the luggage was found at their office and I didn't not receive it till Monday late. I spoke to several supervisor to let them know that all my clothing, cosmetics, etc were in the luggage for the funeral that weekend and they said go ahead a purchase the items. When I tried to get a budget, no one would give me a figure. On my return to DC, I filed the 3rd., claim with the person in charge at the office. Gave her the receipts and I assumed all would be well. It's been close to three months now and many, many follow up calls and the same untrained phone customer service people who get you no where. Finally someone informed me that I can file a complaint on line. I couldn't believe that I got a call from the Detroit office claiming that they never received messages from me. I assured her that I have phone documentation to prove how many calls I made to Detroit and the national number. She then informs that I should have been give an authorization to purchase items. I screamed at her that no one ever told me that and that I tried to ask for a budget and no one would address it. She asked me to email her the receipts because the Detroit office didn't have them. The apparently lost them, and it was my responsibility to resend them to me. She gave me a gmail number which surprised me that it was not a Frontier email. Guess what - the email kicked back. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever received from anyone. Although people think they are cheap, after you pay all the extra, they were much higher than Delta. Never again would I ever use them.

### "may fly Frontier again"
Kansas City to Seattle via Denver. I chose Frontier Airlines for a one way flight back home to Seattle from Kansas City. All in all, Frontier was mediocre. Pros: cheap airfare, flights on time or early, convenient flight times , customer service was pretty good. Cons: charge for carry in bags, additional charge for seat, no complimentary snacks or beverages offered in flight (other than glasses of water), minimal options of food and beverage for purchase, no in flight entertainment of any kind. Almost no padding on seats - tiny (half size maybe?) tray tables, no wifi. I may fly Frontier again for short trips, but it's not up to the standards of other airlines as far as in flight experience goes.

### "smoothest flight I've been on"
Frontier Airlines was the smoothest flight I've been on. From the checkin at the kiosk, the flight and baggage claim. Everything was on time. I didn't have to wait more than five minutes for my bags. The flight was great, the price is unbeatable. To top it all off we flew right over the city skyline and turned right over lake Michigan, it was beautiful. Definitely flying Frontier again. The only down part was leg room, but there's even an option to upgrade of you want!

### "never fly on Frontier again"
Customer Service on Frontier Airlines is abysmal. I had problems every step of the way. I talked to airline employees from gate agents, to ticket agents, to flight attendants, to customer service employees. All were unhelpful. They could tell that I was an irate customer. I would think they would want to make me feel better. I'm not asking for free stuff. Just a smile - which I never saw. They advertise low prices but dont tell you they will charge you $40 to carry an item on. $2 for a coke. $5 for a cup of coffee. I will never fly on Frontier again.

### "regretting my choice"
This review is to prepare other Frontier "possible" passengers of the potential additional costs of flights. Due to a family emergency, I quickly found a flight to be with an ill family member. The most direct flight at a reasonable cost was selected - It just happened to be Frontier. The cost was slightly less expensive than other carriers. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, I was impressed and even purchased the "DEN Discount" for $49. That was then. Today, I see there's a $30 fee to Carry-on my luggage. (Yes, I said carry my own) baggage. Then there's the $6-25 fee for your seat. That's an extra - $82 costs! After I realized, I was more cost effective using another carrier and that I would never fly Frontier again. I asked to be refunded for the DEN Discount. Sorry the rep said after 24 hours it's non-refundable. My flight isn't even scheduled until tomorrow. After looking at these reviews - I'm regretting my choice to go Frontier! Run, Passengers - Use another provider who's up-front andre reliable! Boy, do I wish I did. 0/10 for overall rating.

### "service has deteriorated"
Frontier Airlines is absolutely the most awful airline. Hidden fees. Terrible times. Horrendous website. Paid for their 'Discount Den' and cannot use it online - keeps asking for me to re-pay. Can't e-mail directly with concerns until after the fact. Service has deteriorated over time. Just awful.

### "explain about extra charges"
Frontier Airlines explains everything about extra charges for bags, seats etc. My family and I flew to Orlando this past week and could not have had a better experience. We got the tickets dirt cheap $152 and I did not choose seats and checked in 1 bag. Our family was seated together. Staff was helpful and welcoming. I just hate to see the negative reviews about how they charge for everything - they explain that to you when you book so it's your fault if you choose to ignore it. I paid for 1 bag round trip and the total price for 4 tickets was $202 which is $50.50 each. Best deal around by far. I have flown on Delta, US Air and other major airlines and I haven't had a perfect experience with them and 1 ticket cost more than all 4 of mine.

### "the charge for anything"
First and last time we will fly Frontier Airlines. My son is active duty military and returned home last week from a 8 month deployment. I had seen Frontiers ads about inexpensive fares, and since the military does not give you more than a few days notice, I decided to fly them. After booking them through Orbitz (package deal) I loved onto Frontiers website (not easy to use) and choose our seats. To my shock, you had to pay extra for your seat ($9-30) AND pay for your luggage whether checked or carryon! Really? I asked customer service about the seat charge. If you want to sit where you want to, you must pay the extra fee. My husband is tall and needs extra leg room. The head flight attendant both directions were very cranky, the seats do not recline, but the topper is the charge for anything other than a half a cup of water (2.5 hr flight)! Coffee, soda or a bag of peanuts are all $1.99! So in closing, if you add up all of the fees tacked on we could have flown an airline that we actually enjoy!

### "I'm not happy"
I was to fly from Minneapolis to Portland, with a stop in Denver. This was my first time flying with Frontier Airlines, I will never do so again. My tickets were purchased from Frontier's website, so I was hoping for a good experience. I checked in online the evening before, printed my boarding pass and paid for my bags. I was thinking that I was good to go. When I got to Frontier's counter to actually check my bag, this is where the problem began. The kiosks weren't working, so people who were flying couldn't do this part, and had to wait for a counter person. This caused a huge back up. When I finally got to the counter, the clerk said you aren't going to be able to check your bag, you will need to take it to the gate and see if they can do it there. Then all of us had to go through the TSA checkpoint, which normally is pretty efficient, but not today. They decided to take my "bag" and go through it, which then caused me to miss my flight. I had to then go to the counter at the gate, wait for someone to come and find out what to do next. They rebooked me for later, to leave Minneapolis at the time I was to arrive in Portland Oregon. I'm not happy, very angry as Frontier employees just seem to be unconcerned for my plight.

### "will not fly them again"
Incompetence, coupled with excessive fees - I will not fly Frontier again. Due to a nationwide computer glitch my flight was delayed 1.5 hours. The ground crew professed to have no information about where our aircraft was, when it would arrive, or the impact on the ability of myself and other passengers to make connections. They repeatedly broadcast to the passengers that there was nothing they could do. Despite this glitch, the ground staff stated that the flight was oversold and that they could book willing passengers on later flights (this, to me, seemed to contradict their statement that they had no information on any other Frontier flights). I detest airlines that do not state fees up front which is tricky when buying through Expedia or other sites. I had the nasty surprise of having to pay for cabin baggage ($30). I was unfamiliar with Frontier before this trip, and will not fly with them again. Lack of communication, lack of information, frustrated ground staff, late flights, missed connections, bag fees, seat-selection fees.

### "very dissatisfied customer"
My husband and I had flown Frontier in 2009 and early 2010 and loved them. Their approach to customer service was fantastic and who wouldn't love the chocolate chip cookies they served in flight. Fast track now to 2015 - my hubby and I needed to make a trip to Denver from DC for a medical specialist appointment. The trip out was uneventful but we saw significant changes from the Frontier we loved back in 2009. This airline has been transformed into an ultra low cost carrier (eg Spirit Airlines) and as I have learned since my flight, was purchased in 2013 and torn apart by Indigo Partners. Our return trip on Oct 5th was an absolute nightmare. While the surgeon was late for my appointment, this cut us very tight at DIA. Security lines took over 50 minutes (one of the most inefficient TSA operations I have ever seen and I fly a lot for work). We ran through the terminal to the gate only to find out that they flight had left early and there were no more flights back to DC that night. We were sent to Frontier's customer service desk in DIA's A terminal and they were completely worthless. Were willing to rebook us both (for a $95 fee x2 of course). We paid it after contacting other airlines and determining there was no other way to return to DC that afternoon/evening. We were left with a hotel bill for a night we hadn't planned, an additional $25 in parking fees at DCA and lost work for both my husband and I. I have tried calling multiple times but no one will return my call. Very dissatisfied customer who has learned her lesson and will not fly the 'new Frontier' again.

### "an absolute breeze"
I was a little hesitant to fly Frontier as I had read some of the reviews, and it seemed a lot of folks had issues with the airline. Let me just say, I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to those reviews. My flight from Houston to Denver was an absolute breeze. We took off early from Houston and got to Denver early, and we didn't have to wait to be deplaned. I highly recommend upgrading your flight to the "works" when making the reservation. I will definitely fly Frontier again.

### "charged an occupancy fee"
After booking the first thing I was charged was an "occupancy" fee. Isn't it implied that I'll be occupying the plane when I buy the plane ticket? My girlfriend was charged to bring on her purse. Keep in mind this isn't some outrageous huge purse. This is a small 12 inch purse. But still we were charged for that along with our carry on bag. So after already being in a bad mood from paying the hidden fees we get inside the plane. The seats were uncomfortable, provide no personal space and I spent the entire trip with some guy laying on my shoulder. Don't get hungry or thirsty unless you feel like paying even more. The only positive comment I will give is there was a fox painted on the wing of the plane. That's not spectacular but what else was there to be excited about on this plane. If you're thinking about flying on this airline I suggest you walk. you'll have a better time.

### "not fly Frontier again"
Bad customer service, hidden fees and an overall poor experience is what awaits you on Frontier Airlines. Staff outside of the planes really took the "low cost" approach to customer service and are basically just there to collect tolls. The staff on the plane was friendly but it couldn't overcome being nickle and dimed at every step. I will not fly Frontier Airlines again.

### "I'm glad I made the choice"
I was a bit hesitant to choose Frontier Airlines for my round trip from Cincinnati to Las Vegas, but I'm glad I made the choice to go with Frontier. Upon reading the fine print about baggage fees, I went on Frontier's site and purchased their classic plus option. For a little extra added on to the ticket, I was able to choose my seat, add checked/carry on luggage, and not pay anything at check in. They sent me an email with the details of the flight a day before with advisories on when to be there. The staff at both check in counters were efficient and friendly. Both flight crews were knowledgeable, and friendly. Here's my advice to all that are in it for a cheap flight, check on the airline's website for fees, and rules. The other airlines charge more because they add those fees in the ticket price already. You are going to pay one way, or the other.

### "were absolutely pitiful"
Frontier Airlines were absolutely pitiful on this trip from Chicago to Raleigh, and can't wait to see them close up. $40 per carry on, or $30 to check a bag. All of this is hidden in the fine print. Staff are also unfriendly and unprofessional.

### "rudest customer service people"
Low initial price, I paid $300 for two one-way tickets with Frontier Airlines. The fees I paid brought my grand total to over $800! The customer service is terrible. My wife and I encountered the rudest customer service people at the ticketing counter for Frontier Airlines at DCA. You'll pay more in the long run and have a rude awakening as to just how bad airlines can get.

### "used to like the airline"
I am 62 years old and have flown extensively for business and pleasure. I have been a Frontier Airlines supporter and used to like the airline. After flying on an aircraft with the plastic seats and 6" tray tables I will never fly on Frontier again and go out of my way to let others know how miserable the airline has become. In addition the website seems to be incapable of understanding an expiration date on a credit card. Sold me baggage tickets and then credited them back out. Tried to charge $13 for seats behind the ones I got for no charge. Refused to offer aisle seats. Looked like plenty of people are still willing to put up with this experience.

### "upset with carry on baggage fee"
I was quite upset with the Frontier Airlines carry on baggage fee and the required $16 charge per seat which was required to be paid or no boarding pass. This added $92 to my flight cost. Round trip will be $184. The seats are ridged and dont recline. A greyhound bus seats are better. Most uncomfortable flight ever.

### "my return trip was absolute misery"
I purchased my tickets from Frontier Airlines and after a satisfactory trip to my destination, my return trip was absolute misery. Frontier cancelled my return trip and I was stuck for 2 days without a way home. I tried customer service several times. There was always a long wait and it always took several times explaining to get my message across. Finally, a rep promised to offer a full refund and email confirming such. I never received the email and never received the refund. After I finally returned home on another airline, Frontier Airlines customer service once again would not honor their word for a refund. Frontier is fine to save a few bucks but if you have any problem whatsoever, don't expect it to get resolved.

### "neither cheap nor a good experience"
Only positive of our Frontier Airlines trip is we arrived from our flight from Vegas to Orlando. If you are planning to book with Frontier you might want to consider their business practices. The price they give you is not the price you are paying. There are surcharges left and right. They consider any suitcase, regardless if it is a small carry-on or a checked bag, an optional service and charge you 30 to 50 $ per bag extra. This is not disclosed properly on booking sites. So if you plan to bring anything aboard you will be charged extra. They also charge extra if you want an exit row (its their version of first class). They want to charge you for a soda. I basically did not drink during the flight. They do not provide anything to eat, not even a bag of peanuts or a single pretzel on a 4 hour flight. Looking for something to plug your headphones in? Keep looking. No entertainment options whatsoever, not even if you would pay for it. No screen showing your travel stats, no movies, no music, no plug to recharge your electronic, no onboard wifi, no in-cabin skyphone. They don't even have a blanket or pillow on board. The absolute worst are the seats. Forget regular airplane seats as you know them from other airlines. The seats in a Frontier plane are made of a hard plastic shell with a very thin vinyl cover over it. They have pretty much no cushioning. The back of the seats are not a high as regular seats and sit very upright. They are incredibly uncomfortable. They are kind of curved forward so you remain in a slightly hunched position all the time. I had flown many 12 to 14 hour trips with a number of airlines before. Because of these terrible seats this 4 hours was worse than any other of the much longer flights. The seats are not only terribly uncomfortable, they are also very dangerous for tall people. The seat back is short and ends in the height of my neck. I am 6 foot 6 inches tall and if we had any turbulence I would hit my neck right at the hard upper edge of the seat. No cushioning to soften the blow. If you could choose another airline, even if you had to detour, I would strongly suggest that option. Jetblue and Southwest are pure luxury compare to the Frontier version of travel. Frontier is neither cheap nor a good experience.

### "I would try Frontier again"
There are many horror stories about Frontier Airlines lately, given their recent carry-on baggage charges, new skinny seats, etc. I wanted a good fare for an overnight trip to DTW from the Washington area. The choices? Delta from DCA was over $500. United from IAD the same. Southwest from Baltimore around $300. So I went to the Frontier website, and due to a special sale, I paid a total of $48.00 return, including a charge to select my window seats. The A320 in both direction was clean. Boarding was fine. The seats are indeed thin, but for me the ergonomics worked great and plenty of lower back support. Of course, this is a 55 minute flight one-way, and I only had a backpack. But I would try Frontier again, no question.

### "surprised they charge $30 for carry on"
We recently flew Frontier Airlines from Chicago to Vegas and back. We had flown in 2013 with Frontier and were surprised they now charge $30 for one carry on. Also, it seems all the seats have been changed with less padding. Less than an inch of padding in backs and seat, which makes for a very uncomfortable flight. The tray tables are half the size of a normal tray. The staff on the flight were rude and unprofessional. I am anxious on flights, and watch crew a lot. The fight attendants seemed frantic. At one time the co pilot spent 20 min outside the cockpit chatting with a stewardess. Very unprofessional!

### "just lost a long time customer"
I am incredibly disappointed in Frontier Airlines. Over the last 15 years I've flown numerous times and had never had complaints about them, but this new $30 for a carry on bag? Are you kidding? It has always been a free personal and free carry on bag as it is with many other airlines. There is absolutely no reason to be charging for a carry on bag. And the paying to sit together deal is ridiculous as well. Especially when it takes you through the screen to charge you $25-$30 to choose seats together, and then when I chose no thanks I'll take whatever, it gives me both seats together anyway. So I would have just spent more in stupid bag and seat fees than the ticket cost itself was. Get it together Frontier. You've just lost a long time customer.

### "other staff were unprofessional and rude"
Frontier Airlines sent an email describing unreal fares. I bought 2 tickets from Vegas to Washington DC for $75 each. Incredible, right? Wrong. There was no entertainment. Well, ok. The seats didn't recline and the table was smaller than half the size of a laptop. Well, again, for $75 ok. There was no free snacks or drinks. Soda was $2. If you purchased more than 1 seat and wanted to sit next to the other person the cost was between $9-$50 more. When I tried to board for the flight back to Vegas they kicked me out of line and told me I had to pay $60 for my carry-on bag. When I got my receipt for the bag it also included $107 for "fees and taxes" and $110 for "services". My total bill for my $150 flight ($75x2) was $316. Some of the airline employees that I dealt with were ok but others were unprofessional and rude.

### "never fly Frontier Airlines again"
The flight from San Francisco to Denver was delayed nine 9 hours. No one could tell us when the flight might leave, so we couldn't leave the gate area but for short periods. No effort was made to book passengers on alternative flights or airlines. They claim not to have partner airlines and I can understand why no one would partner with them. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again and would never recommend Frontier. The worst experience in 30+ years of flying.

### "we had to pay piecemeal for every item"
I have flown for over 42 years and must say that this flight with Frontier Airlines from Denver to Portland was the most disappointed I have ever been in an airline or in information given on a flight. As far as the flight attendants were concerned they seemed to do a very good job considering they had to spend more time as sales people than flight service. What bothered us most was we had to pay piecemeal for every item totaling $50.00+ more than another airline. I am unable to sit by the window and noted it in my reservations and was than given a seat next to the window. On the flight back we had to pay so I could get an aisle seat. Then nowhere were we told we would have to pay more for carryon than to check our bags, had we known this we would have combined luggage for one checked bag. Last the seats were hard, did not adjust, no entertainment and the instructions were jammed in as an afterthought. I am sorry to give this kind of report as most often I prefer to complement to complaint.

### "would never recommend Frontier"
My wife purchased these Frontier Airlines tickets, I cannot say how disappointed I was to find out that we have to pay for Carry-Ons. They say you are getting such a great deal, but then you have pay for something you do not have to pay for on other airlines. This is no deal. I would never recommend Frontier Airlines.

### "no one was willing to help me"
Although I got to the counter well before the cut-off time the Frontier employee told me it was too late to get my boarding pass printed or to check my bag. I luckily did manage to print my boarding pass at a self-checkin machine. At the gate I was told that it would have been possible to put my luggage on the flight simply by bringing it with me through security, although the lady at the counter had told me I couldn't get my bag on the flight anymore. The next day I called customer service for the error that was clearly made on their part. I was handed off from one person to the next and no one was willing to help me.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The good price deal was a scam. You pay extra for carry on's, check-in's, seats, seat changes (even if on accident), food and even drinks except water. They charge you for everything. So there was really no savings at all. Airlines have forgotten the art of good customer service and in the future I will try to avoid Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
It seems that the base fare is not reasonably acceptable, but actually punitive. The add on fees are basically required for any sort of convenient travel. The customer service is a total joke. I understand that it has been totally outsourced and it is evident from the lack of compassion shows to travelers after my flight was cancelled. I used to be a loyal Frontier traveler with a rewards program membership and credit card. I have since cancelled my card and gifted my several hundred thousand reward miles to friends and family. I actually feel a little guilty for this. Frontier was once my preferred airline of choice, now I'll pay in excess of a $100 premium not to fly them. This is what happens when you quit making your employees and customers a priority.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I purchased a ticket for my husband for his 60th birthday to fly from Cleveland, Ohio to Tampa, Fl to visit his brother. I was a bit nervous having purchased the ticket as a surprise and not knowing how things would go. However, I must say he was extremely impressed with how well things went. The flight to Tampa was on time and he said the staff was very friendly and helpful. The flight back was also enjoyable, both flights were on time and he felt the staff at both airports as well as the attendants on both flights were friendly. I would recommend.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My first time flying on Frontier and knowing what I was going to encounter beforehand, I was impressed. Easy online check-in, quick boarding, and departure/arrival. Cabin crew were pleasant on both flights. The only thing thing that I did not like was that the "Stretch Seating" seats do not recline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Our first flight was delayed an hour and our flight back (7pm) was cancelled after waiting 6 hours upon arrival. We were already on the runway, got sent back to the gate to "fuel up" again because of a "reroute". After an hour, they open up the gate because all of a sudden, there was another technical difficulty (same for first flight) that affected all Frontier airlines nationally. After waiting 6 hours upon arrival, our flight was cancelled. All the passengers marched to the front desk to wait in a line that soon turned into a rally. The employees were poorly equipped to handle scenarios like this. They decided to call the names of 180 passengers individually to hand them their hotel vouchers. They called about 50 names then the front desk agents decided to just abadoned the rest of the customers who were left to find their hotel vouchers with their name. They did tell us before hand that we can book our own hotel and be re-imbursed afterwards. I had no choice but to just book my own.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I had no idea what I was getting into when I made reservations with Frontier. They nickel and dime you to death. We had to pay extra not only for all luggage but also for our carry-ons. We had to pay to reserve any seat except the ones in the middle. We were traveling with a child but they wouldn't let us reserve seats to ensure that one of us could sit with the child without paying. Even a cup of water cost money on the plane. They were out of the most attractive snack. They told me I had to pay for these things because I booked with Expedia, but I don't think that is true. When I needed help with the boarding passes I got a woman I could hardly understand that I talked to for 45 minutes and she still couldn't tell me how to print the boarding passes. I called again and got somebody who told me in about 7 minutes.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The ticket price was cheap, and "you get what you pay for". From New Orleans to Denver I carried a bag on, after checking in the night before, and choosing to have a random seat instead of paying an extra $13 to choose a seat. The plane was standard with standard seats and tray tables. For the return portion of my round trip ticket, it was a nightmare. These folks are after every penny they can rip you off for. 45 minutes before the take off time, they called anyone who had a carry-on up to the desk, and had not paid while checking in. I was charged $60 for a small bag, and when the 40 or so people in the line complained we were told very abrasively, we could pay or stay on the ground. There was 1 employee trying to handle all the people who would need to pay and only when we collectively complained and asked for a supervisor did they bring another person out. That person was extremely rude, and when I asked for her name she refused to give it. The family behind had checked in at the main Frontier counter, had boarding passes printed for them there, and were not charged for bags. They had to cough up $240 at the counter 20 minutes before flight departure to board the plane. I will never fly this ariline again. I think their tactics are very deceptive.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
What was "tolerable" travel on Frontier has been reduced to a form of punishment - at every level. The telephone customer service is truly the worst I have encountered - repeatedly. A simple call requires repeating the most basic information many times, only to be put on hold many times, and asked the same questions. The reps have a script that they know how to read, but beyond that, there is no actual problem solving going on. They speak English, but comprehension is lacking. I don't need to check luggage, but I end up paying another $80 for seats and luggage on top of a not so great fare. The inflight experience is another worst in US travel. A broken plastic lawn chair would provide greater comfort than the new rigid, horribly uncomfortable seats that do not recline (unless you pay another $100 round trip (or pay to bundle) for one of the 18 "stretch" seats in the first 3 rows. The web site frequently has issues. The flight crew - no complaints, no compliments. They're no different than any other airline, which is to say they tolerate us passengers.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I used to like Frontier, and I would pick it over higher cost carriers. They had comfortable seats, their staff were pleasant and helpful, and I never had a problem with them. Then I flew them this weekend. It was the worst flying experience I have had. They charge you for everything, your seat, carry on luggage, a coke. We easily spent a couple of hundred dollars over the ticket price, so their "low cost" ticket turned out to be pretty expensive. Secondly, the seats are now just a frame with cheap plastic slung across it - it's very uncomfortable, they are packed in there, and you can't even recline. Thirdly, it's poorly run. At the airport, we had to wait in line for a half hour at the ticket counter, even though we had already checked in online and were just dropping off a bag. In short, pick any other airline-it will be cheaper in the end and you'll have a better experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Absolutely horrible. The seats are unbearable. No padding and they do not recline, they squeezed in two extra rows of seats at the cost of customer comfort and the seats are comparable to a city bus. The seat back is less than 2 inches thick of molded plastic covered with 1/4 foam and material. I would have paid double instead of being on that flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Awful. I cannot possibly list everything bad about this airline. Buying tickets is a pain because it is almost impossible to figure out exactly what the trip will cost. Redesigned cabin seats are horrible. Hard plastic with minimal padding. Staff is completely unwilling to help you out. Frontier management believes this model is what customers want. Comfort, pleasant staff and simple amenities are not important. Flying is hard enough. Frontier does everything they can to make it even worse. Avoid.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The check-in agents were disinterested and gave no sign of life when I bid them a casual "have a nice day" and didnt even look at me while checking my bag. Frontier has 2 lines, one for check-in and one for bag drop for online check in passengers. The kiosks were located in the front of the check in line meaning you still have to wait in the check-in line to use those (so much for saving time by skipping the line). I went through the usual security and onward to Houston George Bush Intl Airport Terminal A, nothing special there except the fact that the gate Frontier was to depart from (Gate A25) was horrendously crowded and so I had to resort sitting on the other side of the terminal. Boarding commenced at 3.05pm and I was welcomed onboard by a very enthusiastic and welcoming flight attendent, and went towards the back portion of the aircraft where I was shown to my seat. The seat itself was ok, it was the older dark green-black leather seats with the T Vs and full tray tables, they could recline but barely, but the headrest was pretty comfortable. The usual takeoff proceeded, I wanted to change seats as a gendtlemen talked onward endlessly and was spitting on my arm for over an hour, I went to a flight attendant and asked for a seat change and  I was relocated towards the front of the aircraft. I was pleasantly pleased with the enthusiasm of all 3 crews.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier happened to have a cheaper fare for my Atlanta - Denver flight. I arrived at the airport just over an hour before my flight which was very early in the morning. I had no bags to check and I figured it would be a brief swipe at the kiosk and I'd be on my way. I had no idea that Frontier has a 45 minute cut-off where they refuse to print boarding passes after that time, forcing you to miss your flight. The kiosk refused my information and wouldn't let me check in. I waited in line and watched the 45 minute timeline arrive and pass. By the time I got to the counter they refused to give me my boarding pass and suggested that I book the next flight at 8:10am. Frustrated, I called the airline with the number provided by the staff and was told it would be $100 to move me to the next flight, plus Frontier charges a $40 carry on fee? I'm used to paying $25 for my checked bag with Delta, which is why I made the effort to do only carry-on luggage this trip. I moved back over to the counter where there was no line and asked for my boarding pass. It was 1 hour before the flight. The staff told me the 45 minute window had closed again. Patiently, I told them I had gotten off the phone seconds ago and the woman told me that it was still "open" and that they could print my boarding pass. I also alerted them to the actual time. Oh" was the response! Do they have any clue the extent of the inconvenience they cause by simply not using their few active brain cells? They printed my boarding pass - never once mentioning that my original flight had been delayed to 8:45 - thereby saving me $100 and the stress and hassle of dealing with their ineptitude. Their flight attendants are sweet and I have nothing bad to say about them, but the staff that book flights and checks people is a study in illiteracy. I have never been so frustrated with an airline in my life. I've never written a scathing review on anything before now! Sorry Frontier, but you've lost my business. Your nickel-and-dime antics and lack of service will eventually earn you what you deserve.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Outgoing flight landed and required over an hour to get bags to the carousel. Representatives behind the counter were disinterested and refused to help. Seats were painfully uncomfortable for a 5 hour flight. Return flight paid the extra $50 per ticket for upgraded seats (Padded, reclining, and extra leg room). Got on the plane and found out the seats had extra leg room but were not padded and did not recline, another painful flight. Called for refund and was offered 50% back in vouchers. Will not fly this carrier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I wish I could give zero stars but that's not an option. This is the worst possible air carrier you could fly, pay the extra money and take another carrier. Frontier lost our bag in the midst of our best friends wedding, the staff at Denver were horrible and unhelpful. The phone numbers after 5 pm do not work. If you want your luggage lost and poor customer service, this is the air service you would want to choose. I was on the phone with them for about 4 hrs and they transferred me from person to person with no resolution. At the end of the day we never received our luggage.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew Frontier a few years ago and thought it was a great airline, how things have changed. Outbound - we were about to depart MSP when they started counting and recounting everyone. An hour later they were still counting passengers. Finally told they had a security issue and started checking off everyone's name on the flight. We ended up taking off 2 hours and 15 mins late! On the way return we got to the airport and were told our flight would be 3 hours and 10 mins late. Then told it will be 2 hours 55 mins late, left us waiting in a very small and cramped departure area with no food.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I would not recommend using this airline. My flight was delayed 6 hours and all I could get was sorry, a $25 food credit, and maybe $100 credit to use for future flight. This airline charged me to checked my bags that have not been refunded and everyone that works for Frontier is acting like it's OK to have people at the airport for more than 6 hours. Cheaper is not always better.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Forget about choosing your seat during online check-in unless you desire to pay for the privilege. If you elect to not pay, the system chooses for you. Baggage fees: Many so-called low cost airlines now charge baggage fees for carry-on bags, however, it is as if Frontier has a scam to collect extra baggage fees. At no point in the process was it apparent there is a fee for carry-on baggage. I checked-in online and paid checked-bag fees, I did not see anything about fees for carry-on bags. At the check-in desk, the agent said nothing about carry-on bag fees. At the gate I was forced to pay $60 for a small carry-on bag. I was one of at least 6 other passengers who learned this at the gate, all of us were surprised and appalled about the lack of information on this fee. The gate agent told me they aren't req'd to inform passengers about the fee at check-in. He said the cost is $25 if paid online, $40 if paid at the check-in desk, $60 if paid at the gate. If I had known this, I would not have had a carry-on bag. We were 3 passengers with 2 checked bags and 1 small carry-on bag. If we had taken 3 carry-ons, I would have had to pay $180 dollars at the gate. Also, the seats were terrible, and the service reps were cold and uninformative. Last trip with Frontier.

Frontier Airlines say their seats don't recline, but Row 13 is the only row where the seats do recline on their A319. I was seated on row 14 and as soon as the flight departed Denver (Flt 612 on July 26), the three people in front of me recline their seats and laughed loudly that they paid $50 more for a first class seats. Row 13 is an exit row. It made the overnight flight very uncomfortable for me since my seat did not recline and my knees were firmly pressed up against the seat in front of me for 3.5 hours. During the beverage service, the flights attendant approached each person saying, "would you like to purchase a cocktail, soft drink, or snack". I ordered a water and was surprised to hear her serving wine to the person directly behind me. I looked up at her and said excuse me and she just said, "I'll be right with you" with a bit of an attitude. I guess if I paid $4 for the water I would have been served before the person behind me. When you add up the flight, extra costs ($3 for a seat selection, $25 for a carry-on bag, $30 for a checked bag, and $4 for a soda or $6.99 for a beer), I really didn't save anything by flying Frontier. I am most surprised that Frontier apparently charges $50 more for Row 13. It seems very unfair the only row that reclines is Row 13 and anyone seated on Row 14 gets a seat back in there face. I gave it a try, but I will not make that mistake again. Frontier may be a discount carrier, but they are not the cheapest once you start adding in all the extras. Buyer beware.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We flew Frontier for the first time on 6/23/2015. We were very happy to discover an airline that flew into Trenton N.J. close to our family. The flight up was on time and much more convenient than spending seventeen hours driving one thousand miles in a car. Our return flight was scheduled 6am on 6/30/2015, flight 917 from Trenton to Orlando. We started to board on time but were told to return to the terminal due to a mechanical problem. After waiting three hours with little information from Frontier staff we were told our flight was cancelled!Two staff members from Frontier Airlines were at the gate passing out letters stating Frontier airlines would reimburse passengers up to four hundred dollars for another flight and assist with accommodations so passengers could complete their travel. There was no one from Frontier to assist with anything! Due to the fourth of July holiday we were unable to get on another flight for several days. We felt our only option to return home to Florida was to rent a car and drive one thousand miles.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Terrible customer service, bag fees cost almost as much as the ticket ($198 for a 1 hour flight from Atlanta to Indianapolis. Bags are $70 each way [$40 for carryon and $30 for checked]. That's $140 for bags alone). Flight attendants were rude and the only thing you get for free on this flight is water, cramped seats, and flight delays.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight attendants loudly cackled in the galley throughout the overnight flight preventing my family from sleeping. A drunken woman walked laps up and down the length of the plane because sitting "ain't good for your circulational system". Drinks were overpriced, everything costs extra, but the worst were the seats! The plastic framed, foam rubber cushioned, non-reclining seats, with tray tables the size of smart phones were torturous! To top it all off, my daughter's tray table was broken and held in place with duct tape!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The baggage fee was better then some (not Southwest because they are free) of the other airlines, $20 check in when you it when you make your reservations. Traveling from Las Vegas to Kentucky (CVG). Total price was $278 with flight, seats, baggage round trip. The staff were very polite. Yes I will fly again. Yes you have to pay for soda but if you really look at it, I fly Southwest all the time. Ticket price is around 398-472 round trip for me. I got airlines and car rental (10days) for 485.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Single handedly the worst airline I have flown with. First airline I have encountered where you have to go to the International Terminal to check in for a Domestic flight (with no warning or anything in any of the three emails sent prior to the flight). As a result I missed the check in time for baggage, despite arriving at the airport the 1.5 hours prior to the flight that they recommend. Were unable to check me in, and charged $75 to change my flight to the next one, which wasnt for a full 24 hours.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Second time flying this route and second time the plane was delayed over an hour. I flew a month ago and the plane was delayed three hours. I also flew Trenton to Charlotte this past year and was delayed two to three hours.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The flight was delayed because of weight issues with the plane. They had taken out the nice seats with the directv entertainment system and put in smaller and narrower seats so they can fit in more passengers. I was also informed by one of the flight attendants that all of their planes are going to have their seats replaced and will no longer offer the directv service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Traveled on July 4, 2015 and had a terrible experience. First the check-in rep gave my mother, who was traveling with me (there were 5 of us), the wrong boarding pass. Yes, with all the airport security, etc., and although my mother did hand the rep her Drivers License, the rep gave her someone else's boarding pass. Mother is elderly, so had I not checked her boarding pass, she would have ended up goodness knows where. Secondly, when I arrive in CLT my bag did not arrive with me! No apology, nothing! The rep calls me the next day (July 5th) to tell me the bag had arrived and I should go get it. Of course, it was too late for that being that I was scheduled to return to PHL on Tuesday 7/7. My flight back from CLT to PHL was delayed 2 hours. Yes, the airfare is inexpensive, but the customer service is terrible. I will pay a higher fare next time and get better service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
It is not cheaper considering there is an extra charge for carry on for each leg of the trip, charge for drinks, not even free peanuts. Delayed out by 2 hrs for maintenance. Delayed again coming home for same reason. People at the desks are rude. Will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Plane had mechanical issues so the flight was delayed by 5 hours. My four year old wouldn't sleep until 1am. All FA's offered was a meal voucher. I had a special event which I missed, had to re-book ground and air reservations etc. Every time I book this airline there are issues. I have learned my lesson and will pay more for a more reliable carrier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I that this is meant to be a budget carrier but there is no excuse for untrained, poor staff who don't understand basic customer service. At check in customers have to pay $30 for their carry-on cabin bag, I was informed that only one personal item was free. On boarding all luggage racks were empty for obvious reasons, welcome onboard announcement failed to advise of normal flight times, weather conditions.. Crew unsure what to say. We experienced turbulence during the flight, Captain failed to put return to seat signs on a number of times. Crew did not manage the cabin or provide any customer service thoughout the flight, no entertainment or wifi in the cabin whatsoever, no complimentary drinks.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I purchased a book to read on this trip, but could not read it going or coming because the overhead light above my seat did not work. On the trip home, I opted to watch their TV channels, but monitors on my row did not work either. Be sure to select your own seat prior to boarding, if you choose to Fly Frontier Airlines. I was randomly given a seat in front of the exit row by the clerk when I checked in. The seats directly in front of the exit row will not recline backwards, so on a late night 4-hour flight, I had to sleep in an upright position. It was very uncomfortable. You can ask for a cup of Frontier's very fine water on ice and they will give it to you at no additional charge.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Second delay in 4 days. First delay 4.5 hours. Second delay was going home. One hour and still waiting! Both due to mechanical issues. Bags took 30 minutes to get bags at baggage claim.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I understood that Frontier was a low cost airline and that many "extras" had additional fees associated with them. What I didn't realize was that if you paid the fees, they would not provide the service you paid for. I chose to pay the extra fees for seat selection so that my party could sit together and my children would not have to sit next to a stranger. I booked 8 seats and chose the seats from Frontier's seat selection menu. When we arrived at the airport, the seats had been changed and we were no longer seated as a group. The agent told me there was nothing they could do about it since our seats had already been assigned to someone else. So, we were split up on our flight. I was told that not only could we not sit together, they had no power to refund the seat selection fees that had already been paid. I would have to call and talk with "Customer Relations. I have now made 3 phone calls to customer relations and spent a total of 2.5 hours on the phone. Again I am told that "customer relations is working on it". I waited and again, no call back.

I checked into the airport 5am on the 11th June. I'm a wheelchair passenger. I was told someone would be with me shortly. I sat for almost an hour waiting. Finally a lady told me they were short staffed so I would have to wait so I waited. My flight left for New York at 6.15, I barely made my flight and I was the last one on the plane. My flight on the other hand was ok. Would fly with Frontier Airline as long as I'm not in a wheelchair.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier is no different from other US based airlines. Same lower quality interiors, comfort, poorer service and lack of respect for economy class passengers. Frontier goes a step forward and uses the following tactics to foster its revenues: 1) Bait and switch schedules. 2) Nickel and dime everything from seat selection, food, beverages, and carry on bags. My family booked a flight back in January for a journey in April. We thought we got a good price and a schedule that fit our needs. Few weeks later we were contacted by our travel agent to inform us that Frontier had canceled the return flight. We were offered the following choices: 1) Go on a flight the following day - Frontier would not compensate for any added expenses. 2) Cancel for no charge and rebook on another airline for an additional $400, because tickets prices had increased in the interim. We were pretty much forced to go with option 1. Also, while doing an online check-in the Frontier system pretty much "confuses" you into paying unnecessary fees. We had the foresight to skip that process during seat selection, whereby it automatically assigned us a seat without additional fees. We were not so lucky as it suckered us to pay cabin baggage fees that no one bothered to check at the gates and smarter passengers had avoided. Essentially the system threatens you will be charged more at the gate and that you are better of paying online. I'd take my chances at the gate.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
If you're traveling for business, or travel where you need travel to be on time and reliable don't fly Frontier Airlines. My wife and I made the mistake of booking Frontier Airlines for our honeymoon. We had our flight information changed 3 times. They changed the whole day of travel, causing us to have to reschedule our motel, they changed times on us and then on the week of my wedding when we had enough other things going on they changed our flight times just a few days before we left. I called to ask them about this and they offered no explanation. I can't imagine using them again when I need a reliable flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I compared Frontier with other airlines before purchasing my ticket. I paid $253 for a round-trip ticket from Washington-Dulles to Orland- which included upcharges for a seats $40 ($20 each way) and a checked bag fee of $50 ($25 each way). I checked in and boarded without a problem. The seats are incredibly thin and hard. I was in row 6 and the seats don't recline. There are no TVs in the headrest and no inflight entertainment. I arrived to the airport for the flight back extremely early as the rest of my family was driving back and Frontier only has only one flight departing Orlando at 8:40PM. Around 8, I was texting my parents in DC and they told me they lost power because of a storm. There was no agent at the gate to tell us the status of our flight. At 8:30 there was still no gate agent. Then with no announcement and no gate agent present, the flight went from saying "on time" to 11:40PM. People started to get panicky. A little after 9PM finally a gate agent comes up and gets on the loud speaker and says "Your flight has been cancelled, please see an agent to rebook your flight. I went back to check-in and the agents were confused. We didn't know the flight was cancelled. We're just finding out like you. You need to call customer service. Since there is only one departing flight per day, I knew the rebooking situation would be bleak. So, I decided to get a hotel room rather than spend 24hrs in the airport. It was after 10PM before I checked in. I then spent over an hour on the phone with customer service, who rebooked me on the 8:40PM flight for the following night. But the thought of spending another 10hrs+ in the airport literally brought me to tears. So I booked a one-way ticket on US Airways to DCA. Attempting to save $100, ended up costing me more than $340 - not to mention meals while I was waiting. In the end Frontier credited me $56 to use on a future fare, which I will never use because I'm never flying with them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
First time on Frontier, Tampa to Cleveland. Went "Classic" which included free bag check-in, assigned seat (in "Stretch Seating", aisles 1-4), and Zone 1 boarding. Inbound aircraft was late. The other plane at TPA due for DEN was 3 hours late to properly rest the crew (obviously late the night before inbound). The one good thing were the seats, very comfortable and in dark green leather, with plenty of leg room, at least in the "Stretch" area. Cabin service was mediocre, $4.49 for an oversized Rice Crispie treat and a cup of coffee (and the stewardess had forgotten the coffee, granted a mistake, until being reminded, and she was very apologetic about it). Timekeeping is a problem at Frontier, this seems to be a regular thing. Would only fly them non-stop, and have contingency plans at the ready.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have never written a review, much less a negative one, before. Frontier used to be a great airline from start to finish. Found out they were bought by Spirit, considered the rock bottom airline. I was careful to pick a good connecting airline considering baggage rates. I was gouged at check in with my large purse fee. Frontier has clearly taken on Spirit's m.o. s.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Horrible customer service, horrible planes. I was flying from San Francisco to Orlando with a layover in Denver (at least that's what it said on our itinerary email). We're then told there's actually two stops, one in Denver, one in Chicago. The flight from Denver to Chicago was 2 hours late. Then we sat for an hour on the tarmac. Then we arrive at Chicago and they tell us our flight to Orlando left 3 hours ago - they knew they were sending us to Chicago when the last flight to Orlando had already left. There were no apologies issued at any point, they just kept insisting that it was due to weather. Then of course they did not offer any refund, or partial refund, credits, nothing. The employees "helping" us get out of this fiasco were rude. They kept telling us there were no more flights until Wednesday (this was taking place on Monday). Other passengers started just booking flights on other airlines and when most of them had disappeared they actually started helping us. We got a direct flight to Orlando 17 hours later and had to fly back to Denver first. Horrible experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Well to start with it's a bit of a swizz that we have to pay an additional fee for seats to ensure that your family sit together, but whatever. Our flight to Denver (due out at 7.50pm) was cancelled. Option to transfer to another airline flying to Denver? Nope (not unless we pay). Complimentary hotel due to the fact that we are now Stuck in New Orleans overnight? Nope. Complimentary meal tickets? Nope. Flight out in the morning? Nope. Refund? No-one was forthcoming on that so I still don't know if that was an option. Rescheduled on another flight almost 24hrs later, lets hope it's not delayed or cancelled

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Encountered the worst customer service with Frontier. From the desk agents who stood around for 20 minutes and then claimed we came in late to the customer support, they all were rude and unfriendly and offered absolutely no support to help get us home in time. They lure you in with cheap tickets and then charge ridiculous for everything, and by the time all is said and done, you spend more then you would have to just fly Southwest or something. Will never consider flying with Frontier, and suggest the same to everyone who doesn't want to get a headache from something as simple as flying A to B.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
One way flight from Atlanta to New Orleans. Was very worried after booking and reading so many bad reviews. Flight was delayed almost 2 hours due to a storm but we were well informed with updates by staff in waiting area. When I got on board I was pleasantly surprised with the leather, or what appeared to be leather, seats and they were very comfortable. The flight staff were very attentive and the flight was smooth as glass. So I'm glad I had what seems to be one of the rare good flights. No problems except for the delay. Would have spent way more money driving down and didn't have that long drive. I'm satisfied!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier has officially landed at the absolute bottom of the airlines. Planes have recently been "remodelled" to include hard plastic seats that don't recline and tray tables that are the width of a cup. On our last flight from Las Vegas to Cleveland, we arrived early (big mistake). Ours may have been the only boarding passes printed with the wrong gate. When we finally realized it, the plane was pulling away from the gate. No announcement or email message (but they can bombard me with ads on my email account). Next plane was nine hours later (overnight). And to add insult to injury, charged us a $75 per person change fee. No offer to food or hotel or alternate airline. Just tough luck.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Sure, you might expect that when booking with an "ultra low fare" airline that it will be skimpy. Come on, though. Charging for a carry on? Does the airline actually think people travel with only a purse or briefcase? Of course not. Just add $35 to the price of the ticket. And for coffee? The flight attendant actually told me that one cup pays for the whole pot. That piece of data is not surprising, but the fact that she told me only reinforced my observation that the majority of the staff of Frontier display an embarrassed, apologetic demeanour. I would too. There is just no room for this type of nickel and dime approach in a competitive space. Cheers to Southwest for not going this direction. At some point Frontier will run out of first time fliers to fool with their supposed lower rates. Then, everyone will have made the same decision I have made: never fly them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I had to plan a cheap trip from Texas to Delaware. I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to get through security and get to my gate however the line to get my ticket from Frontiers desk at IAH was long. No one was at the front because it is their policy at IAH to not take customers until two hours before the next flight. When I finally got my ticket I found out I had to pay an additional $35 to carry my suitcase on the plane because the ticket prices do not include carry ons. I guess Frontier thinks people that travel do not need to take anything with them. Then I had to get through security which the lines were long. By the time I got to my gate the plane was already boarding. My return flight I had to pay another additional $35 for my carry on. My total price for my ticket went up by $70. If I had known that I would have gotten a ticket through Delta or US Airlines. I will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight 506. Denver to LaGuardia May 15th. Don't fly frontier! The arm rest has been reduced to less than an inch in width the seats are plastic without any comfort and they don't even recline. The tray table is only 4" in depth which I guess is all you need for the extra small cup of water you get which is the only complimentary beverage. No snacks no inflight TV no business or first class and actually no class whatsoever. For a 3.5 hour flight to the east coast it was miserable.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
F9 916 5/31/15 and F9 1287 6/1/15. The seats were uncomfortable my seat woul not recline and it was hard as a rock. The hidden charges made the flight overly expensive added 90 dollars to my trip each way for seat choice and small bag carry-on. The service was terrible and no one around to answer questions at the Chicago airport. I ordered a Chardonnay off the menu and it came in a can with a gorilla face on it marked white wine and it had bubbles in it I took one sip and could not drink the rest it was horrible a waste of $7. None of the attendants or counter people were friendly or helpful. I usually fly Southwest and hope I never have to fly frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
5 hour delay coming from Miami Fl to Denver Co on June 2nd 2015. No complementary anything was offered. Worst planes. Now the seats are very small the tray in front of you only hold 2 cups. My last time flying with Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
First time flying with them and my last. I was flying from Atlanta to Orlando could not check in online. Kiosks were not working so I stood in line to check in and the attendant gave me attitude for coming to the desk. The airline gave me the incorrect gate number and once I figured out which gate I needed to go to the airline changed it and we had to move - very unorganized. Once they found a gate for us the plane was delayed 2 hours for mechanical issues. No one informed passengers of the delay. I wouldn't have know except that my smart phone informed me. After waiting 2 hours we boarded sat for 30 more minutes before going out to the runway. Once there we were told the plane still had problems so back to the gate we want where we were taken off the plane. I gave up and went home as I am not getting on a broken plane with such unorganized and rude staff. The plane was supposed to depart at 12:15 it is now 6.30 and it still hasn't left Atlanta. I will never fly with them again. Very unprofessional staff.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I had a flight from Miami to Washington Dulles with Frontier. When I searched on google I was a little worried when I booked this flight since the price was only half compared to those of other airlines (even after adding the baggage fee). But nothing was wrong. Perfect flight. Take off and landing on time. Check-in fast. Baggage fast. I have nothing to complain. That they charge for the baggage and the food is quite normal in my opinion. The prices for those services are reasonable. If you accept the cheap airplane tickets they provide that is part of the additional costs one has to accept too. Anyway highly recommend!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My fiancé and I flew from Portland Or to Memphis TN. My first slight shock came when it was apparent that we had to pay for drinks which on every other airline I have flown this was complementary. It also seemed that anything extra had a cost to it. But my biggest complaint was when we were returning home. Our flight was delayed an hour. No announcement was made to the passengers or any explanation was given. When we boarded we waited another half hour to take off due to computer issues. We ended up missing our connecting flight to our home city. It took the customer service reps two hours to give us our stand by tickets and food vouchers. They also were unsure about how the hotel voucher worked. Speaking of hotel they didn't have any rooms in their system for us so the voucher was pretty much pointless. So as a well traveled person I would not recommend this airline to anyone no matter how cheap they are.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was by far the worst travel experience. I flew from ATL to PDX with a connection in Denver. Our flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours and we spent an additional hour on the runway because Frontier was short staffed and could not find anyone to direct the flight out. We were told that our connecting flight was aware of the delay and waiting at the gate for us. Little did we know they rebooked the entire flight before we even departed from Atlanta with no intention of holding the plane. When we arrived there was no gate available and 20 passengers missed their connecting flight. Frontier customer service was extremely rude. They did not offer any vouchers and told customers that all hotels were booked and passengers would have to remain in the airport for up to 2 days. There were elderly and sickly people scattered all over the airport sleeping on floors and chairs. One family had to purchase 6 new tickets on Delta airlines because Frontier did not have a flight to put them on for 2 whole days. Although airfare appears reasonable please keep in mind that there is a seating fee for up to $35. Both carry on bags and checked bags cost between $25-$35. Water is free but all other beverages cost $2.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We boarded Frontier flight 607 from Miami on 5/15/15 at 1.08pm. We watched the flight land and unload and within 5 mins we boarded the plane. After everyone boarded this was a full flight the door was shut the captain came on and stated we had to have a tyre change. After over an hour the captain came back on and said we needed to have a 2nd tyre changed. We spent from 1.08pm until 3.40pm on this plane before takeoff on a fully booked airbus shoulder to shoulder very uncomfortable seats and without a single offering of a drink or food item. While I appreciate and understand safety this is absolutely uncalled for! The very least they could have offered was a complimentary drink but no we had to pay $2 for a canned soda. We spent a total of 4 hours on this plane! The seats on Frontier are plastic and very uncomfortable! They also state they are committed to serving customers but that is not what we experienced on this flight. Customer service is lacking.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I took Frontier from LAX to DEN to DWT. In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.

I took Frontier Airlines from Houston IAH to San Francisco SFO on Saturday May 2nd and returned on Wednesday May 6th. The airline gives complimentary water and was punctual to the destinations. Had no issues with luggage nor seating.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew Frontier from SFO-MSY. I had to pay for seats on both flights totalling $70 plus a checked bag fee for both flights totalling $40. On top of a $500 ticket it cost me $110 extra just to get a seat and to check one bag. All the drinks and food on the plane are extra. On top of that when I arrived in New Orleans only half of the passengers received their checked luggage. The rest of us waited over an hour for someone to help us and after that they found our bags in the back of the baggage claim where someone forgot to put them on the carousel. Today (5/7/15) I get to the airport for my return trip - everyone was ready to board when someone comes out at the gate to tell us that our flight was delayed for four hours because Frontier didn't have a crew for the flight. The woman who made the announcement quickly walked away leaving all the passengers standing in disbelief. I go to the ticket counter to have them find a flight from Denver to San Francisco because I was going to miss my connection. I was put on hold 45 minutes and talked to four different people.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I've been flying Frontier between Dulles and Orlando on a regular basis (once or twice a month) since they started the service last summer. They are having scheduling issues flights are late 70-80% of the time. They charge for everything since I have no luggage only a computer bag that's ok. I reserve a seat since I don't want a middle one and that recently went from $3 to $8. All this is ok for a two hour flight (beats driving) except that the plane I have been flying on lately has the thinnest most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on in an airplane. Not sure if this is an exception or this is the new normal? Overall they're ok and the flight delays are becoming shorter and less frequent.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My family and I flew round-trip from Cleveland to Orlando and I am happy to report that we had great experiences on both flights. All Frontier airport staff/flight attendants were very friendly. Neither flight was delayed at all in fact we reached our destination ahead of schedule both times. I will say that we were annoyed by the extra charges for choosing seats (which I did because one of my companions is a very nervous flyer and I didn't want her to be alone) and carry-on bags (which again we did - checking bags is the cheaper option but I prefer the ease of carry-on luggage whenever possible) however getting to/from our destination safely and efficiently is top priority. I would certainly recommend Frontier to others but just make sure you look into all the charges before you book so you know what's coming.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew at the end of April 2015 from CVG-LAS round-trip. First experience on Frontier. I had researched pretty well so I knew all about the extra fees. I paid in advance for a checked bag and an upgraded stretch seat. Seat was very average at best but on a long flight the leg space was worth it. It was my first time checking a bag in years as I couldn't justify spending more to carry my bag on. A bit of a hassle but probably would not stop me from flying them again. Flights were on time and went off without complication. They really hustle to turn the planes around quickly. That also means that they don't get cleaned very well as this is the flight crews job. Floor of the plane was filthy and general upkeep was neglected. Definitely no frills but they did get me and my luggage from point A to point B safely and on time.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Denver to Dallas 4/22 flight 124 and from Houston to Denver 4/26 flight 247. I fly Frontier all of the time out of Denver and have never had any issues at all. One of the few carriers to have TVs on every flight. I have never been delayed. It blows my mind that there are so any bad reviews. You just bought an airline ticket for 100's under other carriers and you don't expect to be charged other places? It's not even that terrible of up charges. Yes to pick your seat if you want to and to check or carryon a bag but you still are 100's under other carriers prices. Go into knowing there will be fees it's nowhere near as bad as spirits fees and the prices are cheaper. The planes are nicer and the pilots are top notch.

Always remember that you get what you pay for. This airline lures you with low fares then has lots of add ons. $35 for a carry on #25 for a checked back and also you have to pay to select a seat. Minimal staffing at airport so unable to answer questions. Flight from DEN-LAS delayed 4 hours due to mechanical delay no support from airport staff. Return flight boarded 45 min early with final call 30 min before scheduled departure because they wanted to leave early. Worst turbulence ever on approach into DEN never had with other airlines even in bad weather. Would not recommend. Crew not particularly friendly.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have been a "road warrior" for over 15 years. My schedule for weekly air travel has been fairly consistent throughout that time-I'm usually on a plane every week. Needless to say I have pretty much flown every airline out there. When we moved to Denver 4 years ago Frontier became my "go to" airline. Great staff great service lots of direct flights and they were usually on-time. Wow with the new ownership and pricing model apparently you can kiss all of that goodbye! Sad to say that the best air carrier has completely imploded. Stay away. Do not buy into the cheap airfare inducement.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Worst experience on an airline ever for this frequent traveler. Due to mechanical failure on the aircraft they left us stranded in Orlando in early March. They kept us at bay until they boarded three other flights in their terminal "pod" I suppose to thin the crowd that could have got fired up. 5 hours after scheduled departure they told us flight cancelled. They were working on getting hotel accommodations and transportation but could not tell us about return flight info. It was approaching midnight and I had to be back home in the AM. We booked a flight on US Airways who as always took great care of us. We spent the night on the floor in the airport. They do not respond to complaints nor have they made any effort towards remedying their failure. Horrible customer service. Horrible airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I took a 5 hour flight from Dulles to Vegas. I wasn't sitting with my boyfriend who I booked the flight with. We were delayed nearly 2 hours. The seats were like sitting on a rock and my seat recline was broken. To watch TV was 5.99 to get a soda was 2.99! On the way home we got to sit together but there weren't any TVs and none of the seats reclined. The flight home boarded a hour early and took off early which those of us who were there appreciated but a lot of people got left behind. I will go back to flying with Delta!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight F9 1256 4/15/15. I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus. Expect to get from point A to point B nothing more. Plan on bringing a pillow and a book to make the flight more comfortable.

March 15 flight #1127. March 20 flight #1126. I booked flights with Frontier Airlines before knowing anything about the airline. My husband researched them and had us very nervous about flying with them due to reports of cancelled and late flights. I called customer service and they were very helpful and courteous. After talking with them I felt comfortable with the reservations. The flight out of Dulles was 30 minutes late but we still arrived in Las Vegas 15 minutes early. On the return flight we left 15 minutes late and arrived at Dulles 45 minutes early. I have no complaints at all.

Denver to Seattle April 8 2015 flt 137. Seattle to Denver April 12 2015 flt 146. The seats were uncomfortable and leg room was not sufficient. The extra carry on bag fee was $40.00 and cokes were about $3. Terrible experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The only thing that had any value was my seat and I was by the emergency window. I had great leg space but as for the service on the flight. The flight attendant seemed she didn't really care no smile. As for the pricing it was a cheap flight but everything else cost: the drinks (non-alcohol) on the flight and the snacks. The bags I got charged for every bag. I will not fly Frontier just like I have not flown Alaska Airlines.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Been flying from Orlando to Washington Dulles every week since June their inaugural flight. Never saw such a decline in service. Upgraded seats went. From 25 to 45$. Seats went from a nice leather to a hard smaller seat that does not even recline. Just cram more seats. No leg room. Seven out of ten flights are always delayed. I have three more flights then going back to another airlines. Would rather pay more. Actually everything Frontier charges for it is cheaper to fly elsewhere.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I am laying on the terminal floor as I type this. I was scheduled to fly to ORD from MCO this evening at 6.45. There were heavy storms in the Midwest so our flight was initially delayed. This happens. However the way this airline handled this delay was nothing short of appalling. The website said the flight would be delayed a little less than an hour. Upon arrival at the gate there is absolutely no info on out flight. Finally after 3 hrs the young woman at the gate tells us that the flight should get to Orlando around 12.15am and that's "all she knows". We all wait. Meanwhile the skies are all clear in Chicago and all other flights are starting to get moving. Then at about 11pm we are told that the plane has not yet pushed back in Chicago and is sitting at the gate and now the flight will be around 2:45am. At this point we all start to ask if the flight will be cancelled so we can all make other arrangements and find lodging. The attendant once again says that this is all the info she has. One man asks "you work for the airline can't you at least call to see if you can find anything out? Her response "no I can't. She eventually disappears. Then shortly after midnight a man get on the intercom and informs us (very casually) that the flight is cancelled but "since it has do to with weather we aren't going to make any accommodations for anyone. If you want we can give you s number that you can call to try and figure this out fit yourselves. They preceded to write down the same 800 number from the website on ripped pieces of paper and hand it out to anyone who asked. In defence of the attendants they seemed like they honestly had no idea what was going on and were just as frustrated as many of the passengers. Upon calling the airline I was put on hold for over 45 mins with no response. All in all it was an awful experience and the incompetence of this airline seemingly knows no bounds. I am currently stuck in Orlando with a choice of paying over $700 for a one way domestic flight or renting a car and driving 20hrs to get home because this airline cancelled my flight and offered no solution or assistance whatsoever. I will never fly Frontier again!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Even though we enjoyed the convenience of the 5 minutes walk between our parking spot and the check-in counter at Trenton Airport having to pay for any checked luggage and specific seats so my partner and I could seat side by side was vexatious. Flight attendants were very pleasant but the 2-hour wait after disembarking at Hartsfield- Jackson (Atlanta) to get our checked luggage was exasperating.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight was delayed on my way to Naples FL from Cleveland OH. No notification and no staff around. Finally 1 hour later we were told there wasn't staff for our plane. On my way back home my seat was double sold! Tried to offer me another seat but it was away from my daughter whom I was flying with. Staff were difficult just said "you want to get home don't you"? Then to top it off my luggage was lost! How does that happen on a non-stop flight?

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Bad service. Paid for seat upgrade but video monitor did not work. Every seat except middle seats behind the wing have an upgrade fee. Beverage service is poor at best and even a Coke costs $3 ("but you get the whole can"). Bag fees are increasing yet again. As a Denver native I am sad to say I will never fly Frontier again and will discourage anybody else from doing so. Like with Spirit Air Indigo Partners ruined another once great airline. But hey they turn the biggest profit in the industry so screw the passengers.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I did not have any baggage to check and my only carry-on was a backpack that fit under the seat. I arrived at SeaTac in plenty of time for my flight so that I could print out my boarding pass (I had already checked in online) only to find that none of the kiosks were working. So I waited over an hour for the counter to open only to be treated to a rep yelling at everyone for not checking in at the kiosk. Finally the other rep got her to listen that the kiosks didn't work. Upon arrival at the airport my flight was listed as on time. After a gate change to clear across the airport we were told that the flight was delayed by 4.5 hours. No one to speak with since no agents at the gate. By 10pm 3 hours post original flight time the flight was listed as delayed another 3 hours! Again no agents to speak with. I had signed up for text/phone/email notifications and none were ever received. We ended up arriving 8 hours after our arrival time. I had to take another day off of work and it was a very long night. The flight crew was pleasant but again no compensation of any kind for our troubles. You would think that if Frontier cared at all about their passengers that we could at least get a free soda. This was my last Frontier flight! Not worth the time and aggravation. We never did get a realistic reason for the delay.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Will never fly Frontier Airlines again. We were scheduled to fly to Tucson via Milwaukee to Denver to Tucson. When checking in in Milwaukee we were told our outbound Milwaukee to Denver flight was delayed by two hours. As a result we would miss our Denver to Tucson flight. For the next 75 minutes we waited to be rebooked on a flight arriving in Tucson 24 hours later. Terrible service. No apologies nothing. You get what you pay for with this airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier Airlines is ranked as a 3 star carrier. Really? On a scale of 1 to 5 stars 3 stars means an airline is average. That has not been my experience on Frontier and I think on a whole the airline is substandard. My recent flight round-trip from PDX to DEN was miserable. They charge for baggage-checked and carry on and they even charge for a cup of coffee or soda! The flight attendants are grumpy and not customer service oriented flights are late without any reason or apologies from the ground crew and leg room is non-existent. Better fares abound on Southwest so choose wisely.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I bought my tickets before reading the reviews and when I started to read the reviews I started to regret buying the cheap tickets but it was too late. I flew from Orlando back to Chicago and I have to really say that I'm glad I bought the tickets before reading the reviews or I wouldn't have bought them. High points of the flight? They have a TV and the seats were actually comfortable. I'm a plus size girl and I fit and my legs didn't feel cramped at all. So for those of you who had a bad experience try it again maybe it was a bad day for everyone that day. But do bring your own snacks and drink because the prices are ridiculous onboard.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The customer service is unacceptable and unhelpful and the flights are frequently delayed and canceled. This airline will tempt you with lower fares and then make you pay for each carry-on bag and each checked bag as well. It's a tactic that has apparently been working for them because their buyers are ignorant and don't check these things first so please don't be one of those customers like I was. My only advice is turn around and book somewhere else.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have been a summit member for over ten years. They have methodically reduced all of the benefits for being a frequent flier until they are now nearly non-existent. The staff on the phone when you can get through are tired and it is easy to see that they very much dislike their jobs. The flight attendants on too many of my recent flights are also grumbling and service is sketchy at best. On a recent flight from Denver going south the attendants did not start the beverage service until we were more than two thirds the way to the destination and did not prepare the cabin for landing until the pilot announced "Attendants please prepare for landing. Speaking with a number of people we have all encountered hang-ups when trying to speak to an agent.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The usual complaint about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. We packed individually a total of four carry on for a total of $200 round trip and we had to checked them not bring as carry on. Second they changed our returning flight from 11pm to 9am we lost a day of our vacation! Then we had to purchase assigned seats to ensure we sit together. Third they only provide free water everything else had to pay even $3.00 for a can of soda. Only snacks for a 7 hour flight to Las Vegas. Fourth staff did not communicate we had special service stop in Cincinnati and we're told to get out of the plane and then they called us in about 5 minutes to hurry up that we should have never got out of the plane. Six our returning flight was awful we sit inside the airplane for an hour they said it was a light bulb they needed to change. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'3 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour. Seven we had to get out of airplane in Cleveland Ohio for special service again and only had 10 minutes to purchase cold food and drinks for $60. Insane! And then ran back to the same airplane. Eight we finally arrived to Orlando Florida the staff could not tell us were the luggage will be. After we arrived to baggage claim we waited for over an hour! Nine a lot of passengers went to the counter where staff had no idea why the luggage was not available they said that probably they were waiting for other flights! Finally a supervisor came in and her only consolation comment was that we needed to wait 5 more minutes. Everyone was outraged and started asking for their baggage money back. The frontier supervisor started yelling back to all passengers and threat to call police on us. No meal voucher or baggage voucher. We had just keep waiting after a 12 hour trip. Ten this was the worst experience I've had. The cheap flights are always more expensive and service is awful.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight down to Florida delayed 30 mins because the plane over-fuelled. On the way back flight was delayed for 6 hours then canceled until the next day with no explanation. The Frontier workers wouldn't even come down to the gate to tell us we had to go by the Departure board. Next day flight was delayed 3 hours because the crew was legally required to have a certain amount of time before next flight. If they had to delay flight for 26+ hours you would think the flight would leave on time. Also because so many people just jumped on another flight back they had to role call to see who was on the plane. Never felt less secure on an airplane.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew at the last minute from San Diego to Denver. Frontier had better flight time selections and fares than Southwest (won't make that mistake). It was impossible to check in online as the hyperlinks didn't work. I called their "customer service" number and after being on hold for 30+ minutes I gave up. I don't understand their baggage and carry on policies and pricing and quickly realized that any money saved by not flying Southwest would be eaten up by these stupid nit picking fees. I finally prevailed on their horrible website and arrived at the airport to hear that their whole software system was brand-new and everyone was trying to figure it out. Then the flight was delayed with no notice to my email or phone. At the gate they had one poor employee trying to handle all these passengers and get the inbound flight all set up to de-plane. This was a bad experience and I will attempt not to fly them ever again.

Went to Punta Cana from Rockford IL on flight 32 on Feb 27th. Flight was on time and the crew made the experience fun and enjoyable. The stewards were funny and even played "happy" when we landed! Now for the flight back to Rockford on March 5th on flight 33 I have to say it was by far my worst experience flying! We not only had a 5.5 hour delay but the pilot mumbled when he addressed the passengers to the point no one had any idea what he was saying. I was in row 9 and it took over 1.5 hours just to get a beverage! They didn't even make it halfway through the plane and had already run out of some snacks soda liquor and of all things ice! We had asked if their were any other seats available because our seats did not recline due to the emergency exit behind us we were informed yes there was but the passenger in the end seat had decided to lay across all the seats and they were not willing to ask this person to sit up! Once we landed we had heard many other passengers say how bad their experience was as well. In my opinion the next time I fly anywhere I will stay far away from flying on Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
What attracted my husband to try Frontier Airline to Vegas was the cheap fare. Sad to say we got what we paid for. I had no problem with a 2 hour delay nor getting our luggage after 10 hours. I do understand this. But poor customer service and waiting over an hour after disembarking to get our checked luggage is too much. Flying Frontier will be my last option the next time I travel.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight from Cleveland to Denver. Mid day clear skies. They boarded the plane on time. Departure time was no problem but came and went. Captain comes on saying a small paperwork issue. Same story for the next two hours until they made everyone get off the plane. Then their reservation system goes down. Can't get anything but more lying to the passengers. Flight was re scheduled for after midnight. This airline has turned into a really bad airline. So after spending all day being lied to they offer a 10 dollar meal coupon. That will get you a bottle of water and some crackers. No help with booking another airline. Avoid the aggravation and go on another airline. It will be cheaper in the long run.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
They were incredibly inconsiderate. The first leg of my flight was delayed by weather at the destination airport yet the second leg departed from that airport ahead of schedule. Half of my flight was told that the next available flight was 24 hours later or that we could go to an alternative airport 1.5 hours from the original destination in 12 hours. No meal voucher no hotel no compensation - we all slept on the floor. The desk attendant's consolation was "Well it's better you don't have a hotel because you would have had to come back very early in the morning regardless. Also add the usual complaints about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour leg. I'd hate to imagine what the larger passengers had to endure.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
New seats do not recline. My friend and I just flew a quick RT CLE-RSW over a four-day span. We paid for seats with extra legroom. What they don't tell you now is that they just "upgraded" (their word not mine) their seats for the whole plane and now none of them recline. The FA told me that doing so resulted in them being able to squeeze 9 more seats into the cabin. So - what good is "extra" room if it is actually less roomy than previous experience? Very frustrating - I won't be flying Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was my first experience flying Frontier and will be my last. The outbound flight from Cleveland to Phoenix was adequate but it took over 1.5 hours to receive my luggage. The return flight was a disaster. I arrived at 4pm for my 6pm flight only to find that the fight had been changed to 4.10 pm. I was never informed of the change but the agent lied and stated that I had accepted the change. I was forced to fly Delta through Detroit. Frontier offered a small partial refund for my flight but nothing for my Delta flight. I will never fly frontier again. Interestingly my friends have had similar experiences. In fact Frontier has engaged in a classic "bait and switch". Frontier initially offers convenient schedules and then changes the flights to save on landing fees. I will be back flying United.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have never flown Frontier before my trip from CVG to MCO. I was attracted to the airline because of the lower fares which is great for my family of 5. We no issues on the flight to MCO. Fast forward 3 days later on our return flight from MCO to CVG. We arrived at the airport only to find that our flight had been delayed for 2 hours because of maintenance issues. Understandable. From the time we left the main terminal to the gate the delay went from 2 hours to 9.5 hours. Again we were told it was a maintenance issue. The delay changed again to 10.5 hours. It turns out it wasn't a maintenance issue at all it was a crew issue - they don't have a crew to fly the plane. Supposedly the do now (thus the delay). I'm not sure where the plane is - CVG or MCO. The attendant at the gate told me planes are delayed at least once a week because of no crew but usually the delay is shorter than 10.5 hours. I only wish I would have read the reviews before I booked my flight. It can only be a matter of time. Southwest/AirTran and Delta are substantially more reliable and if you have someplace to be it's worth it to pay a little more.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier 114 February 4th. Do not cross the line into Frontier Land - enticed by the low fares and the thinking of "these negative reviews can't possibly be true". They are. After my 4th straight delayed flight (this one for 6 hours) on this carrier and the record now stands at 8 of the last 14 flights - it finally dawned on me. This airline really is a poor choice. This is (was) the only airline I fly "Elite" status credit card Early Returns program direct booking etc.. a refuge from the era of when the "friendly skies" of United got not so friendly. I'm the guy you see boarding first sitting up front. I used to love this company when it was a version of Southwest - good fares fun staff reliable. I'm that guy who smiles understands that this is a complicated business understands that there are several factors that can disrupt a schedule. I'm the guy ground and flight staff like - polite and courteous. They went where I needed to be and they were in concourse A (DIA customers know about this). I get the new pricing strategy and I understand the a' la carte idea. They had to do something about the bag war going on for overhead carry on space. What is not excusable is the consistently late flights or worse - the cancellations of which I have been now reading about. Frontier I'm gone. It's sad - they were my savior from United. Southwest - here I come.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
World Strides trip home from Fort Lauderdale to Dulles International. Flight canceled on 2/21/15 due to weather which is understandable. We were traveling with 32 middle school students and 9 adults. No flight available for 3 days 2/24/15! After a week long event we had students who would need medication before that date (we expressed this to the agent). We had to sleep in the airport that night because there were no hotels available that was not Frontier's fault but having to stay there 2 more nights with 41 people would have been. When discussing flight options with the very nice ticket agent we discovered that not only would we not be able to fly out for 3 days only part of our group could fly out then. Another group would have to fly out on the 4th day and another on the 5th day! This was totally unacceptable. During our lengthy stay in the airport we discovered from other customers (we were camped out right across from the Frontier ticket counter) that almost all customers were delayed the next day (the weather was beautiful) and those who had flown before stated their flights are always delayed (our flight to Orlando was delayed). The lines for check in were crazy long compared to other airlines. People waiting hours to check in. This could have been a marketing dream for Frontier. Imagine the story of helping out a group of stranded middle school students because Frontier cares. Instead they left us stranded for up to 5 days. No refund. No credit. Now 32 parents will never fly Frontier. 9 chaperones will never fly Frontier. For a price gouging company that advertises low prices then charges not only for checked baggage but for carry on bags and charges for water and sodas and basic channel TV I would think Frontier would at least want to retain the customer base they have. I for one will never use Frontier again. The flight attendants and ticket agents are super. The business model is horrendous. They should be ashamed.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was my first trip with Frontier. We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it. I will have no hesitation in recommending the airline with that caveat.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
No leg room I am a small 5'2" female and I felt cramped I felt sorry for my brother-in-law who is 6' tall his knees touched the seat in front of him. Apparently the only thing free on Frontier anymore is water everything else will cost you. I got extremely ill on the return flight and they told me they had no blankets or pillows to offer. My thought what do they do if they have an emergency needs to lay down and be kept warm put them in the aisle? No entertainment at all not even TV or music and a 5 hour layover I will never fly Frontier again.

While this has not happened to me I witnessed this first hand - a flight to Oklahoma City from Denver was cancelled. 150 passengers had the rug pulled out from underneath them - I caught this because I was at the next gate over and noticed the customer service center was suddenly packed. Refunds were offered but what you supposed to do now - book another airline at the last minute? That's triple the fare in most cases! Apparently Frontier has no desire or capability to do what other airlines do - get you home on another carrier. Frontier I'm gone. Southwest - here I come.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Our first flight was great but it was only 45 minutes. We sat in the "extra leg room" seating but it was just normal seating… or so I thought. Our connecting flight had us in the very back row. There there is no leg room whatsoever and your knees are directly against the seat in front of you. They do not offer complimentary snacks or drinks but you can pay for half a can of soda for 2.99. The flight attendant was very rude and patronizing. Not only this but our seats were moved from the front all the way to the back without notification to my family. I do not recommend Frontier to anyone. Pay the extra and take United.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have only flown this airline once (RT) and will never fly them again. Both times the flight was delayed once by 1/2 hour and once by 2.5 hours. They actually had the nerve to post 'on time' on the electronic board along with the rescheduled departure time. When I questioned the 'on time' the customer service agent said they hadn't yet updated the sign. Um then why does it say 11.30 instead of 9.35? Unfortunately it wasn't until I made my reservation that I noticed a review (1/2 stars) that they are consistently delayed. If you are needing to get somewhere especially if you have a connection I strongly advise you avoid Frontier and if you must pay a little extra for an airline that cares about their customers getting to where they want to go relatively on time.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Where do I begin. So my cousin and I got to Orlando airport at about 11am. We waited in a line for about 39 mins just to be told that we could not check our bags yet. So we waited an hour and went back to the bag drop off line to check our bags. Again we waited about 30 minutes. Luckily we had paid our baggage check fee online so the process went fairly smooth. We were scheduled to leave at 4.10pm to go to IAD. I received an email saying the flight had been delayed to 5.07. Not even 30 minutes later the flight was changed again to 5.27. Eventually I was notified that the flight was canceled. So we went back to the desk to confirm and the board still stated that the flight was on time. By this time the line was obstructing the flow in the airport and wait times were over an hour long. The cancellation was confirmed but we were told that they were not going to be rebooking and flights or giving any refunds. They gave us food vouchers and a hotel voucher and said we had to call a 800 number. I waited to speak with a representative for over 3 hours and still did not get in touch with anyone. They still did not offer any resolution as to how we were going to get home. So finally my cousin and I had to book with another airline in order to get out of Orlando. The workers were very rude. They had no answers whatsoever. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that I had to go to the end of the line and wait until the supervisor had time. This customer service experience was the worst ever.

After buying the tickets we needed to buy seats pay for bags pay for soda TV peanuts overall cost is higher and service is awful. Return flight just as bad gate changed no reason boarding delayed no reason the plane not cleaned between trash at our seats delayed on tarmac due to broken toilet. Seats front was ripped and dirty seat chair very uncomfortable. 4 of 6 TV's broken in my row (23) and agents were making sarcastic comments about the passengers in front of them horribly unprofessional.

Frontier Airlines. Beware: limited flights schedule changes = stranded for 2 days. Frontier delayed our flight by 5 hours due to "equipment changes". Naturally I missed my connecting flight to my destination. Frontier graciously offered to book me onto the next connecting flight - 2 days later. The delay was not because of full flights. It was not due to bad weather. They simply had no scheduled flights for 2 days (48 hours). Frontier provided no offer to book on another airline no offer to refund my ticket except for the single connecting leg no offer to compensate for costs on another airline. No voucher no flight credit. I contacted customer service 3 times. I received 5 hours to sleep in a run-down hotel a half hour from the airport and $15 for an airport dinner. Several weeks earlier I had to book a one way return on United because Frontier changed my return to a 16 hour itinerary with a 9 hour layover. Then I had to book a third ticket just to get out of the airport on my outbound - United to the rescue again. Fly Frontier but be prepared to suddenly spend a couple-few days in your layover airport or city. Or be prepared to buy a last minute fare to get to where you were going. Frontier: Discover a whole new way to fly like driving which is faster.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My family of four which includes a 2 year old and an 11 year old just flew Frontier from DFW to Denver in January and paid in advance for seats in the forth row for easy boarding and u boarding due to my youngest and so we could all sit together. My seats were bought and paid for well over a month in advance and confirmed via email. Upon arriving at airport and boarding we were placed in 4 different rows in the very back of the plane. Luckily a fellow passenger switched seats allowing my 2 year old to sit beside my husband. The same thing happened on the return flight even after spending 1 hour and 57 minutes on hold with Frontier to make sure this didn't happen again. The lady on the phone told me that the 4th row did not exist on the return flight and so once again we were shoved in the back of the plane. The 4th row did indeed exist with some very happy passengers sitting in our paid for seats! Not a happy Frontier past customer!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My original flight from Chicago was supposed to get me home on Sunday night but was cancelled due to weather despite other airlines flying out. The agents in Chicago were completely unhelpful and utterly lacking in empathy or any semblance of customer service. My only options were a flight two days later (with no food hotel or transportation vouchers provided) or to book with another airline. I didn't have the money to rebook a last minute flight across the county and had to swallow the cost of a cheap nearby hotel with a shuttle. However when I went back to the airport two days later it was to find that my flight was massively delayed due to "weather" again despite other airlines having no problems. This makes no sense to me and makes it appear that Frontier just sticks the words "weather related" in front of any problem to avoid having to take any responsibility for their delays and cancellations. My flight was delayed more than four hours (with no food vouchers offered) and sat on the runway for a further hour and a half with everyone aboard while the plane de-iced. I asked Frontier agents in Chicago before I left that if their delays caused me to miss my connection in Denver if I would be provided a hotel voucher. I was assured that I would. However when I arrived in Denver myself and the 15-20 others who had missed connections were offered no vouchers or assistance but only extremely impatient and disrespectful service from Frontier agents. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport waiting until the following night for my flight. I'm currently sitting in the airport waiting for my flight and have just found out that it's of course delayed. I'll never fly it again. The cancellations delays lack of communication disorganization and horrible customer service are absolutely startling.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
First they delayed our flight leaving Milwaukee to Denver. Then we miss the connecting to Bozeman. Since Frontier does not and will not work with any other airlines we were stuck in Denver because the next Frontier flight to Bozeman was a day an a half away. Very unhelpful and horrible customer service. The only thing they offered was a discount on the next trip. Will never use this airline again. The connecting flight only needed to wait an extra 15 min for us. No beverage service for a two hour ride.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This nickel and dime airline is the definition of Caveat emptor. In hindsight I should have read the reviews rather than enduring the abominable travel experience between MCO and LAX with a layover in lovely Denver. I can only reiterate what so many have said before. The cheaper price is what hooked me but I would have rather paid the difference for another airline because in the end I probably spent about the same. Frontier reeks of cheapness with no complimentary snacks zero legroom and Direct TV only available to those willing to dish out even more money. The flight attendants barked orders and scowled and the customer service couldn't be more useless. When I asked to move to an earlier flight they informed me it would be an additional $75 per ticket as they do not offer stand-by. So while I wait for my later flight I decided to make good use and warn any curious travelers to avoid this airline at all cost. For me I can say this will definitely be my final Frontier. The best thing I can take away is the valuable lesson to always look before you book.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My husband and I booked two round-trip itineraries from Denver to Ft. Lauderdale last September for travel this coming March. Just 8 days after the booking Frontier changed our flight destination to Miami and we were told they would not provide a way to get us from Miami to Ft. Lauderdale. Despite the added cost and inconvenience we accepted the flight change. Since that time our flight itineraries have changed 3 more times (that's 4 itinerary changes in 4 months and counting). Today we were informed that our non-stop flight has changed to a 3-leg itinerary flying from Denver to Indiana to Alabama to Miami. We are now arriving over five hours late and in a different city! I waited over an hour to speak with an unsympathetic customer service rep (as is typically the case) who could offer no acceptable remedies and no explanation other than "they are making many schedule changes at the moment". Once upon a time I loved this airline! I was one of their elite frequent flyer members and flew them almost exclusively. I don't know what went wrong but over the past decade they have become "a whole different animal" indeed!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Chicago O'Hare to Denver on January 25th flight 1067. My flight was delayed 12 hours because they didn't schedule a pilot. Staff were rude and did nothing for passengers who waited all day. Flight that was supposed to leave at 1.55 pm finally left at 1.15 am. I will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We were supposed to leave Orlando at 9.30am. I checked the website before we left for the airport and it showed a 30 minute delay. By the time we got to the airport it had been pushed back twice more totalling a 1.5 hour delay. I looked at the screens inside the airport to see where the flight stood before we checked our bags. It showed our flight was on time. We went to the ticket counter to check our bags and there was no mention of a delay. We went through security and made our way to our gate. Still no mention of a delay. At the gate our flight didn't show up but instead they had a flight leaving an hour after our scheduled departure. I made my way to the counter and it was the first time Frontier acknowledged there was a delay. After being told nothing I had to keep checking the website for updates. The flight was pushed to 12.00 then to 3.30 then to 6.30 and eventually to 7.30. I did over hear a couple walking away from the counter saying Frontier was flying a part from Denver to Cleveland hoping that would fix the problem. They couldn't arrange for a plane to take us to Cleveland we had to wait for that same plane. The poor folks in Cleveland were in the same boat we were in Orlando. We rebooked on another airline and I lost track of when if ever our original flight left. Last I heard it was delayed 10 hours and counting. They never updated us as we sat waiting and you had to wait an hour plus on the phone to cancel your seat to be eligible for reimbursement. The reimbursement was meagre to say the least. It only covered a fraction of what I paid to fly home.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Used to love Flying Frontier but they have really gone downhill. There were 6 of us flying to Vegas on Jan 4th and meeting 2 other family members from other states. We were ready to leave and my sister checked to make sure our flight was on time to find out they had cancelled it due to mechanical problems. No email no phone call nothing. We found out that they no longer affiliated with other airlines so we would have to wait and fly out 24 hrs later! We had already paid for a room in Vegas had 2 people already waiting in Vegas for us and were only going to be in Vegas for 3 nights so we had to rush and book a flight on Delta. Not to mention that on Frontiers flights you have to pay for carryon luggage picking your seats if you want anything to drink. This party of 6 will never fly with Frontier again!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight from Miami to Philadelphia 1/18 after a cruise. Arrived at airport at 11 am for 8.30 pm flight. Couldn't check in bags until 3 hours before flight. Learned flight delayed until 1 am. Checked in bags at 6 for flight told flight delayed until 4 am. Frontier was supposed to text delays but did not. Offered to refund money and cancel our flight but couldn't reschedule us to leave for 3 days. Arrived for 4 am flight delayed until 5 because of "security issues with plane". Never explained delays. Last Frontier flight for us.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I used Orbitz.com to buy round trip tickets from Raleigh to Trenton price was great. No complaints about the flight into Trenton however I was notified hours before it was time to return home that my flight had been cancelled. There were no weather issues the representative could not tell me why the flight had been cancelled. I explained that I had checked out of the hotel and had nowhere to go I asked the Frontier representative to connect me with another airline or to cover my hotel expenses and received no assistance whatsoever. The next available flight was 2 days later. I ended up having to stay in a hotel another night and used AMTRAK to return home that morning. I will never use Frontier again this way of doing business was unexpected and I was totally unprepared. The cheap fare turned out quite costly.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
After repeated late and canceled flights I will no longer fly Frontier. Their ticket prices are cheaper but if you can't reach your final destination (like I was unable to) then it ends up costing you more in the long run. After a delayed 3 hour flight and missing my connection I was forced to cancel my trip to Vegas since I couldn't get on another flight for another day and a half! I have never flown on a Frontier flight that has arrived on time yet. Will not use again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I am a business traveler with over one million lifetime miles spread over several airlines. I am a Frontier Summit member and have had that status over the last several years. In the early days I found the airline to be of good quality. Under the new management Frontier has plummeted in my estimation under this guise of "low cost". First it is not low cost when the "nickel and dime" charges are added in. The under-staffing at my home airport (DIA) and the various regional airports is quite apparent. If one talks to staff or flight attendants the low morale becomes apparent. Needless to say I have a few award miles to spend and then it is adiós to Frontier. What a shame that an airline that was of reasonable quality has been driven down by these new owners.

Came back from Chicago on Monday Dec 29. Was a great flight arrived into Orlando 10 minutes early the crew were friendly. Would take Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew round trip from Trenton to Raleigh for $89. The flight was on time and coming home I was actually late to my plane and they waited an extra couple minutes to allow me to board. Would definitely use them again. Prices are unbeatable. Complaints are from those expecting a commercial airline. This is a discount airline and you get what you pay for. Our family uses Frontier for business as well and have never had an issue.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Terrible service. Did not inform us that we have to pay for carry on bags ($35). Not enough staff to help you to check in. Our flight was supposed to board at 5.40. At 5.40 they started boarding a plane going to a different location at our gate. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6.15 and the flight they began to board was leaving at 6.30. We had to stand around and wait to board after their flight left at 6.30. We didn't leave until 7. Very disorganized. Anytime anyone asked what was going on they sent us away with no explanation. It wasn't until after 6 when they informed us of the other plane. Never fly Frontier!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew on a Saturday Jan 3 2015. Flight was delayed in Houston because of "weather". Missed our connection in Denver Frontier said the next available flight to Seattle was Jan 6th. Would not put us up in hotel. Frontier lied to us it was a mechanical issue in Bozeman that started it all that was from the Pilot. Plane finally loaded but after sitting for 30 mins on runway the pilot told us she had reached her limit on hours went back to gate and sat for 1 hour before they rescheduled flight to next morning Frontier didn't pay for hotel rooms. At airport the next morning Frontier board the plane going to Denver with passengers going to San Francisco had to de-plane and remove all luggage. Finally took off.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was my first experience with Frontier. Even though I saw bad reviews I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it out. I booked online through Orbitz and my reservations never made it into the Frontier online system. I could not access my info so I had to use their 800 number for dealings. I paid $40 to upgrade my seat selection and another $20 for my checked bag at check-in. The only part of their online system that worked was online check-in but I had to try twice before it actually worked. At my departure I waited 45 minutes to drop my bag. The customer service was unorganized and rude. Why check and pay ahead of time if I still have to stand in the same line as those who haven't? At the departure gate it got worse. The screen displayed the flight information and they announced boarding so I naturally proceeded to the line. I was zone 1 and when the agent scanned my boarding pass he abruptly informed me that this was not my flight. It was in fact a delayed flight that was supposed to already be in the air. The screen continued to show my flight info and half the people in line were misinformed about where the plane was actually going. We were told that our plane was at the airport and would arrive at the gate once this plane had left. Meanwhile our captain co-pilot and flight attendants were also sitting in the waiting area and had no clue where the plane was. They were laughing and joking (rather loudly) about the delayed status and disorganization of the airline. Everything was very unprofessional. An hour after our scheduled departure we finally took off. I still have to take my returning flight so I hope they will redeem themselves. I will never ever book a flight with Frontier again!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Terrible airline. Will never fly again. On one of the busiest days of the year Frontier delayed our departure for almost 4 hours and then cancelled. Since they have no airline affiliations they couldn't offer any other travel options only option was a flight two days later or refund of ticket. They gave us our money back but it doesn't exactly cover the loss of our vacation planned months in advance. I've learned to always check if the airline has co-operating airlines with which they can rebook passengers.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This is the first time I took the new version of frontier. The experience is not at all good not on par with other airlines. I will gladly pay the extra $50 next time to go with a better carrier. My flight was delayed by more than two hours. I only found out about the delay at the airport when I picked up my boarding pass. Desk agent didn't tell me you figure it out on your own from the hour-later boarding time on your boarding card. No one at the gate and the gate monitor said flight on time for a whole hour while I waited. Then told the flight was delayed another hour. Still Frontier doesn't show the delay. Reason for the delay? None I could find. All the other flights in this concourse were on time. Not a happy customer and I will not be back. I rate even Spirit better than this.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Horrible customer service and lack of empathy for guests flying with them. Flight was scheduled to leave at 12.40 to Georgia and was delayed until 1.11 pm. Around that boarding time the announcer made another call to let everyone know that the flight would further be delayed until around 4.30 pm due to the incoming aircraft having a cracked windshield. If they were aware of the situation beforehand why lie to the entire crowd of people waiting and expecting the initial delayed flight to depart at 1.11. To further add insult Frontier never offered any service recovery discounts fee waiver etc. Their guest service and accommodations are terrible. Many people were complaining to the staff that they were on a tight schedule for weddings birthdays etc and Frontier Airlines did nothing to help myself or those guests. Never again will I be flying with this airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Trip from Atlanta to Denver. No issues in Atlanta crew was very nice. In Denver the desk staff were borderline rude and wouldn't acknowledge you unless you use the kiosk to print the boarding pass but no one was willing to explain how to use the kiosk. Then had to reprint the boarding pass at the kiosk for unexplained reasons. I want to deal with people not computers. Desk staff was rude in Denver but flight crew was refreshing. Flight from Atlanta was actually early and return flight was on time.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight 133 Dec 2 Dallas DFW-Denver DEN. Flight 657 Dec 2 Denver DEN-San Francisco SFO. Very unimpressed. They charge for carry-on bags which is bad enough but they actually charge more for carry-ons than checked bags. The employees I encountered were very unfriendly and unhelpful. And lastly they charge for everything but water. Bad experience overall.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I am a frequent business traveler and I will never fly Frontier again. Having to pay for carry on luggage is ridiculous. If they are trying to reduce the number of carry-ons then they should just allow 1 free checked bag. But that wasn't the most frustrating thing. Even though I checked a bag on line and had my printed receipt I had to re-check the bag at least he kiosk at Denver because I was told that was the only way they could print my baggage tag. If that's true then I'm going to fly an airline with the capability of printing their own baggage tags from this point on!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
After arriving at Dulles it took well over an hour to get luggage off loaded from the plane. When we finally found someone who worked for Frontier they advised that baggage is contracted out at Dulles. We were told that there were only 2 people working baggage as they had "a bunch of people call in sick. They waited for 3 planes to land and unloaded all 3 planes before sending bags to the carousels. It took so long that the hotel shuttle left and I had to pay for a cab. Return flight after a 20+ hour international flight I was told I could not check my luggage through on my final leg until 2 hours before the flight. Family connecting with Delta and Southwest checked their bags immediately. I had to sit in the airport lobby for 5 hours before I could check my 1 bag. I will try to avoid flying Frontier in the future!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
$30 for a carry on drinks $2 and up snacks you also have to pay. I didn't select a seat to upgrade the first time and I was put in the back of the plane. On the way back home I paid for an upgrade seat and it didn't recline back.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I honestly can't complain. We paid for seats that didn't have much legroom. Because they were only $3. I would say we got what we paid for. Nothing was complimentary other than the water. The flight attendants were nice and we got from LAX to Denver right on time. We paid for carry on. We followed the instructions on measurements and weight of our luggage. We had no problems whatsoever.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I am a frequent traveler. I booked round trip tickets for two. The first flight was to leave at 6.05 am. We loaded on time but sat on the runway for 2 hours while the computers "rebooted". This delay of course caused us to miss our connection flight in Denver. Causing us to miss much of the first day activities. On our return flight we made it out of LAX on time on arrival in Denver it appears that our connection flight was on time. 30 min after we landed our flight was delayed for 5+ hours. No explanation was given to us. They did give us $15 food coupons 45 min before all restaurants closed "after we had already paid for our meals". Every gate in the Terminal had an unused plane sitting at it. Not any cheaper " when you count baggage fees" than any other carrier and I have never had so much trouble keeping a schedule. There was no weather in any part of the country by the way. We haven't made it on the delayed flight yet. Entirely possible that we didn't make the 3am flight either. Avoid at all cost.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was my first time flying Frontier and perhaps my last. My main complaint was assistance for customers with reduced mobility. I am a stroke survivor and was forced to walk up stairs because there was no ramp. The crew offered no help. Also you could board the plane from either the back or front. It was confusing because people bump into each other trying to store their luggage.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My reservation was lost although they billed my card twice and I had to pay the higher last minute fare. Both flights delayed. They lost my luggage and it was not found for 3 days. There is no on site help desk for lost luggage just a phone number (not toll free) which no one answers after leaving a handful of messages. After returning to the airport the next day I was told to call the complaint number - it is only open for 3 hours a day and a recording told me there was an hour wait. Fly an airline that is customer centric if you don't want to get surprised like I did.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier should be ashamed of their lack of customer assistance at Chicago ORD on October 31 2014. The customers were completely aware of the fact that all airlines were not able to land or take off due to heavy winds. That was not the problem. We were frustrated by the fact that nobody showed up at the Frontier gate until 7.30 pm and our flight that was originally scheduled for 4.10 was changed 3 times before a Frontier staff member made an appearance at the gate. On my return flight on November 4 we were expecting to board at 7:10 as stated on the boarding pass but there was no gate agent available again. Then every passenger who had paid to bring carry on luggage was asked to fit their bag into the measurement apparatus at the gate - the delay was ridiculous.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier Airlines poor planning in notifying its passengers in a timely manner is ridiculous. Frontier waited until 6.30 am to make an announcement to its passengers about the flight being delayed due to crew rest. Boarding time was scheduled for 7.10 and flight schedule to leave 7.45 am moved to 8.55 am. So why didn't the airline notify customers via phone (text) or email concerning this change so that passengers could have stayed at their hotels or homes little longer. Why ask for phone number when check in online if you not going to use for that purpose. Ridiculous Frontier Airlines and inconsiderate of your customers.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew Frontier Denver to Seattle - Oct 7 - Oct 22. Both flights were great! Love online check in - member of Rewards Club so $15 bag. I think the problems that others may experience are back east more than the original Frontier areas. Has some very decent employees. Enjoyed the flights and will travel with them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Three of us travelled round trip on Frontier between Washington Dulles and Fort Myers Florida. Our experience was excellent. Frontier was not only $100 cheaper per ticket than any other airline flying the same route but it was also the only airline offering direct service. We opted not to reserve seats to save money yet when we checked in Frontier assigned us seats together. Usually when traveling each of us would have brought a separate carry on bags but because Frontier charges for carry on as well as checked bags we opted to share a large checked bag for the same cost as a single carryon. Boarding was orderly the plane clean the crew pleasant and the flight was on time. We definitely will use Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I'm a frequent flyer so for me to say that this is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on is quite accurate. Where do I even begin? After purchasing a ticket that was supposed to have one free bag checked I was told at check in that I'd have to pay $25 to check in my bag. In addition I was told had to either pay $35 for my carry on or get it checked in for $30. Are you kidding me? That's already 3/4 my ticket. Then I arrive at the gate just to find out there was a delay. Not to mention the customer service was rude and made us wait 30 minutes in line to check in. Please if you care about your money and time do not fly with this airline. They rip you off completely and are shameless about it. Please spare yourself the trouble.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Drove to Chicago on 10/24 and paid for a hotel to be at O'Hare by 5am 10/25 for a 7.30 direct flight to Cancun. Due to a scratch on the nose of the plane that we were told would take 45 minutes to fix we waited and waited until finally leaving at 5.30pm. Instead of being at our resort by 1pm we arrive there after 10pm. While delays can be expected with any airline a 10 hour delay was ridiculous. The gate agents were rude and aside from a food coupon for each passenger they did nothing. Our vacation was cut short by an entire day. The agents announced that if we wanted to complain to call the travel agency. I will avoid Frontier. We've flown extensively and again delays happen. But not 10 hours and if it did happen I'd think they would do more than give you an attitude and a cheesy food voucher. Very disappointed.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Just flew SLC - Denver. Paid extra for classic plus which was to include early seating extra leg room free checked bag and carry on and one free alcohol drink and other drinks free. Guess what: after 22nd of this month - no free drinks. Didn't I get the email? How can Frontier just take away something I paid extra for? Will avoid this airline if at all possible.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew from Denver to Minneapolis. They changed our seats at the last minute by calling us up to the counter. We argued to no avail. Rude agent says they don't have to explain. We were reassigned seats to the back of the plane and separated. I will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My Frontier flight was scheduled about 3 hours after a long intercontinental flight to Denver supposed landing and I was really scared after reading all bad reviews. However the experience was very nice. We did not do online check-in but it took literally 1 minute to check-in on the counter. When making a reservation I paid for carry- on items instead of check-in. When I found that out I called and wrote to customer service and they told I'll be able to check my item in and so it was. The staff were helpful the flight departed and landed without delays. When we landed one of the bags was damaged (whichI think is not airline responsibility). We went to Frontier representatives in Bozeman airport (it was around 11 pm)and they just brought us a new bag. You have to pay for carry-on and check-in baggage and drinks but the ticket price is still good.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Arrived two hours early for a flight from O'Hare to Dulles. We had pre-printed our boarding passes and paid for our additional checked luggage. We simply need to check the luggage at the counter. Our party of five - along with several others were redirected out of the line to some type of "domestic" holding area as they attended to an international flight. About a half hour into our wait the redirection stopped. However those of us in the holding area were left to stand there for another half an hour without further direction. There must have been twenty travelers that arrived well after we did that found their way in front of us in a very long line. My son- in-law took matters into his own hands as it was obvious that the Frontier service reps had no intention of returning for us. Had it not been for his negotiating with the people in line we all might still be sitting there. Upon arrival at our destination we sat at the gate for a half an hour before de-boarding. Despite this wait we waited an additional 40 minutes for luggage to begin flowing at the baggage claim. I am a well seasoned traveler for both business and pleasure. This was my first experience with this airline and it will certainly be my last. I would never fly this airline again!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Unpleasant staff; unwilling to assist in any way expensive baggage fees including carry-on old planes with broken seats extra charge for a soft drink and the list goes on. The price of the ticket was not any cheaper than any other airline but the service and lack of customer care made it a very negative experience across the board. Especially for a handicap passenger or anyone with special needs it is a bad choice to fly Frontier!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Due to storms our flight was over 30 minutes late leaving Atlanta. Knowing that we only had 35 minutes to make our connection I expressed my concern to two of the flight attendants on the plane before take-off. They assured me that due to flights being late that it shouldn't be a problem making our connection since the tower was aware. We arrived 15 minutes after our connecting flight left. We were offered stand-by on the last flight to Phoenix along with 10 other passengers. We were told that there were no seats available the next day and would have to fly stand-by on any of the flights to Phoenix on Tuesday. We were confirmed for a flight on Wednesday. This was unacceptable since we had to return to work on Wednesday. When I asked if we would be provided with food and hotel vouchers I was informed that it wasn't Frontier's fault and that we would not be given any form of compensation. Taking matters into our own hands we chose to fly into Las Vegas and rented a car to make the 5.5 hour drive home. I was told that flights cannot be held yet as I sat waiting for the stand-by flight I witnessed Flt 583 to Salt Lake City at 7.05pm being held for a flight that had arrived late at the gate next to it. I have been flying for 40 years. I have seen a drastic decline in the quality of air travel over the years. To go from getting a hot meal on the plane to having to pay for a can of soda. The lack of compassion from Frontier's customer service center is disturbing to say the least. I wasn't even offered a discount voucher for a hotel as I was told I should have been. It's a shame that the customers who pay for a service are treated with disrespect.

My daughter has flown Frontier Airlines from Seattle to Denver to Bismarck and back on several occasions so I should have known better. Her flights were almost always late and there were several times they were late enough for her to miss her connections to Seattle or to Bismarck. Still the cheaper fare wooed me. Well after leaving 45 minutes late on my flight to Denver and 3 hours late from Denver I am no longer interested in the savings. Goodbye Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Like some of the folks here I questioned my sanity for booking Frontier after reading the reviews! But it was the only non-stop to Denver from Reagan National. I was pleasantly surprised OK so my standards are not that high but was more then comparable to US Airways I normally fly to Florida. As another reviewer said read the rules. There was a woman on the Denver to DC was arguing about the size of her carry-on at least this airline sticks to their guns about the size allowed.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My family and I recently traveled using Frontier Airlines. I must say the ticketing counter staff Frontier has are the most incompetent representatives I have ever seen. We arrived at the desk approximately 90 minutes prior to flight. We had our tickets and baggage all previously taken care of online. We stood inline for 45 minutes waiting to just get our baggage checked and placed on the conveyor belt while the only representative spent this entire time with one customer ahead of us. When we finally got to the desk we were informed it was too late to send our bags to the plane. After attempting to explain we have been waiting the representative charged an additional $225. then put us on a flight 12 hours later which created a domino affect with our rental car and hotel being cancelled for a no-show. I am disappointed with our service and trip therefore I warn others to look elsewhere for air travel.

Flying from Ft. Lauderdale to Cleveland on 9/28/14. Flight was supposed to leave at 8:00 PM. At the airport flight posted a delay to 11:30 PM. Good weather. Flight then posted to 10.30. Got something to eat just outside terminal. At 9:30 went to gate. Fight cancelled with no announcement and nobody at the gate. Found all the passengers at the check in. Only two employees and one line. No alternative fights until Wednesday. Missed my appointments and had to forfeit the return fight on another airline. Buyer Beware. Read all the bad reviews.

Charlotte NC (CLT) to Washington Dulles DC (IAD). Sep 19 2014 - Sep 21 2014. Beware: Extra fees. You will have to pay for you carry on going to the city you are traveling to and on the way back $25-35. Staff are extremely unprofessional and I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

We flew Frontier from Tampa to Denver and back again on 9-17 to 9-26. I had read reviews thought I was insane while booking and decided to get familiar with the rules and regulations posted on their website. We used the check in baggage after signing up with early rewards and it cost us $15.00 each way per checked in luggage. Had no problem toting a decent sized bag on board as our "personal" item. Seating was $3.00 each way - still not a lot to pay to have a seat on board together. Thought the flight crew was rather bland on the flight to Denver our return trip was the complete opposite. I totally enjoyed all the jokes both by the pilot as well as the rest of the crew! Very relaxing flight. That being said I would definitely without a doubt let Frontier take me where I need to go in the future.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Surprised by all the fees. Their ticket price is deceptive as Frontier charges for carry on and seat assignments and provides nothing in the cabin for economy. Website charged x2 for a single carry on. Dropped the second passenger for return trip. Could not get boarding pass online or at the airport check in device. Had to wait for the staff to show up. Absolutely no chance of getting through to a person at the 800 number tried x3 minimum wait was 34 minutes (they said). Minimum leg room. Passenger in front could not recline seat all the way without breaking my legs which she tried several times. The single plus of the experience was the cabin crew. They were fine both ways. But flying is too much of a hassle to put up with the likes of Frontier's bait and switch and poor communications. We actually paid more once all the extra fees were added in. Will be willing to pay a lot more to avoid Frontier in the future. Plus the aircraft we flew in were extremely old Airbus 320s. The 320 went into service 26 years ago.

I arrived with my family to fly to Atlanta GA. We arrived with more than enough time to check our baggage and make the scheduled flight. There were two representatives when we arrived one representative just closed his site and walked away leaving only one person to service the remaining passengers. The lady left alone was very slow helping one customer which lead to the remaining passengers being left without enough time to process their baggage. When we got to the desk she informed us that it was too late and she would have to reschedule our flight. We tried to explain that we have been waiting in line for at least 20 minutes and there was more than enough time if they were properly staffed. She just apologized and rescheduled our flight for an all night red eye flight that will leave us short on time if not late for the graduation we planned to attend. She also charged us $75 each totalling $225. This was my first attempt to use Frontier Airlines as of now I will never use this airline again. I now see why they are rated number two in airlines with the most complaints.

There will be additional fees. You will have to pay for your baggage (both checked and carry-on). Your seat will not be guaranteed unless you pay a minimum of $8 to select your seat. Frontier has a strategy of overbooking presumably to ensure full flights. Every day groups of these extra passengers are forced into later flights. Check-in is 45 minutes prior to departure" means that you will be charged $75 and forced into the next flight if you do not check-in 45 minutes prior to departure. Frontier is the only airline that pulls their employees from the check-in counter and shuts down their check-in computers 45 minutes before departure to ensure that you will not be allowed in if you arrive late. I was running late to my flight this morning and called Frontier's 1-800 number at the suggestion of the friendly JetBlue check-in folks as Frontier's counter had recently been abandoned. I manoeuvred my way through the expected automated system and finally reached a woman who handled my situation with the patience and understanding of a grizzly woken from hibernation. I was interrupted and rudely instructed to be quiet and listen to the rules before rebooking my flight. By the way this airline treats its passengers I should not have expected their employees to be any happier. Frontier employs bait-and-switch policies to maintain the "cheap ticket" reputation. In reality Frontier's customers are not presented with an honest estimate of the cost of their travel at checkout. My conclusion is that the service one receives from other airlines is well worth the additional 20% in initial ticket costs. You will end up paying that much more to Frontier anyway.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have flown Frontier many times over the past several years. My last flight with the company will be my last! I flew economy class knowing that I would have to pay extra for checked and carry on luggage. Prior to my trip I used Frontier's website to determine the acceptable dimensions of a carry on bag. I then measured the bag I intended to take. It was within the guidelines provided on the website. I paid to check one bag and proceeded to the gate to board the flight. Just prior to boarding the gate attendant required me to place my carry on bag in a little box to ensure that it was of proper size. It did not fit by less than a 1/4 of an inch in the length. They immediately charged me $50.00 for the carry on. I have flown with this same carry on bag for many years it has even taken several trips on Frontier and fits perfectly under the seat. Needless to say because of this experience I will pay a little extra to fly on Southwest and/or United at least then I will know exactly what its going to cost me before I leave the house!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I recently flew from Dulles to Atlanta and back and for the most part it was a pleasant experience. I have flown AirTran more often than another airline and Frontier is comparable. I bought my tickets directly from Frontier about 4 months in advance. I paid $20 for a carry on $15 for an exit-row seat and $3 to choose my seat at time of purchase (twice coming and going) and my total round-trip fare with fees was $198 so if I had not paid the extra fees it would have been $122. In reading the reviews here I see that many people buy their tickets from third party sites (Orbitz etc.) and are surprised by the "hidden fees" when they reach the gate. I really think that they have only themselves to blame. First every time you fly you should check the airline's website for their policies; the fees are very clear on Frontier's site. I think even the third-party sites tell you to check the airline's site. I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for people who make assumptions and then become indignant when their assumptions don't match reality. I also read below that the flight attendants wouldn't help lift luggage because of "policy. On both my flights the staff were very helpful with luggage so clearly it's either not a policy or one that not all attendants heed. The only minor complaint I have about Frontier was that both flights were late to take off by about 20-30 min. There seemed to be no particular reason for the delay. I didn't have a connecting flight so I didn't care but it might be useful info.

Never mind extra fee's! How about no show flights! Recently stranded in Milwaukee flight 996 - Milwaukee to Trenton. Arrived 4 hours early for the flight and saw on status board that the flight was cancelled. Went to ticket counter and no one was there when staff showed up for work I addressed them with the problem and was told a matter of factly that the flight was cancelled. I was treated like a fool and no one - not one Frontier rep cared that we didn't have a ride home. I had to rent a car and drive to Trenton from Milwaukee. Do not fly with this airline they will strand you and leave you to fend for yourself.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We arrived 90 minutes prior to our flight and (despite discrepancies in their fee structure from what their website stated) we made it to our gate trouble free. Only then did we find out that our flight was delayed by 2 hours because the co-pilot didn't show up (come to find out they had known for hours but didn't update their system so we woke up at 2.00am for nothing). They told us we would make our connecting flight despite the delay which was an impossibility given the schedule. Of course we missed our connecting flight and Frontier representatives were unhelpful and unapologetic. No one can tell us where our luggage is or when we will get home. Other carriers have open seats going to our destination but Frontier refuses to buy us a ticket. The next seat they can "promise us" will be 24+ hours after we arrived here!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier used to be a solid budget airline and living in Denver I was comfortable using them. I must admit that the last month I've told many how my wife was recently treated. To start they are getting very skimpy on extras so she found out that her bag check would cost $35 when she got to the airport. This all but kills the advantage they have over United for 'cost' though if she had known earlier she would have bag checked to save money. More important though was the way that first the agent at the gate treated her about how she should have checked after she obviously didn't know about the fee. It was more of a "it's your fault" thing. Then she explained that she is recovering from shoulder surgery to the agent who told her to discuss this with a flight attendant and they will "Assist". Unfortunately when she boarded the less than helpful person said "Well you should have bag checked if you have an issue lifting your bag and then told her per policy she couldn't help" My wife is very kind when speaking and pretty tough but the really rough attitudes had her crying. I'm sorry but I fly a lot and will do anything in my power to never fly them again and I live where the hub is.

I took time to read the reviews of previous passengers of Frontier Airlines and if I had relied solely on what I had read I would not have bought tickets. I disregarded the reviews read all the requirements for baggage fees and seating costs and bought tickets for my daughter and I. Did round trip from Baltimore to Florida and back. It was a pleasant experience. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. Even after paying for luggage seats and hand luggage the total fare was less than most airlines if not all. I will definitely fly with them again.

Another Frontier flight where the TV's don't work. On the way out from Denver today no TV and on the way back from Los Angeles tonight the same problem. Planes are as dirty as I have ever seen them. What happened to my favorite short run airline. I'm a Summit member who can't believe how quickly things have gone bad. Date of flight 9/6/14.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We will not fly Frontier again. My husband and I bought our tickets through cheaptickets.com and picked Frontier because it had a non-stop flight to our destination and because they had the cheapest fare by about $20 a ticket. We were only going to be gone a short time so we both packed a carry-on so we could avoid paying to check a bag. When we checked in for our flight we found out that we would have to pay $35 for each carry-on! We thought Frontier was ridiculous to charge so much (if at all) for carry-ons when no other airline we've flown with charge for that. Also Frontier charges almost $2.00 for a can of soda or juice. You only get one free cup of water after that the price goes up to the same as for a soda. Frontier lures it's customers into buying airfare by offering tickets that seem to be the lowest priced but then rob you with all the hidden fees. Frontier also has its flight attendants pitch a credit card offer to the passengers during the flight. I know that it is their job to do so but I found it extremely annoying. Although the flight attendants were friendly it does not make up for the feeling of being robbed. I will give Frontier a point for the flight attendants being friendly and a point for it being a non-stop flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My husband and I arrived 55 minutes prior our 10.13 flight from Seattle to Denver on Labor Day. When we arrived to the ticket counter we saw a small sign that stated that a Frontier representative would not arrive until 11am and to use the nearby kiosks. We attempted to use the kiosks but the system stated that due to our late arrival we would need to speak with a Frontier representative. Since there was no representative at the ticket counter we had no way to check in for boarding. When we call customer service they let us know that there was no way we would make our flight but Frontier would graciously charged an additional $150 to place us on another flight. We then were charged $50 for our 1 carry on bag.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My daughter needed a ticket from Dallas TX to Minot ND. There are only 4 airlines that go to Minot. When we started looking at prices Frontier offered the one-way flight for a total of $174 which included a lay-over in Denver CO. Regarding the "nickel and dime" tactics - I actually appreciate them! It provides the option of taking the services for an additional cost or leaving them and saving some cash. The day before the flight we checked in online. During this check-in process I added a checked bag for $15. The option was there to select a seat for $3-$25 but we opted out of the choosing. We printed the receipt for the bag the boarding passes and a receipt. The flight was scheduled to deport at 2.15pm so we arrived at DFW at 11.30 to make sure we had time should any issue arise. When we walked up to the ticket counters a Frontier service agent was standing by the kiosks to provide assistance. Since I had printed my boarding passes she directed me to a counter clerk who was checking bags of passengers who did not need to check-in at the counter. The checked bag weighed 50.5 lbs. They checked the bag. I asked about my daughters purse/bag to make sure we would not have a problem with it being too large to count as the free personal bag. She assured me it was fine. Both agents were friendly. This entire process so far had taken 5 minutes. The plane arrived to the gate boarded and took off on time from DFW to Denver. I asked my daughter about the seats and such and she said it was the same as most other flights she has been one. She did take her iPad with movies on it and watched that during the flight. Landed in Denver on time. The Denver to Minot flight arrived boarded and departed on time. She had a smooth flight the flight was relatively uneventful and arrived in Minot 5 minutes early. After getting off of the plane it took her about 20 minutes to get her luggage and she was on her way out of the airport! Overall a budget airline with great prices.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We flew Frontier for the first and last time this weekend. We purchased our tickets online with the assumption we could carry on our bags for the weekend. We were charged $60 each way. This was not disclosed when we purchased our tickets through Expedia. We were not able to sit together as the selection online required more payment to select our seats to "upgrade" in which we were not even upgrading we just wanted to choose our seats. They now even charge for a pop. We fly 1-3 times per year. Just charge what you want up front (offer discounts for those who have no luggage which would probably be one in thousands) so people know what the total bill will be. It is very deceitful and unfair practice to get more money when it's advertised as the lowest fare etc.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier seems to be doing their very best to consistently frustrate and anger the people who fly with them. My first experience I was stuck in Denver for 18 hours due to cancellations and delayed flights. Then when I requested another flight staff did absolutely nothing to help me switch my flight book a different flight or even refund my original ticket. They had me on the next available flight at 9.30 am the next morning (which would have been a 29 hour layover). I ended up just booking another ticket with another airline to fly to out. I understand weather causes delays but at least work with the travelers to accommodate them on different flights/airlines or give them hotel/food vouchers to help. It was ridiculous. The next experience (and hopefully the last) I had to fly on a different date than the date on my ticket. They tried to charge $450 dollars to change the date by two days even though I had just purchased the ticket a few hours earlier that day. They refused to refund the ticket (it would be issued as "credit" for a different ticket) and wanted to charge me an additional $75 dollars to cancel the ticket. The airline employers are extremely rude. The line was long the travelers were getting frustrated while the only two workers did everything in their power to take as long as they possibly could. They denied military checked bags (even though I had travel orders) because I had 3 of them and the girl was too lazy to tag them. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and was able to get them all checked for free. Will do everything in my power to not fly with this airline again. Even if I have to pay 50 bucks more for United it still comes out even since I don't have to pay $35 to bring a carryon.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Worst airline experience. The employees are rude and snotty they airline charges you for everything. $15 to pick your seats for a family of 4 that's $60 $30 for a carry on $25 for each 1st checked bag $4 for water no free refreshments here. I can't understand how they stay in business. If you want a roomier seat that's $30. On take off there were unsecure bins in the galley so when the plane pitched up there was a loud crash. We flew this airline because it was the one Priceline recommended for our trip. They took an hour to get everyone's checked luggage to baggage claim. Save yourself the headache pay a little more and fly a real airline carrier.

Flight 754 on 8/17/2014 from Sky Harbor to DIA. They have all these rules about when we are to check in etc but when we get there to check in where are they? The Sky Harbor ticket counter was horrible. Not only did we have to wait on them for 15+ minutes when they did show up they sauntered like they had all day. No comments to anyone about our wait. We happened to be first and actually got our bags tagged after the sixth person in line behind us. The gal "helping" us was rude and I swear moving as slow as she could. Maybe I should not have said anything about being there first! I have over 200k frequent flyer miles-Southwest here I come!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have been flying Frontier Airlines for years. Not anymore. Both flights had broken down planes. My flight out of Milwaukee had a flat tyre. There was only 1 maintenance person on duty. They had to call another in to help fix the tyre. Our flight to Denver was delayed 2.5 hours. Of course our connecting flight was gone once we landed in Denver and there were no other flights available. Frontier shuttled everyone to a hotel for the night. On the way back home my flight from Denver to Milwaukee also had a broken plane. Flight delayed by 2 hours because we had to wait for a plane from Los Angeles. I have flown almost every US airline and this is the worst.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flying from Phoenix to Denver. Frontier has all these rules about when passengers need to check in but it is ok to make us wait 15-20 minutes to check our bags. The staff come sauntering down to the ticket counter no apologies and no welcomes. My husband and I were the first ones there had checked in and reprinted our boarding passes and ready to go. Did a ticket agent ask who was there first. Of course not and then we ended up waiting while they dealt with six groups before we were taken care of. When I said we were there first I got the evil eye and then had to wait until the agent got to us and deal with her snarky attitude. I swear that cost us even more time. When I tried to call customer service the edit time is 35 minutes. Guess I am not the only one with issues. I have 200k miles in my frequent flyer program. Guess I will have to be desperate to us those. Southwest here I come.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
What you get on Frontier Airlines is one glass of water free. Everything else costs something and all those something's are so under par that the whole Frontier Experience becomes a terrible experience and a costly one. You really don't get a carry on unless it's as big as an old computer case. Customer service will split up families and try to seat two year olds from their mother and they don't follow through with handicap assistance. I found the whole Frontier Experience not one to do again. I advise you to get a credit card with baggage allowances and fly those airlines. They are better and cheaper. I forgot about my credit cards but I won't forget again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Thunderstorms in Denver are common and although they cause delays the delays are typically limited to 45-60 mins. We flew from Milwaukee to Denver to Santa Ana and back the same way. Our flights were all on time and even arrived a little early each destination. All of the staff were very friendly from the people at the check-in counter the flight crew and even pilots. The check-in counter people were very accommodating to our family with two small children. My husband is a veteran and with his military ID they gave us free checked bags and also even upgraded one of our flights to stretch seating! This was a very appreciated surprise! This was definitely an excellent experience flying with Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Was set to fly out on a Friday to Denver then Bozeman from Atlanta. ATL airport had a fire in a tram which shut down passenger travel between concourses. Long story short we were stranded in a tunnel. I wasn't worried as I told my wife and kids that the airport is shut down so our flight will be delayed. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the monitor had every flight delayed but the Frontier flight it took off without us and several other people. I still thought "It's ok they will get us out to Denver to catch our connecting somehow. I was incredibly let down as the airline did nothing to help us just put us on a flight 3 days later. They didn't offer any apologies made no efforts to fix the problem. To make it worse they redirected our bags from Bozeman back to Atlanta on a Saturday. Of course the bags did not make it to ATL. Another 2 and half hour conversation with Frontier - more rudeness. I got a security guard in Bozeman to get a luggage woman to finally locate our bags and hold them for us. It took me 15 minutes what Frontier couldn't do in 2 days.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Trying to get home to Orange County CA from Orlando. Flight was scheduled for Monday but I tried to grab an earlier flight. Frontier had zero flights leaving until Monday. On Monday as I arrived at the airport I was notified the flight had been changed to 5.48 am the following day. I was given a hotel voucher. A few hours later I happened to be walking past ticketing and noticed my flight to Denver was now showing 11.48 pm same day (in a few hours). I asked if the flight at 5.48 am tomorrow was still on schedule. She said no that now tonight's 11.48pm flight. No one called or emailed me letting me know about the change. I asked if I could fly the 7.45 am flight next day instead of this 11.48 pm flight. Was told no it's full. When asked if they could try to change my connecting flight time in Denver from 2 pm to something a little earlier they said they didn't know how to do that. I was traveling with a 9 year old and they didn't put us together. I look forward to my 12 hour lay over in Denver now. Will never fly this awful airline again.

I am a medical student in Omaha and took a quick trip out to Durango with friends. The airplane broke down before the scheduled departure the mechanic was not available I missed my connection in Denver and have been here for the last 24-27 hours. Apparently Frontier does not work with other airlines - or other airlines don't work with Frontier. The two men at the gate where I was on standby were less than courteous the ladies at the customer desk were nice but unhelpful. They have no way of checking to make sure that my luggage arrived in Omaha either. For a company that nickels and dimes its customers for seat assignments carry-ons etc. it sure isn't making itself seem worth the money. Just save yourself the headache and fly another airline.

Thunderstorms in Denver are common and although they cause delays the delays are typically limited to 45-60 mins. My flight from STL to DEN was delayed 2 hrs then 4 hrs I wasn't worried as my layover for my flight to SEA was 5 hrs. When we arrived in DEN we were informed that flight was delayed 6 hours (leaving at midnight as opposed to 6 pm. The plane arrived but the outgoing crew had left. They changed the flight until 1.45 am and finally cancelled the flight stranding all 150 passengers in the airport. No rooms offered no meals offered not even a toothbrush!

Flew from SLC to Denver then to Puerto Vallarta. First flew with small children all separated from parents when asked to change seats was told by a very rude stewardess that we had to stay in assigned seats. What person flying wants to sit next to someone else's crying two year old? Then the stewardess had the nerve to talk to other passengers about us very unprofessional. Pay the extra fly Delta.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew in and out of Trenton from St. Augustine. A little nervous after reading review however our experience was great. I didn't go in with high expectations and was very pleased with the outcome. First we flew Classic Plus which allowed more leg room (my son is 6'3" and needs extra space). This allowed us to check a bag each and have carry on for free (in addition to the allowed personal item). The seats were roomy and comfy. The staff at each airport was friendly (we arrived 1.5 hours before the flight with boarding passes printed at home as instructed). Had read horrible reviews of Trenton but found it very nice though small. Restrooms available at the gate a nice little eatery upstairs (before security). If you plan well and read the fine print you should have no complaints. It was 100 times better than my latest flight on United to Newark last month.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight Cleveland Hopkins to Fort Lauderdale. Flight was delayed already when we got there because of domino effect of previous flights. It was delayed even more when previous delayed flight to Atlanta had a bad tyre which delayed theirs and our flight by one hour. Total delay time for our flight more than 2.5 hours. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews because they never read the small print. Use your common sense a $30 flight is not going to include baggage fees. Plane was airbus A320 featuring fin the tiger shark. Seats were very uncomfortable and needed new cushions. No IFE. Crew was friendly and we received free drinks for late time. I expected this from a cheap airline so that's why the review is not too negative.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I've flown 8 times with Frontier airlines and I couldn't be happier with their service. The flights were laid back and quiet. Once I even lost my boarding pass after I went through the security checkpoint. The lady at the terminal was very nice understanding and knowledgeable. After verifying my identity with a few clicks at a computer she printed me out another pass and I was able to catch my flight without a problem. They've never lost any of my luggage either. The inflight crew were always very nice and quick to respond to questions and concerns. The only down-side I could find is that you can only buy in-flight refreshment with a credit card - no cash.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Each time if you are in the front three rows the crew restrict usage of the overhead in preference to the people not already boarded. This usually means that we end up putting their bag further down the plane and the first three bins usually end up not full and people boarding further back of the plane end up using the bins. It is illogical and rude to the passengers already boarded. Now we have to wait to go down the plane to get our bags. It makes now sense. Frontier you have lost me with your ridiculous policy.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
July 29 2014 was flying from Minneapolis to Idaho Falls one stop in Denver. Ladies at the ticket check in said the flight was overbooked due to weather and we would not make the connecting flight until Aug 3. After 2 hours of going back and forth talking to them about options which they were unwilling to help with we asked how many seats were available well we found out 6 or 7 so why could we not go on our assigned flight? We arrived in Denver the flight to Idaho Falls was delayed and yes there were seats available their too. So why did the ticket ladies not just let us check-in in the first place?? It would have saved us 2 hours of stress. I'll never fly with them again!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Plane departed and returned to the gate three times while in Atlanta due to a warning light. On the fourth try the plane took off - now 5 hours late. Connections were missed in Denver by nearly everyone on the plane resulting in a mass of unhappy yelling customers. Options presented by Frontier were to wait for the next flight - in 48 hours - or get booked on a different airline with additional legs and a long layover. Frontier offered a hotel voucher for what ended up being a 3 hour stay and meal vouchers which were not usable at 1 am. Through this I had a toddler with me who became exhausted and dehydrated. Never again will I consider Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I had no problems with my flights (PDX-CVG via Denver) either with Frontier's service personnel or my expectations. It strikes me that most of the people posting really bad reviews didn't read the information Frontier provides when purchasing a ticket. Frontier is exactly what it says it is basically an al a carte airline. My flights were on time the staff was professional and courteous. Check in online and print your boarding passes at home and you'll have no problems at the gate.

I've flown Frontier numerous times and never had a problem except once my luggage was on a later flight. Minor inconvenience and it was returned to me at 2am the next morning. It happens with any airline. The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I guess there's always a first time but I still plan to fly with Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My sisters and I went to Minneapolis. We left Idaho Falls flight 446 and 120 on July 25 2014. Flights went smoothly and staff were nice. July 29 2014 on our return flights 115 and 447. We arrived at the Frontier counter to check in and were told a tornado hit Denver and all seats were taken and no seats available until Aug 3 2014 so we could get a refund that night. In a panic we checked other airlines to Idaho Falls we could get another flight the next morning Delta or United. We asked the Frontier counter to help us book a flight they said they could not help us either a refund or travel Aug 3. We were about to ask for our refund when my brother in law suggested we try again to get to Denver options were better there to get to Idaho Falls and cheaper. The ladies at the counter said they could not help us we asked if their were seats available on flight 115 finally they said yes there were seats available but we would miss the flight to Idaho Falls. We told them we would take our chances since the flight going to Denver was delayed 1 hour maybe the flight to Idaho Falls would also be delayed they would not assign us seats to Idaho Falls just to Denver only check our baggage to Denver which we opted to carry on. We barely arrived at the gate for flight 115 after 2 hours of fighting with staff at the check in counter as they were boarding. Staff on the flight were very nice and apologetic. Flight 447 was delayed due to weather as we expected and had to wait for seating assignments just as they were boarding. Boarded the plane and again their were a few empty seats. Arrived in Idaho Falls only 30 minutes later than the scheduled arrival time! Had we not insisted that staff get us on flight 115 we would still be in Minnesota.

I arrive with more than 40 minutes to spare for my flight from Trenton to Raleigh. Due to a website issue I was unable to print out a proper boarding pass. Upon arrival the kiosk would not allow me to print my pass as it was under the 45 minute deadline a deadline that I have never encountered in all my years of flying. The Frontier reps at the counter were of no help and were quite hostile to my (and the 7 other passengers) complaints. They are essentially running a racket. Trenton airport is small and the time to the gate from the ticket counter would have been 5 minutes or less. Yet Frontier asks (though I have yet to see this information anywhere other than the Trenton ticket counter) you arrive a full 2 hours before a flight to get a boarding pass. My flight was at 6.25 this morning. It was an absurd experience and easily the worst I have ever encountered flying.

I can only speak to our experience on Frontier and it was good. Flew from Cincinnati to Punta Cana DR on a chartered vacation flight in July 2014. Non -stop. 1 free checked back carry on and soda. Food was extra. Both round trip flights started boarding early left on time and arrived a few minutes early. I would fly Frontier again if the price was right and departure times made sense.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew yesterday from Trenton to Ft. Lauderdale. Was very excited to be flying from Trenton - much more convenient than going to Newark or Philadelphia. Check in was fine - security easy and waiting area adequate. The problem came when the flight was delayed for 9 hours - yes 9 hours. I spent the entire day and evening at the airport. the problem is two-fold - why I am not likely to fly Frontier again: 1) The communication throughout the ordeal was worse than awful - it is pretty clear that they knew early on that this was going to be a horrific wait. They kept stringing us along - many of us could have gone home for the day but instead we were there not knowing what was going on. 2) Second issue - staff are incredibly rude. Staff upstairs at check in were great but those in the gate area - with the exception of the manager were rude unhelpful and without basic knowledge needed to be interacting with passengers. 9 hours late and poor customer service are problems that need to be addressed.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I took this flight this AM 7/19 with my family Atlanta to Denver. Departure 8.47 on time. Good. Flight was safe landing was nice. All good. Cannot complain. The main reasons I log this review is because if you are flying on a budget (which you likely are on Frontier) then beware of the surly attendants the lack of snacks coffee and beverages available on a 3 + hr flight. This was a 8.47am flight no coffee no individual snacks for purchase one box snack available for purchase and some sodas/juices. I don't look forward to airline "snacks" but when you fly with kids creature comforts are welcome at times. Very strange airline. Very strange flight. Not worth the $1400.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We flew Frontier from Trenton to Tampa because the flight appeared to be the least expensive and because of the convenience of Trenton Airport. It was a mistake that we will never make again! No free luggage at all - the first piece checked in costs $25. If you have a carry it costs even more - $35. When we factor in $8 a day for parking at Trenton Airport we ended paying more than what we would have flying other airlines. The flight was delayed both ways. The fight from Trenton was over an hour late and it was just seem as par for the course. No apologies whatsoever. We're waiting for the flight from Tampa and it is delayed as well. The service is awful - you'll get a cup of water for free. That's it. It is just not worth it.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I was on a flight with Frontier that was delayed 7 hours. There was no contact from the airline to me (phone text or email) alerting me of the delay. When I arrived to the airport I was informed that I could not check my bag but still had to pay the $25 checked bag fee. I then had to dump all of my liquids from my bag so it could go through security. We were then delayed another 90 minutes while sitting on the plane at the gate at which point flight attendants informed us we could pay for beverages snacks or TV if we would like. The pilots were the only friendly and apologetic staff associated with Frontier. I would not recommend Frontier to anyone. The flights may be cheap but you pay for your seat bags and everything else later. Additionally if you do have a complaint you cannot get anyone to assist you.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I fly Frontier only when I have to that is when there are virtually no other choices. I don't mind some product differentiation in which they charge extra for "extras" but it is completely ridiculous that they intentionally won't allow people traveling together to sit together without paying an extra fee. Also charging for carry-on bags is very annoying but I can live with it. The Frontier company attitude appears to be one of "screw the customer" and as one who works with customers all the time this attitude really bothers me.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
July 11 2014 I travelled to Portland Oregon from Des Moines Iowa via Denver on Frontier Airlines flights 155 and 799. The ground personnel at the Des Moines and Denver Airports were extremely helpful and personable. The air personnel (both flight attendants and flight crew) were courteous and attentive. As for the newly revised baggage policies of Frontier I understand and accept them. Frontier Airlines is no different than legacy airlines. They are here to provide good and comfortable air service to their passengers. But they are also here to make a profit. Again hats off to Frontier for providing courteous friendly and helpful service.

Flight 527 Cleveland to Denver and 745 Denver to Phoenix. Return flight 1112 Phoenix to Cleveland. July 7- 15. My family of 7 just flew to Pheonix from Cleveland and back and I have to say I was very pleased in fact impressed with how smooth things went. I had read several reviews about Frontier and I have to abmit I was nervous about flying with them. We have flown on several airlines and I must say I will be flying Frontier in the future the associates were very helpful and the aircraft were very clean.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I had checked in online and printed boarding passes and coupons for my luggage. I arrived at the Madison WI airport 40 minutes prior to my flight. Madison is a small airport and usually does not take much time to check luggage and get to the gate. The Frontier desk was closed. There was a sign on the counter stating someone would return after the flight left. We did not make our flight to Seattle. I think it would be most helpful if Frontier stated on their website that the gates close 45 minutes prior to take off and that you will not be able to board your plane. I paid $75 to get a flight out a day later. I asked if I could travel to a nearby airport and take their flight later in the day to Seattle and I was told this was not an option unless I wanted to pay full fare $600. They were unwilling to put us on another airline going out today. I also paid to select my seats so I could travel with my daughter. I am sorry I did not read any of these reviews prior to my trip to avoid such a disaster. I will avoid Frontier at all costs in the future and can only hope my trip tomorrow goes without problems.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My family and I also had a horrible experience with Frontier and will never fly them again. We had no idea that we would have to pay $35 for carry-ons and $25 for checked baggage. We would have packed differently if we had known this. Each of my children had a small rolling suitcase which we ended up checking and it cost us $250 total extra for the trip. I feel like they robbed us! This extra charge is not common practice among any other airlines I have flown before. Then we get on the plane to discover that all drinks and snacks cost as well. They didn't even offer water on two of the flights. There is very little leg room so you feel like you're packed in like cattle. The whole trip gave us a terrible feeling about Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I am so frustrated with Frontier's new policies to charge you extra for everything: seat assignment carry-on bag checked bag coffee on the flight etc. I'm sure they will be charging for seat belts soon. Frontier used to be my favorite airline but now I avoid them at all costs. I am happy to pay a little extra (or not in many cases) to fly Southwest Airlines where they still let you check a bag for free and carry on a bag with your personal item. If Southwest isn't available I look for anything other than Frontier now. We are spreading the word and on my recent flight from Cincinnati I heard several passengers complaining saying they wouldn't fly Frontier anymore - it's so ridiculous. And because passengers have become so frustrated this has caused Frontier employees to lose their patience... what was once one of the friendliest airlines is now the rudest. Shame on you Frontier - this is the worst example of customer service I have seen in many years.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I arrived at the Sioux City airport an hour before my flight. It's a very small airport with just a few flights and a few gates going at one time. 30 minutes prior to my flight the man at the ticket counter announced they were closing the check-in desk and no one else would be able to print boarding passes or check luggage. I had checked-in previously from home and just needed a boarding pass printed. Frontier did not have a single self- service kiosk at the airport so I wouldn't have to wait in line with people who needed to check baggage. Myself and about 12 other people had been in line for 30 minutes but were turned away from our flight because they closed the desk. The next option they presented was rebooking in Omaha which is a 90 minute drive without offering a complimentary rebooking or even a discounted ticket. Frontier claimed it's their policy that guests arrive 2 hours prior to their flight (but neglected to mention their counter closes 30 minutes prior) so their desk closure was our problem - not theirs. It's pretty appalling that they were able to turn people away like that when there was adequate time to get everyone checked in and boarded if they hadn't closed the counter. The entire situation was unfortunate and handled poorly by the airline and by their employees. I will avoid flying Frontier going forward.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flying to Denver from Seattle and back Frontier failed to get me on either flight. In Seattle the check-in desk was empty at 6pm Saturday with a sign that it would reopen 10 hours later at 4am. The automated machines were not giving boarding passes and I along with other passengers were stranded unable to reach our flight. On the return trip in Denver recent changes in timing cost me my flight. At the start the desk representative wasn't aware that my boarding pass could be printed for me after I'd checked in online. Unlike all other airlines the doors are closed early and baggage handling is closed early in Denver so I forfeited my pre-paid $20 baggage fee to try and make it to the airport. Luckily for me my bag was small enough to be carried on. Arriving at the gate I was told the doors had already closed and myself (plus some others who arrived after me) were told to go to customer service. It seems a policy change at Denver has Frontier closing their doors earlier than any other airline meaning I had no realistic time to reach the gate. Arriving at the customer service desk after being turned away from my plane I was told they would charge me $75 to be put on standby for a full flight 3 hours later. The staff were unsmiling unsympathetic and unapologetic. I'm now sitting through my first wait at the airport on standby for the next flight. I'm told my odds are not good and I'll probably be spending all day waiting for a flight home. I will not fly Frontier again.

TTN (Trenton-Mercer airport) NJ - CLE (Cleveland-Hopkins) OH. The customer service couldn't have been nicer. They were very nice on the plane. Sure they charge you for a carry on bag and beverage but what do you expect for an incredibly cheap fare. For the most part they were on time it was a bit delayed in Trenton because of minor issues going forward. This is essentially the "T-Mobile" of airlines. You pay for what you want how do you expect they make those fares so low. Great Airline gets you where you want to go recommend to anybody who is on a budget.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Pretty good for a low-cost airline. I know they recently changed their policy on carry-on luggage where I believe you have to pay to have a carry-on bag using storage above. My last trip with them was in January of 2014. They were on time friendly bathrooms were clean and the flight was comfortable. In September of 2013 I flew from KC to PDX with a stop in Denver. On the way back to KC we did miss our connecting flight by about 5 minutes. They hadn't taken off yet but they wouldn't let us on because they were to leave the dock in just a few minutes. While it was a bit annoying they got us on the next flight to KC which left about 90 minutes later and I understand why they couldn't let us on that original connecting flight. Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight. With the changes in carry-on costs I'm not sure I will fly with them again because it all really depends on where I can get the best deal but if they are still the cheapest I have no qualms with flying Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Denver to SFO July 2nd. This is an inferior airline due to its policies and poor customer service. It is a myth that it costs less when you are done with their nickle and diming. The flight crews are fine it is everything leading up to it. The extra charges are over the top. The only thing that does not cost is a glass of water and using the toilet but I would not be surprised if this will change. I witnessed a young woman traveling with a baby who had paid for a checked bag. When she decided should needed to carry it on she offered to pay the difference and was told there was no way to refund and she would have to pay full carry-on fees or she could not board. Robbery by any other name. Any company that gouges the customer to stay in business needs to close its doors. Buyer beware.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Check in was slow and unfriendly. My seat on the way to my destination was slouched to the right and the cushion was worn below the frame so I had two hours of metal frame for a seat. Costs for drinks are what they are but the crew could offer the complimentary cup of water or the charge for bottled. Also if you have to delay a flight 2.5 hours and not update the flight information on the boards I highly suggest you use the intercom when calling to finally board. I appreciate that I was nearly left behind after being told that You were being screamed at to close the doors yet could not properly inform passengers that the plane planning to leave. But here is my favorite part about Frontier Airlines I incurred a baggage fee for my personal carry on that was not large enough to have to stow above when I paid in advance online for only the bag I was checking to go under the plane. Lastly thank you for eliminating one more option when I decide to fly. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again and the other 3 people in my group agree!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I would never fly Frontier Airlines again. Last week we have a 7am flight departing Denver on Friday morning. We arrived at the airport at 5.30am to check in for our flight we had to check bags so we figured we would just check in at the gate. We waited in line to check in for 45 minutes and when we got to the check in counter the lady stated that their system had locked (it was now 41 minutes before our flight) and we were not allowed to check in or attempt to catch our flight. Their policy is that you must be checked in 45 minutes before departure or you are out of luck we were 4 minutes late but had also been waiting in line for 45 minutes. The front desk lady was extremely rude and unhelpful and just continued saying "well do you want to pay the $50 per person to change your flight to 5pm tonight" we did not have any other option. The kicker was we took the 5pm flight and of course checked in 45 minutes before it took us under 15 minutes to get from the check in counter to the gate we could have caught our flight in the morning without any issues. Poor customer service terrible policy took no responsibility for the 45 minute check in line. Absolutely disgusted and will never travel with them again.

Flight 369 from Newport News to Denver. My girlfriend and I checked in at our house and did not have access to a printer to print our passes leaving us with the only option of arriving early to have them printed by a Frontier representative. Confident that we were on time (over an hour early for boarding at this small airport) we stood in line behind a handful of people and two sometimes one representative. The line crept. Two or three people had been assisted in front of us and all the sudden the Frontier representatives walk away behind closed doors for over five minutes. Upon their return all of the paid in full checked in online customers were told in a rude manor that we were all not getting on the plane and to call a 1-800 number for further assistance. We were told it was our fault and there was no other option. The boarding gate could practically be seen from the check in counter there was still 50 minutes to board and all that was standing in our way was a piece of paper to let us through. The clock was ticking while we were about ready to give up. With only a few minutes to spare a woman showed up and took some names and returned with boarding passes. We boarded our flight with a foul taste in our mouths from the unprofessional attitude received from the Frontier representative at Newport News airport. Check- in was "closed" but we were all checked in and just needed a pass printed. Why was someone else able to help us? Airlines are a customer service industry and if you lack the most basic skills to satisfy those that support you there will most definitely be a problem for you in the future. A couple of boarding pass kiosks would have eliminated this whole headache.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier is not cheaper. I recently flew American Airlines to Seattle to get my two children and we flew Frontier back to TN. I had no problems at all with American to Seattle. No unexpected fees and charges or hassles at all. You should know that your buck doesn't stop with buying a ticket with Frontier. You must buy your seats and you must pay $50 per any carry on that goes in an overhead or checked at the gate. Even if it fits easily. They are out to squeeze every dime out of you in every way. You must pay for any beverage or snack on board. Not just cocktails and large snacks. They assured us at the gate in Seattle that we would see our baggage in Knoxville. We did not. They're lost and no one knows where they are. I've never written a review to express my dissatisfaction with an airline before but this airline has the worst customer service ever.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Spokane to Denver 18 June. Stormy weather in Denver prevented our flight from landing 3 times so we flew to Colorado Springs to refuel. We had to stay on the plane and only 1 of the 3 lavatories was operational - there was a line of about 30 people waiting to use it. An hour later I was close to the lav and had to sit down again for take-off. We got to Denver 2.5 hours late and my connecting flight to Little Rock had already left. After standing in a long line I found out their next flight to Little Rock wasn't for 2 days. They gave me a ticket to Branson Mo for the next day and I slept on the airport floor. In the morning I exchanged the Branson ticket for a Little Rock ticket for Friday since I didn't have transportation from Branson to Little Rock and got a hotel room for Thursday night. I left Denver Friday evening and got into Little Rock just before 11 pm. My luggage was not there. It had not been in Denver the 2 days I was there. The agent there couldn't get ahold of any of the other airports either. I called the baggage dept at Spokane and twice said they'd call back and haven't. I will not use this airline again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
ILG-MDW 6/1/14 Flight 383. I disagree that the fares are higher once you add in the extras. Who do you think is paying for your extra luggage and soft drinks? You are! Everything is figured into the price and when compared to Southwest I know I saved quite a bit on my recent purchase. The service was timely and professional as well. I give Frontier credit for trying to carve a niche and I predict they will be quite successful as people get educated with regards to what they are doing. Also when fewer people are hauling on oversized luggage and trying to stuff it in the overheads it makes for a smoother and quicker loading and departure from the gate. Ultra low cost carriers like Frontier typically charge $5 extra to carry on a bag versus checking it which effectively eliminates the luggage hoarders trying to board planes with too much luggage which most would admit makes for a slow maddening boarding process. Also if you check/carry 100 lbs. of luggage on other carriers who offer free checked bags and carry-ons who do you think is paying for the extra fuel it takes to transport that? That's right it's you again! It's all built into the ticket price. Again I'd rather pay for what I want and for what I use. I was happy to pay a bit extra for leg room but not for everyone else's extra baggage. I'd rather bring my own bottled water than pay for all the soda and peanuts that everyone else drinks. I'm happy with the experience and will be trying this more often. On very short trips I can make due with a personal sized item and not even have to pay any luggage fees whatsoever! It's a win-win once we all better understand the concept.

Seattle WA (SEA) - Denver CO (DEN). Economy Class A320. 13 June Flight #284. Denver CO (DEN) - St. Louis MO (STL) Economy Class Airbus A319 13 June Flight #138. I thought all airlines were about the same but Frontier takes cheap and greedy to a whole new level. I was amazed. 1st carry on bags were 35$ each. Nothing free on beverage cart except cups of water. Attendants just average but the service people at Denver and Seattle were downright rude! We arrived 2 hrs early at check in but no clerks w/long lines then plane arrived 1/2 hr late. When we boarded taxied to flight line then had to go back to gate because of equipment failure so we were an hr and a half late leaving Seattle but they did hold our connecting flight because it was late also. Don't fly w/ them!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew Frontier for the first and last time this past week. I had a business trip and this was the most cost effective airline for me. First my luggage is a rolling carry on that is the appropriate size and fits in any other airline. Frontier forces you to stick it in a sized up box at the counter to be approved to get the carry on onto the flight and that is for each connecting flight. It's difficult to fit in and I noticed a few people who were charged $50 per bag to have it checked because it did not fit. I lucked out but had to go through the ordeal all over again at my connecting flight in Denver and was told my bag would not fit when it did just a few hours earlier. On my 1st flight the passenger in front was in a broken seat and the stewardess continued to scold him to pull his seat forward for landing/takeoff when he repeatedly explained to her they finally comprehended to get a maintenance person on the flight who did not even fix the seat. I could go on and on but the points above are the biggest red flags and disappointments. Each flight was worse than the previous.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I never used Frontier before so I took a gamble for a weekend trip. My flight was scheduled to leave at 3.13pm. I was not told of any delay until I was at airport with bags in hand. Personnel were more concerned about the size of bags rather than telling us of a delay. We were delayed to the aircraft flying to Tampa first and coming back to Trenton. We finally got on board at 5.30 for a 5.50 departure and then were delayed as a passenger was injured trying to get onto plane. After that hour delay the captain stated that there was some issues with the plane's log so could not leave until that was fixed. Another hour passed and we finally pushed back from Gate at 8pm. We ended up sitting 15 minutes waiting for traffic to clear. We finally got in the air by 8.15pm. I have been flying for 25 years and never heard of a log book issue delaying a flight. Since we were so late had to rebook rental car and had other issues.

DFW-DEN on 6/14/2014. Arrived at airport at 4.40am to find out that our 6.10am flight was cancelled due to not having a flight crew. There was no notification of such a cancellation even when we arrived at the airport the monitors still said 'On Time'. There were over 100 people in line at the ticketing counter and only 2 agents at the desk. Hold time on the phone was over 30 mins. Frontier could not get us out that day and we had to be rescheduled for the next day. When I discussed the no notification of cancelled flight one customer relations person told me they didn't know why I didn't receive a notification later another told me that Frontier no longer does flight updates. Arrived at airport at 4.35am on 6/15/14 for 6.10am flight and there were over 50 people in line to check bags and no one showed up to work the Frontier counter until 5.00am! Received several "textbook" answers from Customer Relations regarding the issues with Frontier - not one seemed concerned with anything. This airline is not what it used to be.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My daughters flew from KC to Salt Lake City via Denver. They were told in Denver that they could not board after having flown from MCI until they paid additional "baggage" fee in the amount of $100.00 for the two small carryon bags that they had. That is one bag each. My daughters were very upset as they had little cash with them and no credit cards. This is a form of extortion as far as I am concerned. I prepaid for their flights with the understanding that this was all paid for. Why would you sell a ticket and not figure that there would be any baggage?

### Frontier Airlines customer review
DTW-TTN-DTW. Outbound flight was delayed by weather 4+ hours. Not Frontier's fault but once onboard we were charged $1.99 for lukewarm coffee: is it expecting too much to get freebies after such a long delay? Apparently so. But my main gripe is their carry-on policy. It appears based on our experience both ways that after a certain number of passengers have boarded they simply assume the overheads are full and require people to pay extra to check their carry-ons. This happened to us and when we stopped arguing and got on board the overheads were nowhere near full. That's a $50 hit each way.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
First time flying Frontier instead of Southwest and was very disappointed! Not only do they charge you for checking a bag but also for any carry-on and they charge you to sit with your party. The check in process is inefficient and slow the staff are not nice. Once on the flight there is a charge for any beverages and snacks but water is free! They then try and convince you to sign up for their credit card wit their on-board "deal" and awkwardly try and explain why it is a good idea. Will definitely be paying a little more to fly Southwest!

Cincinnati OH (CVG) - Denver CO (DEN) Jun 10 2014 F9 0735. Denver CO (DEN) - Cincinnati OH (CVG) Jun 11 2014 F9073. My first around trip flight on Frontier I was sceptical. From the moment I entered the Frontier gate area CVG to Denver flight onboard during the flight and the landing all aspects of the experience was professional. The aircraft's were clean flight crew were making every effort to accommodate the passengers. My return flight was also the same. I would utilize Frontier for my flight service and recommend to others. My one complaint was the long wait for phone service the wait was 20-25 minutes. I feel that's far too long.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Four of us travelled from Philadelphia to Cancun on May 29 2014 flight 19 at 7.15 am. I was not allowed to take my carry-on bag onto the plane unless I paid $50. My other choice was to have them check it for $25 so two of us paid additional $50 for small carry-on bags. The other couple was not charged any money for their carry-on bags with the same customer service representative. My request to speak with supervisor was ignored. The customer service personnel could not have been ruder. On return flight from Cancun to Philadelphia on June 8 2014 we did not have any charges for the same carry-on bags. I will never look at Frontier again when booking a trip.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
May 31st 2014 from Denver to Orlando flight 678 return June 6 2014 flight 677. We booked our trip through our travel agent months before these new carry on charges went into effect. We were told we would not have to pay the extra fees. As we arrived at Denver airport and proceeded to the Frontier check in counter we were told we had to pay for our carry ons all of which could fit under the seats we explained what we were told and the check-in guy looked up our booking date and all was fine not the case at the Orlando airport on the way home. We asked for our check in bag back and since we still had 7 lbs allowed in that bag before they added another $75 we started to unpack bags and re-pack so as not to give them one dime more. Needless to say after all the rearranging which was totally unnecessary we were allowed to take our carry on bags as personal items. As I said before we did not have to use the carry on overhead compartments all the bags were so small they fit under the seats with no problem at all. After arriving at the gate we heard several stories like ours. There were so many upset people saying they will never fly Frontier again. It's not just about the money but it's about how you are treated.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
What was once a decent airline is now beyond a nightmare. The new baggage policies are ridiculous. They are taking no frills to new limits and despite the few bucks you save on the ticket price you will end up paying more than competitors in the long run after $2 water charge $50 carry on charge (for the first carry on) and have a poor experience. Customer service if you can even get it is awful. On the phone from a gate agent etc. this airline is almost primitive now. Very disappointing. I will never choose to fly with Frontier again. The one upside is that the flight attendants were courteous and professional.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Achieved what they offered. TTN-RSW. First flight out. On time boarding departure and landing (a few minutes early). Crowded plane and they checked the size of my personal item 2x. I had to take out a few items (stuffed in my pocket to make it fit) but overall uneventful journey. I can't speak for service as I slept the entire flight and deboarding was uneventful. I faintly remember the offer for water. Seat pitch normal - I didn't pre-assign seat so was in 2nd to last row but had an empty seat next to me. I'm aware Frontier gets a bad-rap due to its fees but if you know what you are getting into I don't see the issue as it is still cheaper vs flying/parking at PHL or EWR for same route.

Flt 232 from Denver to Nashville 06/04. The ticket was not much cheaper than on Southwest. My computer travel system booked it because it was cheaper but it did not figure in the extra $20 for a checked bag and $30 for the carry on bag. Then they charged for a drink and snack! Charged for watching TV yes you have to use your own phone ipad or laptop but it is free. Plus if you want to select you seat in advance it is from $8 to $15 extra. This will be the last time I fly on Frontier.

After a revolting experience on a Frontier Flight from MCO to DEN we bit the bullet and flew DEN to SLC May 21 (noon). What a difference! Wonderful stewards on board friendly helpful welcoming. Still cannot believe how rude people are when told that their huge bag cannot fit in the overhead just check the damn thing! Saves a few dollars boarding time too but it is funny to watch people unpacking their overhead bag and trying to put all items in their large "handbag" then try to hide their now just as big handbag.

I've flown from Harrisburg PA to Orlando FL and back a few times in the past year. Most of the time it was a good experience. One flight which I booked way in advance in the snow season had more than 3 hour delay and I would have missed my appointment so there was no longer a need to fly. I got a refund for which I was thankful. One flight had comedian flight attendants giving the on board preflight information (buckle up etc) that were actually funny. All flights were nonstop from PA to FL which was so nice. The rates were great for an average wage earner like me which was my main reason for choosing Frontier. Now I'm booking 3 tickets for my family and my total bill will be less than I would pay for one ticket with the other major airline flying out of MDT.

Scheduled to fly Frontier 902 ATL to TTN today. Flight canceled without notification or explanation. Next flight offering to TTN was in 5 days! Frontier refused to assist with rebooking on an alternate airline. Offered only refund or hotel voucher. Customer service offered no other assistance. I was left on my own to book same day out of ATL on Memorial holiday (to PHL requiring trains and cab to reach my car at TTN airport). Very expensive out-of-pocket.

Arrived at airport 2.5 hours before flight. No one was at the ticket counter despite a line of about 50 people. Shorter line of about 12 at Kiosk but they were having trouble so the line was slow. After finally getting to the kiosk had trouble getting it to work. (Like the others before me.) When it finally did start working I started pressing the continues until I realised that I had just input that I had no carry on. No way to back up so I printed the ticket and got in the line waiting for the ticket counter. After I finally got through all this I got to the gate just in time to board. Never again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Booked a cruise for the family in Alaska and we were hoping to fly Frontier from ATL to AK but when we got to the airport the airline said flight was delayed for 3 hours. Not a big deal but since we were connected through Denver we would miss our connecting flight. Also happens before not a big deal. The big deal was we would have to lay over in Denver for 2 days. We ended up being able to book a flight on Delta for twice as much and now the nightmare of trying to find out how to get linked up with our ship. Airline was very rude dismissive and well trained in saying sorry. Which is appropriate since this airline is very very sorry all around. Great to book if you don't care much about getting to your destination. Also don't be fooled by the prices. They charge you for both your checked and carry on luggage. They are a complete waste of time and money.

I have flown this airline many times. I saw all the bad reviews and thought while everyone vents when they are frustrated very few take the time to praise when they are satisfied. So here is a satisfied customer. My one wish would be service to Boston or Manchester.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
They cancelled our flight from Orlando to Wilmington at the last minute saying the plane did not ever leave Denver. They said maybe they could get us on a flight in 3 days! They would not help even help us find another airline to fly. They just gave us a business card with a 1-800-432-1359 number on it. This had a 67 minute wait time. We had to pay top dollar at US Air to get to a city close to Wilmington.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Hands down worst customer service of any airline/company. I first attempted to call their customer service line to resolve my problem and everytime I called there was a 45+ minute wait so I emailed instead. Keep in mind it takes them 3-4 days to respond to emails (which I find unacceptable) so I tried to work it out with them for a few weeks. Following my initial complaint the customer service rep went in and deleted all my airline miles I had accumulated seeing as how my initial contact with them was resolving and issue on using them. Second they didn't even bother to tell me they deleted the miles they tried to play me for being ignorant and said I had no miles. Three weeks of battling with them they have restored part of my points and refuse to assist with my initial issue of using the points. Absolutely worst customer service ever!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We will not fly with Frontier again. After having paid for tickets for our trip to Costa Rica months in advance we were informed at the gate that our flight was delayed but the check in agent said that we should still be able to make our connecting flight through Denver. So we check our bags ($50 for 2) and go through security. Upon arrival at the gate we were told that we would arrive in Denver at 11:55 p.m. which was the departure time for our connecting flight to Costa Rica. We asked if they would be able to hold the plan for 10 minutes so that we and the 3-4 other passengers who were in the same situation could make the flight. The gate agent said that she had called the staff in Denver and they refused to hold the flight as it would further increase delays. Frustrated we asked to be put on the next flight hoping we could leave the following day at the latest but she told us that the next flight with available seats was in 6 days. We asked to speak to her manager who essentially said that out options were to wait six days or that she could (reluctantly) refund us for the cost of our original flight and book a new flight through a different airline. We had to research flights on our own as they had no intentions of helping us secure seats on a new flight. We ended up paying an additional $400 to book last minute tickets on American Airlines waiting for her to process our refund and get our mailing address to send our checked baggage fee back to us via mail and then rushing to the next terminal to go through security again and catch our flight. Ultimately we paid more than we would have if we'd just booked through American months ago. Plus the lack of customer service or care regarding out situation was infuriating. We are waiting for our flight to Costa Rica as I type this and just praying that they successfully rerouted our bags. Overall a terrible first experience with this airline and we didn't even make it on the plane.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I don't understand the negative reviews. Seating was good. Comfortable seats didn't feel crowded. Entertainment for $4 you get to watch Direct TV. It is free until the flight takes off. If you are really concerned about $4 then I don't know what to say. There were about 30 channels available.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Our flight from Seattle to Branson and back was the worst experience ever. I felt at each terminal that it was their first day in business and they had not worked the bugs out of the system. All the employees seem to be angry about something poor morale and no idea of what customer service is all about. The only good thing about this trip was leaving the Branson airport my wife and I arrived there early no Frontier people there however a Southwest agent checked us in and we had absolutely no problems.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
MCO to DEN on May 13. I am on crutches and found staff from other airlines to be wonderful helping me but not this time. The stewardess at the front of the plane was the most miserable and unhelpful person I have come across. I don't know why she was even there - a road cone is more useful than she was. She just stood there glaring at everyone that boarded with her arms folded not attempting to help anyone. Abruptly told me to out my crutches in the overhead not attempting to help me do so. The only time she did anything was to miserably ask what people wanted to drink or eat. She was more than annoyed that she had to do anything as it disturbed her gameplay on her phone.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier was delayed 120 minutes from new Orleans to Denver for weather in Denver. We were informed all our connecting flights would be delayed and that we would make our connections not to worry. Upon arriving in Denver many passenger's as well as myself learned our flight connections had left. Many appeared to have been delayed 10 minutes or so clearly not inline with the info provided by new Orleans staff Frontier offered to put me on another flight at 4pm the following day and we could sleep in the airport. No other options nor recommendations for other airlines were provided. My husband searched with me and we purchased a one way ticket from Denver to Salt Lake to get home that night. My family will do whatever we can in the future not to fly Frontier Airlines.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
After reading all of the negative comments on this site I wanted to give some positive information. Most people only write a review when they are unhappy and don't take the time when it is a good experience. We flew from Milwaukee to Denver and then Las Vegas. Everything went very smoothly. All flights were on time. If you don't take time to read all of the rules then be prepared for being unhappy. I checked out everything beforehand and didn't have any surprises. The nice thing about the carry on bag requirement is that it eliminates people from bringing hugs bags on and trying to stuff them in the overhead bins. By limiting this and have the airline actually follow the rules they have makes for everyone getting on the plane and seated so much faster.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I chose to fly with Frontier because of their low prices. I was not aware that this meant I was sacrificing any type of customer service. I booked a flight from CVG I had not received the online check in email and was not at a place where I had access to a printer so thought it would be easy enough to check in at the counter. This was incorrect there was no kiosk and the line was quite long with several people ahead of me checking bags. Although it was not mentioned in any of my emails Frontier seems to have a strict policy that they will not check you in if your flight is 45 mins or less to boarding. Although we were all in line within this time frame due to the slow movement several of us were not at the counter 45 minutes before our flight. This was handled by one lady looking up at us and saying "no they are cut off" and no more. We were all very confused and asked what was going on we needed to check in and she ignored us. There were 3 people at the counter and four in line but they would not respond to us at all just completely ignored us and would not explain what was going on until a fourth attendant came up and asked how she could help. This is a frustrating experience no matter what but to just be ignored like that was one of the rudest ways these staff members could have handled it. I do not plan to continue to fly with Frontier even if does save me a few dollars because people should not be treated that way.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I will never fly with Frontier again. I was in a rush trying to find flights to make it back home before my grandfather passed away and found some tickets through Orbitz. We were supposed to fly out the next morning at 6.15am. I checked in early online and printed out boarding passes. When we got to MSP we were an hour early. There was no one at the bag check counter so we proceeded to go through security and were told our passes didn't work. We were directed back to the counter to get new passes but by this point we were beyond the 45 minute window and couldn't speak to anyone. While I was on the phone with Frontier explaining what happened they said we had to pay the $100 fee per person to get our flight changed to the next available flight. As I was on the phone they came on the intercom calling our names but we couldn't get through security. We then spent 8 hours in front of the baggage check before we could check our bags and go through security. After being nickled and dimed for every fee they could possibly come up with they have the nerve to say "you booked on a third party website and can't sit together".

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I do not plan on flying Frontier again. Cannot confirm seats prior to check-in unless you pay however no one explains this. Thus my husband 3 year old and I were all seated in different parts of the plane. Even when I paid to check in early on my return we still were separated. Everything is an additional charge. I would rather pay one price and know that I can have a confirmed seat can carry on a bag and can have one cold beverage on my flight. Flight attendants sit in the back of the plane and read a book. Not sure what the point is in having them. I booked with Amex points (a "third party") thus carry on luggage is extra. Pretty much everyone in our line had booked through a "third party" so we were all in the same boat. They make everyone have their carry on bag measured which was one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. This created chaos in the waiting area as multiple lines had formed and half the people didn't know what was going on.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We left from Omaha and after checking in going through security and getting to our gate we were told to wait in line to put our carry ons and personal items in a slot to see if we would be charged. Very rude same thing happened changing plans in Denver. Leaving Las Vegas at 6.30am told to pay $50 for carry-on I said we didn't on the way out and she said we are a 3rd party and that is how it goes. Wait through a very long security line sit down and again they told us to wait in a very long line to check to see if everyone's carry-on fitted into the slot. I have MS and lines and standing are not the best for me but myself and my husband do what we are told. Never once was there a problem. Staff were not friendly. I travel 12 to 15 times a year for work and have never had to do any of this. Then they come through with the snack and beverage cart and tell you sorry your drink is $1.99. We have never been treated like lower class on any flight business or pleasure. I can assure you we will not save $20 for a flight and go through Frontier ever again. I know everyone wants cut backs but they may want to look at customer service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Never mind how 100% of everything (drinks food checking baggage) is "available for a fee" I understand that is a way to save me some money. What makes this airline the worst experience I have ever had traveling is the fact my flight was delayed - I understand that happens - but that made it so they could not get me on my connecting flight home. They cannot get another flight on their airline for another 2 days. They refuse to help me at the desk I call their customer service line on my own personal phone which took several hours for them to tell me they will not help me get on another airline. I have to stay at the airport for 2 days. Not even an upgraded seat. I saved a little money on Frontier tickets and they are costing me hundreds of dollars. I will never consider giving them my business again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Poor inflexible service. If you don't have your boarding pass printed before you get to the airport you might miss your flight. Their machine shut off 45 min before the flight and they don't staff their counters. 30 min on the phone and they were still inflexible. Couldn't rebook flight until 4 days out. Don't use this airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
SEA to OKC round trip 4/10/2014 coming home on 4/14. I made sure I checked all their rules checked one golf bag online saved 5 dollars each way. Plane was not as clean as would like. Just an uneventful trip with no snags. the Denver to SEA connection was very close time wise. If you do your homework and plan you can save money flying with them. I would fly them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew from SEATAC to Midway near Chicago with a stop in Denver. This was round-trip so there were four flights in all. Not one flight left on time. You would think the law of probably would ensure that at least one flight would be on schedule but that was not so. We flew classic plus so we had one free checked bag one free carry-on and a free drink during the flight. I feel sorry for those that had to pay for those things. When did we have to start paying extra for customer service? Since you have to pay extra for everything everybody tries to make all their luggage carry-on. This slowed down the boarding process and only made the whole experience worse. Everything but the seat you were sitting in was extra and it seems that if federal guidelines would allow them to pack more people onto a plane by doing away with the seats they would do that too! The flight attendants were courteous to your face but since we sat in the front right next to them we could overhear them talking about passengers in the back and previous passengers on other flights. Very unprofessional. I would not recommend this airline to anyone expecting a decent experience. If you don't mind being treated like you are cattle being led to slaughter then this airline is for you. I wouldn't fly Frontier again no matter how low the fare is.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I fly all the time and try to fly Frontier if at all possible that is until tonight. I won't be flying them anymore. Flying Denver to Kansas City originally leaving at 7.15. After three gate changes our flight is delayed over 2 hours. Funny thing is there is a later Frontier flight flying to Kansas City and they are boarding now. Everyone is asking why Frontier wouldn't switch planes so earlier flight could leave first. We aren't only people affected either Frontier is moving everyone gate to gate and there are delays galore.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I fly a lot for business and must check a bag for tools. My selected seats (non premium) were rejected at check in and random seats were assigned. I expected baggage fees for checked baggage but my briefcase was large enough to qualify as a carry on instead of a personal item. Sizing explanation was not available until the rate increased from $50 to $100. Random seat assignment always means middle seat assignment. My return flight was not as booked but this may be my travel agent. By the time all of the surprise fees were added I could have flown another carrier for less. They would be better named hidden fee or bait and switch airlines. Alaska Delta and United would be better choices for routes in the Northwest and West. I didn't eat or drink on the flight but n/a is not a review option so I chose no opinion. The flight crew was professional and genial the check in staff was bright and chipper but unhelpful.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew PHX-DEN on 3/27 for $90 a person during spring break. Flight was on time boarding quick and organized except for the carry on bag size check which was very unorganized at boarding. Flight attendants gave out water for free and on a 1.5 hr flight food and drink purchases weren't needed. Checked bag was out before we even got to the baggage claim belt. All in all a very positive experience and highly recommend Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I was penalized because I booked my flight through Orbitz. I had to pay for seats - $8 a piece so that I could sit with my kids. The airlines nickel and dimes you - you pay to carry on or to check a bag. I ended up paying $80 each direction to check 4 bags for my family. Then they give you no beverages for free on the flight - a 4hr flight and you have to pay $2 for a coffee or soda! Finally - their computer system could not let us check in online - because my husband and son share the same full name - one is Jr the other is III. I have never had a problem with this on any other airline. Frontier told me I should have booked their tickets separately.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Denver-Orlando and return: March 18-24 (FFT678/FFT681). If you know what you are getting into with this airline it's not half bad. I researched and knew Frontier charges for carry-ons if you don't meet the requirements or book a fare on their website so I made sure to bring a proper sized bag and got on no problem. I do the same thing when I fly Spirit. The customer service wasn't very good in Denver but once on the plane the flight attendants were very nice and helpful especially when my TV broke and the customer service in Orlando was noticeably better. The flight on the way out was delayed due to snow and wind but I can't fault Frontier. Overall an enjoyable experience and considering they have TV (yes they charge but so do most others) I did my research and they were nearly $200 cheaper than the nearest non-stop competitor I would certainly would continue flying them again.

Des Moines to Las Vegas March 24 2014 and return on March 27 2014. One of the legs was flight 782 on March 27th. They reel you in with a low fare and then nickel and dime you to death. As a business traveler I'll steer clear of this airline from this point forward.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight 667 March 7 2014 Cleveland to San Francisco. My 19 year old daughter booked a flight in early March and had two small carry on bags. When she checked in no one at Frontier mentioned anything about a charge for a second carry on. When she got to the gate they told her she needed to pay $100 for the second carry on. She offered to check-in the second small bag and was told "no we have to charge you $100. She ended up having to check the bag anyway but they still charged her $100.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew from Denver to San Diego on 8.59pm flight. We did not board until 9.20pm and started to taxi but returned to the gate due to the plane had a malfunction with one engine. We didn't taxi for another 20 minutes which all of this caused a serious delay! All of these events seemed to be a disorganization on Frontiers' behalf. After all of this confusion and frustration Frontier employees acted as if they did passengers a favor. No compensation was awarded i.e. beverages or anything. On top of this distraction I landed late causing my rental car reservation to be cancelled and had to barter with taxi drivers for transportation to my hotel. As far as I'm concerned this airline has the worst customer service bar none!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have flown Frontier before and thought that for the price it was a good option. However I suppose it had been longer than I remember since I experienced Frontier. I was told that my carry on was too big (I have taken it on every flight for years including Frontier) and that I had to check it. Then I was told that whether I checked the bag or carried it on that I would be charged an extra fee! I specifically travel light to avoid fees and baggage mix ups. I actually drive an extra hour to get to an airport that includes Frontier so that I can get a good deal. Never again. I hate to say this as I am a working person myself and don't quickly complain about service but unfortunately the Frontier employees were plain rude. I can almost overlook this since I would be frustrated with all the angry customers if I had to deal with them too. Frontier doesn't seem to care about the passengers anymore.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
March 3 2014 – Flight F9 395 ILG–DEN. March 5 2014 – Flight F9 396 DEN–ILG. Thank you Frontier for my recent ILG–DEN flight coincidently on the Alberta Clipper and Polar Bear tail ID. The New Castle (Wilmington DE) Airport was pretty much the only game in town during the March 3 snowstorm. Nearby Philadelphia Airport was all but closed. This was true for earlier snowstorms too. Our flight was delayed about an hour due to de-icing issues not the airline’s fault. This little airport has all the charm of a Soviet-era military installation but I’ll gladly forego shopping mall ambience for short lines free parking easy access and cheap flights. I carried-on so can't comment on baggage. Service was comparable to other low-cost domestic carriers. Return DEN-ILG was delayed about 20 minutes. Their Mediterranean Sky Snacks Box was purchased for $7 and it was ample tasty and good value for money.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I used to be a big fan of Frontier but no more. Three of us travelled from DFW to SLC for spring break. Much to my surprise I was not allowed to take my carry-on bag onto the plane unless I paid $100. My other choice was to have them check it for $35 more than if I had checked it in initially. The gate personnel could not have been ruder. I will never look at Frontier again when booking a trip.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My husband lives in Chicago and I live in the Northeast. One of us flies every two weeks. We use Frontier on a regular basis and while I think they can improve on the carry on bag size checking process other than that we've both been more than impressed with the low fares and clean safe planes. The flight crew are funny and make the trip seem quick.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was my first and last flight with Frontier. We arrived at DIA with plenty enough time to drop off our bags and make it in time to the gate for departure. However when we tried to print our already completed boarding passes and drop off our bags the computer directed us to go directly to the gate. The only option we were given was to re-book a later flight at a cost of $100 per person (5). We were not treated properly and can only anticipate how we will be treated once we actually get on the next flight. I already do not like the cost to pick a seat and the cost to bring luggage and will try to stick with Southwest for future flights. Judging from the other posts it is clear Frontier has a serious PR problem and doesn't care about customer service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
2013 Christmas Vacation from Atlanta Georgia to Trenton New Jersey. I found a ticket within my budget and booking the ticket was easy. Boarding was done quickly and very organized. The stewardesses were kind and very helpful to passengers. The only difficulty I experienced was with the ticket checker upon boarding in Atlanta after I learned that my bag wasn't within standard regulations to be a carry on. This one young lady was very rude and short with me. She took no time at all to explain to me the steps that I needed to take to secure my bag from the gate. Her only reply was "You're not getting on this plane. I was quite taken back by her rudeness. However as quickly as she had insulted me another young lady at the desk came to my rescue and she was very helpful and polite. I was able to check my bag and board my flight without further incident. The plane was clean and the flight was quiet and friendly.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My husband and I got to the airport to discover that the flight had been delayed 10 hours. There was only one person behind the desk to re-route an entire plane of people. We got in line and the line had barely moved in 2 hours. I called Frontier was told that the next time we could get out to our destination was 5 days from then. I then went to the American Airlines counter-they said if Frontier was willing to release the first half of our tickets they would be glad to honor them. I called Frontier and they refused. When I tried to reschedule the return date for 5 days later the agent said they would do that but we would have to pay 100$ each for a rebooking fee. Everyone in line had horror stories about Frontier.

Orlando to Denver. First and last time I will fly with Frontier. Very rude and disrespectful flight attendants. They were the most unprofessional crew I have seen. They treated everybody like they were doing them a favor. They simply don't realize that customers pay their wages. It's just not worth it.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This was my first and last experience with Frontier Airlines. I bought my ticket not directly from Frontier Airlines and found they treat these tickets as if you are an inferior customer. I paid to check in my luggage and not one word was mentioned about my carry on I proceeded to the gate and was told I had to pay $100 to get on with my carry on bag. I travel often and have never had to pay for a carry on. The gate agent had terrible customer service and when I finally made it on the plane everyone around me was also complaining about the horrible customer service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The first time I have used Frontier and it will be the last. Everything was fine until I was boarding and then they said that my ticket didn't say carry on.I had to walk to the check in desk which was about 20 feet away and tell them. This is when I was told that I needed to pay $100. After that shock and paying the money they then told me to carry my bag and go ahead and get on the plane. On my return flight I made sure that I told the check in attendant that I had a carry on and needed to have it on my ticket so I wouldn't have to pay 100 more dollars. She then said my bag was too big and would have to be checked. I have used this bag for many flights and never has it been to big for carry on. It is the standard size approved for airline carry on. Worst airline I have flown.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Our flight was cancelled due to the recent snow was told since we didn't buy our ticket from them we have no travel options to get rebooked. Now on my 3rd day of standby. Everyone I have dealt with has been rude and gives conflicting advice. We were offered another flight in a week or money back. Problem is this is a family vacation now with lost rental car lost ski condo etc. no offer to switch airlines or rebook as things settled out from storm. No offers to get others to give up their seats. Never seen anything like it.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight 668 and 678 on Feb 4 2014. Tries to charge you for every little thing. Who ever heard of charging for carry-on baggage? As if it costs them anything for me to drag on my own suitcase hoist it up to the overhead compartment and then lug it back down! Why do they charge so I can pick my seats? $1.95 for a Coke? There was no airsick bag when I started feeling nauseous. Luckily the stewardess got a plastic bag to me on time but how many times does someone have to wait 5-10 minutes for a stewardess to show up and no one does? Finally they spend half the flight trying to get me to buy a frequent flyer credit card. I'd rather drive.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I wish I had read these before booking. We booked our flight through another site so had to pay for bags (the only way we knew about the flight was because of the other site you would think they would be glad for the business) travelled with children could not sit together ended up in middle seats throughout the plane. We arrived at our initial airport on time but the incoming flight was late so we got in late to Denver they let us off the plane to try to make it we ran to the gate to be told (with 10 other passengers) that they released the plane. We were four minutes late apparently that was the one flight that could not be late we were trying to make a reception that night in SLC so had few other options. Customer service was the worst I have experienced in 40+years several different people sat at the counters without acknowledging customers when they did talk to us they were extremely rude acted inconvenienced by customers. We've flown 4 airlines this year this was our first and last for Frontier. Awful not worth the cheap tickets we got nickel and dimed and treated unprofessionally.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I caught a Frontier Airlines flight from San Francisco to Denver CO then from Denver to Cincinnati on Feb 5th 2014. The airfare is reasonable but I was surprised to learn that you cannot choose a seat in advance I was charged $50 for a carryon luggage plus another $25 for a "preferred seat". The agent at the gate later explained to me that I had a "basic" ticket which does not afford passengers with similar benefits than those who book their flights through Frontier AL website. Another surprise is they charge passengers to watch onboard Direct TV ($5.95) plus $1.95/standard beverage such as Pepsi products coffee etc.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Another awful experience by this the worst of US carriers. Flew IAH-DEN one way only good part was that the ticket was cheap and flight left on time. Previous flights all delayed by at least an hour. Crew were surly and rude and didn't want to be there. One attendant barked at passengers to not put bags in the overhead unless it was their row (never heard that before). Another yelled at me for keeping my Iphone on during taxiing which is allowed by every other airline now (TSA/FAA have change the rules). Worst part is they charge you for a can of soda ($2) and make a big deal about giving you the whole can!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew Frontier for first and last time to Nashville-Phoenix. Connecting flight delayed 45 minutes due to mechanical problem with door. Return trip: Phoenix-Denver flight ok. Flight from Denver to Nashville took off and had to return to Denver (plane landing gear unable to retract). In both situations staff had very poor communication informing passengers of situation. Rudest flight attendants I have experienced. No compensation for inconvenience or lost time due to delays. Frontier is an economy airline I get it. They want to charge you for anything/everything they can. Baggage food and beverages.

Just did a round trip from Salt Lake to Orlando changing in Denver. We had pre chosen seats on Orbitz we arrived and had been separated for our flights what would posses a company to charge for a carry on I paid $20 for a checked bag and then was stiffed for $25 for a carry on. But here is the good part when boarding in Denver from Salt Lake the plane was late so we had to rush to the next and was treated horrible by the flight attendant saying we couldn't come on late and expect a place for our carry on (the one I paid $25 for). No complimentary snacks or beverages.

I booked a flight on Frontier for my parents on Oribz.com. Their whole Frontier Airlines experience was a disaster. The Frontier employees told my parents that because they booked on through a third party that their seat assignments would not be honored. My senior citizen parents were crammed in the last row by the bathrooms and made to feel like it was their fault because of where they bought their tickets. They were not seated together. They were surprised to find out upon check in that carry on bags are not free even though the Frontier website chart says that "Economy" tickets are free. They came to learn that this is only if you book directly through Frontier. Very misleading. They had to pay $50 to take their carry on. The gate attendants were rude. My parents arrived early for their return flight and were made to feel stupid for getting there 2.5 hours early. The gate attendant told them to just sit there and "someone will be around at some point". So tricky baggage fees rude employees and being treated like you in trouble because you bought your ticket off Orbitz all equal one bad experience and the fact that our family will never fly Frontier again.

My wife and daughter flew out the day after Christmas (2013) and arrived 2 hours prior to boarding as recommended. Much to our surprise the line to check baggage was extremely long compared to what the other airlines were experiencing. It was apparent that Frontier was under staffed behind the counters so by the time it was our turn to check in the gate was closed for our flight. They did not have an express check in so we were out of luck as this would have helped. Fortunately a relative gave us her miles for my wife and daughter to fly on Delta and after explaining to the Delta representative what had happened they were given priority check in and they were on a flight 3 hours later to their destination. After numerous phone calls with waits of up to 1 1/2 hours Frontier gave us vouchers for the fight that was missed. We have always had great experiences with Frontier over the years but apparently with all the reorganizations buyouts etc.. have lost the customer service they once had.

Traveled from Trenton NJ to Fort Myers week before Thanksgiving. It was one of the most pleasant flights I've had in a long time. They have a small terminal in Trenton not like dealing with Newark. Check-in staff were nice and security was quick. They have a tiny store in the small waiting area to buy snacks/drinks. Plane was about 30 minutes late but once it got there they had us boarded and doors closed in about 15 minutes. They boarded from the middle to front and middle to back - common sense! Flight crew very pleasant. I didn't like the idea you could only purchase drinks or snacks or TV with a credit or debit card no cash. The plane was very clean restrooms spotless flight quiet and comfortable. In Fort Myers I went to the first baggage claim to find my luggage already on the rack. I spent less than five minutes in Fort Myers airport! Return flight was on time and flight crew was also fun. Boarding was organized: first 4 rows then those who had carry-ons that would fit under the seat. I got on then and everyone with bags for overhead got on quickly with much less stress than the Continental flight I took in May. Return flight the same as the first quiet and on time. I had to pay $25 for my luggage each way but not for carry-on. For me this was a great value: $178 round trip and $50 total for baggage. From the comments above some encounter problems with Frontier but it seems to be mostly on connecting flights. I will definitely give Frontier another try as my experience this time was very good!

Our flight was Kansas City to Denver with a connection in Denver to Las Vegas on Mon Jan 6th. Flight scheduled to leave at 6.30am. Flight delayed 4 hours supposedly for mechanical issues. They do not communicate to passengers or update on status. Many people were led to believe they will make connections and waited for info for 2-4 hours to be told they will not make their connecting flight. When we finally arrived in Denver we were told to go to Customer Service to reschedule our connecting flight and waited in excess of 4 hours just to get to the counter. Told that the next flight out would be the next day! Finally we got food vouchers we had been at Frontiers mercy for over 18 hours. After arriving at 3am at Las Vegas airport we had to get our luggage out of impound. From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket purchased through a third-party vendor that our carry-on bag would be $100 per bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverages offered without a charge incurred. The recent addition of fees for everything but use of the bathroom has taken Frontier Airlines to the very bottom of the food chain. Our return flight was no better. We made it on the Las Vegas flight to Denver. When we got to Denver our flight was delayed. Our plane was to leave at 9.13pm. We got food and started back to the terminal and when we got there they wouldn't open the doors to let us on the plane. This was 9.10pm. We were told to go to Customer Service to be rescheduled for another flight. By the time we got down to the Customer Service desk the woman was very rude and said that she couldn't do anything without us paying an additional $100. I paid the money and got a stand-by for 10.12am and a confirmation for a 3pm flight. We spent the next 13 hours sitting at the boarding gate. No where to lay down but on the floor and again our luggage made its way home but we didn't. I will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Over winter break my family enjoyed a wonderful Skiing vacation in Colorado. My boyfriend and I had to leave the trip early. Because of this we paid a shuttle service to get us to the airport early on Sunday morning. When we got to the airport we saw the Frontier flight was delayed 2 hours. No text no call no email to warn us of this inconvenience. When we got to the gate I politely asked the lady what the problem was weather mechanical or just a delay at the other airport. She told me it was mechanical. With that I asked if we could be compensated for our time in the airport with food vouchers. She replied that the delay was not set in stone and therefore would not reward customers. The flight did not leave for another 3 hours and we were not compensated for any food during that time. I was extremely disappointed and plan to never fly Frontier again.

I traveled Frontier to come home from Los Angeles. Frontier has a rule that their ticketing counters open 2 hours prior to departure. Arrived at the LAX ticket counter a little early and had to wait 45 minutes for an agent to check me in. However agents were very nice and got me checked in fine. I flew to Denver from LAX and had no complaints with flight attendants and pilots. My second flight was from Denver (depart at 5pm) to Cleveland. I went up to the agent at the gate to ask a question. He greets me with "Yo. I found that to be very unprofessional. We ended up departing at 7pm I have never boarded a plane so slowly. We landed in Cleveland around midnight. It must be a Frontier thing to be understaffed when unloading bags off the aircraft because that was the case. With all of this said I will never be flying Frontier Airlines ever again.

I flew from Orlando to Trenton NJ. Flight delayed twice but did take off finally. When the flight arrived in Trenton the pilot announced that the runway was too icy to land. We circled for 45 minutes more they tried to de ice the runway. No success! The pilot announced we would now land in Wilmington Delaware and a representative would meet us and provide hotel accommodations. They kept us on the runway for almost 90 minutes and we were told that they were making accommodations for everyone with hotels. Finally get into the airport and are told that they have no intention of providing of providing hotel accommodation. We sit for almost 90 minutes and are told they hired a bus to transport people. Too icy to land a plane but they felt is was fine to put people on a bus. Airport was closing and they were not offering any other options. Arrived back at Trenton 3.30 am. I will never fly this airline again and I don't care how cheap it is absolutely awful service.

Kansas City to Denver connection on Mon Jan 6th. Will never book Frontier again. Surprise fees at the gate. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours supposedly for mechanical issues. They do not communicate to passengers or update on status. Many people were led to believe they will make connections and waited for info for 2-4 hours to be told they will not make their connections. Passengers were in a line to schedule alternative flights to find 1 agent to assist them. Then told you will need to call their 800 number. No excuse for that kind of customer service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I do not recommend this airline for people traveling between Chicago and Trenton. The primary reason: the lack of any semblance of a contingency plan in the event of weather related travel delays. Our Monday flight home to Chicago was cancelled due to weather (not the airlines fault) however the next available flight was Thursday (3 days later). The announcement was made by an attendant yelling it through the terminal and passengers had to quickly get in line in the hope they would get on the flight. The attitude of the attendants was apathetic and no efforts were made to help customers rebook a different flight. Certainly no notion of adding an additional flight to help customers reach their final destination. There was minimal assistance helping people find transportation from the airport find lodging for the evening and it felt like we were being pushed out the door as everyone was scrambling to change their plans and find a way home. General complaints include: understaffed baggage drop-offs confusing and useless signage extremely slow kiosks. There is a general apathy towards customer service - individual front line employees are generally nice and helpful but there is an evident lack of organization and customer concern. The airfare is cheap but you get what you pay for.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Was booked on a flight from Tampa - Trenton on 1/3/14. Flight was cancelled about 4 hours prior to departure and I was left stranded without any options. Frontier stated they could not fly me out for another 4 days and refused to put me on another carrier or on their next departing flights stating "they are already full and you don't have a guaranteed seat". This is totally unacceptable. I had to spend hours on the phone with other airlines and incur excessive charges to take a last minute flight and change my car return time. Would not recommend this airline if it was the only airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We drove 5 hours out of our way to receive what we thought was a discounted ticket for four traveling to Mexico. $180 later for baggage fees and we should have just booked Delta or United for about the same price. It is a "hidden" fee and is not ethical. They specifically ensure that your not aware of the policy. I fly a lot for business and its standard to pay for bags exceeding 40-50 lbs and can also be policy to pay for checked bags (domestic) but I have never heard of having to pay for carry-on baggage that meets their size and weight criteria. If they would have been upfront about it we wouldn't have went through the trouble of ensuring that we were brining four small bags that met their height width length and weight requirements and would have just had two bags and saved ourselves half the cost. Even worse this is on an international flight. I could truthfully not care less about drinks and snacks but a 5 hour flight and they want you to pay for a cup of coffee? I feel as if they should be paying me for the 3 hour delay on each side of my flight that was caused by their incompetence if they are going to nickel and dime their "customers" for every last item. Watch out next time you get on a Frontier flight they will probably have a visa machine to gain access to the bathrooms.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My husband and I are just returning from vacation and are waiting to board our final flight of our journey home to Denver. We arrived at the Frontier ticket counter this morning to find that we could not carry on our bags for free as we had on the way out - today it would cost either $25 to check each bag or $50 to carry them on. This was a sneaky tactic by frontier - very clever to gouge the budget traveler when they believe they have accounted for all costs at the end of their trip. Of course our hands were tied and we had no logical choice but to pay! Wow. My resolution in 2014: no more flights with Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I think Frontier should remove their inclusion on the cheap-fare sites because when you get to the airport you are told that because you bought your ticket on one of these sites you have to pay $55 for your carry-on etc. The departure and return flights were changed and I had to stay five days longer than planned. Also the people using these sites were put in the very back where the seats don't recline. This would all be fine except by the time Frontier gets done with you you might as well have paid regular fare. Every airline I have ever used cheap fare or not will email when the departure time has been changed even by only 5 min. You rescheduled your departure time for 25 min. earlier without letting me know. I was lucky to get to airport in time. I will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We fly Frontier only because it is the only airline that provides direct flights to Madison WI. I would like to admonish everyone not to leave the check-in desk without checking if you received all tickets that you purchased. We wasted 40 minutes with 3 kids under three at the check-in desk checking in our bags. At first the agent was too lazy to carry several credit card transactions for checked in luggage and was saying that she would check in two bags under one passenger's name and another bag under another passenger's name (we had 3 tickets) - we ended up paying $5.00 more which is not a big deal but the agent's attitude was far from professional. After that ordeal we have to return to the check in desk two times as the agent printed only one boarding pass at a time without checking that there three tickets under the same reservation and that happened two times! In addition the crew was out of soap and coffee and by mistake took our bag thinking that it belongs to the crew member. We were happy that it was only a 1.5 hr flight. In general the service was not so bad but little customer service issues ruined the pleasure of having a nice flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I'm a Summit member with Frontier and have been for approx 10 years. In short I booked 4 'Classic Plus' seats for myself and family in October and was told that I could not select seats at that time. So exactly 24 hours prior to the flight tried to check in and received 4 seats (none of the 'Classic Plus' variety scattered throughout the plane). These are all middle seats too. I suggest no-one fly Frontier unless you have time to waste (flights are always delayed) travel alone (can't get seats together) and have no baggage (carry on or otherwise). If you are sane and can do the math by the time you book their "Ultra Low Cost Carrier' fare add in baggage ($50.00 at min) and carry-on ($25.00 at min) you've just paid the same price as United Delta etc. and get to buy your own water.

I read other messages on this board and arrived at Denver Airport fearing the worst. At it happened my experience was entirely opposite. My wife and I fly had booked on Frontier understanding that like other low cost airlines (e.g. Air NZ) you get what you pay for. We had never flown Frontier before. We are Americans but have lived overseas (mostly Australia) for several decades and have been consistently amazed when flying in the USA at the huge suitcases that are show-horned into overhead luggage areas supposedly as carry on. Carry on for us elsewhere is an enforced max 7kg (15 lb) and much smaller in size than the Frontier allowance though admittedly at no cost. We had prompt service from a polite and friendly service team who went out of their way to find for us a luggage option that minimised cost and maximised our enjoyment.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight 403 from Denver to LAX on 12/18/2013. I am a Denver native and resident and the decline in the quality of this airline is sad to me. It was never a top tier airline in quality but the recent addition of fees for everything but use of the bathroom has taken it to the very bottom. Want to select your own seat? $8. Stretch seating? $20. Carry-on bag? $25 each way. Seltzer water? $3. Oh and today you have to stand in a new separate line where they force you to stuff said $25 carry-on into a sizing box. If you don't they won't allow you to board the plane. The staff is inflexible probably because of the new corporate rules. Two round trip flights in the last month they are my last ever on Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I bought a classic plus ticket so that I wouldn't have to pay at check in. However if you check in online you still must wait in line (this was in Seattle and OKC) because there is no curbside drop off. You are better off using the kiosk to check in at the airport because you will receive priority for baggage check. They are severely understaffed and use outdated computers and communication systems so everything is super slow for check in. At OKC two of the 3 kiosks weren't working. Of the 4 flight attendant crews that I experienced on this trip one crew was awful and one crew was great. it had been a while since I had flown on Frontier and I'm with other reviewers when I say never again. Unbelievable.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I've flown Frontier 3 times in the last year. Each experience worse than the prior. They now charge $50 for a carry on bag $25 for a checked bag. Tha last time my seat was taken by another passenger and the flight attendant made me sit between two larger passengers. Never again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My family and I got to the airport at 5.05 because we dropped our rental at around and 4.40 got the documentation for that one. Now earlier in the day we were notified via email that our 5.45 had been changed to 5.55. Upon trying to check a car seat and a bag which we per paid for at the same time we checked in online more than 3 hours before we were told that could not happen because the time had been changed back to 5.45. I know about the 45 minute cut off time some airports have but it was still showing a departure time of 5.55pm on the departure board and the best part is it didn't even leave until after 6.10. I was given the option to pay 50 dollars more per person for a flight leaving the next day but the wife and I had to work the next day. I basically had to pay $370 to get home. I will pay more to never fly them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Very unlikely I will use Frontier again. Three of us flew from NYC to Portland OR on Dec 2 2013. I bought the tickets through a 3rd party so I had no idea they charged for both checked and carry on bags. Frontier is the only airline that charges for carry on bags. I believe these are hidden costs that they're passing on to consumers and that this practice is unlawful. Aren't the airlines required to disclose all costs? Also their system of charges is complex as is the various "classes" of customers. I am so annoyed at having to pay an additional $110 for the bags.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
First of all I looked online and they said first baggage was free. Got there had to pay $25. The flight had to make an emergency landing (I understand things happen). Got a hotel voucher to stay the night and the desk clerk said this happens all the time! Never again. It is taking 22 hrs and 3 flights to get from Houston to Albuquerque!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I will never use this airline again. I had no idea that they charge passengers for carry on bags if you use a third party vendor to book your flight. That is not a deal. We observed numerous travelers being advised of this policy at the time of boarding. Also they charge $2 for a small cup of water. Don't use this airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I discovered that they have upped their price for checked baggage and now charge $1.99 for inflight sodas. I then missed my connecting flight due to an error on the counter attendant's part and was charged an additional $50 to change to the next flight. When I calmly explained the situation I was told that I was the only person to miss the flight. She rudely dismissed my further request for a supervisor and demanded payment unless I was "no longer interested in reaching my final destination. My traveling is not yet over and I have already encountered further issues with this airline just in one day. I shudder to think what my return trip will be like. Throughout this ordeal I have encountered the same attitude with each Frontier representative. The customer service is absolutely atrocious the employees do not seem to care and I have found that Frontier does not uphold the typical customer service mantra that "The Customer is Always Right.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We flew Frontier for the first time and it was definitely our last time. I've never heard of an airline that charges for carry on $50 a piece soft drinks $1.99 TV $5.99 and to top it all multiple delays. Customer Service was horrible. One of the check-in agents drove a lady into tears. It was horrible to watch. We also had problems getting seat assigned together but thank you to passengers who were kind enough to switch. Please beware If you book through a third party you will pay for your carry on.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I was traveling with my wife and booked two tickets together. When we tried to check in (exactly 24 hours before the flight) we couldn't select seats and the seats that Frontier assigned to us weren't together - we were sitting in different sections of the airplane not even anywhere close to each other. At the airport we were told that because we don't have "status" we couldn't select seats and they had no obligation to let us sit together. When we protested the Frontier rep told us we should be happy that we have a confirmed seat at all. Apparently Frontier has a new policy to specifically not let passengers who travel together sit together so they can split them up and stick them in middle seats. This lets them charge extra for aisle and window seats or just entirely reserve them for their "elite" passengers. Do not fly Frontier. They don't notify you when you buy your ticket that your party will not sit together. On top of that they nickel-and-dime passengers at every step. You want to choose a seat? You have to pay. You want a soft drink during the flight? That will be $1.99. Want to use the TV screen? $3.99. Oh and if you buy a ticket via another website (instead of Frontier's website) they will charge you $100 for your carry-on bag. I think the next logical step for Frontier is to start charging for using the lavatory for reclining your seat and for using the reading light.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
SAN-DEN. Online booking was horrible - Select outbound flight select return flight change return flight. Frontier then changes your outbound flight to the first one available (the wrong one). Call to change with 48 minute hold time. Called the next day to change (only 28 minutes wait!) Charge to change the flight $150/person. So for the cost of a round trip flight my wife and I were charged to select the correct flight that Frontier erroneously picked for us. Pros: None. Cons: customer service has excessive hold times. Cost to change a flight not commensurate with the cost of the flight/available flights. Frontier refused to admit their website was faulty. Do not fly Frontier. Unless you like "saving" $50/flight and then giving it back for checked bags carry- on bag and a drink of water. Same business model as Spirit - cheap flight but not worth it at all.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This is the first time I've flown Frontier and it will be the last. Want something to drink? $2. They will give you one glass of water for free. Want something to eat? $6. Want to bring a carry-on? $25. Want enough legroom to fit your legs between your seat and the seat in front of you? That will be $5 $15 $25 or $50. Want to watch TV? $6. Want to check in online? Good luck - said I had to check in at the airport. I even went to the airport to check in and at 8.05 the attendant said "sorry closed at 8pm come back tomorrow.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I booked through 3rd party which prohibits you from choosing a seat at all and no confirmation until 24 hours before. Used the mobile application to check in terrible application to say the least and no paperless option like United. First time I've ever had to pay for a carry on and normally fly United or Southwest. Got to the gate and they made everyone put their bags through a pre-check to make sure bags were the right size. What a hassle for those who travel all the time. Frontier used to be a good airline but they're just making it difficult for customers to travel with them. This is the last time I will ever fly with this airline.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I was a loyal Frontier Airlines customer for forty years. Not any more. I will not fly Frontier again if I can avoid it. Just as others have posted here the customer service is terrible they will charge you outrageous fees wherever they can and the flights are not on time. Avoid this airline if you can. I fly other airlines quite frequently for business. American United Delta Southwest and US Airways all do a much better job.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I live in Colorado and have used them for years. They were a great airline until they were bought by Republic a while back. The latest purchase by the owner of Spirit Airlines has gutted the airline I liked so much. Just spent 10 minutes waiting in line to measure my carry on bag. This is my 4th flight with them this year. In the future I will use United Southwest or Delta.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This airline not only charges for checked baggage but also your carry on. If you pay for it prior to going to the gate its $50 a bag and $100 at the gate. I fly 75 flights a year on various airlines this is the first flight I have flown on frontier and will be the last myself or any other employee in my company will fly on Frontier Airlines. I knew their business practice was to underpay their employees which will lead to terrible customer service so I should have been surprised that they would nickle and dime their customers. Avoid.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My flights were excellent however on the Denver to KC flight I was charged $50 for my carry-on bag. This was surprising since I had already paid $25 in Kansas before leaving. In Palm Desert I was not charged at all. It was a little confusing.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I purchased a Frontier ticket from Minneapolis to San Francisco through Orbitz. Frontier changed my departure light from a 10.45am to 6am flight leaving me with a 5 hour layover and necessitated getting up early and driving myself to the airport (paying for parking). Frontier repeatedly admitted they did not inform me of this significant change in flights. I discovered the change during check-in the night before and called Orbitz. Orbitz tried to rebook me but said Frontier refused to adjust my flights. I then paid $25 to carry on my own bag and they demanded I check it instead. When I asked for a plastic bag to put some things in they laughed refused and told me "that's why you have hands. On arrival in Denver I found there was another Frontier flight leaving for SFO in 45 min. I was told there were plenty of open seats and was sent to customer service to change the ticket. The agent again admitted they changed my flight without informing me but demanded I pay $125 to change the ticket. She stated they will only help customers who buy directly through their website. I called Frontier and all they could offer me was to mail a copy of my itinerary to my home (not helpful). I have never encountered such a rude unhelpful company and will never fly Frontier again. Avoid!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I am a frequent flier on various airlines but trying Frontier was the worst mistake I've made. My trip was supposed to start from Portland OR and end in Houston TX. At the airport they had only one check in counter and only 2 representatives and when I arrived 50 minute before departure there was no representative at the check in counter. I tried the kiosk machine to check in but it said I needed to check in at the counter. I contacted the company and was put on hold for almost 2 hr. on and off. When I decided to rebook they told me to pay $100 despite a long wait and their fault. I only had a small carry on and my suit but they told me to check in my small carry on and pay $25. Frontier is a rip off unprofessional customer service and a disgrace to the airline industry. Based on my experience I would never use Frontier again.

F9 846 SEA to DEN Oct 24. F9 182 DEN to OKC. Return F9 185 OKC to DEN F9 841 DEN to SEA. This trip with Frontier Airlines was one of the worst airline experiences. Many of the flight attendants knocked you every time they walked down the aisles. Never an apology. You had to ask for a cup of water. You had to pay for soft drinks. If we can help it we will never fly Frontier again. The only good thing was they were on time but other than that terrible service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
They charge for everything you can get one tiny glass of water and then you have to pay. Inflight entertainment was non existent unless you pay. Also I was unaware of the fact that if you don't check in at least 45 min before your flight that they will bump you. I checked in 44 min before my flight and they refused to let me board. I had to buy a $400 one way ticket from Southwest just to make it to my second leg and then they told me I would have to pay a change fee and fare difference on a flight I already bought. I will never fly Frontier again.

Not a stellar flight from PDX to IAH but the return was truly horrid. We hit traffic got lost and arrived with just 20 minutes to departure but boarding passes and baggage fees receipts in hand because we knew we had to check baggage due to there extreme size and weight policies. There was no one at the counter. It turns out they close the counter 45 minutes before departure. Really? 2.5 hours later around 20 people were waiting to check in. I had to pay $100 to rebook the next day and get a hotel.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Frontier airlines was the 2nd part of our journey to our vacation in Seattle to be honest our first flight was with AA and that was horrible. The crew on AA nothing memorable but Frontier staff were so pleasant. I made sure when booking our flights that the connecting flights were at least 2hrs apart the service on Frontier was great and I will definitely fly with them again but this time we'll upgrade to more leg room. My Husband and I were quite happy and will use this airline again whenever we can.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The customer service on Frontier is lacking. On a recent trip from Chicago to Denver changing planes then Denver to SLC I was frustrated by the lack of compassion by the Frontier staff. My daughter has MS and uses forearm crutches. Because we booked on a third party site the attendant assigned us a seat on the back row of the plane. It was very difficult for my daughter to navigate her way to the back of the plane. From Denver to SLC I asked the gate attendant if my daughter could please get a seat with more leg room closer to the front of the plane. He said they had a seat with more leg room on row 2 however it would cost an additional $15 for each of the three seats we needed. I did not think someone who is disabled should have to pay to be accommodated. While we were waiting to board the plane he announced several times that there was seating with additional leg room available for $5 or $15 depending on your type of ticket. In the end the seats with additional legroom were empty and my daughter had to go to the back row of the plane. Another frustration was we had to pay $85 to check our baggage because our third party ticket did not allow for carry-on luggage. Then there was the tackiness of having to pay for a soft drink and snacks again because we purchased our ticket through a third party. If you're going to treat customers poorly because they booked their ticket through a third party then don't offer tickets through third parties like Jet Blue does. All of their nickel and dime policies make me want to spend my dollars traveling with another airline.

My niece and her new husband were flying last Sunday 10/6 from SLC to Denver and on to Cancun. They arrived at the ticket counter at 6.45 am for a 7.25 flight to Denver. Frontier has a policy that you have to check in at the ticket counter 45 minutes before your flight. No where on the printed ticket did it say that. When they arrived the person at the ticket counter told them they were 5 minutes late so they would not let them check a bag or go through security. There were 6 other people in the same boat. When someone finally came back to the ticket counter 45 minutes later they charged an extra $200 and were told to come back tomorrow. Frontier went out of their way to make sure people didn't get on their flight. We will never fly Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
KC to Denver- my flight was due to leave at 8.30 am. At 9.00 it was announced that the flight was delayed and more announcements would follow. Announcement at 9.30 am the flight will be at 10.30. At 10.30 it was announced that at 1.00 it would be announced if the flight would be cancelled or rescheduled for later that day. Also was told to be thinking about booking a different flight just in case. I went to the ticket counter and asked about a different flight. I was given a flight to Chicago on a different airline and would catch a flight from there to Denver. I went to the gate of the different airline and noticed that I landed in O'Hare but flew out of Midway. I asked the person at the gate about it. He checked it and said to return to the ticket counter. By that time the line was very long and only 1 person was handling that canceled flight. 4 hours later I got to the counter. I had to stay the night and flew to Dallas to catch a flight to Denver from there. I lost 2 days of work extra parking fees.Told they would send me a $75 voucher. They can not pay me to fly Frontier again.

I booked a flight from Org City to Bismarck ND on Sept 13 2013. We were 1 hour 40 min late leaving. Told we would keep same plane to go into Bismarck because the other plane had already left since we were late. When we arrived at Denver we were told that this plane was needed elsewhere and to go to the service desk. Waited in line for 2 hours got to a rep and was told that they did not have another flight to Bismarck until Monday. Told they would fly us to Fargo or Willison the next day and we could rent a car and go to Bismarck. They said we could see if United could get us in the next day for $500 one way but United did not honor them. I booked United I had a boot on my leg since I had fractured my foot and could not drive easily. When I called Frontier Customer services upon returning from my flight I was told that it was the weather. This is the worst airline I have flown.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
August 8 2013 Salt Lake City to Denver Denver to Wilmington return. Frontier Airlines are unfriendly and crowded. They treated us like cattle as we were preparing to board. Do we have to expect rudeness and poor service to get a decent deal? How much can it cost to give us a small glass of orange juice? I wondered if this is just the way airline travel has become but my husband flew on Delta last week and was treated much better and enjoyed his juice. My sister flew on Southwest and even had a bag checked for free. I hope I never have to fly on Frontier again. If you had a spot for zero stars below rating travel experience I would rate zero stars. Frontier is definitely the worst in my experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I will never fly Frontier Airlines again. I booked a ticket from St Louis to Phoenix. I started off in St. Louis and connected through Denver to arrive in Phoenix. While in St. Louis I checked one bag for $25. I then paid an additional $45 to have "More Legroom Seating. and Zone 1 boarding. St. Louis leg was fine. Denver is where the issues take place. As I boarded in Zone 1 I was asked to step aside and stand in a line as the flight attendant needed to speak to me. I was informed that I needed to pay an additional $100 to carry my purse and computer bag onto this plane before I could get on my flight home. I explained to the flight attendants that I would have easily packed my computer into my existing bag that I checked in St. Louis. The flight attendant asked me to dump my purse into my computer bag. It was never mentioned to me in St. Louis that I may have to absorb an additional cost to carry my purse and computer bag onto plane. Beware of the lower priced fares of Frontier. They will charge you in the beginning middle and end! You could fly first class on other airlines.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We flew from Costa Rica to ATL stayed for 7 days then back to SFO. We were told we get one free baggage per person. I confirmed again a day before. At the check-in we had to pay for baggage simply because we had stayed 7 days in ATL so it is not considered international flight. Gate check-in was a joke. She grabbed our printed boarding pass and left us nothing to show our seat number. When we asked her she said 'You did not print 2 copies?". Really? I need to print 2 copies of boarding pass per person? Next the safety announcement at flight 429 on 10/9/2013 sounds like someone is forcing a 15 year old to read an English essay. I highly recommend travellers avoid this airline if you can.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I was given this trip the purpose was to see a concert in Seattle and we were scheduled to arrive at 2 pm. Due to a weather delay our initial flight out of KC was delayed-this is not Frontier's fault. I asked the ticket counter clerk if I needed to be put on a later flight and that I was even willing to purchase a flight on another airline because I had to be in Seattle before 8 pm. The counter clerk told me this delay would cause a 'ripple' effect and that my flight out of Denver would be delayed. The flight out of Denver wasn't delayed and we missed it - and missed out on all of the flights that we could have booked when we were in KC. The only available flight was on a partner airline and arrived to Seattle at 11.15 because it had to go through Phoenix first. On the way back our flight was delayed again - this time it was not weather and we were automatically put on a later flight out of Denver to KC. This meant that we had to start our drive home 3 hours later than originally planned. Somehow we made it to Denver before our original flight left. They wouldn't let us on the plane. The ticket counter told me I had to change my ticket at customer service. Customer service called the ticket counter who told them we could not board the plane - that plane was actually delayed until 7.45. We sat and watched the plane we had purchased tickets for take off. I am giving them low ratings on everything because the seat comfort really doesn't matter when they can't do the basic job of getting you to one place when they say they will.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Left on Friday 10/4 at 6.15 am. First time flyer on Frontier. The ticket desk was horrible. They were so rude to each customer that went up to the ticket desk. It became the joke of the customers in line and than on flight. They acted as if we should be lucky they were there instead of treating us as the customers. Flight attendants were abrupt and never helpful or kind. Awful experience. When I got to my destination I talked with my son and his fiancee who flew the day before. Same thing happened to them. On the way home from Oklahoma City on 10/7 we had an amazing experience. My ratings below are on MPLS only.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I booked the flight via a 3rd party agent depart from Los Angeles to Indianapolis with one carry-on with me for the weekend. Arrived at LAX 20 minutes before departure. Incredibly I avoided the extremely long line and made it through the kiosk quickly but did not realize that they charge $25 carry-on fee for 3rd party booking users. So I got charged $100 at the terminal gate in order to board the flight instead of $25. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to bad weather in their hub in Denver. On the returning flight I arrived at the Frontier counter in Indianapolis 50 minutes before departure. Few people in front of me and a few behind me at the counter with only 2 employees working there with extra slow pace. By the time I reach the counter I been told that their counter has been shut down 45 minutes prior to the departure as well as the Kiosk so there is no way for me to pass TSA without a boarding pass. Their employees were extremely rude with a bad attitude. Both left the counter and shut down everything. All they said was "read the sign and call the 1-800 numbers for help. I called the number but ended up wasting my time. It was $100 to reschedule which I did not accept. In the end I had to purchase a one- way flight from Delta across the lobby for $450.90 in order for me to get back to Los Angeles on Sunday. I have learned some lessons from this incident which I will definitely avoid Frontier Airline in my life.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My family booked its trip on Frontier Airlines through Travelocity. From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip greatly. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket our carry-on bag would be $50 a bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverage except water. Also Frontier Airlines has implemented a new policy that if your boarding pass is not checked in 45 minutes prior to your flight you are not allowed on the plane and are to be rebooked. My family was traveling in a very small airport turned in our rental car and got in line about 50 minutes before the flight. Please note that there is no one in the security line and that it would take about 10 minutes to check in and go through security at this airport. As we are standing in line it is announced that my family along with 15 others will not be allowed on the plane and that we will need to rebook. Because it is a small airport the soonest that Frontier Airlines could get us to our destination was 2.5 days later. My family rented a car drove to another airport 7 hours away paid for new tickets on another airline and got home late that evening. Frontier Airlines is known as an airline for value however booking with them cost my family an additional $1200 and left many of their patrons sitting in the airport stranded. My family along with many extended members will never fly Frontier again and we will make sure to share this experience with as many people as possible. For a customer service industry this is unacceptable.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My wife and I were scheduled to go to Los Angeles to visit our family today. Arrived at Frontier in Bismarck ND an hour before the flight (at 5.30am). Bismarck is a tiny airport and the last time I attempted to get there 2 hours prior to departure no one was there. When we arrived there was a large line at Frontier we waited for 20+ minutes and the lady at the check in stated that Denver (Frontier's hub) had shut down their computers and nobody else would be able to check in. The entire line missed their flight. This was due to the fact they opened the check in line later than they should have. They did not shut down the check in line 45 mins prior to the flight departing because they were trying to catch up from a combination of opening up so late and the incredibly slow service. Not only were there no other flights that day the flight for the next day was full and we were told Saturday was the first option. You would also think this would be at no additional charge you would be wrong to think that as well. They charge you transfer fees third party booking fees difference in the cost of the new ticket etc... So all in all we initially paid $635 for the tickets for the two of us then I paid $679 to put my wife on a Delta flight same day to get her to LA lastly I paid $399 for myself to fly from Dickinson to LA on Friday morning. Frontier gave me a credit for the flight I missed that ended up being worth $33. That doesn't even cover the gas for me to drive back from Bismarck after they caused me to miss my flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I arrived at the gate with 40 minutes until departure. They would not give me a boarding pass! Additionally the rude lady at the counter would not re-book me or put me on standby for another flight. I had to buy new same day tickets with Southwest Airlines. Worst of all because I didn't make my outgoing flight they cancelled my return flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
September 20th - first flight: ABQ to Denver and Flight 2 Denver to Seattle WA. Both flights were delayed. The boarding process was chaotic the boarding by zones served no purpose: we had to wait in line before boarding for at least half hour because passengers struggled to find a spot to store their carryon luggage and struggling to get to their seats causing heavy traffic in the aisle. Attendants seemed to be as confused as us not knowing what to do. I and other passengers had to check in their carryon as all the overhead compartments were full. The check- in agent did not seem to know what to do either. Finally arriving in Denver I headed to the customer service to make sure my carry-on would get to my final destination when I arrived at the counter the three employees who were not helping anyone literally ignored me for some time and then finally a rude employee did not really help me out but sent me to another gate in order to receive service. Second flight was delayed due to refuel process. Paying for entertainment may be justified but paying for non alcoholic beverages is not acceptable. I will definitely not fly with this airline ever again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We booked through Cheapo Air because tickets were cheaper. Well we made up for this at the airport when we checked our bags - $25 for checked bag and $20 for carry on - each. We followed online instructions that said it would be cheaper if we checked in online - so we did. I used my smartphone so could not print a boarding pass. At the completion of this online check in I got the message "online check-in confirmed" - this was witnessed by four other people. At the airport we were told that they had no record of our online check-in so had to pay $50 for checked bag and $25 for our carry-on. Not only that but the 3 of us did not get seats together. We had to approach the ticket counter every stop (4 times) and beg to get our seats changed so we could sit together. On two "legs" of our trip we got the very back row which was stuffy/hot/uncomfortable. If you have booked your flights together they should know that you want to sit together. It's ridiculous! It all comes down to booking with them so you will pay a higher fee for your ticket. One "leg" of our trip the flight was delayed almost one hour with no explanation no notification no apology. We would never fly Frontier again.

9/13/2013 Flights: 231 Nashville to Denver 551 Denver to San Diego 563 Denver to San Diego. Travelers beware. Frontier is no longer what it once was. The ticket gate and customer service agents will - either through incompetence or deliberate false manipulation - frustrate your efforts to smooth out the hiccups caused by their poor schedule management. Flight delays and missed connections are tough luck - takes 12 hours to travel Nashville to San Diego or Chicago to Las Vegas or Austin to Denver. There were 100s of these stories just in one day. The staff denied that connections would be missed (they were) claimed all flights were delayed (they weren't) claimed later flights were full (not true). New militant carry on baggage measurements and charges don't ask for water coffee or a soda unless you have your credit card handy and don't count on them having anything edible on board. If you still decide to travel with this miserable airline the best of luck.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew Frontier approx 2 years ago to Vegas and had a bad experience then. I ignorantly decided to give them another try and flew to San Diego from Nashville with a layover in Denver same route back to Nashville. Not only was the check in staff rude but they messed up our seat assignments. My husband and I who were on our honeymoon checked in 2 hours early and they still managed to mess up our seat arrangements made during the booking process 4 months prior. We ended up having to fly seated separately. Normally we wouldn't be too upset but it was our honeymoon and we did check in with adequate time and booked our flights well in advance. Needless to say I will never use this airline again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I got an early flight from IND to PDX. Flight 613 was 2+ hours late so Frontier rebooked to later flight with 20 minute connection in DEN which was obviously missed. Rebooked again on Alaska Air to SFO then Virgin Air to PDX later that night. After traveling over 12 hours now my bags are in SEA waiting for next flight to PDX so I have to wait hours again! Bags never made flight! Drove to SEA airport to pick them up. Trip home 2 weeks later flight 792 from PDX on time only to find out in DEN that flight is actually delayed but not before running 40 gates to make a connection then running 40 gates back to new gate. All airport displays showing on time at wrong gate! Now sitting at new gate waiting hours again. Flight 1608 finally leaves well after 4.30 with a reserve pilot. Not once did we get to watch TV on any one segment of flight to or from PDX! I will look for other airlines in the future.

We recently flew to and from Denver to Anchorage. Both were night flights. Your cabin and reading lights are awful. Those greyish/white lights make the plane feel like a parking garage and impossible to read by. Yes everyone is transitioning to new types of lighting but there are better lighting options out there.

Flew late July from Vegas to Cancun via Denver. Realised that bags had not been booked apparently you can not do this from UK. I attempted to book online day before leaving Vegas but was not permitted to do this. At airport we paid for bags and asked to have two seats together as my partner is a very nervous flyer. Check-in staff in Denver were lovely and quickly changed our seats. Staff on flights were probably the worst I have flown. Landing announcements were quite funny and instead of reminding passengers to check the overhead compartments for personal belongings we may have stored she said to check for any personal problems we may have left there. Didn't flying used to be fun and exciting and not a chore.

Orlando to Trenton on 8/28 and return 9/3/13. I had one of the best flights I've had!

August 23rd on Flight 572 from Salt Lake City to Denver and on Flight 156 to Des Moines. Return flight on August 27th on Flight 157 from Des Moines to Denver and on Flight 575 to Salt Lake City. I have flown Frontier several times within the past four or five years and have never experienced difficulty. However on this flight I was shocked by the apparent focus of the staff on measuring each person's carry on bags. I saw several customers being sent back to the security desk to pay a $50 fee so that they could carry on a backpack - simply because the backpack did not fit in the measuring tool. Each item individuals had to pay extra for were not overweight nor extremely large. Many of them had backpacks the same size as mine and my backpack fit completely under the seat with no problem. Personally I had to remove my dirty laundry out of the front compartment of my suitcase and transfer it to my checked on bag or I would have had to pay an extra $50 to check on my carry on bag. I believe Frontier has changed their focus from convenience and friendliness to customers and are now focused on making more money. I remember the days when Frontier used to serve complementary drinks and cookies on their flights. Now they charge $2 for a glass of apple juice. Forget the cookies. I will not be using this airline again in the near future.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
DEN-SLC. Not for the business traveler. In a competitive industry - you would think that the airline would want last minute top dollar customers. Finished meeting early have 4.30 flight but not able to take the 1.55 - would not accept me as standby because I am not their rewards customer. Frontier does not fly anywhere that would warrant being a rewards member. Also the entire cabin was laughing because of the flight attendants trance to ensure that everyone was charged for their carry on luggage.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Arrived at 5am to Salt Lake City Airport to find my flight cancelled. Nobody had received any type of alert. After 1 hr 15 mins we were finally addressed by a Frontier Airlines employee who was passing out customer service cards and telling us that we would likely have better results by calling or rebooking. I called finding a 45 minute wait should be expected. Like many customers I was on a tight schedule and decided to book with Southwest Airlines. My Southwest flights were excellent. On the returning trip the first flight was 45 minutes late. We had a similar wait on my connecting flight though we were told repeatedly that there would be a delay of some sort with no explanation or expected time which ended up lasting at least an half hour. I understand that things like this happen but I was happy to land in my final destination.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have traveled with this airline several times in the past year from Utah to Arkansas and have never encountered any problems. The last trip was SLC to LR. Once onboard the plane proceeded to the runway where there was a 45 minute delay. Had to return to the gate told we had a choice to deplane or stay but all connecting flights would be missed in DEN. We boarded again and went to DEN. Staff were amusing and more than willing to offer any information. We all received our hotel accommodation food vouchers and questions were answered quickly and efficiently. The next day was a piece of cake - I flew on to SLC but had problems with losing my bag but had it delivered to my home by 5am the next morning. One thing I didn't understand was the first flight they gave a free beverage but the one from DEN to SLC they wanted to charge for a soda. I feel like a beverage is a very small request for the price of an airline ticket.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I purchased the tickets in February to fly Classic Plus in April and return in May. When I scheduled this round trip ticket the airline stated I would receive free television on both flights along with discounted liquor. On the first flight I did and the service was great. On the flight back I was informed Frontier no longer provided such service and canceled in between the time of my three week business trip. Had it not have been for the TV baggage fees reduced and beverages I would have chosen I different airline. They either need to inform prior to flying as the company knew I had the ticket so I could get a different company or honor their' commitment when I paid for the ticket.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have to say my round trip went without a hitch. Both my departure and return flight were on time with no mechanical problems. The staff were cordial and my seat was the same as any other airline as far as comfort. Yes they do charge for drinks and snacks so if that bothers you buy your own in the airport (it is the same price anyway). I flew from Delaware to Houston and it cost 110 dollars. All other airlines that had direct flights were asking between 350-400 dollars. For that price difference I am willing to shell out 5 dollars for a snack and something to drink. Maybe I had beginners luck but I did save quite a bit of money.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Began flying Frontier out of Williston ND some 3 years ago since they were the only carrier there. I live in Utah so would have expected basic but acceptable service. It seems the longer I continue flying with them the more the problems. Coming home to Utah this last time meant delay after delay (I had some 5 delay announcements sent to my email all after I already knew about it!) causing me to miss my connection at Denver. Almost had to stay overnight. Had been gone from home 3 months! How difficult is it to maintain their equipment? Always an issue for them. Now United and Delta are flying to North Dakota. I have to return with Frontier but won't fly them again. I'd rather fly someone else for $100 more who has their act together without the drama and adventure. Hope they go out of business soon.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
SEA-DEN-ILG (Wilmington DE) one way. A pleasant enough way to travel. Had exit row seats on both legs at $20 per segment on an economy fare this is a steal and well worth it. Yes you do have to pay for drinks but they will give you a cup of water for free if you ask. Why not just charge an extra $2/ticket and give everyone a free drink and a small snack? Flight from DEN delayed 35 minutes due to waiting on a crew member to deadhead. Carry on bag policy enforced at DEN with all bags sized but not SEA - if an airline wants to be strict they should do it at every airport. Some people were bringing bags on the Seattle flight that were clearly over-sized. Wilmington New Castle airport is a great alternative to chaotic PHL but has little to no room for expansion and is crowded with just one flight on the ground.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
LAX-DEN. Bought a ticket after 20 hour flight from Asia since it was a better connection to DEN. Flight delayed 1.5 hours and had to rebook everyone making a connection - 2 agents for 70 people who were totally incompetent could not get anything done. No announcements no information just rude attitude from ground staff. My bags were checked through onto Frontier and I checked with agent to make sure they would get loaded on from the international flight after clearing customs in LAX - she assured me "no problem" and of course on arrival - no bag. Had to wait 36 hours before they were delivered. Never again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My son and I flew from ANC to SFO (and return) via DEN. Satisfied by all flights and crew. However I did notice some changes since my last flight(s) one being the new charges for carryons. The folks at SFO began to implement this new policy and it caused quite a bit of confusion for the passengers and some noted unhappiness at having to pay. Some folks were not pleased with having to have their stuff "sized up" prior to boarding. The new policy of charging for all drinks was not too popular as well. I spoke with a couple of crew members from the various flights we were on and a basic theme appeared "we seem to be heading towards becoming Spirit". Crew members were not too thrilled. I was using my miles on this trip and my last one with my daughter recently. I have been both an Ascent and Summit member for years and have been very pleased with Frontier. I am however somewhat scared about their becoming a bottom feeder. I know change is always around the corner with airlines but the nickel and dimes they are going after is not right in my way of thinking. Keep it up and I will be traveling on Alaska Air year round.

Daughter and I flew down to SLC from ANC changing planes in DEN. No problems going or returning with the small exception of a somewhat rude/uncaring employee at check-in at SLC. The service was fine the planes clean and the flight crews were caring and professional. The crew on the return to ANC was the best I have ever had on any airline professional and funny. I have them on the flight tonight returning to DEN as my son and I fly to SFO. I expect the flight will be a good one!

Seattle to Omaha 7/12/13 Flights: 510 and 432. Omaha to Seattle 7/15/13 Flights: 437 and 843. I have had many complications with this airline. The last 4 flights I was on over this past weekend did not leave on time. The shortest waiting time was 2 hours after original departure and the longest was 24 hours. I have many other opinions on why I am not satisfied with this airline and will not fly with them.

I flew Denver to DC. Outbound was pleasant enough by today's flying standards. The way back was horrible. I had the same weight suitcase as when I left and they wanted to charge 75 dollars for an overweight bag but a second bag is 20 dollars. The person at the counter was very rude. They started charging for beverages on July 1st. If you add up the fees this airline charges you will actually pay less with another more expensive carrier. I'd shop around before booking tickets with Frontier.

Flying from Cancun Mexico to Denver. Spent 45 minutes at gate waiting for maintenance to repair a tray that wouldn't stay latched. Then another 20 minutes for a refuel. Only two updates on status in the entire hour. Missed the connecting flight. After another 4 hours we here the announcement that the Denver to SLC flight was delayed 30 minutes. Given a card with a phone number to file a complaint or a compliment. The wait times were horrendous and after waiting for 15 to 30 minutes with no answer - we tried this several times. Most recently it said high call volume. Not surprised. Hope we never have to fly Frontier airline again. Staff fairly unconcerned.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Not a pleasant return flight from Denver. Flew DEN-STL on the 'economy' fare. Seats were okay but became uncomfortable and pitch was poor. Beverage service was nonexistent since drinks now cost $1.99. That is ridiculous. Flight attendants were rude. The bright side was the TV service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
There is room for improvement. Left from STL at 5.00 on time outbound to DEN. Seats weren't that great. They were thin and uncomfortable. Very little lumbar support. Flight attendants were okay a little aloof but kind. Inflight entertainment was nice but you had to pay for it. No complimentary snacks. Drinks were free but will be $1.99 as of 7/1/13 - ridiculous. Plane was somewhat dirty. Very wide plane however (A320). Seat pitch wasn't bad (I'm 5'9"). Landed ahead of schedule. Overall pleasant first experience but could have been better.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight number 122 from Denver to Dallas on 6/30/13. Flight delayed 3 hours and I never received any notification from the airlines via email text automated call. The customer service desk was very unhelpful in exploring other flight options since the flight now doesn't leave until 11pm. They also were very unhelpful in providing any information. I will never use Frontier again this is a first and a last.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I once again had a great experience flying Frontier-ANC to SLC via DEN. The planes were clean the service was excellent and always on time. We actually landed in ANC 30 minutes early on the return. I have yet to have a less than positive flight ever with them. I have been flying them since they arrived in ANC many years ago. Good choice overall.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flight 929 from Trenton to Detroit yesterday. After hearing a number of bad comments I had very low expectations. They gave me an option of a food box which I liked. Had a small TV in front of my seat. Flight attendants were funny and very nice. Seats were comfortable.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The worst airline I've flown. My flight got changed 7 times. Each time it was a new reason why the flight time was changed. My flight was suppose to take off at 8am. Did not leave until 9pm. The service alone was enough to make me never want to fly with the airline again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I flew from Columbus Ohio to Trenton New Jersey a few weeks ago and had a good experience. I was worried because of the unfavourable reviews but I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Frontier is your typical "no-frills" airline. You do have to pay for a snack but for the price I paid for the flight I wasn't complaining about that. The position of the seats was a tad uncomfortable however my flight was short so it wasn't too much of a problem for me. The staff and flight attendants were helpful and friendly and there were no delays on either flight. In fact the return flight arrived early. In my opinion Frontier is a good value and I would fly with them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
DCA to Jackson Hole Wyoming. Flights to Denver and one to Jackson Hole were on time. New clean Airbus 319s. Friendly and helpful crew. Return flight from Jackson Hole left about 40 minutes late due to weather but they held connecting flight in Denver and arrival in DCA only 10 minutes late. Excellent experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I foolishly accepted a great rate flight forgetting you get what you pay for. Flight delayed from LAX to Denver 3.5 hours upon arriving in Denver the staff were completely useless and preferred bad attitudes over customer service. The amount of misinformation received was nothing short of incredible. Management was useless. I will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Friday 24 May 2013. Frontiers Denver flight was delayed 3 hours which caused me to miss my connection to Reagan Airport so an agent booked me on a United flight from Denver to Dulles. While at the gate I was told I needed to check my luggage because it may not fit in the overhead bin although my carryon luggage met the requirements of a carry on. Once I arrived in Denver I was told by a United agent that they no longer have a contract with Frontier and I was unable to board the plane. So while I did not board the United flight my luggage was on its way to Dulles. I then had to stay over night in Denver and pay for my own hotel. When I finally made it back to Oklahoma I was told my bag was located and it would be sent to my house. Received a call Tuesday 28 May 2013 stating my luggage was still at Dulles with United.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Have no problems with Frontier except their seats. Horrible and I've flown over 60 flights with other airlines. Never had a seat that uncomfortable. The cushioning in the seats is terrible.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
No huge gripe here but it just seems Frontier has joined just about every other airline in the USA in their quest for uncomfortable mediocrity. My tray tables on each of 4 flights were filthy and the seats are very hard. Classic Plus" gives you a few more inches of leg room but little else. They will attempt to charge you for your complimentary beverage upgrade and nobody on that aircraft will get any freebies not even a tiny bag of pretzels. Don't expect a magazine (or even SkyMall) or any free TV/movie viewing. The in-flight credit card sales pitch is the icing on this cake of cheapskate tackiness.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew Frontier last week and had a horrible experience. On the way back they were delayed 1 hour due to weather even though looking at a radar of the entire US there were no weather issues anywhere. Another staff member said it was an air traffic control delay where another said it was a TSA issue. They wouldn't hold our connecting flight for 5 minutes and we missed our flight. We had to wait 5 hours. Finally they lost our luggage and I still don't have it back. I have yet to receive a phone call. It has now been 4 days since the flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
The planes were clean and the staff very nice. What I didn't like was they push for you to sign up for a Frontier Airlines Mastercard. They should be pushing you to get one of their cards in the Concourse / Gate Area that seems more comfortable to me than having the Flight Attendants doing it. The live TV service has gone up in price didn't like that - they should have left the price alone.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
New Orleans to Denver: heavy rain flight delayed. Staff tell us we won't make our connection so should go back pay for our own hotel and try again tomorrow. We insist that we go to Denver now they reluctantly concede but take us off the connection flight giving us tickets for next day. We should have insisted that we get the boarding passes for the connection and then change those if we can't make it. Before departing we call our travel agency who tell us that there is a United flight with seats departing the same day and Frontier was responsible for placing us on that. Onboard: staff start asking me where I'm going then essentially grab my carry-on bag out of my hand to check it in. I explain that due to my short connection my bag will almost certainly not make it and ask to check for a space. They say no. I was shocked by their abruptness and rudeness. In Denver: our connection is delayed and is boarding as we leave the plane. They won't let us on. After a phone call staff at the gate decide to let us on. In Seattle: naturally they didn't get my bag there on time. I had to get it myself the next day.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I've got no problem with the on-the-ground staff of Frontier. Most are hardworking nice folks but I may never fly Frontier ever again due to their poor management making decisions. Thr overhead compartments wouldn't be extremely full if they didn't start charging to put bags under the plane years ago. Now they will charge us to have a carry-on bag for our own good of course. Also promo codes that their site say they are good for a certain time they don't last until the time they say they are usable. That's just dishonest. All things considered it's enough to push me away from ever wanting to fly them again. I'm happy to take my business elsewhere especially when other companies fares are identical. Why fly a dishonest airline that talks down to their customers?

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I will never fly frontier again Trenton Airport customer service is horrible and they don't have someone to take your baggage down to security for you when you have an infant a child to tend to and I also had my 90 year old grandmother with me who was in a wheelchair. When it was time to board the airplane they didn't have the walk way connected to the plane. They had to push my grandmother up on the ramp. We got to the door of the airplane they had my grandmother sitting in the middle seat they had to change her seat 3 or 4 times. We just wanted to go to Orlando FL with my children but I will go to the Philadelphia Airport and get on United to make our next trip.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
TTN-TPA round-trip. Booked 1 week in advance and paid under $200 round-trip whereas US Airways and Southwest's fares were twice as much. Overall good value for money. In addition to the savings on airfare I was able to park for free at the Trenton airport. Since the flights were full we were given the opportunity to gate check our carry-ons and pick them up at baggage claim. This came in handy flying from TTN to TPA since I wouldn't have to carry my garment bag through the Tampa airport. But I would advise don't gate check carry-ons when flying into a small airport like Trenton. I had to wait in a cramped baggage claim for probably 30 minutes for my bag no thanks to the ground crew taking their sweet time. As much as I don't like the Philadelphia airport at least bags are going around the carousel by the time I get to baggage claim. Also although Frontier has DirecTV on the seat backs if you get the lowest fare you have to pay extra for it. And if you're thinking about purchasing snacks you better have a credit or debit card because they don't accept cash.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We had purchased 2 return tickets MDT (Harrisburg) to MCO (Orlando). Did online check-in 24 hr prior to takeoff at which time we purchased and paid for Frontier's Stretch seating. Selected a middle for myself and window for son who is over 6 ft tall. They called our name and boarded us first before all other passengers. My extra charge stretch seat became awful when Frontier determined the seat (aisle) next to me was the only place that would accommodate a "double wide" passenger. Their term not mine. They wheeled the passenger in and we spent 2 hours skin to skin with me unable to move. There would have been absolutely no way to access the screen controls. We also were unable to get out for bathroom use or for any other reason. I understand we all have different body types and sizes but it's unfair for me to pay extra for more room yet getting the worst possible seat on the plane. I will never pay for "stretch" seating on Frontier I won't be flying with them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This is the worst airline ever. Only use them if you are desperate and if you are plan to have a terrible experience. I have taken hundreds of flights good and bad and Frontier is one I will never take again. I've only used them three times but each time they have been delayed. I mean 20 minute delay fine but each flight has been delayed over an hour and usually close to two. One was weather related and okay of course that happens but other times there has been no excuse. And when I have talked to them on the phone they give no information for why its delayed! I've only taken this airline because it flies into an airport right by my parents so its easier when I go to visit them but Id much rather fly to Newark or JFK and take a train to my family! Lesson finally learned. But really Frontier get your stuff together.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Our flight was changed to us air. Me and my wife 2 children 1 being an infant had seating together and select seating. We were moved to another flight seated apart when there was an entire row above us for same price open. We were denied be able to have those seats and sit together. I had asked for a reason and none was given. I asked to speak to the air manager. What kind of business downgrades their customers to a worse seating arrangement when its the companies problem they had to move our flight? We also had to pay the baggage fee difference. Customer service was horrible I will have to say I would never book a flight with Frontier Airlines again and would gladly pay more to another airline that would accommodate their customers.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
This airline could not provide a flight-crew for a flight from Kansas City to Boston so the flight was cancelled. We were then transferred to a flight to LaGuardia. We got to LaGuardia and had to switch terminals to the flight which was a US Airways flight with the rest of the people from our original flight. We got to the terminal and the flight had left and all other services to Boston had finished. We were told to go the baggage claim and take a bus to a hotel. Our bags had made it on the US Airways flight. We could not find the bus due to terrible communication skills between the passengers and the staff. However one very nice flight attendant on the flight to New York stepped outside the job description and helped passengers personally.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We were pleased with our flight from Chicago to Denver and Denver to Las Vegas. I wish they had told us ahead of time that the seats in front of the emergency door don't recline. Our son has to have a reclining seat and we were not told about this prior to purchasing our tickets.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
LaGuardia-Denver-Phoenix. Incoming plane to LGA was delayed for mechanical reasons. Plane to DEN therefore left the gate 2 hours late. Sat on the Tarmac another hour and a half because of a fast moving storm. We all missed our flights out of DEN. Frontier denied responsibility for the delay secondary to the weather. Clearly if the incoming plane to LGA had been on time we would have left ahead of the storm and made it to our destination. I waited in line in Denver for an hour and a half to speak with the customer service agent who gave me incorrect information. I was finally booked on a flight leaving early the next morning to San Diego way out of my way with a transfer to PHX. Spent a sleepless night in Denver airport and got home 24 hours after the start of my journey.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Trenton to Orlando. I flew with my husband and my 2 young boys. Check in took a little while because there was only 2 girls at the counter. Security check did not take long but was thorough. The plane was on the smaller side but not any smaller than Spirit Airlines planes. The seats are a little smaller than your Continental airline seats. If you are a larger person and don't like tight spaces don't fly Frontier or Spirit airlines. Flight out was on time some turbulence mostly smooth. Flight back was about an hour behind but made up some time in the air. The attendants were nice. Cleanliness as average. I found some trash in the pocket seat in front of me. We had no problems with Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Denver to Spokane (March '13). We were put in the back seats that don't recline at all. The space to the seat in front of us was so close to us that ii even blocked our reading light. The stewardesses were sympathetic but apparently couldn't offer us the empty 'stretch' seats unless we paid an extra 25 dollars. The stewardess said the 'stretch seats' had actually created the lack of leg room between other seats. Frontier should not have back seats that are so cramped and certainly shouldn't be charging full price for them. While giving the usual free beverages we found it very cheap and tacky that Frontier doesn't even give a bag of pretzels. To have to pay for even music channels is very poor for customer relations.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Booked a flight from MSP to DEN saved maybe 20 bucks on the flight. Started to taxi down the runway there was a problem where they told us they need to run tests that will take 45 minutes. 2 hours later they removed us from the plane. 3 more hours of unknown and no communication. Finally they routed a plane from another location and I touched down at 1.15 (2.15 local). Then it came time to come home my 3pm flight turned into the same thing this time we never boarded though. I waited in the DEN airport for mechanical issues until we were boarded at 8.15. I spent over 10 hours in one weekend waiting for Frontier Airlines. I have $300 in useless vouchers from one weekend - you could not pay me to fly with them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I have flown Frontier twice in the last month. Both times the flight was delayed until it was later cancelled. The agents were very difficult to work with and did not provide reasonable accommodations. On the first flight I had to purchase a Delta flight or wait 2 to 3 days to get to my destination with no weather issues at the origin or destination airport. Today a Thursday I was turned away in Minneapolis and told they could not get me to a wedding in San Diego by Saturday. Given no alternatives in either case. Neither was acceptable and I will not fly this carrier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My outbound flights were both on time and I really have no complaints other than both planes smelt. My return was delayed and after asking to be rebooked the gate agent said everyone was going to make connecting flight. She was incredibly rude and did not want to help anyone. After missing my flight which I knew was going to happen it took over an hour to rebook me and half my flight missed connections. Frontier could not get me into OMA within the next 24 hours so I drove. I would never recommend flying Frontier.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Have flown Frontier 3 times now each time seems to be a little worse. Just got back from a Florida trip via Harrisburg PA. Going down there was a problem with a seat late leaving. Coming back same problem sat onboard for one hour waiting for a seat to be fixed. My tickets were bought 3 months in advance and they were high in price one month before the flight they were 1/2 the price. So buying early isn't always the best way to go. Wanted to buy a snack they were out so made another choice they were out - this was the first flight of the day. Cheaper isn't always better.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I checked in online the night before but did not have my boarding pass. I also was not checking any bags. I made it to the ticketing/baggage check counter right at 45 minutes before the flight time. I was told that I could not check in. Rather than wait in line I remembered seeing signs that you could get through security using your smart phone. I verified this with the agent before I went through security. Unfortunately I only had the pdf document downloaded to my phone and that was not sufficient. I needed to have the little speciality square that these smart phones can read. I had to return to ticketing to change my flight because I was definitely going to miss the flight. Then I had to fly standby and hope I could get on a later flight. So my lack of knowledge regarding the scanning/smart phone procedures did me in but it all started when the first agent gave me bad information. The agent that finally provided me with a boarding pass verified that the 1st agent should have been able to issue the boarding pass - it was only checking in at that point that required her. In hindsight I should have argued with the 1st agent or requested that he check with someone more experienced (or who was listening to me).

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We traveled recently on a trip that was American Airlines to our destination but Frontier on our return. I have no complaints about the flight itself. We were delayed due to necessary de-icing but the captain and flight attendants kept us informed and we were grateful to arrive at our final destination only a couple hours late. My only complaint would be that they don't know how to seat people we were in a group of 4 (2 couples) and they seated us all over the plane in middle seats between people who were traveling alone. We weren't allowed to pick our seats or change them so that even couples could sit together. I just feel that if you book your trip early enough as we did there should be no excuse for such a terrible job of seating us.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Booked our trip in Sep and paid for preferred seating. When we checked in at the ticket counter we were told that our seats that we prepaid for we're reserved for other customers and we were given seats further back. On the flight the seats we had paid for sat empty. While onboard I turned on my light to get a drink and the attendant said I would have to wait while she and another attendant stood in the front and had their drinks and snacks an hour later she came by and wanted to know if we wanted anything. Would not waste my money on such poor service.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
All flights departed on time and either landed early or on time. The second flight DEN to IND was the best of all - one flight attendant knew my son loved the Frontier animals so he looked for some cards with the animals listed. He gave the whole family free headphones to watch TV for the rest of the flight. If the need arises to travel to DEN again I will definitely choose Frontier Airlines.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Return round-trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Trenton-Mercer NJ airport was a disaster. We had a return flight for Monday 2/10/13 at 6.40pm - they delayed the flight to 8.50pm then to 11.30pm then at 12.30am cancelled flight. They advised that they could book us on a flight back Friday - 5 days later! The flight Wednesday was fully booked. We asked that that they put us on another airline on Tuesday but they would only refund our fare. It ended up costing us double since we had to get one way tickets at the last minute on another airline. We had to fly into Newark airport and then arrange transportation back to our car in Trenton. We will never fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Kansas City-Denver-Colorado Springs return 1-30-13 return 2-4-13. No problems on first leg but flight from Den to COS was late nearly 2 hours as originating flight from Minot ND was delayed due to mechanical. Return flight COS flight pushed back and stayed on tarmac for 30 minutes as one engine could not be started. Eventually corrected and just barely made connecting flight to MCI. Again no problems on the Denver to Kansas City flight.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My daughter and I flew from Newport News to Denver and on to LAX on Jan 25 2013. Although both flights were enjoyable the first leg was particularly well managed by the flight crew. One of the passengers a lady with a small child 15 months old was doing an admirable job of keeping the little girl happy. On a 4.5 hour flight this is a nearly impossible task. After serving drinks an FA spent a good deal of time occupying the little ones time. As a parent myself and remembering what traveling with little ones could be like I am sure the mother of this child was very appreciative.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We paid for classic plus going from KC to Denver and stretch on the return. You get 36" of legroom but the seats were flat and uncomfortable at least for my back! On both flights we took off around 40 mins late with no apology or explanation. The flight attendants looked tired and were unfriendly. The check in staff were just as bad. Frontier needs to improve its customer service. A shame as they are good value.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Unacceptable service for our charter 12/23/12 to Punta Cana from Chicago and again back on 12/30-31/12. In brief 3 flights from O'Hare on 12/23 all delayed several hrs flight to Montego Bay was cancelled all because none of the crews were complete. They knew this was going to happen and never notified any of us. Offered no info or help. Coming back we waited 2 hrs at Punta Cana airport then flight cancelled.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
December 2012 round trip between Madison WI and Washington DC. The planes were up-to-date and the seats very comfortable. The service was superb at check-in gate and through the flight. Crew were organized and friendly. A nice touch was the raising of the cabin lights during beverage service. Many food items were available for sale. We didn't buy any but liked that there were options. Flights were comfortable and calm.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We flew on Christmas Day from Madison to DCA (Reagan). It left 2 hours late. Return flight on 12/30/2012 left 4 hours late. Seemed to be a problem in gathering crew for the flight. Unprofessional appearance and very casual attitude. Here in Wisconsin we like having the option for a non-stop from Madison to Washington DC but the service is terrible. Hope I can find another way.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew round trip from Ft Myers to Denver 12/12. Flight out was no problem. Return flight - flight listed as on time on the screens but we boarded over 30 minutes late. No announcement made that explained when we would be boarding the reason for the delay or any kind of apology or assurance. Asked to check our carryon bags at the gate which was not a problem except that my companion was not given the receipt from her bag check. The agent said she would be right back with the tag never returned and when my friend asked the attendant she was sent to the front of the plane and told by the gate agent that there was no way they could find the receipt. During the flight we experienced strong turbulence no acknowledgement was made by the flight attendants or by the pilot over the intercom system. We don't plan to fly Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We left Seattle late but the gate and flight crew told us that the connection in Denver for my flight to Orlando would wait for us. Flight was pleasant and the air crew good. However the plane did not wait and no flights available until tomorrow. To add insult to injury they lost my bag.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Delayed over 2 hours. None of it related to weather issues. It was because we were short a stewardess for our flight and we had to wait for them to arrive from another city. My first and last time my children and I fly Frontier Airlines. Completely unacceptable.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Virginia to California in economy. They checked in all of the classic plus customers before checking in a single Economy customer. I and many others nearly missed our flights because of this. Once I actually got to my plane to make the 5 hour trip I realized once again because I was an economy passenger I then had to pay for movies! There's was no entertainment either direction which made for an even worse experience. On my way back to Virginia I had a lay over in Denver and realized my original flight Id bought from Colorado to Virginia was no longer in service and I had a 6 hour layover. I was never notified of the cancellation and this just confirmed that I will never fly with them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Had an emergency flight back to Ohio. I left Albuquerque in bad weather but was reassured by Albuquerque Frontier staff that I would be able to catch the next flight back to Ohio. Frontier airlines in Denver knew that we would not be able to make the connection and told me that the Albuquerque Frontier station frequently tells customers that they will be able to make connections that are not possible in an effort to get them out of Albuquerque to be someone else's problem. I had the 'pleasure' of sleeping in the Denver airport overnight because staff in Denver said that they were not liable for putting me up in a hotel.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My 2 older children had a flight from DIA to Grand Rapids and they sat in the airport for 6 hours before Frontier cancelled the flight. The were rebooked for the following morning. We arrived at 6 am flight just to be informed that flight was cancelled. We received no compensation or upgrades for the inconvenience. They rebooked us for what was our original 2 hour flight tomorrow to fly 4 hours to Houston 3 hour layover and then another 4 hours to Detroit - not their airport of origin. I have 4 children returning 12/28 on Frontier what are the chances they will all make it?

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew Frontier on a whim since it was our honeymoon and they offered a non-stop flight. The flight to our destination was uneventful even pleasant. On the return the ticket staff were incredibly rude. We paid additional for the both of us to sit together in the middle of the aircraft however when we arrived we were seated at opposite ends of the plane. After spending an hour trying to get the issue resolved we had to resign ourselves to the back of the plane negating the extra money we spent for preferred seating.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Awful experience ticket agent was very rude. Our flight had been moved to another day without notifying us the ticket agent said it was not his problem and we needed to contact the other airlines to find a flight to Orlando. He finally did find us a flight on American and it was already boarding so we had to run to catch the plane our option to fly home was stay an extra day in Orlando which we could not do or fly from Orlando to Denver to Madison WI which we had to do. Fly another airline.

We flew to Puna Canta. Attendants were friendly and attentive we were celebrating our 50th anniversary and enjoyed the trip there and back. Impressed with the cleanliness of the bathrooms and the room in them. Hope to fly them again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Depending on which rules they choose to enforce you can never be assured that you will be granted access to their boarding process. I am a young woman with a certified disability. I live 4 hours from Oklahoma airport and after waiting on the check in line presented my travel documents 4 minutes late according to their boarding rules. I was not allowed to check in for my scheduled flight. I was re-routed to an intermediary city where I had to spend the night before catching a flight to my final destination. Do not fly this airline especially if you have children or special needs!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Very disappointed with Frontier Airlines service on our trip out to visit family for Thanksgiving. They did not make traveling with two young children easy (1 toddler 1 infant). We selected seats together at the airport we could not sit together because we didn't pay the extra $5 fee for the opportunity to select seats. So we pay the upgrade for the 1st leg of our flight but they keep us in separate rows and seats for the second leg. With a 2.5 year old and an 8 month old we're all going to sit in separate seats? I highly dissuade any families from using Frontier. We flew home on United and had no problems whatsoever sitting together.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I had a combined round-trip ticket flying American from Tulsa to Denver then Frontier to Minneapolis; coming back was the reverse Frontier out of Minneapolis then American to Tulsa. It was ticketed through American. Flying to Minneapolis was fine because I didn't really have to interact with checking in at Frontier. However the return was horrible. I arrived at the airport later than I planned but still had a half hour before takeoff when I tried to check in at the Frontier counter. The attendant wouldn't let me check in because he said I wouldn't make it in time. I had a half hour but he wouldn't even let me try. I asked if there was anything he could do and he said no. Other airlines have been known to call the gate tell them the passenger was on the way and ask them to hold the plane. But not Frontier. He was also unwilling to help me get on a later flight because "it's ticketed through American let them help you". I went to the American desk. They were very friendly and tried to help. However it would cost $150 to change my ticket and fly from Minneapolis with them so they suggested I go back to the Frontier desk and ask them to sign my ticket over to American. The attendant would not help me and rudely said it was my fault because I was late. But he finally said they could put me on standby on the next plane which would leave 4 hours later but said it was full so my chances weren't good. I went back to American and paid my $150. From now on I will pay a little more to deal with a friendly helpful person.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
We were supposed to leave on a 1.12 flight to Denver and our plane had started boarding when an announcement was made that there may be an aircraft change. There was - the plane headed to Harrisburg directly across from our gate started deboarding and got on our plane and took off. Here we sit 3 hours after we were supposed to leave with another 5 hour wait before we can leave. What I don't understand is why we had to sacrifice our plane and time for the folks going to Harrisburg. It's a huge inconvenience. We will never fly with Frontier again.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew Frontier 3 times this week (Denver to Phoenix 11/16 Phoenix to Denver 11/17 and Denver to Dallas 11/24). This was the first time I had used this carrier. Not a single flight left on time average delay on each flight was 2-3 hours (always blamed on mechanical delays). I understand being delayed once in a while but 3 out of 3? Also staff (from the baggage checker to flight attendants) were grouchy and the customer service reps essentially told me too bad (never once apologized for the inconvenience). I fly a fair amount (20+ times per year) and have been on almost all major US carriers this one takes the cake as the worst!

I flew from Austin TX to Portland OR changing both ways in Denver CO. On all 4 planes the aisles were so narrow that it was difficult to even enter the plane. The planes seem to have been changed from 5-seat rows to 6-seat rows and additional rows added. This meant that the seats were so close together that the experience was like being a sardine in a can. When the stewards were passing out drinks on one flight they parked the cart by my row and served the whole plane from there. When the passenger in front of me lowered their seat they were in my lap. Never again will I fly Frontier.

Will never fly Frontier again. Was on 4 different flights and were only greeted twice by flight attendants. Made arrangements in April for a November trip and had no choice of seats at reservation time only to be told at check in you will get your seat at the gate. Gate staff were rude. We had a first time flyer with us and nicely asked if she could be seated with one of us so she wasn't alone. Only to be told we were lucky to be on this flight. The 4 of us were separated on all the flights we were on. When you're flying for over 3 hours it would be nice to sit with someone you know.

Denver to Dayton to visit family in Ohio. Have flown Frontier many times before staff have always been courteous and apart from when I've flown home in the winter the flights have been on time. I have a direct flight so don't know about connecting flights.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew from Orange County to Detroit with a stop in Denver. Boarding in Orange County was fine was seated at the very back of the plane which I hate but that is the luck of the draw. Flight started with flight attendant saying the TV system was broken for the flight . Beverage cart came around giving us a shot glass of Pop. Landed in Denver 15 minutes late. Only had 15 minutes to catch my next flight which was 7 minute away from gate to gate. Being at the very back of the plane killed another 5 minutes. We rushed (with no assistance from the airlines) to our connecting flight and was made to feel like it was our fault when arriving at the next plane for holding up the flight. Never even looked at our boarding passes just ordered us on the plane. Why would they put us at the very back of the plane on the first flight when we had a tight connection like that. I booked over a month in advance. Second flight to the very back of the plane again. Air did not work in our seats and when asked attendant about it she brushed it off in addition the seats do not go back when you are in the last row which made it tight. Then the TV came on and was disappointed we had the pay $5.99 if we wanted to watch it. Overall very uncomfortable flight with rude attendants. I flew AA a week earlier and had a great experience.

Even though I booked round trip tickets with Frontier I never once got on an actual plane the departing flight was cancelled altogether and the return flight was delayed so long that the connection would have been impossible to make. Making matters worse I was flying to my sister's wedding in California from Michigan and could not afford to wait for following day much less trust that it would go. So they rebooked myself and my daughter on a flight from Detroit to Washington/Dulles then after hurrying to the connecting gate we flew clear across the continental US something like 5 straight hours. Not much fun to say the least. Coming home we were forced to layover an extra day so my 5 day trip turned into a six day trip with three days spent entirely at airports. As far as this review goes I can't give an opinion because I never got on their plane! My sister booked my niece on the same flight so the same thing happened to her except they rebooked her on US Airways and she flew from DTW to Phoenix but never made her connection to California.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I will never fly Frontier again. The staff were rude and made us very uncomfortable. They were not helpful at the baggage check in this was in PHX on the morning of Sep 12th. On our connecting flight going to Nashville one of the flight attendants snapped at me when I asked where the restroom was. Their lack of customer service made my experience lousy. On our way back we took United Airlines. Totally different.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Overall I was very satisfied. Online booking was smooth I had no problems boarding and the flight left and arrived on time in Denver. I flew from Salt Lake to Little Rock to visit family and I might have to push my return date out so I am curious as to how smooth that will go. The drinks on flight were a small cup with ice the food was expensive and so were alcoholic drinks so I refrained from those. I would recommend this flight and would also add that more leg room would be nice.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My flight to Colorado Springs with connection at Denver was delayed which in turn made me miss my connection flight. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to fly the next day at 8 am. We were told that they were holding flights when in fact my connection flight left 7 minutes earlier than suppose to. This is the last time I fly Frontier. I was told by another flyer that this happens way to frequent and he was driving from Denver to Colorado Springs. This was my first time flying alone to this airport. They have made this a bad experience. This airline needs to get their act together.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I was travelling with my 4 year old. My flight to Portland with connection at Denver was delayed 3 hours. First they said it was due to weather but then they said it was a mechanical problem with the flight. I was to miss my connection at Denver. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to either stay back at Denver or fly the next day at 9 am. The next day they were so fuzzy about my baggage being overweight by 1 pound - the same bag they checked in yesterday but had to get back due to flight delay. They made me remove stuff from my bag and finally they lost my bag. Staff at Portland responsible for baggage claim was impossible. I am still waiting for my baggage to arrive and I am hoping I would get it back.

Portland-Denver-Jackson Hole in A320/A319. Smooth online booking online check-in and bag drop Flights on time and the service efficient. Seats in the cheapest part of the plane offered as much legroom as premium airlines' Economy. A non-alcoholic drink was served on each leg (no free snack). The hub at Denver was quite crowded and busy. Luggage took a long time to be unloaded at Jackson Hole. Overall a good experience.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements. After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent. I feel that it is ridiculous that I have to go on Frontier's website and show it to Frontier agents in order for anything to happen.

I flew to Portland OR from NYC via Denver. Outbound trip was great. On the way back on DEN-LGA leg of the journey the pilot made an emergency landing in Indianapolis. The next 16 hours is a case study in trying to buy off customers for poor quality service. Instead of having enough people on the ground to service the accommodation of 150+ passengers the airline effectively paid the passengers to struggle through the limited resources available on the ground in Indianapolis to assist them. I ended up sleeping the night in a cold airport lounge and slogged through multiple re-scheduling of the continuation of my trip from Indianapolis to NYC. I tore up the $400 airline voucher I got for the inconvenience.

We (5 people) travelled from GEG to DEN on 08/03/12. I was travelling with my disabled daughter in a wheelchair. During reservation I had already informed them that my daughter is in a wheelchair and cannot walk. We checked in online and after going through security arrived at gate C32. After the gate agent arrived I reminded her that we need an aisle chair. She said that as per 'normal' Frontier procedure when travelling with a wheelchair passenger I should have checked in at the counter and not online. I never saw this instruction on their website. She also mentioned that they can deny us boarding for not doing that. I did complain about this to the airline and they rewarded me the with a whopping $25 certificate per passenger that can only be used for 'future' travel on this customer un-friendly airline. Frontier provides only complementary beverage no food.

I just returned from a trip with Frontier Airlines and I hope it is the last time I need to travel with them. Unlike other reviewers we were not offered a cookie with our drink. We had a delay of 6 hours which was not Frontier's fault however people were tired. A nice gesture would have been to offer flyers a whole can of Pepsi not just the usual half ice and half drink that all airlines offer after the wait was over. Instead we had one steward who was not rude but obviously tired. Frontier like most airlines does charge. Their term for this is "excess baggage" when you check it in. It's not excess it's your luggage bag. However what I was amazed about was Frontier staff kept announcing before the flight that the flight was full and you should check your roll-on baggage before boarding. In both cases where I saw this done many people did check their roll ons and there was lots of space in the overhead bins. This was a DC to Denver to Billings MT round trip.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
All in all pretty good experience. Flights were on time check in was smooth as were the flights. Flight attendants were great. The only cons were the planes were small and cramped especially on the Denver to Spokane leg. We paid extra for Classic Plus and felt like our knees were under our chins undoubtedly due to the aircraft type and the fact that three seats were squeezed into an area probably meant for two. We were shoulder to shoulder in the three row seating and both of us are small and thin. I imagine it would be even more miserable for people who are normal sized or a little overweight. It wasn't as bad on our return flight but it wasn't full and we had an empty seat in our row. The saving grace for Frontier at least as far as we were concerned was the courtesy of the staff at the airports and the personable flight attendants.

SEA-DEN-OKC-DEN-OKC. Overall service was really good. Had a huge delay from DEN-OKC due to crew scheduling issues but other 3 legs were on time. Food selection was adequate for these flight duration's but the aircraft interiors need to be refreshed. With that said seats on 3 of the 4 legs were uncomfortable due to high wear and tear. IFE was not free like Virgin America or JetBlue. It's terrible how the US airlines are charging for everything now it's getting ridiculous.

Flight: In last month. Just returned last night to Anchorage. I used my Early Returns miles and took my family to ATL via DEN. All aspects of our trip were great on Frontier. We did takeoff 40 minutes late from DEN on our return but somehow managed to arrive 20 min's early into Anchorage. The planes were fine the service excellent and staff attitudes were quite positive. No problems and no complaints! I will fly them again soon!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew from La Guardia to Denver. Flight took off 40 minutes late but otherwise a pretty pleasant experience. Newish Airbus with comfortable leather seats decent legroom and direct TV screens in seatbacks. Crew was OK but unremarkable. I'd fly them again and consider them one of the better options in my market.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
I purchased a round trip Minneapolis to Santa Barbara 4 months in advance. I did not specifically look at the aisle seating I was assigned and 3 out of 4 legs I was seated just in front of the exit row and could not recline my seat (Row 10). 3 out of 4 legs were on an Embraer 190 which is a nice plane but no storage. Last leg on Airbus 320 had the most cramped seating I've experienced. They gate checked my bag half way through boarding letting the last 20 folks bring on their bags. When I asked the flight attendant what was going on she said they "pre-emptively" gate check bags when they have few checked bags for a full flight. Bottom line is that Frontier is not customer friendly. They will survive on price alone and they won't get my business unless I'm desperate.

LIR (Costa Rica)-DEN-LAX. Sat on the runway in CR for a 1.5 hours due to "paperwork issues". They wouldn't let us on our connecting flight (we made it 30 mins before departure) stating our luggage wouldn't make it on. They rebooked us to a United flight who charged us for luggage. Not a pleasant experience - will never fly them again.

Flew round trip from Minneapolis to Las Vegas via Denver. Staff very friendly and the overall experience was fantastic. I recommend upgrading to Classic Plus - it is well worth the extra money!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
Flew roundtrip from Denver to San Diego return to Denver. Staff were friendly helping us with checking baggage. Boarding was easy boarded early due to no carry on bags. Flight staff friendly and efficient trying to get everyone's carry on bags stored. Seats were comfortable and had plenty of room. The TV was good had to pay for it but it was affordable. All of our bags made it to our destination. The return trip to Denver was just as pleasant the plane not very full so attendants let us change seats.

### Frontier Airlines customer review
ATL-DEN. Arrived on time however the boarding ramp would not work so had to wait 30 min for technicians to fix it before we could exit the plane. On the return DEN-ATL we sat on the runway for an hour because the plane had a malfunction. Finally unloaded off the plane just to be told to wait for another to arrive in 30 min. We arrive in ATL airport to find out the shuttles have been shut down for the night and that we would have to take buses to the baggage claim. Total delay 3 hours!

### Frontier Airlines customer review
My flight from DCA-MKE was delayed 1.5 hrs. In MKE my flight to DFW was cancelled due to the fact that they did not have any staff available. There were only 10 seats available on flights going to DFW for the next 2 days. Overall the worst flying experience I have had. My first and last time using this carrier.
